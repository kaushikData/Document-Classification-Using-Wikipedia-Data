'''Abaúj-Torna''' ({{lang-sk|Abov-Turňa}}, {{lang-de|Abaujwar-Tornau}}, {{lang-la|comitatus Abaujvar-Tornensis}}) was an administrative county ([[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]) of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Its capital was Kassa (present-day [[Košice]]). Its territory is now in eastern [[Slovakia]] and north-eastern [[Hungary]].

==Geography==
Around 1910, Abaúj-Torna county shared borders with the counties [[Gömör-Kishont]], [[Szepes (county)|Szepes]], [[Sáros county|Sáros]], [[Zemplén (county)|Zemplén]], and [[Borsod]]. The rivers [[Hornád|Hernád]] and [[Bodva|Bódva]] flowed through the county. Its area was 3317&amp;nbsp;km² around 1910.

==History==
The county Abaúj-Torna was a combination of the counties [[Abaúj]] and [[Torna County|Torna]]. It existed in three periods in the 18th, 19th and 20th century: first from 1785 until 1790, again from 1848 until 1859, and finally from 1882 until the end of [[World War I]].

In the aftermath of World War I, the northern part of Abaúj-Torna county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia (as ''Abovskoturnianska župa''), as recognized by the concerned states in the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]. It continued to exist as an administrative unit until 1922. The southern half stayed in Hungary as the county Abaúj-Torna, with capital [[Szikszó]].

Following the provisions of the [[First Vienna Award]], most of the Czechoslovak part was returned to Hungary in November 1938. It was added to the county Abaúj-Torna, with capital [[Košice|Kassa (present-day Košice)]]. After [[World War II]], the Trianon border was restored, and the Hungarian county Abaúj-Torna merged with the county [[Borsod]] and the Hungarian part of [[Zemplén (county)|Zemplén]] to form the present [[Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén]] county. Since 1993, when [[Czechoslovakia]] was split, the northern part of Abaúj-Torna is part of Slovakia's [[Košice Region]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">'''Adriano Balbi''' (April 25, 1782 – March 14, 1848), Italian geographer, was born at [[Venice]]. The publication of his ''Prospetto politico-geografico dello stato attuale del globo'' ([[Venice]], 1808) obtained his election to the chair of professor of geography at the college of [[San Michele at Murano]]; in 1811–1813 he was professor of physics at the [[Lyceum of Fermo]], and afterwards became attached to the customs office at his native city.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Balbi, Adrian|volume=3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820 he visited [[Portugal]], and there collected materials for his ''Essai statistique sur le royaume de Portugal et d’Algarve'', published in 1822 at [[Paris]], where the author resided from 1821 until 1832. This was followed by ''Variétés politiques et statistiques de la monarchie portugaise'', which contains some observations respecting that country under the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sway. In 1826 he published the first volume of his ''Atlas ethnographique du globe, ou classification des peuples anciens et modernes d’après leurs langues'', a work of great erudition.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In 1829 he published, with [[Andre-Michel Guerry]], ''Statistique comparée de l'état de l'instruction et du nombre des crimes dans les divers arrondissements des Académies et des Cours Royales de France'', the first comparative [[choropleth map]] showing crime in relation to level of instruction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1832 appeared the ''Abrégé de Geographie'', which, in an enlarged form, was translated. into the principal languages of Europe. Balbi retired to [[Padua]] and there died in 1848.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His son, [[Eugenio Balbi]] (1812–1884), followed a similar career, being professor of geography at [[Pavia]], and publishing his father's ''Scritti Geografici'' ([[Turin]], 1841), and original works in ''Gea, ossia la terra'' ([[Trieste]], 1854–1867) and ''Saggio di geografia'' ([[Milan]], 1868).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Image:Alastair M. Taylor in 1995.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Alastair M. Taylor]]
'''Alastair MacDonald Taylor''' (March 12, 1915 – October 15, 2005) was a Canadian historian, filmmaker, United Nations official, professor of geography and political studies, and interdisciplinary thinker. He co-authored the first world-history textbook published in the United States. He played an active role in, and became the leading chronicler of, the diplomatic intervention by the United Nations to secure the independence of Indonesia. He was also among the first to apply systems theory to the historical development of human societies.

== Biography ==

Taylor was born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], in 1915, the youngest son of Scottish immigrants. In 1930 the family moved to [[California]], where he attended [[Hollywood High School]] and then the [[University of Southern California]], from which he graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1937. The topic of his Master's thesis at USC was "The Decline of Scottish Monasticism in the Fifteenth Century". At age 22 he collaborated with [[T. Walter Wallbank]] to begin writing ''Civilization Past and Present''. The first world-history textbook in the [[United States]], and a best-seller since its initial appearance in 1942, it was published in many editions for over six decades and was familiar to generations of students.[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/education/a-list-of-the-best.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1]

In 1942 Taylor returned to [[Canada]] to enlist in the armed forces, but was recruited to the [[National Film Board]] in [[Ottawa]], where he worked for pioneering documentary filmmaker [[John Grierson]], making films for the war effort. Taylor himself directed two short films focusing on the situation of Canadian workers in the domestic wartime economy.[http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/result.php?type=credit&amp;pid=15988&amp;nom=Alistair+M.+Taylor]

Between 1944 and 1952 Taylor worked for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and then for the [[UN Secretariat]] in [[New York City]]. At UNRRA he was a speechwriter for [[Herbert Lehman]], former governor of New York state, and then for [[Fiorello La Guardia]], former mayor of New York City. Taylor became the Official Spokesman of the [[Security Council]]'s United Nations Commission for Indonesia, which oversaw the peace settlement between the [[Netherlands]] and its former colony. In this capacity he spent several months in [[Indonesia]] in 1949 and 1950 and also attended the [[Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands.

Taylor received his doctorate from [[Balliol College, Oxford]], in 1955. His dissertation was the basis for his book ''Indonesian Independence and the United Nations'' (1960), with a foreword by [[Lester B. Pearson]]. Upon its publication, this work was hailed as a "brilliant study of the protracted negotiations that led to Indonesia's independence"&lt;ref&gt;Irene Tinker, ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 336 (July 1961), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the fullest, most accurate, and least biased"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Van Niel, ''American Historical Review'' 66 (April 1961), p. 741.&lt;/ref&gt; treatment in print of the UN's role.

In 1960 Taylor joined the faculty of [[Queen's University]] at [[Kingston, Ontario]], where he taught in both the Geography and Political Studies departments until 1980. At Queen's, in the early 1960s, he developed his systems-theory model of the historical evolution of human societies, which he designated Time-Space-Technics (TST). TST understands human societies as instances of open natural systems equilibrating with their environments in a hierarchy of [[integrative level]]s. It identifies an evolutionary sequence of [[world-view]]s that organize societal systems at the different levels. Taylor named these world-views "Mythos", "Theos", "Logos", and "Holos". TST focuses on the interplay and tension between what Taylor called "material technics" and "societal technics", and attempts to identify factors responsible for fracturing a system's equilibrium and quantizing it to a different level of societal organization (either more or less complex). Taylor published a number of articles about the TST model and in his last years was preparing a book-length exposition of his ideas. He believed that modern society stands at a critical juncture: although [[industrial society]] has become culturally and environmentally unsustainable, we have the opportunity to replace it with new values and institutions appropriate to a sustainable global civilization.

[[File:Antipodes LAEA.png|thumb|360px|right|This map shows the antipode of each point on [[Earth]]'s surface—the points where the blue and yellow overlap are land antipodes—most land has its antipodes in the ocean. This map uses the [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection]]. The yellow areas are the reflections through the Earth's center of land masses of the opposite (Western) hemisphere.]]
[[File:Antipodes LAEA inverted.png|thumb|360px|right|The same map, from the perspective of the Western Hemisphere. Here the blue areas are the reflections of the Eastern hemisphere.]]

In [[geography]], the '''antipode''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɪ|p|ə|d|iː}}) of any spot on [[Earth]] is the [[antipodal point|point]] on Earth's surface [[diameter|diametrically]] opposite to it; the '''antipodes''' of a region similarly represent the area opposite it.{{refn|group=note|In British English, "antipodes" can be either plural or singular.&lt;ref name = "Dictionary_antipodes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/antipodes? | title = antipodes | website = Dictionary.com | access-date = 2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A pair of points ''antipodal'' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɪ|p|ə|d|əl}}) to each other are situated such that a [[straight line]] connecting the two would pass through Earth's center. Such points are as far away from each other as possible, a [[great-circle distance]] of up to {{convert|40075.017|km|mi}} on the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/66515/how-many-miles-around-the-earth/|title=How Many Miles Around the Earth? - Universe Today|date=2010-06-16|work=Universe Today|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], "the Antipodes" may be used to refer to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and "Antipodeans" to their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/antipodes?view=uk Compact Oxford English Dictionary, 2008, "Antipodes"] Access date: 2010-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, the antipodes of Britain and Ireland are in the [[Pacific Ocean]], south of New Zealand. This gave rise to the name of the [[Antipodes Islands]] of New Zealand, which are close to the antipode of London at about {{coord|50|S|179|E}}.  The antipodes of Australia are in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], while parts of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[Morocco]] are antipodal to New Zealand.

Approximately 15%{{citation needed|reason=non-RS give lower values|date=May 2016}} of land territory is antipodal to other land, representing approximately 4.4% of the Earth's surface. The largest antipodal land masses are the [[Malay Archipelago]], antipodal to the [[Amazon Basin]] and adjoining [[Andes|Andean]] ranges; east [[China]] and [[Mongolia]], antipodal to [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]; and [[Greenland]] and the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], antipodal to [[East Antarctica]].
There is a general paucity of antipodal land because the Southern hemisphere has fairly little land, and of that, the antipodes of Australia are in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], while the antipodes of [[Africa]] are in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==Geography==
The antipode of any place on the Earth is the place that is diametrically opposite it, so a line drawn from the one to the other passes through the centre of the Earth and forms a true [[diameter]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antipodes|volume=2|pages=133-134}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the antipodes of New Zealand's lower North Island lie in Spain. Most of the Earth's land surfaces have ocean at their antipodes, this being a consequence of most land being in the [[land hemisphere]].

The singular ''antipode'' is a [[back-formation]] (c. 1540-50 CE) from the plural ''antipodes'',&lt;ref name = "origin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/antipode | title = antipode | website = [[Dictionary.com]] | accessdate = 2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in [[Greek language|Greek]] is the plural of the singular ''antipous''.

The antipode of any place on Earth is distant from it by 180° of [[longitude]] and as many degrees to the north of the [[Equator]] as the original is to the south (or vice versa); in other words, the [[latitude]]s are numerically equal, but one is north and the other south.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The maps shown here are based on this relationship; they show a [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection]] of the Earth, in yellow, overlaid on which is another map, in blue, shifted horizontally by 180° of longitude and inverted about the Equator with respect to latitude.

[[Noon]] at one place is [[midnight]] at the other (ignoring [[daylight saving time]] and irregularly shaped [[time zone]]s) and, with the exception of the [[tropics]], the longest day at one point corresponds to the shortest day at the other, and [[Winter solstice|midwinter]] at one point coincides with [[midsummer]] at the other. Sunrise and sunset do not quite oppose each other at antipodes due to refraction of sunlight.

===Mathematical description===

If the [[geographic coordinate]]s ([[latitude]] and [[longitude]]) of a point on the Earth's surface are (''φ'', ''θ''), then the coordinates of the antipodal point are (−''φ'', ''θ'' ± 180°). This relation holds true whether the Earth is approximated as a perfect [[sphere]] or as a [[reference ellipsoid]].

In terms of the usual way these geographic coordinates are given, this [[Transformation (function)|transformation]] can be expressed symbolically as

:''x''° N/S ''y''° E/W &amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;↦&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''x''° S/N (180 − ''y'')° W/E,

that is, for the latitude (the North/South coordinate) the magnitude of the angle remains the same but N is changed to S and vice versa, and for the longitude (the East/West coordinate) the angle is replaced by its [[supplementary angle]] while E is exchanged for W. For example, the antipode of the point in China at {{nowrap|37° N 119° E}} (a few hundred kilometres from [[Beijing]]) is the point in Argentina at {{nowrap|37° S 61° W}} (a few hundred kilometres from [[Buenos Aires]]).

==Etymology==
The word ''antipodes'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek:]] ἀντίποδες (antípodes),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2310380 ἀντίποδες], Liddell and Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; plural of ἀντίπους (antipous), "with feet opposite (ours)",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29nti%2Fpous ἀντίπους] Liddell and Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from ἀντί (antí, “opposite”) + πούς ([[wikt:πούς|poús]], “foot”). The Greek word is attested in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', already referring to a spherical Earth, explaining the relativity of the terms "above" and "below":
{{quotation|For if there were any solid body in equipoise at the centre of the universe, there would be nothing to draw it to this extreme rather than to that, for they are all perfectly similar; and if a person were to go round the world in a circle, he would often, when standing at the antipodes of his former position, speak of the same point as above and below; for, as I was saying just now, to speak of the whole which is in the form of a globe as having one part above and another below is not like a sensible man.|Plato&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus'' 63a, translated by Benjamin Jowett, (Indianapolis: Bobbs Merrill, 1949).[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1572]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term is taken up by [[Aristotle]] (''De caelo'' 308a.20), [[Strabo]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Diogenes Laertius]], and was adopted into [[Latin]] as ''antipodes''. The Latin word changed its sense from the original "under the feet, opposite side" to "those with the feet opposite", i.e. a [[bahuvrihi]] referring to hypothetical people living on the opposite side of the Earth. Medieval illustrations imagine them in some way "inverted", with their feet growing out of their heads, pointing upward.

In this sense, ''Antipodes'' first entered [[English language|English]] in 1398 in a translation of the 13th century ''De Proprietatibus Rerum'' by [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], translated by [[John of Trevisa]]:
{{quotation|Yonde in Ethiopia ben the Antipodes, men that haue theyr fete ayenst our fete.
}}(''In Modern English: Yonder in Ethiopia are the Antipodes, men that have their feet against our feet.'')

==Historical significance==
[[Pomponius Mela]], the first Roman geographer, asserted that the earth had two habitable zones, a North and South one, but that it would be impossible to get into contact with each other because of the unbearable heat at the Equator.

[[File:Crates Terrestrial Sphere.png|thumb|180px|right|The Terrestrial Sphere of [[Crates of Mallus]] (c. 150 B.C.), showing the region of the antipodes in the southern half of the western hemisphere]]
From the time of [[St Augustine]], the Christian church was skeptical of the notion. Augustine asserted that "it is too absurd to say that some men might have set sail from this side and, traversing the immense expanse of ocean, have propagated there a race of human beings descended from that one first man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html ''De Civitate Dei'', Book XVI, Chapter 9 — ''Whether We are to Believe in the Antipodes''], translated by [[Marcus Dods (theologian)|Rev. Marcus Dods]], D.D.; from the Christian Classics Ethereal Library at Calvin College&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[Isidore of Seville]]'s widely read [[Etymologiae|encyclopedia]] presented the term "antipodes" as referring to [[antichthones]] (people who lived on the opposite side of the Earth), as well as to a geographical place; these people came to play a role in medieval discussions about the [[Flat earth#Early Middle Ages|shape of the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stevens | first = Wesley M. | title = The Figure of the Earth in Isidore's "De natura rerum" | journal = Isis | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | page = 274 | date = 1980 | jstor = 230175 | doi = 10.1086/352464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 748, in reply to a letter from [[Saint Boniface]], [[Pope Zachary]] declared the belief "that beneath the earth there was another world and other men, another sun and moon" to be heretical.  In his letter, Boniface had apparently maintained that [[Vergilius of Salzburg]] held such a belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The antipodes being an attribute of a [[spherical Earth]], some ancient authors used their perceived absurdity as an argument for a [[flat Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.ii.iii.xxiv.html|author=Lactantius|chapter= ''The Divine Institutes'', Book III, Chapter XXIV|title=THE ANTE-NICENE FATHERS|volume=VII|editor1=Rev.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, knowledge of the spherical Earth was widespread during the Middle Ages, only occasionally disputed — the medieval dispute surrounding the antipodes mainly concerned the question whether people could live on the opposite side of the earth: since the torrid [[clime]] was considered impassable, it would have been impossible to [[evangelize]] them. This posed the problem that [[Christ]] told the apostles to evangelize all mankind; with regard to the unreachable antipodes, this would have been impossible. Christ would either have appeared a second time, in the antipodes, or left the damned irredeemable. Such an argument was forwarded by the Spanish theologian [[Alonso Tostado]] as late as the 15th century and "St. Augustine doubts" was a response to Columbus's proposal to sail westwards to the Indies.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Life of the Admiral Chrispher Columbus|author=Ferdinand Columbus|date=1543|edition=Translation by Benjamin Keen|publisher=London, The Folio Society, 1960|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the Norwegian book ''[[Konungs Skuggsjá]]'', from around 1250, discusses the existence of antipodes. He notes that (if they exist) they will see the sun in the north in the middle of the day and that they will have seasons opposite those of the Northern Hemisphere.

The earliest surviving account by a European who had visited the Southern Hemisphere is that of [[Marco Polo]] (who, on his way home in 1292, sailed south of the [[Malay Peninsula]]). He noted that it was impossible to see the star [[Polaris]] from there.

The idea of dry land in the southern climes, the ''[[Terra Australis]]'', was introduced by [[Ptolemy]] and appears on European maps as an imaginary continent from the 15th century. In spite of having been discovered relatively late by European explorers, [[Australia]] was inhabited very early in human history; the ancestors of the [[Indigenous Australians]] reached it at least 50,000 years ago.

== True trip "around the world" ==
To make the longest distance trip around the planet a traveler would have to pass through a set of antipodal points.  All meridians can be crossed in one hemisphere--indeed, by walking around one of the poles--but such trips are shorter than a maximum circumnavigation.  On the other hand, the greatest straight line distance that could in theory be covered is a trip exactly on the Equator.  The Earth's [[equatorial bulge]] makes this slightly longer than one north-south around the world along a set of meridian lines, or on any other closed [[great circle]] route traveling at an angle.  In any of these cases after half the world is passed every subsequent point will be antipodal to one already visited.

== Air travel between antipodes ==
There are no non-stop scheduled flights between any two antipodal locations by commercial airline service—or anything even close. There is currently no commercial aircraft capable of travelling between antipodes at full load non-stop. (The current record holder [[Boeing 777-200LR]]'s maximum range is rated at {{Convert|17,395|km||abbr=on}}.) There are also regulations regarding pilot's work time, so [[Aircrew#Relief crew|relief crewmembers]] would be needed.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The longest non-stop scheduled flight was the [[Singapore Airlines Flight 21]] between [[Newark, New Jersey]] and [[Singapore]], covering about {{convert|16700|km|mi|abbr=on}} in about 17 hours and 52 minutes of flight time, and this was far from a journey between nearly antipodal locations. Among flights with fuel stop and crew-change stop but still same flight number, [[Air New Zealand]] has one of the longest, [[Auckland]]–[[Los Angeles]]–[[London]], at {{convert|19240|km|mi|abbr=on}} over Los Angeles ({{convert|18360|km|mi|abbr=on}} directly).

A hypothetically perfect antipode flight would be [[Tangier Ibn Battouta Airport]], [[Morocco]] ([[IATA]]: TNG) to [[Whangarei Aerodrome]], [[New Zealand]] (IATA: WRE), whose designated locators are 10,800&amp;nbsp;nautical&amp;nbsp;miles (20,001&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;!-- EACH TO 5-DIGIT PRECISION --&gt; apart,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=tng-wre%0D%0A&amp;R=&amp;PM_q=%2A&amp;PM=%2A&amp;MS=wls&amp;MP=&amp;MC=&amp;PC=red&amp;PW=&amp;PT=&amp;RC=navy&amp;RW=&amp;RS=&amp;DU=nm&amp;DM=&amp;SG=&amp;SU=kts&amp;EV=&amp;EU=kts Great Circle Mapper] Access date: 2017-09-24,&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum possible distance, but their actual runways cross in projection. However, with only a length of {{Convert|3599|ft||abbr=on}}, Whangarei's runway is too short to accommodate any current ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}) commercial jet airliner, especially one with the required range. Traveling between them would presently need at least three plane changes, e.g. Paris–Los Angeles–Auckland. Taipei and Asuncion are {{Convert|19,912|km||abbr=on}} apart; Santiago and Xian are {{Convert|19,897|km||abbr=on}} apart; Madrid and Auckland are {{Convert|19,590|km||abbr=on}} apart; Buenos Aires and Beijing are {{Convert|19,260|km||abbr=on}} apart; Johannesburg and Honolulu are {{Convert|19,188|km||abbr=on}} apart; New York City and Perth are {{Convert|18,700|km||-1|abbr=on}} apart.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==List of antipodes==
===Earth===
[[File:Antipodes equirectangular.svg|thumb|560px|Some cities and towns which are near-antipodes in [[equirectangular projection]]. '''&lt;span style="color:#0000ff;background:#ffffff;"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;''' labels pertain to &lt;span style="background:#00ccff;color:#000000;"&gt;cyan&lt;/span&gt; and '''&lt;span style="color:#660000;background:#ffffff;"&gt;brown&lt;/span&gt;''' labels pertain to &lt;span style="background:#ffcc00;color:#000000;"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt; areas. Areas where &lt;span style="background:#00ccff;color:#000000;"&gt;cyan&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:#ffcc00;color:#000000;"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt; overlap (coloured &lt;span style="background:#00cc00;color:#000000;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;) are land antipodes.]]
Around 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by [[ocean]]s, and seven-eighths of the Earth's land is confined to the [[Land and water hemispheres|land hemisphere]], so the majority of locations on land do not have land-based antipodes.

The two largest human inhabited antipodal areas are located in East Asia (mainly eastern China) and South America (mainly northern Argentina and Chile).
The Australian mainland is the largest landmass with its antipodes entirely in ocean, although some locations of mainland Australia and Tasmania are close to being antipodes of islands (Bermuda, Azores, Puerto Rico) in the North Atlantic Ocean. 
The largest landmass with antipodes entirely on land is the island of [[Borneo]], whose antipodes are in the Amazon rainforest.

====Cities and geographic features====
[[Gibraltar]] is approximately antipodal to [[Te Arai|Te Arai Beach]] about {{Convert|85|km||abbr=on}} north of [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. This illustrates the old yet correct saying that the [[The empire on which the sun never sets|sun never sets]] on the [[British Empire]]; the sun still does not set on the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The northern part of [[New Caledonia]], an overseas territory of France, is antipodal to some thinly populated desert in [[Mauritania]], a part of the former [[French West Africa]]. Portions of [[Suriname]], a former Dutch colony, are antipodal to [[Sulawesi]], an [[Indonesia]]n island spelled ''Celebes'' when it was part of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. [[Luzon]], the largest island of the [[Philippines]], is antipodal to eastern [[Bolivia]]. As with the British Empire, the sun set neither on the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], the [[Dutch Empire]], nor the [[Spanish Empire]] at their peaks.

[[Santa Vitória do Palmar]], the most southerly town of more than 10,000 people in [[Brazil]], is antipodal to [[Jeju-do|Jeju Island]], the southernmost territory of [[South Korea]].

The [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]] is antipodal to the [[Okavango Delta]] in Botswana, with the island's largest city, [[Hilo]], antipodal to [[Nxai Pan National Park]].

[[Easter Island]] is antipodal to [[Desert National Park]], {{Convert|35|km||abbr=on}} from [[Jaisalmer]], [[India]].

[[Kiritimati]], the largest island of [[Kiribati]] and the largest coral atoll in the world, is antipodal to [[Salonga National Park]], which is the largest national park of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the largest tropical rainforest reserve in Africa.

[[Serra da Estrela Natural Park]], the largest natural park of [[Portugal]], is antipodal to [[Kahurangi National Park]], the second largest national park of [[New Zealand]].

Desolate [[Kerguelen Island]] is antipodal to an area of thinly inhabited plains on the border between the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] and the US state of [[Montana]].

The [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]], an uninhabited Australian territory, is antipodal to an area in central [[Saskatchewan]], including the towns of [[Leask, Saskatchewan|Leask]] and [[Shellbrook, Saskatchewan|Shellbrook]].

[[Tigres Island]], the largest uninhabited island of [[Angola]], is approximately antipodal to [[Johnston atoll]], which is the third largest uninhabited island of the [[United States]].

[[Île Saint-Paul|St. Paul Island]] and [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]] are antipodal to thinly populated parts of the eastern part of the US state of [[Colorado]].

[[South Georgia Island]] is antipodal to the northernmost part of [[Sakhalin Island]].

[[Lake Baikal]] is partially antipodal to the [[Straits of Magellan]].

The Russian Antarctic research base [[Bellingshausen Station]] is antipodal to a land location in [[Russia]]n Siberia.

[[Rottnest Island]], off the coast of [[Western Australia]], is approximately antipodal to [[Bermuda]].

[[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores Island]], the westernmost island of the [[Azores]], is nearly antipodal to [[Flinders Island]] between [[Tasmania]] and the Australian mainland.

[[Point Nemo]], the point in the South Pacific Ocean most distant from any other land, is precisely opposite a desolate piece of desert in western Kazakhstan.

By definition, the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]] are antipodes.

[[Null Island]], {{coord|0|N|0|E|display=inline}}, at the intersection of the [[prime meridian]] and the [[equator]], has its antipodes at {{coord|0|N|180|E|display=inline}}, at the intersection of the [[antimeridian]] and the [[equator]]. This point lies northeast of [[Nikunau]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]] and southwest of [[Baker Island]], a [[United States]] territory.

As can be seen on the purple/blue map, the [[Pacific Ocean]] is so large that it stretches halfway around the world; parts of the Pacific off the coast of [[Peru]] are antipodal to parts of the same ocean off the coast of Southeast Asia. For example, the island of [[Ko Chang]] - which is the second or third largest island in [[Thailand]] - is nearly antipodal to [[San Lorenzo Island, Peru|San Lorenzo Island]], which is the largest island of [[Peru]].

Countries matching up with just one other country are Morocco, Spain, Chad, Libya, Cameroon (with the Cook Islands of New Zealand); Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia (with French Polynesia); Senegal (Vanuatu); the UAE (Pitcairn); Ghana, Ivory Coast (Tuvalu); Burkina Faso (Rotuma in Fiji); Guinea (Solomon Islands); India (Easter Island); Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand (all with Peru); Singapore (Ecuador); Brunei, Palau, Micronesia (all with Brazil); Venezuela and Suriname (Indonesia).

Of these, the larger countries which are entirely antipodal to land are the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Fiji]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Brunei]], and [[Samoa]]. [[Chile]] was as well prior to its expansion into the Atacama with the [[War of the Pacific]].

===Extraterrestrial examples===
In a number of cases on extraterrestrial bodies in the Solar System, unusual geologic features (e.g., jumbled terrain or unique volcanic constructs) are located antipodal to major impact basins. It has been hypothesized that this results from focusing of some of the seismic waves ([[p-wave]]s and [[surface wave#Mechanical waves|surface waves]]) produced by an impact at its antipode.&lt;ref name = "Schultz1975" /&gt;

===Television===
* A gag in American animated television series was "digging all the way to [[China]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
* On the popular TV show ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', the Deeper Well is a hole that goes through the world, with its entrance in the Cotswolds in England and its antipode in New Zealand.
* The May 19, 2008, official ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' audio podcast gave credence to a theory that the Island (where the show is set) is located at Tunisia's antipode, in the [[South Pacific Ocean|south Pacific]] east of New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
* "[[The Gathering (Torchwood)|The Gathering]]", a [[Torchwood: Miracle Day|fourth series]] episode of ''[[Torchwood]]'', refers to [[Shanghai]] and [[Buenos Aires]] as being antipodes of each other.  The [[The Blood Line|tenth]] and [[final episode]] notes more precisely that they are "perfect antipodes" while acknowledging that is only accurate "give or take a hundred miles or so."
* At the closing ceremonies of the Rio 2016 Olympics, they used the antipodes as a tool to invite viewers to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

The '''Arctic Cape''' ({{lang-ru|Мыс Арктический}}, ''Mys Arkticheskiy'') is a [[headland]] in [[Severnaya Zemlya]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="mapcartaA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapcarta.com/15368460|title= Mys Arkticheskiy|work=Mapcarta|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a distance of 990.7&amp;nbsp;km to the [[North Pole]], the Arctic Cape is sometimes used as starting point for expeditions to the [[North Pole]].
==Geography==
Stretching out towards the [[Arctic Ocean]] by the [[Molotov Glacier]],&lt;ref name="mapcartaA"/&gt; it is the northernmost point of [[Komsomolets Island]],&lt;ref name="epf668"/&gt; which in turn is the northernmost [[island]] of the archipelago. Under [[Joseph Stalin]] the cape was known as Cape [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]].&lt;ref name="epf668"/&gt;

The Arctic Cape is not the northernmost point of Russia. That distinction goes to [[Cape Fligely]] (mys Fligeli) on [[Rudolf Island]] (ostrov Rudolfa), an island in the [[Franz Josef Land]] archipelago. The northernmost point of mainland Asia is [[Cape Chelyuskin]].

This cape also marks the [[Kara Sea]]'s northeastern limit, which is the eastern end of a line running from [[Cape Kohlsaat]] in [[Franz Josef Land]] to the Arctic Cape.

'''Bamyan Province''' ({{lang-prs|ولایت بامیان}}) is one of the thirty-four [[provinces of Afghanistan]], located in the central highlands of the country. Its terrain is mountainous or semi-mountainous. The province is divided into six [[Districts of Afghanistan|districts]], with the town of [[Bamyan]] serving as its capital. The province has a population of about 455,000.&lt;ref name=cso/&gt; It is the largest province in the [[Hazarajat]] region of [[Afghanistan]], and is the cultural capital of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group that predominates in the area.

Its name can be translated as "The Place of Shining Light". In antiquity, central Afghanistan was strategically placed to thrive from the [[Silk Road]] caravans that criss-crossed the region, trading between the Roman Empire, China, [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. Bamyan was a stopping-off point for many travellers. It was here that elements of Greek and Buddhist art were combined into a unique classical style known as [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] art.

The province has several famous historical sites, including the now-destroyed [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], around which are more than 3,000 caves, the [[Band-e Amir National Park]], Dara-i-Ajhdar, Gholghola and Zakhak ancient towns, the Feroz Bahar, Astopa, Klegan, Gaohargin, Kaferan and Cheldukhtaran.

{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}

=== Ancient ===
Archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0002) Pre-Islamic Period], by Craig Baxter (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name="Dupree3"&gt;[[Nancy Hatch Dupree|Nancy H. Dupree]] (1973). ''An Historical Guide To Afghanistan'', Chapter 3 Sites in Perspective.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] [[Indo-Iranians]].&lt;ref name="JFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html|title=Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska|publisher=Webcitation.org|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDUj6WJ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html|archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=19 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes later migrated further south to India, west to what is now Iran, and towards Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F. (2001). ''The quest for the origins of Vedic culture: the Indo-Aryan migration debate''. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513777-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The region as a whole was called [[Ariana]].&lt;ref name="JFS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan: ancient Ariana (1950), Information Bureau, p3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witzel"&gt;M. Witzel (2000), "The Home Of The Aryans", Festschrift J. Narten = Münchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft, Beihefte NF 19, Dettelbach: J.H. Röll, 283–338. Also published online, at [[Harvard University]] ([http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/AryanHome.pdf LINK]). p. 48. "The Vīdẽvdaδ list obviously was composed or redacted by someone who regarded Afghanistan and the lands surrounding it as the home of all Indo-Iranians (airiia), that is of all (eastern) Iranians, with Airiianem Vaẽjah as their center."&lt;/ref&gt;

The people shared similar culture with other [[Indo-Iranians]]. The ancient religion of [[Kafiristan]] survived here until the 19th century. Another religion, [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]].&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0003) Achaemenid Rule, ca. 550-331 B.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html|title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation|date=15 February 1989|publisher=Gandhara.com.au|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html|archive-date=9 September 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_afghanachaemenid.htm|title=''Afghanistan: Achaemenid dynasty rule'', Ancient Classical History|date=13 April 2012|publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234134/http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_afghanachaemenid.htm|archivedate=2013-12-30|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. 

By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of King [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy H. Dupree, [http://www.aisk.org/aisk/NHDAHGTK05.php#Top An Historical Guide to Kabul]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727185437/http://www.aisk.org/aisk/NHDAHGTK05.php#Top|date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 330 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] seized the area but left it to [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] to rule. The area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] was given to the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]] who introduced Buddhism. The Mauryas introduced were planning to capture more territory in Central Asia, until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces. [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] is said to have reached a peace treaty with Mauryan emperor Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and 500 elephants.
[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Maurya Empire]] under [[Ashoka the Great]]]]

Afghanistan's significant ancient tangible and intangible [[Pre Islamic Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan|Buddhist heritage]] is recorded through wide-ranging archeological finds, including religious and artistic remnants. Buddhist doctrines are reported to have reached as far as [[Balkh]] even during the life of the [[Buddha]] (563 BCE to 483 BCE), as recorded by [[Xuanzang|Husang Tsang]]. It became the site of an early Buddhist monastery. Many statues of Buddha were carved into the sides of cliffs facing Bamyan city. The two most prominent of these statues were standing Buddhas, now known as the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], measuring 55 and 37 meters high respectively, that were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world. They were probably erected in the 4th or 5th century A.D. They were cultural landmarks for many years and are listed among [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Sites]]. In March 2001 the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]] decreed that the statues were idolatrous and ordered them to be demolished with anti-aircraft artillery and explosives.[[File:BamyanBuddha Smaller 1.jpg|upright|thumb|The smaller [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Buddha of Bamiyan]]. [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhism]] was widespread in the region before the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]].]]

By the 7th century, when the Arabs first arrived, it was under the control of the [[Kabul Shahi]] before being conquered in the name of [[Islam]] by the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] in the 9th century. It fell to the [[Ghaznavids]] followed by the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]] before the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in the 13th century. The area was ruled by [[Arghun|Arghun Khan]] of [[Ilkhanate]], later by the [[Timurids]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

In 1709, when the [[Hotaki dynasty]] rose to power in [[Kandahar]] and defeated the Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], Bamyan was under the [[Mughal Empire]] influence until [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] made it become part of the Afghan [[Durrani Empire]], which became to what is now the modern state of Afghanistan. 

During the 1980s [[Soviet–Afghan War]], the Hazara rebel leader [[Abdul Ali Mazari]] began spreading influence. He was supported by Iranian politicians. He founded the [[Hezbe Wahdat]] political party in 1989 and was killed by Taliban forces. By 1995, Bamyan province was under the control of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] (Taliban government). They were toppled by US-led forces in late 2001.

=== Recent history ===
After the formation of the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]], Bamyan became the focus of rebuilding.
 
The Buddhist remains at Bamyan were included on the 2008 [[World Monuments Watch]] List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. It is hoped that the listing will put continued national and international attention on the site as a whole (including, but not limited to, the statues) in order to ensure its long-term preservation, and to make certain that future restoration efforts maintain the authenticity of the site and that proper preservation practices are followed. Bamyan is also known as the capital of [[Daizangi]] and for its natural beauty.

It is recognised as one of the safest provinces in the country, which has allowed for civil rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/bamian.htm |title=Bamian |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=2003-09-22 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamyan served as the base of operations for the [[Military of New Zealand|New Zealand]] [[International Security Assistance Force|peacekeeping force]], a Provincial Reconstruction Team codenamed ''Task Group Crib'', which was part of the network of [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]]s throughout Afghanistan.

== Politics and governance ==
{{Further|Politics of Afghanistan|List of governors of Bamyan}}
[[File:ANP in Bamyan.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]] (ANP)]]
The current [[governor]] of the province is [[Habiba Sarabi]], Afghanistan's first and, so far, only female governor; she was appointed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8205881.stm British Broadcasting Corporation : ''Putting Bamyan Back on the Map''] Retrieved 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Bamyan]] serves as the capital of the province. All [[Law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement]] activities throughout the province are controlled by the [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) along with the [[Afghan Local Police]] (ALP). The provincial police chief represents the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]] in [[Kabul]]. The ANP is backed by other [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF), including the [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO-led forces]].

== Transportation ==
{{Further|Transport in Afghanistan}}
As of May 2014, the province was served by [[Bamyan Airport]] in Bamyan which had regularly scheduled direct flights to [[Kabul International Airport|Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;2014 Timetable, http://flyeasthorizon.com/flight-schedule/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
Bamiyan has been particularly famous for its potatoes.  The region is also known for a "[[shuttle system]]" of planting, wherein seed potatoes are grown in winter in [[Jalalabad]], a warm area of eastern Afghanistan, and then transferred to Bamyan for spring re-planting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSuWNK5Qxn8C&amp;pg=PT73&amp;dq=bamiyan+potatoes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a81FTYSwHMGB8gaalrWBAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=snippet&amp;q=bamiyan&amp;f=false Fueling Growth,health and Prosperity].

=== Tourism ===
Prior to the Soviet invasion of 1979 the province attracted many tourists.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; Although this number is considerably fewer now,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/world/asia/for-ski-break-without-crowds-or-rebels-an-afghan-town-beckons.html?hp Bamyam tourism]&lt;/ref&gt; Bamyan is the first province in Afghanistan to have set up a tourist board, Bamyan Tourism.

[[Image:US NOAA nautical chart of Bering Strait.png|right|thumb|300px|Nautical chart of the Bering Strait]]

The '''Bering Strait''' is a [[strait]] of the [[Pacific]], which separates Russia and Alaska slightly south of the [[Arctic Circle]] at about 65° 40' N [[latitude]]. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37" W. The Straight is named after [[Vitus Bering]], a Danish explorer in the service of the [[Russian Empire]].

The Strait has been the subject of the scientific hypothesis [[Bering strait theory|that humans migrated from Asia to North America across a land bridge]] known as [[Beringia]] when lower ocean levels&amp;nbsp;– perhaps a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water&amp;nbsp;– exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S. Krieger |author4=Phillip C. Naylor |author5=Dahia Ibo Shabaka | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | publisher = McDougal Littell | year = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-395-87274-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it. This view of how [[Paleo-Indians]] entered America has been the dominant one for several decades and continues to be the most accepted one. Numerous successful crossings without the use of a boat have also been recorded since at least the early 20th century.

Since 2012, the Russian coast of the Bering Strait has been a [[Border Security Zone of Russia|closed military zone]]. Through organized trips and the use of special permits, it is possible for foreigners to visit. All arrivals must be through an airport or a cruise port, near the Bering Strait only at [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]] or [[Provideniya]]. Unauthorized travelers who arrive on shore after crossing the strait, even those with visas, may be arrested, imprisoned briefly, fined, deported and banned from future visas.&lt;ref name=NYT71212&gt;{{cite news|title=Journey by Sea Takes Awkward Turn in Russia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/europe/team-returns-to-alaska-after-4-day-detention-in-russia.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 11, 2012|author=Andrew Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography and science ==
The Bering Strait is about {{convert|82|km|mi}} wide at its narrowest point, between [[Cape Dezhnev]], [[Chukchi Peninsula]], [[Russia]], the easternmost point (169° 43' W) of the [[Asia]]n continent and [[Cape Prince of Wales]], [[Alaska]], United States, the westernmost point (168° 05' W) of the [[North American continent]]. Its depth varies between {{convert|30|m}} and {{convert|50|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;It is only {{convert|53|mi|km}} wide, and at its deepest point is only {{convert|90|m}} in depth. [http://www.gr8st8.com/main_pages/bering_tunnel.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It borders with the [[Chukchi Sea]] (part of the [[Arctic Ocean]]) to north and with the [[Bering Sea]] to south.

The [[International Date Line]] runs equidistant between the Strait's [[Diomede Islands]] at a distance of {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on|0}}, leaving the Russian and American sides usually on different calendar days, with Cape Dezhnev 21 hours ahead of the American side (20 hours during [[daylight saving time]]).

== Population ==
The area is sparsely populated.

The eastern coast belongs to the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]]. Notable towns on the American coast of the Strait include [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] (3,788 people) and the small settlement of [[Teller, Alaska|Teller]] (228 people).

The western coast belongs to the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], a [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of Russia. Major towns that lie along the Strait include [[Lorino, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Lorino]] (1,267 people) and [[Lavrentiya]] (1,459 people).

The Diomede Islands lie midway in the Strait. The village in [[Little Diomede]] has a school which belongs to Alaska's [[Bering Strait School District]].

== Expeditions ==
[[File:Operational Navigation Chart C-8, 2nd edition.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Defense Mapping Agency]] topographical map of the Bering Strait, 1973]] 
The earliest reference of the strait were from maps from the Polo family; based on the adventures of [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="History3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/did-marco-polo-visit-alaska|title=Did Marco Polo Visit Alaska? |last=Klein|first=Christopher|publisher=''History'' |date=September 30, 2014 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From at least 1562, European geographers thought that there was a [[Strait of Anián]] between Asia and North America. In 1648, [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] probably passed through the strait, but his report did not reach Europe. Danish-born Russian navigator [[Vitus Bering]] entered it in 1728. In 1732, [[Mikhail Gvozdev]] crossed it for the first time, from Asia to America. [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]] in 1878–79 sailed along the northern coast of [[Siberia]], thereby proving that there was no northern land bridge from Asia to North America.

In March 1913, Captain Max Gottschalk (German) crossed from the east cape of Siberia to [[Shishmaref, Alaska]], on dogsled via Little and Big Diomede islands. He was the first documented modern voyager to cross from Russia to North America without the use of a boat.&lt;ref name="Captain Max Gottschalk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=52AdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YVsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6756,1171017|title=The Victoria Advocate - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, swimmer [[Lynne Cox]] swam a {{convert|4.3|km|mi|adj=on}} course between the Diomede Islands from Alaska to the Soviet Union in {{convert|3.3|°C}} water during the last years of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Simon. (2012-08-08) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19149829#TWEET189319 "Swim that broke Cold War ice curtain"]. BBC News. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 1989, three teams of sea kayakers combined to attempt the first modern sea kayak crossing of the Bering Strait. The groups were seven Alaskans referring to their effort as 'Paddling Into Tomorrow' (crossing the international dateline), a four-man British expedition, ''Kayaks Across the Bering Strait'' and an unnamed group of three Californians.

In 1998, Russian adventurer [[Dmitry Shparo]] and his son Matvey crossed the frozen Bering Strait on skis.

In March 2006, Briton [[Karl Bushby]] and French-American adventurer [[Dimitri Kieffer]] crossed the strait on foot, walking across a frozen {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} section in 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4872348.stm|title=Epic explorer crosses frozen sea|publisher=BBC News|date=3 April 2006|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were soon arrested for not entering Russia through a border control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/humber/4876076.stm|title=Epic explorer detained in Russia|publisher=BBC News|date=4 April 2006|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 2008 marked the first crossing of the Bering Strait using an amphibious road-going vehicle. The specially modified [[Land Rover Defender|Land Rover Defender 110]] was driven by Steve Burgess and Dan Evans across the straits on its second attempt following the interruption of the first by bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetocape.org.uk/|title=Cape to Cape Expedition|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, a Korean team led by [[Hong Sung-Taek]] crossed the straits on foot in six days. They started from Chukotka Peninsula, the east coast of Russia on February 23 and arrived in Wales, the western coastal town in Alaska on February 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120301000341|title=Korean team crosses Bering Strait|author=The Korea Herald|work=koreaherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, six adventurers associated with "Dangerous Waters", a reality adventure show under production, made the crossing on [[Personal water craft|Sea-Doos]] but were arrested and permitted to return to Alaska on their Sea-Doos after being briefly detained in [[Lavrentiya]], administrative center of the [[Chukotsky District]]. They were treated well and given a tour of the village's museum, but not permitted to continue south along the Pacific coast. The men had visas but the western coast of the Bering Strait is a [[Border Security Zone of Russia|closed military zone]].&lt;ref name=NYT71212 /&gt;

Between August 4 and 10 (US time), 2013, a team of 65 swimmers from 17 countries performed a relay swim across the Bering Strait, the first such swim in history. They swam from Cape Dezhnev, Russia, to Cape Prince of Wales, United States (roughly 110&amp;nbsp;km, due to the current).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/c20/836692.html|title=ТАСС: Спорт – На Аляске завершилась международная эстафета "моржей", переплывших Берингов пролив|work=ТАСС}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BeringStraitSwim|title=Bering Strait Swim – Russia to America|work=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had direct support from the Russian Navy, using one of its ships, and assistance with permission.

== Proposed crossing ==
{{Main|Bering Strait crossing|}}

A physical link between Asia and North America via the Bering Strait nearly became a reality in 1864 when a [[Russian-American telegraph]] company began preparations for an overland telegraph line connecting Europe and America via the east. It was abandoned when the undersea [[Atlantic Cable]] proved successful.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A further proposal for a bridge-and-tunnel link from Siberia to Alaska was made by French engineer [[Baron Loicq de Lobel]] in 1906. Czar Nicholas II of Russia issued an order authorising a Franco-American syndicate represented by de Lobel to begin work on the Trans-Siberian Alaska railroad project, but no physical work ever commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19060902.2.146.2 |title=San Francisco to St Petersburg by Rail!

Oliver|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggestions have been made to construct a [[Bering Strait bridge]] between Alaska and Siberia. However, despite the unprecedented engineering, political, and financial challenges, Russia green-lighted the US $65-billion [[TKM-World Link]] tunnel project in August 2011. If completed, the 103&amp;nbsp;km (64 mile) project would have been the world's longest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] | last=Halpin | first=Tony | date=2011-08-20 | title=Russia plans $65bn tunnel to America}}&lt;/ref&gt; China considered construction of a "China-Russia-Canada-America" railroad line that would include construction of a {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} long underwater tunnel that would cross the Bering Strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | last=Tharoor | first=Ishaan | date=2014-05-09 | title=China may build an undersea train to America | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/05/09/china-may-build-an-undersea-train-to-america/ | accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed dam ==
In 1956, the Soviet Union proposed to the US a joint bi-national project to warm the Arctic Ocean and melt some of the ice cap. As designed by Petr Borisov, the Soviet project called for a {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} wide dam across the Bering Strait. It would block the cold Pacific current from entering the Arctic. By pumping low-salinity cold surface water across the dam to the Pacific, warmer and higher salinity sea water from the Atlantic Ocean would be introduced into the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref name="ley196106"&gt;{{Cite magazine

A. Drogaytsev, also opposed the idea, stating that the sea north of the dam and north-flowing rivers in Siberia would become unnavigable year round, and extend the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and other deserts to the northern Siberia coastline.{{r|ley196106}}

American [[Charles P. Steinmetz]] earlier proposed to widen the Bering Strait by removing [[St. Lawrence Island]] and parts of [[Seward Peninsula|Seward]] and [[Chukotski Peninsula]]s. A strait 200 miles wide would let the [[Japan Current]] melt the Arctic Ocean.{{r|ley196106}}

In the 21st century another dam has also been proposed, however the aim of the proposal is to preserve the Arctic ice cap against global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-greenhouse-warming.com/could-a-300-km-dam-save-the-arctic.html|title=Could a 300 km dam save the Arctic?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Ice Curtain" border ==
[[Image:Diomede Islands Bering Sea Jul 2006.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Little Diomede Island (US, left) and Big Diomede Island (Russia, right)]]

During the [[Cold War]], the Bering Strait marked the border between the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States. The [[Diomede Islands]]—Big Diomede (Russia) and Little Diomede (US)—are only {{convert|3.8|km|abbr=on}} apart. Traditionally, the indigenous peoples in the area had frequently crossed the border back and forth for "routine visits, seasonal festivals and subsistence trade", but were prevented from doing so during the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/russianheritage.htm State of Alaska website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831063131/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/russianheritage.htm |date=2009-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The border became known as the "Ice Curtain".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/magazine/lifting-the-ice-curtain.html "Lifting the Ice Curtain"], Peter A. Iseman, ''The New York Times'', October 23, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; It was completely closed, and there was no regular passenger air or boat traffic. In 1987, American swimmer [[Lynne Cox]] symbolically helped ease tensions between the two countries by swimming across the border&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/12/60II/main540357.shtml "Swimming to Antarctica"], CBS News, September 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and was congratulated jointly by [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

'''''Book of Roads and Kingdoms''''' or '''''Book of Highways and Kingdoms''''' ({{lang-ar|كتاب المسالك والممالك|rtl=yes}}, {{lang|ar-Latn|Kitāb al-Masālik wa'l-Mamālik}}) is the name of an eleventh-century [[geography]] text by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri]]. 

It was written in 1067-8 in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[al-Andalus]] (present day Spain).  Al-Bakri based his work on the accounts of traders, the writings of Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Warraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levtzion|first1=Nehemia|title=Ancient Ghana and Mali|date=1973|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0841904316|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''On the Topography of North Africa''), and [[Abraham ben Jacob]]. Despite the fact that al-Bakri never left al-Andalus, his writings are regarded as objectively reporting the accounts of other travelers by contemporary historians, and much of what he wrote is substantiated in other sources.

He described a wide array of regions from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], through the [[Sahara]], to [[Central Africa]], giving descriptions of the geography, people, culture and political situation in each region. The ''Book of Roads and Kingdoms'' exists today only in fragmentary form. It is sometimes confused with a  [[Book of Roads and Kingdoms (ibn Khordadbeh)|work by the same name]] written in the ninth century by [[ibn Khordadbeh]].

'''''Euphorbia boissieri''''' is a species of [[plant]] in the [[Euphorbiaceae]] family. It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]].  Its natural [[habitat]] is subtropical or tropical moist lowland [[forest]]s. It is threatened by [[habitat loss]]. A political crisis in 2009 also plunged Madagascar wildlife into a desperate state. [http://www.wildmadagascar.org]  It is named after botanist [[Pierre Edmond Boissier]].

[[Africa]] is a [[continent]] comprising 63 political territories, representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Africa |volume=1 |pages=320–322 |first1=Edward |last1=Heawood |first2=Frank Richardson |last2=Cana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within its regular outline, it comprises an area of {{convert|30368609|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, excluding adjacent islands. Its highest mountain is [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], its largest lake is [[Lake Victoria]]
&lt;ref&gt;kedcfjsuhk&lt;/ref&gt;

Separated from [[Europe]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and from much of [[Asia]] by the [[Red Sea]], Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (which in transected by the [[Suez Canal]]), {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. For [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] purposes, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]]&amp;nbsp;– east on the Suez Canal&amp;nbsp;– is often considered part of Africa. From the most northerly point, [[Ras ben Sakka]] in [[Tunisia]], at 37°21′ N, to the more southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in [[South Africa]], 34°51′15″ S, is a distance approximately of {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on}}; from [[Cap-Vert]], 17°31′13″W, the westernmost point, to [[Ras Hafun]] in [[Somalia]], 51°27′52″ E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of {{convert|7400|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. [[Africa]] is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, and the southern from north to south.

==Main features==
[[File:Africa (satellite image).jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Africa]]
The average elevation of the continent approximates closely to {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, roughly near to the mean elevation of both [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], but considerably less than that of [[Asia]], {{convert|950|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. In contrast with other continents, it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground, lands under {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} occupying an unusually small part of the surface; while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of Asia or South America, but the area of land over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} is also quite insignificant, being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges. Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent, though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges. (So prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that a specialised term [''Inselberg-Landschaft'', island mountain landscape] has been adopted in [[Germany]] to describe this kind of country, thought to be in great part the result of wind action.)

As a general rule, the higher tablelands lie to the east and south, while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable. Apart from the lowlands and the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range, the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus, the dividing line (somewhat concave to the north-west) running from the middle of the [[Red Sea]] to about 6 deg. S. on the west coast.

Africa can be divided into a number of geographic zones:

*The coastal plains&amp;nbsp;— often fringed seawards by mangrove swamps&amp;nbsp;— never stretching far from the coast, apart from the lower courses of streams. Recent alluvial flats are found chiefly in the delta of the more important rivers. Elsewhere, the coastal lowlands merely form the lowest steps of the system of terraces that constitutes the ascent to the inner plateaus.
*The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas range]]&amp;nbsp;— orthographically distinct from the rest of the continent, being unconnected with and separated from the south by a depressed and desert area (the [[Sahara]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Plateau region==
[[File:Topography of africa.png|thumb|Topography of Africa]]
The high southern and eastern plateaus, rarely falling below {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, have a mean elevation of about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[South African Plateau]], as far as about 12° S, is bounded east, west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts. On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer. Due south, the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them. The largest of these level areas, the [[Great Karoo]], is a dry, barren region, and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The South African Plateau is connected towards [[East African plateau]], with probably a slightly greater average elevation, and marked by some distinct features. It is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground, which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges, tablelands and depressions. The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the Earth's crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes. Towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by [[Lake Nyasa]]), the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Farther north the western hollow, known as the [[Albertine Rift]], is occupied for more than half its length by water, forming the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] of [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]], [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], the first-named over {{convert|400|mi|km}} long and the longest freshwater lake in the world. Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks, the greatest of which occur on a [[meridional line]] east of the eastern trough. The eastern branch of the [[East African Rift]], contains much smaller lakes, many of them [[brackish water|brackish]] and without outlet, the only one comparable to those of the western trough being [[Lake Turkana]] or Basso Norok.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A short distance east of this rift-valley is [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] — with its two peaks Kibo and Mawenzi, the latter being {{convert|5889|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the culminating point of the whole continent&amp;nbsp;— and [[Mount Kenya]], which is {{convert|5184|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Hardly less important is the [[Ruwenzori Range]], over {{convert|5060|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which lies east of the western trough. Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys, some of the Kirunga (Mfumbiro) group, north of Lake Kivu, being still partially active.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This could cause most of the cities and states to be flooded with lava and ash.

The third division of the higher region of Africa is formed by the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent, little of its surface falling below {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while the summits reach heights of 4400 m to 4550 m. This block of country lies just west of the line of the great East African Trough, the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the Red Sea. There is, however, in the centre a circular basin occupied by [[Lake Tsana]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Both in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast, the Ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the Red Sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower. The most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Adamawa, etc.), where heights of {{convert|1800|to|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} are reached. Exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the Cameroon, on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south-west, has a height of {{convert|4075|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while Clarence Peak, in [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]], the first of the line of islands, rises to over {{convert|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Towards the extreme west the Futa Jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers, but beyond this, as far as the Atlas chain, the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Plains==
Much of Africa is made up of plains of the [[pediplain]] and [[etchplain]] type often occurring as steps.&lt;ref name=Guillocheauetal2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coltortietal2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coltorti |first1=M. |last2=Dramis |first2=F.|last3=Ollier |first3=C.D.|author-link3=Cliff Ollier |date=2007 |title=Planation surfaces in Northern Ethiopia |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=89 |issue= |pages=287–296 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The etchplains are commonly associated with [[laterite]] soil and [[inselberg]]s.&lt;ref name=Guillocheauetal2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guillocheau |first1=François  |last2=Simon |first2=Brendan|last3=Baby |first3=Guillaume|last4=Bessin |first4=Paul|last5=Robin |first5=Cécile|last6=Dauteuil |first6=Olivier |date=2017 |title=Planation surfaces as a record of mantle dynamics: The case example of Africa |url= |journal=[[Gondwana Research]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inselberg#Geology|Inselberg]]-dotted plains are common in Africa including [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Åke Sundborg|Sundborg, Å.]], &amp; [[Anders Rapp|Rapp, A.]] (1986).

The area between the east and west coast highlands, which north of 17° N is mainly desert, is divided into separate basins by other bands of high ground, one of which runs nearly centrally through North Africa in a line corresponding roughly with the curved axis of the continent as a whole. The best marked of the basins so formed (the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin) occupies a circular area bisected by the equator, once probably the site of an inland sea.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the [[Sahel]].

The arid region, the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]]&amp;nbsp;— the largest hot desert in the world, covering {{convert|9000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;— extends from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the Red Sea. Though generally of slight elevation, it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to {{convert|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} Bordered N.W. by the Atlas range, to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]; this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the Nile. That river (see below) pierces the desert without modifying its character. The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas range]], the north-westerly part of the continent, between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} broad. From the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the Sahara. The greater part of that now desert region is, indeed, furrowed by old water-channels.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Rivers ==
[[File:Karte der Einzugsgebiete der großen Gewässer Afrikas.png|thumb|350px|Drainage basins of Africa]]
From the outer margin of the African plateaus, a large number of streams run to the sea with comparatively short courses, while the larger rivers flow for long distances on the interior highlands, before breaking through the outer ranges. The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west, or towards the basin of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

To the main African rivers belong: Nile (the longest river of Africa), Congo (river with the highest water discharge on the continent) and the Niger, which flows half of its length through the arid areas. The largest lakes are the following: Lake Victoria (Lake Ukerewe), Lake Chad, in the centre of the continent, Lake Tanganyika, lying between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. There is also the considerably large Lake Malawi stretching along the eastern border of one of the poorest countries in the world -Malawi. There are also numerous water dams throughout the continent: Kariba on the river of Zambezi, Asuan in Egypt on the river of Nile and the biggest dam of the continent lying completely in The republic of Ghana is called Akosombo on the Volta river (Fobil 2003).
The high lake plateau of the [[African Great Lakes]] region contains the headwaters of both the Nile and the [[Congo River|Congo]].

The break-up of [[Gondwana]] in [[Late Cretaceous]] and [[Cenozoic]] times led to a major reorganization of the river courses of various large African rivers including the [[Congo River|Congo]], [[Niger River|Niger]], [[Nile]], [[Orange River|Orange]], [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goudie |first1=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |date=2005 |title=The drainage of Africa since the Cretaceous |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=67 |issue= |pages=437–456 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flowing to the Mediterranean Sea===
The upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighborhood of the equator.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; From there, streams pour eastward into [[Lake Victoria]], the largest lake in Africa (covering over 26,000 square m.), and to the west and north into [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]]. To the latter of these, the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Issuing from there, the Nile flows northward, and between the latitudes of 7 and 10 degrees north it traverses a vast marshy level, where its course is liable to being blocked by floating vegetation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; After receiving the Bahr-el-Ghazal from the west and the [[Sobat River|Sobat]], [[Blue Nile]] and [[Atbarah River|Atbara]] from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] (the chief gathering ground of the flood-water), it separates the great desert with its fertile watershed, and enters the Mediterranean at a vast delta.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Flowing to the Atlantic Ocean===
The most remote head-stream of the Congo is the [[Chambezi River|Chambezi]], which flows southwest into the marshy [[Lake Bangweulu]]. From this lake issues the Congo, known in its upper course by various names. Flowing first south, it afterwards turns north through [[Lake Mweru]] and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa. Traversing this in a majestic northward curve, and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries, it finally turns southwest and cuts a way to the Atlantic Ocean through the western highlands.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The area of the Congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the Amazon, while the African inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but Asia, where the corresponding area is {{convert|1000000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

West of [[Lake Chad]] is the basin of the [[Niger River|Niger]], the third major river of Africa. With its principal source in the far west, it reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the Nile and Congo,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and ultimately flows into the Atlantic&amp;nbsp;— a fact that eluded European geographers for many centuries. An important branch, however&amp;nbsp;— the [[Benue River|Benue]]—flows from the southeast.

These four river basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of North and West Africa&amp;nbsp;— the remainder consists of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams that do not reach the sea.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Of the remaining rivers of the Atlantic basin, the [[Orange River|Orange]], in the extreme south, brings the drainage from the [[Drakensberg]] on the opposite side of the continent, while the Kunene, Kwanza, Ogowe and Sanaga drain the west coastal highlands of the southern limb; the [[Volta River|Volta]], Komoe, Bandama, [[Gambia River|Gambia]] and [[Senegal River|Senegal]] the highlands of the western limb. North of the Senegal, for over {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}} of coast, the arid region reaches to the Atlantic. Farther north are the streams, with comparatively short courses, reaching the Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Atlas mountains.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Flowing to the Indian Ocean===
Of the rivers flowing to the [[Indian Ocean]], the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the [[Zambezi]], whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands. The main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ S 24°22′ E, at an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|abbr=on}}. It flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward. All the largest tributaries, including the Shire, the outflow of [[Lake Nyasa]], flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10° to 12° S. In the southwest, the Zambezi system interlaces with that of the [[Taukhe River|Taukhe]] (or Tioghe), from which it at times receives surplus water. The rest of the water of the Taukhe, known in its middle course as the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans that was formerly centred in [[Lake Ngami]], now dried up.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Farther south, the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] drains a portion of the interior plateau, but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source. The [[Rovuma River|Rovuma]], [[Rufiji River|Rufiji]] and [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]] principally drain the outer slopes of the African Great Lakes highlands.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the [[Horn of Africa|Horn]] region to the north, the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] rivers begin in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. These rivers mainly flow southwards, with the Jubba emptying in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The Shebelle River reaches a point to the southwest. After that, it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain near the Jubba River. Another large stream, the [[Hawash river|Hawash]], rising in the Ethiopian mountains, is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Inland basins===
Between the basins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the Ethiopian plateau, directed chiefly into the lakes in the [[Great Rift Valley]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The largest river is the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo]], which, fed by the rains of the Ethiopian highlands, carries down a large body of water into [[Lake Rudolf]]. The rivers of Africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths, or by cataracts at no great distance upstream. But when these obstacles have been overcome, the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

North of the Congo basin, and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface, is the basin of [[Lake Chad]] – a flat-shored, shallow lake filled principally by the [[Chari River|Chari]] coming from the southeast.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Lakes==
The principal lakes of Africa are situated in the African Great Lakes plateau. As a rule, the lakes found within the Great Rift Valley have steep sides and are very deep. This is the case with the two largest of the type, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the latter with depths of {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}}.

Others, however, are shallow, and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season. Such are [[Lake Rukwa]], in a subsidiary depression north of Nyasa, and Eiassi and Manyara in the system of the Great Rift Valley. Lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth, the deepest sounding in [[Lake Victoria]] being under {{convert|90|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Besides the African Great Lakes, the principal lakes on the continent are: [[Lake Chad]], in the northern inland watershed; [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu]] and [[Lake Mweru|Mweru]], traversed by the head-stream of the Congo; and [[Lake Mai-Ndombe]] and Ntomba (Mantumba), within the great bend of that river. All, except possibly Mweru, are more or less shallow, and Lake Chad appears to be drying up.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Divergent opinions have been held as to the mode of origin of the African Great Lakes, especially [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea, dating from a time when the whole central Congo basin was under water; others holding that the lake water has accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence. The former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type. They include jellyfish, molluscs, prawns, crabs, etc.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Islands==
With the exception of [[Madagascar]], the African islands are small. Madagascar, with an area of {{convert|587041|km2|abbr=on}}, is, after [[Greenland]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Borneo]], the fourth largest island on the Earth.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It lies in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the S.E. coast of the continent, from which it is separated by the deep [[Mozambique channel]], {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} wide at its narrowest point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.zoom-maps.com/ Physical map of Africa] by National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt; Madagascar in its general structure, as in flora and fauna, forms a connecting link between Africa and southern Asia. East of Madagascar are the small islands of [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; There are also islands in the Gulf of Guinea on which lies the Republic of Sao Tomé and Príncipe (islands of São Tomé and Príncipe). Part of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is lying on the island of Bioko (with the capital Malabo and the town of Lubu) and the island of Annobón. [[Socotra]] lies E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui. Off the north-west coast are the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Cape Verde]] archipelagoes. which, like some small islands in the Gulf of Guinea, are of volcanic origin.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The [[South Atlantic Islands]] of [[Saint Helena]] and [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] are classed as Africa but are situated on the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] half way to [[South America]].

[[File:Africa map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Africa map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Lying almost entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south of the equator, Africa does not show excessive variations of temperature.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Africa geography"&gt;{{Cite web| title= Key Elements of Africa’s Geographic Landscape and Climate Patterns| work= [[The Saylor Foundation]]| accessdate= May 4, 2012| url= http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/hist252-1.3-Key-Elements-of-Africa’s-Geographic-Landscape-and-Climate-Patterns.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great heat is experienced in the lower plains and desert regions of North Africa, removed by the great width of the continent from the influence of the ocean, and here, too, the contrast between day and night, and between summer and winter, is greatest. (The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point.)&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Farther south, the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean, and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface, especially in East Africa, where the range of temperature is wider than in the Congo basin or on the Guinea coast.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one, the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone; the south of the continent being narrower than the north, the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall. The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation. In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation, the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after. It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
[[File:Africa FebAug.gif|thumb|width=220|left|Vegetation in February and August]]
The rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west. Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world. The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of [[Mount Cameroon]], where there is a mean annual rainfall of about {{convert|10000|mm|0|abbr=on}} as compared with a mean of {{convert|11600|mm||0|abbr=on}} at [[Cherrapunji]], in [[Meghalaya]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone, where the sun is vertical at half-yearly intervals, become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics, where the sun is overhead but once. Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges, and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in [[Egypt]] as the [[khamsin]], on the Mediterranean as the [[sirocco]], it is called on the Guinea coast the [[harmattan]]. This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result. Similar dry winds blow from the [[Kalahari Desert]] in the south. On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Health==
The [[climate of Africa]] lends itself to certain environmental diseases, the most serious of which are: [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[yellow fever]]. Malaria is the most deadly environmental disease in Africa. It is transmitted by a genus of mosquito ([[anopheles mosquito]]) native to Africa, and can be contracted over and over again. There is not yet a vaccine for malaria, which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in Africa. Recently, the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria.

Yellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to Africa. Unlike malaria, it cannot be contracted more than once. Like chicken pox, it is a disease that tends to be severe the later in life a person contracts the disease.&lt;ref name= "Africa geography"/&gt;

Sleeping sickness, or African trypanosomiasis, is a disease that usually affects animals, but has been known to be fatal to some humans as well. It is transmitted by the [[tsetse fly]] and is found almost exclusively in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)| work= World Health Organization| url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs259/en/| accessdate= May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disease has had a significant impact on African development not because of its deadly nature, like Malaria, but because it has prevented Africans from pursuing agriculture (as the sleeping sickness would kill their livestock).&lt;ref name= "Africa geography"/&gt;

==Extreme points==
These are the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location on the continent.

[[File:Un-guinea.png|thumb|650px|A map showing [[List of cities in Guinea|Guinea's cities]] and [[Administrative divisions of Guinea|administrative divisions]].]]
[[File:LocationGuinea.svg|thumb|Location of Guinea]]

[[Guinea]] is a country on the coast of West Africa and is bordered by [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], and [[Sierra Leone]].

Guinea is divided into four geographic regions: [[Maritime Guinea]] (Lower Guinea) a [[coastal plain]] running north to south behind the coast; the pastoral [[Fouta Djallon]] highlands ([[Middle Guinea]]); the northern [[savanna]] ([[Upper Guinea]]); and a southeastern rain-forest region ([[Forest Guinea]]).

==Location==
Guinea is in western [[Africa]], bordering the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], between [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. Its [[geographic coordinates]] are {{coord|11|00|N|10|00|W|type:country}}. Guinea's total area is 245,857&amp;nbsp;km², comprising 245,717&amp;nbsp;km² of land and 140&amp;nbsp;km² of water.

Guinea's land boundaries span a total of 4,046&amp;nbsp;km: with [[Ivory Coast]] 816&amp;nbsp;km, [[Guinea-Bissau]] 421&amp;nbsp;km, [[Liberia]] 590&amp;nbsp;km, [[Mali]] 1,062&amp;nbsp;km, [[Senegal]] 363&amp;nbsp;km, and [[Sierra Leone]] 794&amp;nbsp;km. It has a 320-km coastline, and claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}, with a territorial sea of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}.

==Climate==
[[File:Guinea Topography.png|thumb|450px|Guinea's topography.]]

The coastal region of Guinea and most of the inland have a tropical climate, with a [[monsoon]]al-type rainy season lasting from April to November, relatively high and uniform temperatures, southwesterly winds, and high humidity.

The capital [[Conakry]]'s year-round average high is {{convert|29|C|F|1}}, and the low is {{convert|23|C|F|1}}. Conakry's average annual rainfall is {{convert|4300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Sahelian Upper Guinea has a shorter rainy season and greater daily temperature variations. There is a dry season (December to May) with northeasterly [[harmattan]] winds.

== Rivers and water ==
{{Further|List of rivers of Guinea}}

The [[Niger River]], the [[Gambia River]], and the [[Senegal River]] are among the 22 West African rivers that have their origins in Guinea.

==Ecoregions==
* [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] covers most of the country, covering most of Maritime Guinea and Upper Guinea, as well as the lower elevations of the Fouta Djallon. It extends north into Guinea Bissau and Senegal, and east though Mali and Ivory Coast.
* [[Western Guinean lowland forests]] occupies the southwestern portion of Maritime Guinea around Conakry, and Forest Guinea, along with coastal Sierra Leone, Liberia, and western Ivory Coast.
* [[Guinean montane forests]], cover the Fouta Djallon and [[Guinea Highlands]] of southeast Guinea above 600 meters elevation.
* [[Guinean mangroves]], in the coastal estuaries. Enclaves extend north into Guinea Bissau, Gambia and Senegal, and southeast through Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast.

==Resources and environment==

The country's natural resources include [[bauxite]], [[iron ore]], [[diamond]]s, [[gold]], [[uranium]], hydropower, fish, and salt. It has 12.21% arable land, and 2.85% of the land is permanent crops. 949.2&amp;nbsp;km² (2003) of land is irrigated.  Guinea's total renewable water resources total 226&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Environmental issues ===
Current environmental issues in Guinea include: [[deforestation]]; inadequate supplies of potable water; [[desertification]]; soil contamination and erosion; and [[overfishing]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] in forest regions.  Poor [[mining]] practices have led to environmental damage.

Guinea is party to the following international environmental agreements: [[Biodiversity]], [[Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, [[Law of the Sea]], Ozone Layer Protection, [[Ship Pollution]], Wetlands, Whaling.

== Terrain ==

Its terrain is generally flat coastal plain, hilly to mountainous interior. The country's lowest point is the Atlantic Ocean (0 m), and highest is [[Mont Nimba]] (1,752&amp;nbsp;m).

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Guinea]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – the northern section of the border with [[Senegal]], [[Boké Region]]*.
* Easternmost point – the [[confluence]] of the Gben river and the Férédougouba river on the border with [[Ivory Coast]], [[Nzérékoré Region]].
* Southernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Liberia]] immediately south of the village of Gonon, [[Nzérékoré Region]].
* Westernmost point –  Ile du Noufrage, [[Boké Region]].
* Westernmost point (mainland) – the point at which the border with [[Guinea-Bissau]] enters the Rio Compony estuary.
* *''Note: Guinea does not have a northern-most point, this section of the border being formed by a straight [[latitudinal]] line''

The '''International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements''' ('''IFOAM - Organics International''') is the worldwide [[umbrella organization]] for the [[organic agriculture]] movement, which represents close to 800 affiliates in 117 countries.&lt;ref name="ifoam.bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoam.bio/en/about-us-1|title=About us - IFOAM|website=www.ifoam.bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It declares its mission is to, "Lead, unite and assist the organic movement in its full diversity." and vision is the "worldwide adoption of ecologically, socially and economically sound systems, based on the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]]".&lt;ref name="ifoam.bio"/&gt;

Among its wide range of activities, the federation maintains an [[organic farming]] standard, and an [[Organic certification|organic accreditation and certification]] service.

== History ==
[[Image:Photo rasit-pertev.jpg|right|thumb|300px| [[Raşid Pertev|Rașit Pertev]], Secretary of the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]], was a keynote speaker at the 2014 Organic World Congress in Istanbul, Turkey.]]

IFOAM - Organics International began in Versailles, France, on November 5, 1972, during an international congress on organic agriculture organized by the French farmer organization ''[[:fr:Nature et progrès|Nature et Progrès]]''. The late Roland Chevriot, President of ''Nature et Progrès'', took the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://infohub.ifoam.org/sites/default/files/page/files/founding_letter.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901000719/http://infohub.ifoam.org/sites/default/files/page/files/founding_letter.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ifoam&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Paull| first1 = John| year  = 2010| title = From France to the World: The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM)| trans_title  = | journal  = Journal of Social Research &amp; Policy| volume  = 1| issue  = 2| pages = 93-102| url  = http://orgprints.org/18808/1/Paull2010IfoamJSRP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 5 founding members&lt;ref name=ifoam/&gt; representing different organizations: [[Lady Eve Balfour]] representing the [[Soil Association]] of Great Britain, Kjell Arman representing the Swedish Biodynamic Association, Pauline Raphaely representing the Soil Association of South Africa, Jerome Goldstein representing [[Rodale Press]] of the United States, and Roland Chevriot representing ''Nature et Progrès'' of France.

The aim of the new organization was reflected in the name: ''International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements''. The founders hoped that the federation would meet what they saw as a major need: a unified, organized voice for organic food, and the diffusion and exchange of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and linguistic boundaries. In 2015 the name of changed to IFOAM - Organics International.

The General Assembly of IFOAM - Organics International serves as the foundation of the organization. It elects the World Board of IFOAM - Organics International for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifoam.org/sites/default/files/page/files/ifoam_directory_2013_dragged.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The World Board is a diverse group of individuals working voluntarily to lead IFOAM - Organics International. The current World Board was elected at the General Assembly of IFOAM in Istanbul which took place in October 2014. The World Board appoints members to official committees, working groups and task forces based upon the recommendation of the membership of IFOAM - Organics International. Member organizations also establish regional groups and sector specific interest groups.

=== IFOAM - Organics International and Standards and Certification ===
'''
'''''The Organic Guarantee System (OGS) of IFOAM - Organics International is designed to a) facilitate the development of organic standards and third-party certification worldwide and to  b) provide an international guarantee of these standards and organic certification.''''''
''ÀÀÀ
In recent years the OGS approach of IFOAM - Organics International underwent some significant changes. With the establishment and spreading of organic standards and certification around the world a number of new challenges appeared. Especially smallholder farmers in developing countries struggle with a) the multitude of standards they are expected to farm conform with and b) with high certification costs and considerable administrative expenditures.

IFOAM - Organics International had a breakthrough in the development and adoption of approaches to address these certification problems. The organization now directs special focus on the promotion of two new concepts:

====IFOAM Family of Standards====

In the framework of a multi-year collaboration IFOAM - Organics International developed together with his UN partners: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), a set of standard requirements that functions as an international reference to assess the quality and equivalency of organic standards and regulations.  It is known as the COROS (Common Objectives and Requirements of Organic Standards)
The vision is that the Family of Standards will contain all organic standards and regulations equivalent to the COROS. Instead of assessing each standard against each other the Family of Standards can be used as a tool to simplify equivalence assessment procedures while ensuring a high level of integrity and transparency. 
The Family of Standard Program started in January 2011. One year later about 50 standards worldwide are approved.

====[[Participatory Guarantee Systems PGS]]====

''Participatory Guarantee Systems are locally focused quality assurance systems. They certify producers based on active participation of stakeholders and are built on a foundation of trust, social networks and knowledge exchange''”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifoam.bio/sites/default/files/pgs_definition_in_different_languages.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  (Definition of IFOAM - Organics International, 2008).

Participatory Guarantee Systems represent an alternative to third party certification, especially adapted to local markets and short supply chains. They can also complement third party certification with a private label that brings additional guarantees and transparency. PGS enable the direct participation of producers, consumers and other stakeholders in:
:* the choice and definition of the standards
:* the development and implementation of certification procedures
:* the certification decisions
For many organic farmers, particularly in developing countries and emerging organic markets, third party certification is often difficult to access. PGS provides an alternative option that takes some burden from the farmers and is crucially linked to local products and local markets.

====Accreditation and  IOAS====

IFOAM - Organics International also offers organic accreditation to certification bodies. 
Certifiers can have their processes audited against the IFOAM Accreditation Requirements. IOAS, an IFOAM - Organics International daughter company set up in 1997, offers the IFOAM Accreditation (analyses of standards and verification process) or the Global Organic System Accreditation (analyses of verification process only) and grants special recognition of credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioas.org/information-center/frequently-asked-questions/|title=Category: Frequently Asked Questions «  IOAS|website=www.ioas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document ISO/IEC 17011: ‘Conformity assessment – General requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies’ lays down internationally agreed rules for how accreditation should be performed. Various national bodies verify this accreditation including the US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioas.org/who-supervises-the-ioas/|title=Who supervises the IOAS?|date=9 February 2013|publisher=|access-date=2013-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911155955/http://www.ioas.org/who-supervises-the-ioas/|archive-date=2015-09-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IFOAM - Organics International and GMOs ===

On October 19, 1998, participants at the 12th Scientific Conference of IFOAM - Organics International issued the [[Mar del Plata]] Declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifoam.bio/sites/default/files/page/files/ifoam-ge-position.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005200921/http://www.ifoam.bio/sites/default/files/page/files/ifoam-ge-position.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs) in food production and agriculture. From that point [[GMOs]] have been categorically excluded from organic farming.

Text of the declaration:

:We, the undersigned participants at the 12th Scientific Conference of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) at Mar del Plata, Argentina, call on governments and regulatory agencies throughout the world to immediately ban the use of genetic engineering in agriculture and food production since it involves:

:* Unacceptable threats to human health
:* Negative and irreversible environmental impacts
:* Release of organisms of an un-recallable nature
:* Removal of the right of choice, both for farmers and consumers
:* Violation of farmers' fundamental property rights and endangerment of their economic independence
:* Practices, which are incompatible with the principles of sustainable agriculture as defined by IFOAM

Signed by: Dr. [[Vandana Shiva]] (India), Hervé La Prairie (Outgoing IFOAM - Organics International president, France), Linda Bullard (Incoming IFOAM - Organics International president, USA/Belgium), Gunnar Rundgren (Incoming IFOAM - Organics International vice-president, Sweden), Gerald Hermann (IFOAM - Organics International Treasurer, Germany), Pipo Lernoud (Conference Coordinator, Argentina), Guillermo Schnitman (MAPO President, Argentina)

=== IFOAM - Organics International and training ===

Organic agriculture can contribute to meaningful socio-economic and [[ecologically sustainable development]], especially in poorer countries. On one hand, this is due to the application of organic principles, which means efficient management of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, the market for organic products – at local and international level – has tremendous growth prospects and offers creative producers and exporters in the South excellent opportunities to improve their income and living conditions. IFOAM - Organics International is therefore active to give special support to the development of the Organic Agriculture Sector in Developing Countries through several means. Organic Agriculture is a very knowledge intensive production system. Therefore, capacity building efforts play a central role in this regard. There are many efforts all around the world regarding the development of training material and the organization of training courses related to Organic Agriculture. Existing knowledge is still scattered and not easy accessible. Especially in Developing Countries this situation remains an important constraint for the growth of the organic sector.

Domeyko spent most of his life, and died, in his adopted country, [[Chile]].

After a youth passed in [[partitioned Poland]], Domeyko participated in the Polish [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] against the [[Russian Empire]]. Upon its suppression, he was forced into exile and spent part of his life in France (where he had gone with fellow [[Philomaths|Philomath]], Polish poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]]) before eventually settling in [[Chile]], of which he became a [[citizenship|citizen]].

He lived some 50 years in Chile and made major contributions to the study of that country's [[geography]], [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]]. His observations on the circumstances of poverty-stricken [[miners]] and of their wealthy [[Exploitation of labour|exploiters]] had a profound influence on those who would go on to shape [[Chile]]'s [[labor movement]].

Domeyko is seen as having had close ties to several countries and thus in 2002, when [[UNESCO]] organized a series of commemorations of the 200th anniversary of his birth, he was referred to as "a citizen of the world".&lt;ref name="msz"&gt;[http://www.msz.gov.pl/files/file_library/42/20020527a_7146.doc CULTURAL BULLETIN 21 (165)], Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Algimantas Grigelis' preface to the book "Ignotas Domeika/Ignacy Domeyko 1802 - 1889, Ignacy Domeyko - A Citizen of the World [http://www.unesco.lt/print?pid=168]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - scroll down for English translation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Krakowskie Przedmiescie 64, Warsaw.JPG|thumb|left|125px|''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście|Krakowskie Przedmieście 64]]'', [[Warsaw]], with plaque commemorating Domeyko]]
[[File:Domeyko plaque, Warsaw.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Plaque commemorating the "distinguished son of the [[Poland|Polish nation]] and eminent citizen of [[Chile]]"]]
Domeyko was born at a manor house located within the then [[Russian partition]] of the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], at [[Niedźwiadka Wielka]] ({{lang-be|Мядзьведка}} — Miadzviedka) Manor (Bear Cub Manor) near Nieśwież ([[Nesvizh]]), [[Minsk Governorate]], [[Imperial Russia]] (now [[Karelichy]] district, [[Belarus]]). The Domeyko family held the [[Polish heraldry|Polish coat of arms]] ''Dangiel''. His father, Hipolit Domeyko, who was president of the local land court ({{lang-pl|sąd ziemski}}), died when Ignacy was seven years old; his uncles then served as his guardians.&lt;ref name=blgov&gt;{{cite web|title=Ignaсy Domeyko|url=http://archives.gov.by/eng/index.php?id=734159|accessdate=2009-09-02|publisher=Government of [[Belarus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth he was a subject of the [[Russian Empire]]. Domeyko, however, had been brought up in the culture of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a multicultural state whose educated and dominant classes had spoken Polish as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' and that, shortly before Domeyko's birth, had been dismembered in the [[partitions of Poland|partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. For this reason, and because Domeyko subsequently spent most of his life in [[Chile]], he is considered a person of national importance to [[Poles]], [[Belarusians]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}, [[Lithuanians]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and [[Chileans]].

Domeyko enrolled at [[Vilnius University]], then known as the Imperial University of Vilna, in 1816 as a student of mathematics and physics.&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt; He studied under [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]]. Involved with the [[Philomaths]], a secret student organisation dedicated to Polish culture and the restoration of Poland's independence, he was a close friend of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. In 1823–24, during the investigation and trials of the Philomaths, Domeyko and Mickiewicz spent months incarcerated at Vilnius' Uniate Basilian monastery.
[[File:Domeyko y esposa.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Domeyko; wife, Enriqueta Sotomayor y Guzmán, 1854]]
After participating in the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]], in which Domeyko served as an officer under General [[Dezydery Chłapowski]], in 1831 Domeyko was forced into [[exile]] in order not to face [[Russia]]n reprisals.

Journeying through Germany, he arrived in France, where he would earn an engineering degree at Paris' ''[[École des Mines]]'' (School of Mining). He also studied at the [[Sorbonne]] and maintained his political engagements with Belarusians, Poles, and Lithuanians.&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt;
[[File:BustoDomeyko.JPG|thumb|left|120px|Bust of Domeyko, [[University of Chile]]]]
In 1838 Domeyko left for [[Chile]]. There he made substantial contributions to [[mineralogy]] and the technology of mining, studied several previously unknown [[minerals]], advocated for the [[civil rights]] of the native tribal peoples, and was a [[meteorologist]] and [[ethnographer]]. He is also credited with introducing the [[metric system]] to Latin America.&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt;

He served as a professor at a mining college in [[Coquimbo]] ([[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]]) and after 1847 at the [[University of Chile]] (''Universidad de Chile'', in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]), of which he was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] for 16 years (1867–83).&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt;&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt;
[[File:Ignacio Domeyko e hijos.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Domeyko, sons]]
Domeyko gained Chilean citizenship in 1849, but declared at the time that "I may now never change my citizenship, but God grants me hope that wherever I may be—whether in the  [[Cordillera]]s or in [the [[Vilnius]] suburb of] [[Paneriai]]—I shall die a Lithuanian."&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;UNESCO.

In 1884 Domeyko returned for an extended visit to Europe and remained there until 1889, visiting his birthplace and other places in the former Commonwealth, as well as Paris and Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt;

In 1887 he was awarded an [[Doctor honoris causa|honorary doctorate]] by the [[Jagiellonian University]], in [[Kraków]].&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt;

In 1889, soon after returning to Santiago, Chile, Domeyko died.&lt;ref name=blgov/&gt;

[[File:TumbaDomeyko.JPG|thumb|120px|Domeyko's tomb, [[Santiago, Chile]]]]
Named for Domeyko are the mineral ''[[domeykite]]'', the shellfish ''[[Nautilus domeykus]]'', the genus ''[[Domeykosaurus]]'', the ammonite ''[[Amonites domeykanus]]'', [[asteroid]] ''[[2784 Domeyko]]'', the ''[[Cordillera Domeyko]]'' mountain range in the [[Andes]], and the [[Chile]]an town of ''[[Domeyko, Chile|Domeyko]]''.

A bronze bust of Domeyko stands in the ''Casa Central'' of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago's]] [[University of Chile]], of which Domeyko was long-time [[Rector (academia)|rector]].

In 1992, a plaque in Spanish and [[Polish language|Polish]] was placed on a building at ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście|Krakowskie Przedmieście 64]]'', in [[Warsaw]], Poland, commemorating the "distinguished son of the Polish nation and eminent citizen of Chile."

On the 200th anniversary of his birth, [[UNESCO]] declared 2002 to be "Ignacy Domeyko Year."&lt;ref name="msz"/&gt; Several commemorative events were held in Chile under the auspices of Polish President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] and Chilean President [[Ricardo Lagos]].

In 2002, Poland and Chile jointly issued a [[postage stamp]] commemorating the 200th anniversary of Domeyko's birth.

Also in 2002, a 200th-birthday plaque honoring him was placed in the entry gate to Vilnius' [[Eastern Catholic churches|Uniate]] [[Basilian monk|Basilian monastery]], where he and [[Adam Mickiewicz]] were held in 1823–24 during the investigation and trials of the [[Philomaths]].

In 2015 a [[Belarus]]ian climber Pavel Gorbunov placed a memorial plate on the top of Cerro Kimal in [[Cordillera Domeyko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.belaruspartisan.org/life/293857/ | title=В чилийских Кордильерах почтили память Игната Домейко | publisher=Belarus Partizan | date=2015-02-02 | accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ilium''' is a fictitious town in eastern [[New York (state)|New York]] state, used as a setting for many of [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novels.

The name most likely refers to [[Troy, New York]] ("''Ilium''" was the name the Romans gave to ancient [[Troy]]), although Troy is mentioned as a separate city in ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Player Piano, Ch. 1, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In all other respects, Ilium very closely resembles [[Schenectady, New York]], with the fictional [[Iroquois]] River standing in for the real [[Mohawk River]], which flows west–east through Schenectady. The Ilium Works is in roughly the same geographic location as the [[General Electric]] plant in Schenectady, where Vonnegut worked as a public relations writer. Still, the city of Ilium is quite clearly distinct from Schenectady, as characters in ''Player Piano'', ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', and ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' refer to Schenectady as a separate place. Besides, Schenectady is in a real sense divided into three parts as in ''Player Piano'': Schenectady proper, [[Scotia, New York|Scotia]] across the Mohawk River, and [[Niskayuna, New York|Niskayuna]].

[[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]], longtime residence of Vonnegut's character [[Kilgore Trout]], is in the vicinity of Ilium, and of the real towns that inspired it.

In Vonnegut's ''[[Galápagos (novel)|Galápagos]]'', Mary Hepburn was a high school teacher in Ilium, and in ''[[Cat's Cradle (novel)|Cat's Cradle]]'', it is the former home of Dr. Felix Hoenikker&amp;mdash;one of the fathers of the atomic bomb&amp;mdash;thus, it is the town that John visits to interview Dr. Asa Breed, Hoenikker's former supervisor. In ''Player Piano'', it is where most of the action takes place. In ''Slaughterhouse-Five'', it is also the home town of the book's primary protagonist, [[Billy Pilgrim]]. Ilium is also where the events of the short story "Ed Luby's Key Club" (from "Look at the Birdie") take place.

[[File:Homann, Johann Baptist (1664-1725).jpg|thumb|Johann Homann]]
'''Johann Baptist Homann''' (20 March 1664 – 1 July 1724) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]] and [[cartography|cartographer]], who also made maps of the [[Americas]].

== Life ==
Homann was born in Oberkammlach near [[Kammlach]] in the [[Electorate of Bavaria]]. Although educated at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school, and preparing for an ecclesiastical career, he eventually converted to [[Protestantism]] and from 1687 worked as a [[civil law notary]] in [[Free Imperial City of Nuremberg|Nuremberg]]. He soon turned to [[engraving]] and cartography; in 1702 he founded his own publishing house.

Homann acquired renown as a leading German cartographer, and in 1715 was appointed Imperial Geographer by Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. Giving such privileges to individuals was an added right that the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] enjoyed. In the same year he was also named a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]]. Of particular significance to cartography were the imperial [[printing patent|printing privileges]] ([[Latin]]: ''privilegia impressoria''). These protected for a time the authors in all scientific fields such as printers, [[copper]] engravers, map makers and publishers. They were also very important as a recommendation for potential customers.

In 1716 Homann published his masterpiece ''Grosser Atlas ueber die ganze Welt'' (Grand Atlas of all the World). Numerous maps were drawn up in cooperation with the engraver [[Christoph Weigel the Elder]], who also published ''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]''.

Homann died in Nuremberg in 1724. He was succeeded by his son Johann Christoph (1703-1730).  The company carried on upon his death as ''Homann heirs'' company, managed by Johann Michael Franz and Johann Georg Ebersberger.  After subsequent changes in management the company folded in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tooley's Dictionary of Mapmakers, Revised edition, volume 2|last=French|first=Josephine|publisher=Early World Press|year=2001|isbn=0906430194|location=Riverside, CT|pages=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was known as "Homann Erben", "Homanniani Heredes", or "Heritiers de Homann" abroad.

The '''Jukskei River'''&lt;ref name="JukseiRiver"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Exact location of Juksei River|publisher=Open Street Map|url=http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2679538}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the largest [[river]]s in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. It is the southernmost river in the [[Crocodile River (West)]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/iwqs/rhp/eco/FROC/WMA3CrocMarico.jpg Crocodile/Marico WMA 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course==
The Jukskei begins in [[Ellis Park Stadium|Ellis Park]] in Johannesburg. Its original spring was on the former Doornfontein farm, which measured at 18,000 liters per hour, but has since disappeared under subsequent urban development.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Christie, Sean|date=3 January 2014|title=Searching for the soul of the Jukskei|newspaper=Mail and Guardian|location=South Africa|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-01-02-searching-for-the-soul-of-the-jukskei|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103215935/http://mg.co.za/article/2014-01-02-searching-for-the-soul-of-the-jukskei|archivedate=3 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now the first surface expression of the Jukskei is in [[Bertrams, Gauteng|Bertrams]] at the intersection of Queen Street and Sports Avenue where it emerges from a storm drain. From there the river flows through Bezuidenhout Valley and is dammed in Bruma. It then meanders in a northerly direction through [[Bedfordview]] and [[Edenvale, Gauteng|Edenvale]] before flowing through [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra Township]]. It then turns northwest and flows through Modderfontein, [[Buccleuch, Gauteng|Buccleuch]], Leeuwkop Prison, [[Lone Hill]], Dainfern and Steyn City before joining the [[Crocodile River (Limpopo)]] outside Lanseria.&lt;ref name="Christie" /&gt;

==Tributaries==

The Jukskei River is joined by numerous streams along its course with its major tributaries being the [[Modderfontein Spruit]], [[Braamfontein Spruit]] and [[Klein Jukskei River]]. The Jukskei River provides the largest amount of water, by discharge, into the [[Crocodile River (Limpopo)]] Basin.&lt;ref name="Christie" /&gt;

==Character==
{{stack|[[File:South Africa-Johannesburg-Jukskei river-002.jpg|thumb|A South African girl sitting on a log next to the Jukskei River]]}}
The Jukskei is mostly shallow and not deep enough for transportation. It is also heavily [[water pollution|polluted]] by [[urban runoff]]. Lack of infrastructure maintenance has let raw waste flow into the river on a daily basis. [[Cholera]]-causing bacteria have occasionally been found in the river.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Cholera-found-in-Jukskei-river-20010118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/cholera-found-in-city-river-438069&lt;/ref&gt;  The river receives a large inflow from the Northern Waste Water Treatment Plant in northern [[Johannesburg]]. The Jukskei River is one of the largest contributing factors of the [[eutrophication]] problems facing [[Hartbeespoort Dam]] further down stream. Tons of waste such as plastic, metal and rubber flow down the river annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2001/010119145p1001.htm |title=Statement by minister Ronnie Kasrils, Minister of water affairs and forestry |publisher=South African Government |author= |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604093758/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2001/010119145p1001.htm |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/2001/01/19/southafrica/CHOLERA.HTM |title=Cholera found in Alexandra's Jukskei River |publisher=Daily Dispatch |author= |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313092320/http://www.dispatch.co.za/2001/01/19/southafrica/CHOLERA.HTM |archivedate=2007-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This spells disaster for the [[squatter|impoverished residents]] of the [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra Township]] who often build makeshift [[Shanty town|shacks]] along the river banks owing to overcrowding and the need for access to water for washing, drinking, and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2016-11-10-still-no-shelter-for-alex-flood-victims-foreign-nationals-search-for-lost-documents|title=Still no shelter for Alex flood victims, foreign nationals search for lost documents|last=Pather|first=Ra'eesa|newspaper=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and sporting significance==
The Jukskei traditionally demarcated the boundary between the ''Northern Transvaal'' and ''Transvaal'' for sporting purposes,&lt;ref name="Ltd1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris van Rensburg Publications (Pty) Ltd|title=Transvaal: the Golden Province|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X21BAQAAIAAJ|year=1992|publisher=C. van Rensburg Publications|isbn=978-0-86846-065-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teams like the [[Titans (cricket team)|Titans cricket team]] and [[Blue Bulls]] (formerly ''Northern Transvaal'') continue to be headquartered in Pretoria, north of the Jukskei.

'''''Jus sanguinis''''' ({{lang-la|right of blood}}) is a principle of [[nationality law]] by which [[citizenship]] is not determined by place of birth but by having one or both parents who are citizens of the state. Children at birth may automatically be citizens if their parents have state citizenship or national identities of ethnic, cultural, or other origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjqWJCE7JQUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Dora |last=Kostakopoulou |title=The Future Governance of Citizenship |pages=26–27 |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship can also apply to children whose parents belong to a [[diaspora]] and were [[Right of return|not themselves citizens]] of the state conferring citizenship.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This principle contrasts with ''[[jus soli]]'' (Latin: ''right of soil'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/birthright_comparativepaper.pdf |last1=Vink |first1=Maarten Peter |last2=de Groot |first2=Gerard-René |date=November 2010 |title=Birthright Citizenship: Trends and Regulations in Europe |location=Florence |publisher=European University Institute |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern development ==
At the end of the 19th century, the French-German debate on nationality saw the French, such as [[Ernest Renan]], oppose the German conception, exemplified by [[Johann Fichte]], who believed in an "objective nationality", based on [[heredity|blood]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[language]]. Renan's [[republicanism|republican]] conception, but perhaps also the presence of a German-speaking population in [[Alsace-Lorraine]], explains France's early adoption of ''jus soli''.

=== Mixed standards ===
Many nations have a mixture of ''jus sanguinis'' and ''jus soli'', including the [[United States nationality law|United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gansallo|first1=Ayodele|last2=Bernstein-Baker|first2=Judith|title=Understanding Immigration Law and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9781454850380|page=570|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u90uDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA570|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian nationality law|Canada]], [[Israeli nationality law|Israel]], [[Greek nationality law|Greece]], the [[Irish nationality law|Republic of Ireland]], and recently [[German nationality law|Germany]]. Today [[French nationality law]] narrowly applies ''jus sanguinis,'' but it is still the most common means of passing on citizenship in many [[Continental Europe|continental European]] nations.

=== Complications due to imposed boundaries ===
Some modern European states which arose out of the dissolved [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires have huge numbers of ethnic populations outside of their new 'national' boundaries, as do most of the [[former Soviet states]]. Such long-standing diasporas do not conform to codified 20th-century European rules of citizenship.

In many cases, ''jus sanguinis'' rights are mandated by international treaty, with citizenship definitions imposed by the international community. In other cases, minorities are subject to legal and extra-legal persecution and choose to immigrate to their ancestral home country. States offering ''jus sanguinis'' rights to ethnic citizens and their descendants include [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]]  and [[Romania]]. Each is required by international treaty to extend those rights.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

*{{flag|Germany|name}}: Article 116(1) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] confers, within the confines of the laws regulating the details, a right to citizenship upon any person who is admitted to Germany (in its borders of 1937) as "refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such a person." At one time, ethnic Germans living abroad in a country in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] (Aussiedler) could obtain citizenship through a virtually automatic procedure.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Federal Expellee Law]] ({{lang-de|Bundesvertriebenengesetz}}), §&amp;nbsp;6, specifies that also foreign citizens of states of the Eastern Bloc (and their desdendants), who were persecuted between 1945 and 1990 for their German ethnicity by their respective governments, are entitled to become Germans. The argument was that the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] had to administer to their needs because the respective governments in charge of guaranteeing their equal treatment as citizens severely neglected or contravened that obligation.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 the law has been steadily tightened to limit the number of immigrants each year. It now requires immigrants to prove language skills and cultural affiliation. Article 116(2) entitles persons (and their descendants), who were denaturalised by the Nazi government, to be renaturalised if they wish. Those among them who took their residence in Germany after May 8, 1945, are automatically to be considered as Germans. Both regulations, (1) and (2), provided for a considerable group of Poles and Israelis, residing in Poland and Israel, who are concurrently Germans.
*{{flag|Haiti|name}}: Every child born to a Haitian father or mother, no matter where he or she was born, is Haitian by the Haitian Constitution. This has been a big issue in the current Dominican nationality law; because of this and other factors, illegal migrants' children born in the DR of Haitian origin are considered non-Dominicans, and therefore Haitians.
*{{flag|Hungary|name}}: A person acquires Hungarian citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a Hungarian citizen. The place of birth is irrelevant.  Furthermore, Section 4(3) of the Act on Nationality permits ethnic Hungarians (defined as persons "at least one of whose relatives in ascendant line was a Hungarian citizen") to obtain citizenship on preferential terms after one year of residence. In addition, the "Status Law" of 2001 grants certain privileges to ethnic Hungarians living in territories that were once part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. It permits them to obtain an identification card but does not confer the right to full Hungarian citizenship. According to the latest Citizenship Law adopted in 2010, anybody, possessing certain evidences (certificates, documents) of his or her Hungarian roots from around the World can apply for Hungarian citizenship. The interview is led in Hungarian either in Hungary or at one of the Consulates abroad.
* {{flag|Iceland|name}}: [[Icelandic nationality law]]
*{{flag|India|name}}: A child born in India must have at least one parent who is an Indian citizen to be conferred citizenship. Earlier, people born in India were given citizenship regardless of the citizenship held by parents, but this was changed on 3 December 2004. Persons with at least one Indian grandparent may apply for a [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Person of Indian Origin]] card, provided that neither the applicant nor any ancestor has ever been a citizen of [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Afghanistan]], or [[China]]. The government may add other countries to the list. This card is a travel document and permits the holder to enter and stay in India without a visa, work, start a business, own land, and attend educational institutions, but it does not give the right to vote or hold office. In addition, persons of Indian origin who are nationals of countries not on the list may apply for [[Indian nationality law#Overseas citizenship of India|Overseas citizenship of India]], which confers similar rights and also permits the holder to apply for full Indian nationality after one year of residence.
*{{flag|Ireland|name}}: Under [[Irish nationality law]], any person with an Irish grandparent can become an Irish citizen by being registered in the Foreign Births Register at an Irish embassy or consular office, or at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin. Such an individual may also pass his entitlement to Irish nationality on to his children by registering in the Foreign Births Register, provided he or she registered as an Irish citizen with the Foreign Births Register before the birth of those children. The minister may also waive the usual requirements for naturalisation as an Irish citizen for those of "Irish descent or Irish associations" although this power is rarely used.
*{{flag|Iran|name}}: According to the [[Iranian nationality law]] the following persons are considered to be Iranian subjects: (1) All persons residing in Iran except those whose foreign nationality is established; the foreign nationality of such persons is considered to be established if their documents of nationality have not been objected to by the Iranian Government. (2) Those born in Iran or outside whose fathers are Iranian. (3) Those born in Iran of unknown parentage.(4)Persons born in Iran of foreign parents, one of whom was also born in Iran. (5) Persons born in Iran of a father of foreign nationality who have resided at least one more year in Iran immediately after reaching the full age of 18; in other cases their naturalization as Iranian subjects will be subject to the stipulations for Iranian naturalization laid down by the law. (6) Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband. (7) Every foreign national who has obtained Iranian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.princeton.edu/irandataportal/laws/institutionsgovernance/nationality-law/ |title=Nationality Law: Article 976 |work=Iran Data Portal: Princeton University |year=2015 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Kenya: According to Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 a person becomes a citizen by birth if on the day of the person birth either parent is a citizen of Kenya
*{{flag|Malta|name}}: [[Maltese nationality law]] grants citizenship to any person descended from "an ascendant who was born in Malta of a parent who was also born in Malta."
*{{flag|Mexico|name}}  The Mexican Constitution (Article 30) indicates that Mexicans are also persons born abroad, to a parent or parents who at that time were Mexicans born in Mexican territory. Also, a person born abroad is also Mexican, if at the time of birth either or both parents were Mexicans by naturalization. Mexico’s Constitution considers them Mexicans by birth.
* {{flag|Norway|name}}: [[Norwegian nationality law]]
* {{flag|Nigeria|name}}: According to the [[Constitution of Nigeria|Nigerian Constitution]], Chapter 3, section 25 1C
*{{flag|Philippines|name}}: The [[Philippine nationality law]] is based upon the principles of jus sanguinis (Latin: right of blood) and therefore descent from a parent who is a citizen or national of the [[Republic of the Philippines]] is the primary method of acquiring Philippine citizenship.
*{{flag|Poland|name}}: The definition of Polish citizenship has been based for years on article 34 of the Polish Constitution; this article is based on a '''jus sanguinis''' right to citizenship.&lt;ref name="Poland"&gt;English [http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm translation] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kMEKJXyM?url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm |date=7 October 2009 }} of the [[Constitution of Poland|Polish Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, any child born by Polish parent(s) is a ''de jure'' citizen of Poland. In 1967–1968 the Communist State issued to Jews emigrating from Poland to Israel, instead of passports, a so-called travel document which granted them the right to exit Poland but not of re-entering it, in effect taking away their Polish citizenship on the assumption that, in emigrating or traveling to Israel, they renounced it themselves. In a 2005 verdict, the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland]] ruled that this action was illegal based on the state of law at that time. Consequently, it is now assumed the Jews who emigrated after 1968 have remained Polish citizens and their citizenship will be certified on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/124944/Emigrantom-z-1968-roku-zostana-zwrocone-obywatelstwa/ |title=Emigrantom z 1968 roku zostaną zwrócone obywatelstwa |trans-title=Polish citizenship reinstated to emigrants from 1968 |work=[[Wprost]] |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2015 |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|Romania|name}}: [[Romanian nationality law]]
*{{flag|Slovakia|name}}: Persons with at least one Slovak grandparent and "Slovak cultural and language awareness" may apply for an expatriate identity card entitling them to live, work, study and own land in Slovakia. Expatriate status is not full citizenship and does not entitle the holder to vote, but a holder who moves his or her domicile to Slovakia may obtain citizenship under preferential terms.  Slovakia grants full Slovak citizenship to children of Slovak parents (one or both parents) irrespective of the place of birth.
*{{flag|South Korea|name}}: [[South Korean nationality law]]
* {{flag|Sweden|name}}: [[Swedish nationality law]]
*{{flag|Switzerland|name}}: [[Swiss nationality law#Jus sanguinis|Swiss nationality law]] is exceptionally restrictive: someone who was born in Switzerland and has spent their entire life there has no automatic right to Swiss citizenship if neither of their parents are Swiss citizens, even if their parents are permanent residents or have themselves spent their entire lives in Switzerland. In fact, the citizenship criteria are simpler for a foreigner with no previous ties to Switzerland who marries a Swiss citizen, than for people born and raised in Switzerland but with foreign parents. Due to Switzerland's [[Immigration to Switzerland|high immigrant population]], there are more than a million people who were born and have spent their entire lives in Switzerland but are not Swiss citizens due to their parents being immigrants. Some Swiss-born third-generation immigrants even have Swiss-born parents but are not Swiss citizens if neither of their parents have naturalised. To obtain Swiss citizenship, people in this position must undergo [[Swiss nationality law#Naturalisation|naturalisation proceedings]], which have a high bar to satisfy the "integration" criterion. The unusual rules hit international headlines in 2017 when a woman born in Switzerland to [[Turkey|Turkish]] parents, who is a native [[Swiss German|Swiss-German]] speaker and has spent her entire life in Switzerland, had her citizenship application denied by the local municipality on "integration" grounds as she could not name enough Swiss mountains, cheeses and retail brands, and was deemed not to have gone skiing often enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/aarau/das-einbuergerungs-protokoll-diese-92-fragen-musste-funda-yilmaz-beantworten-131524081|title=Das Einbürgerungs-Protokoll: Diese 92 Fragen musste Funda Yilmaz beantworten|work=az Aargauer Zeitung|access-date=2018-04-06|language=de-CH|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406232859/https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/aargau/aarau/das-einbuergerungs-protokoll-diese-92-fragen-musste-funda-yilmaz-beantworten-131524081|archive-date=6 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was overruled by the cantonal government several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/naturalisation-row_decision-to-deny-citizenship-to-turkish-woman-reversed/43609038|title=Decision to deny citizenship to Turkish woman reversed|last=agencies|first=swissinfo.ch and|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407053402/https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/naturalisation-row_decision-to-deny-citizenship-to-turkish-woman-reversed/43609038|archive-date=7 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Swiss voters in a nationwide [[Swiss referendums, 2017|referendum]] agreed to relax the citizenship criteria for third-generation immigrants: although they will still not be Swiss citizens at birth and will need to apply for citizenship, they will no longer have to take naturalisation tests or interviews if their parents ''and'' grandparents are long-time permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38947518|title=Swiss vote for relaxed citizenship laws|date=2017-02-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616002429/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38947518|archive-date=16 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20170212/Federal-Decree-on-the-Simplified-Naturalisation-of-Third-Generation-Immigrants.html|title=Federal Decree on the Simplified Naturalisation of Third-Generation Immigrants|last=Council|first=The Federal|website=www.admin.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406230728/https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/20170212/Federal-Decree-on-the-Simplified-Naturalisation-of-Third-Generation-Immigrants.html|archive-date=6 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Thailand|name}}: [[Thai nationality law]]
*{{flag|Tunisia|name}}: When one of the parents is Tunisian, a child is considered Tunisian regardless of the child’s place of birth or whether the child has acquired the nationality of another country. Children with at least one Tunisian parent, no matter where they are born, are considered Tunisian citizens, and must travel to and from Tunisia only with a Tunisian passport.
*{{flag|Ukraine|name}}: Article 8 of the Law on Citizenship of Ukraine permits any person with at least one Ukrainian grandparent to become a citizen upon renunciation of the former nationality.
*{{flag|United Kingdom|name}}: By birth abroad, which constitutes "by descent" if one of the parents is a British citizen otherwise than by descent (for example by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the UK). British citizenship by descent is only transferable to one generation down from the parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, if the child is born abroad.
*{{flag|United States|name}}: [[United States nationality law]] states that a child born abroad is given United States citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen or national, subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/us-citizenship/Acquisition-US-Citizenship-Child-Born-Abroad.html|title=Acquisition of U.S. Citizenship by a Child Born Abroad|author=|date=|website=travel.state.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leges sanguinis states today ==
Many countries provide citizenship on preferential terms to individuals with ethnic ties to these countries (so-called ''leges sanguinis''):
*{{flag|Afghanistan|name}}: Connection to the Afghan diaspora. There have been controversial proposals to people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin.
*{{flag|Armenia|name}}: Article 14 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Armenia]] (1995) provides that "individuals of Armenian origin shall acquire citizenship of the Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/am00000_.html |title=Constitution of the Republic of Armenia |work=International Constitutional Law Project |date=5 July 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is consistent with the [[Declaration on Independence of Armenia]], issued by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Armenia in 1989, which declared at article 4 that "Armenians living abroad are entitled to the citizenship of the Republic of Armenia".
*{{flag|Bulgaria|name}}: Article 25 of the 1991 constitution specifies that a "person of Bulgarian origin shall acquire Bulgarian citizenship through a facilitated procedure." Article 15 of the Law on Bulgarian Citizenship provides that an individual "of Bulgarian origin" (ethnicity) may be naturalized without any waiting period and without having to show a source of income, knowledge of the Bulgarian language, or renunciation of his former citizenship. This approach has been a tradition since the new constitutional foundation of Bulgaria in 1879, following the liberation from Ottoman yoke in 1878, when large numbers of ethnic Bulgarians remained outside of the state borders. Bulgaria and Greece were subject to a population exchange following the [[Second Balkan War]]. The conditions of the treaty settlement mandated that they accept individuals claiming respective ethnic origin.
*{{flag|Croatia|name}}: Article 11 of the Law on Croatian Citizenship allows emigrants and their descendants to acquire Croatian nationality upon return, without passing a language examination or renouncing former citizenship. In addition, Article 16 allows ethnic Croats living outside Croatia to "acquire Croatian citizenship" by making a written declaration and by submitting proof of attachment to Croatian culture.
*{{flag|Finland|name}}: Finnish law provides a [[right of return]] to ethnic Finns from the former Soviet Union, including [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]]. Applicants must now pass an examination in one of the official languages of the country, Finnish or Swedish. Certain persons of Finnish descent who live outside the former Soviet Union also have the right to establish permanent residency, which would eventually entitle them to qualify for citizenship.
*{{flag|Greece|name}}: Ethnic Greeks can obtain Greek citizenship by two methods under the Code of Greek Nationality. Article 5 allows ethnic Greeks who are stateless (which, in practice, includes those who voluntarily renounce their nationality) to obtain citizenship upon application to a Greek consular official. In addition, ethnic Greeks who join the armed forces acquire automatic citizenship by operation of Article 10, with the military oath taking the place of the citizenship oath. This position arises from the fact that approximately 85% of known ethnic Greeks were outside the boundaries when the country was formed, and 40% remained outside the final boundaries at the beginning of [[World War I]]. Most were ''de jure'' stripped of their host country citizenship with the outbreak of war if the host country was at war with Greece. In the late 19th century, Greece had a wider diaspora because of poverty and limited opportunities.
*{{flag|Ireland|name}} While the child or a grandchild of an Irish citizen parent is automatically Irish, Section 16(a) of the [[Irish nationality law|Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act]] permits the Minister of Justice, at their discretion, to waive the residence requirements for a person "of Irish descent or associations".
*{{flag|Israel|name}}: The [[Law of Return]] offers citizenship to any Jew (see [[Who is a Jew?#Law_of_Return|Who is a Jew under the Law of Return?]]) wishing to immigrate. Exceptions can be made for those considered by the Minister of Interior to be a threat to the welfare or security of the state. Israeli law also recognizes the descendants of Israeli emigrants living abroad as Israelis; this applies only to the first generation born abroad. Non-jews can become naturalized after five years' of residency and acquisition of a basic knowledge of [[Hebrew]].
*{{flag|Italy|name}}: The [[Italian nationality law|nationality law of Italy]] bestows citizenship ''jure sanguinis''. There is no limit of generations for the citizenship via blood. However, the first citizens of the modern Italian state were alive on 17 March 1861 when the state was officially formed, and for this reason all claims of Italian citizenship by jure sanguinis must stem from an ancestor who was living after 16 March 1861. Each descendant of the ancestor through whom citizenship is claimed ''jure sanguinis'' could pass Italian citizenship to the next generation only if this descendant was entitled to Italian citizenship at the time of the birth of the next person in the line. So if any person in the line lost the Italian citizenship and then had a child, that child did not inherit Italian citizenship ''jure sanguinis'', except if the child could inherit the citizenship from the other parent. Cases of dual citizenship were possible, which is to say, for example, that a person in the line could have had Italian and Canadian citizenship concurrently. Minor children of Italian citizens were at risk of losing Italian citizenship if the child's parent naturalized in another country, unless the child was subject to an exception to this risk—and children born and residing in a country where they held dual citizenship by [[jus soli]] were subject to such an exception since 1 July 1912.  Until 1 January 1948, Italian law did not generally permit women to pass on citizenship. Persons born before that date are in most cases not Italian citizens ''jure sanguinis'' if their line of descent from an Italian citizen depends on a female at some point before 1948.  On several occasions, this limitation of deriving Italian citizenship only from fathers before 1948 has been successfully challenged in court.
*{{flag|Kiribati|name}}: Articles 19 and 23 of the constitution provides, "Every person of I-Kiribati descent... shall... become or have and continue to have thereafter the right to become a citizen of Kiribati.... Every person of I-Kiribati descent who does not become a citizen of Kiribati on Independence Day... shall, at any time thereafter, be entitled upon making application in such manner as may be prescribed to be registered as a citizen of Kiribati."
*{{flag|Liberia|name}}: the [[Constitution of Liberia|Liberian constitution]] allows only [[Negro]]s (regardless of cultural or national affiliation) to become citizens, though people of other races may live in Liberia as permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analysis of the Aliens and Nationality Law of the Republic of Liberia|ssrn = 1795122|date = 2009-05-01|location = Rochester, NY|first = Jessie|last = Tannenbaum|first2 = Anthony|last2 = Valcke|first3 = Andrew|last3 = McPherson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Lithuania|name}}: The Constitution of Lithuania grants a right to citizenship to foreigners of ethnic Lithuanian origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/lh00000_.html |title=Constitution of Lithuania: Article 32(4) |work=International Constitutional Law Project |date=25 October 1992 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Rwanda|name}}: The Rwandan constitution provides that "[a]ll persons originating from Rwanda and their descendants shall, upon their request, be entitled to Rwandan nationality."
*{{flag|Serbia|name}}: Article 23 of the 2004 citizenship law provides that the descendants of emigrants from Serbia, or ethnic Serbs residing abroad, may take up citizenship upon written declaration.
*{{flag|Spain|name}}: A Spanish law passed in 2015 allows individuals who can prove descent from the [[Sephardic Jews]] who were exiled in 1492 following the [[Alhambra Decree]] and who can show a "special link" to Spain to apply for dual citizenship. Spain had previously allowed application for such individuals but had required that they give up their citizenship from their other country. The new law has no such requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-spain-sephardic-jews-20151001-story.html|title=Welcome home, 500 years later: Spain offers citizenship to Sephardic Jews|first=Henry|last=Chu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|South Korea|name}}: [[South Korean nationality law]] grants special status to ethnic [[Koreans]] and their descendants in the [[Korean diaspora]]. Under the [[Constitution of South Korea]], North Korea is part of Republic of Korea. Therefore, North Korean citizens are also recognized as South Korean nationals. All North Koreans of good conduct are granted citizenship upon arrival to South Korea.
*{{flag|Turkey|name}}: Turkish law allows persons of Turkish origin and their spouse and children, to apply for naturalization without the five-year waiting period applicable to other immigrants. Turkey and Greece reciprocally expelled their minorities in the early 1920s after World War I.  They were mandated by international treaty to accept incoming populations as citizens based on ethnic background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7518">This is a '''list of [[F.C. Copenhagen]]'s managers''' and their records, from 1992, when the team was founded, to the present day.

==History==
{{details|History of F.C. Copenhagen}}
The first manager of F.C. Copenhagen was [[Benny Johansen]], who was manager of one of the mother clubs, [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]], before 1992. Johansen has sat the position twice: the first period ended in 1994, but later same year he substituted [[Keld Kristensen]], who only received 8 matches with the team.

==Records==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2011}}
There have been eight different permanent and two caretaker managers of FCK since 1992; one of the caretakers ([[Kim Brink]]) has managed the club in three separate spells. The longest-running manager in terms of time is [[Hans Backe]] (2001–2005), who also is the longest-running in terms of games. The only two persons, who has managed FCK, that isn't from Scandinavia is [[Roy Hodgson]] and [[Ariël Jacobs]]. The most successful permanent manager was [[Kent Karlsson]], in terms of percentage of wins with 55.38%, while [[Christian Andersen (footballer)|Christian Andersen]] is FCK's least successful (0.00%). Andersen is also the shortest-running permanent manager of FCK, and received only a single match, before he was fired.

==Managers==
''As of 28 May 2017. Only competitive matches are counted. Wins, losses and draws are results at the final whistle; the results of [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]] are not counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nipserstat.dk | title=Nipserstat |author1=Lindemann, Klaus V.  |author2=Mohr, Henrik  |lastauthoramp=yes|language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt;''

The following is a '''List of atmospheric pressure records in Europe''' and the extratropical Northern Atlantic (it does not include localised events, such as those that occur in tornados).

Extreme pressure values in Europe show both seasonal and geographical differentiation. the greatest pressure extremes occur in winter (January) with the deepest lows occurring to the northwest of the continent with a diminishing influence of low pressure to the southeast towards Central Europe and Southeast Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=edited by John E.|title=Encyclopedia of world climatology|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht, Netherlands|isbn=978-1402032646|edition=Reprinted with corrections.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-mwbAsxpRr0C&amp;pg=PA361&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=high+pressure+european+russia#v=onepage&amp;q=high%20pressure%20european%20russia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the main cyclonic centre of the [[Icelandic low]], and the North Atlantic extratropical storm track, close to which have been observed some of the lowest atmospheric pressures of the Northern Hemisphere outside the tropics. Extreme high values are favoured over the north east of Europe where intense cold and long winter nights lead to cooling of the air column by [[radiative cooling]] causing sinking air reinforcing the development of the highest pressures. Other influences include the semi-permanent [[Azores high]], and [[Siberian high]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsson|first1=Markus|title=Extrema lufttryck i Europa och Skandinavien 1881-1995|journal=Masters Thesis|date=1996|url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=2061247&amp;fileOId=2206386|accessdate=30 September 2015|trans-title=Extreme air pressure in Europe and Scandinavia 1881-1995|publisher=Lund University|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the United Kingdom, the [[Met Office]] record the record figures for atmospheric pressure (which are nominally since 1870) as:
* '''Highest air pressure''': 31 January 1902, [[Aberdeen]] Scotland 1053.6 hPa.
* '''Lowest air pressure''': 26 January 1884, [[Ochtertyre]] Scotland 925.6 hPa.

Though the lowest pressure may be second to the [[Night of the big wind]] low, which saw a value of {{convert|27.25|inHg|hPa}} at [[Sumburgh Head]], Shetland on non-calibrated, non-standard equipment 6–7 January 1839, with the mainland at [[Cape Wrath]] reporting an observed pressure of {{convert|27.32|inHg|hPa}}.&lt;ref name="Shields" /&gt;

On 26 January 1884, during the Ochtertyre storm the [[Ben Nevis]] summit weather station recorded a low pressure of 784.7 hPa (at high altitude (above 750 m) and not reduced to sea level) this is proposed as being almost certainly the lowest surface pressure ever recorded in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan|title=Huge weather rescue project under way|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42175307?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_weather&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=news_central|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though due to altitude and not being a value reduced to sea level is not considered comparable to the other records presented here.

A low pressure of 914.0mb affected the UK during the Braer Storm on 10 January 1993, however this figure is discounted as this reading was not recorded in the UK.

In the period of instrumental measurement the atmospheric pressure has exceeded 1048 hPa somewhere over the United Kingdom and Ireland on 17 occasions.&lt;ref name="Burt2007b" /&gt; On nine of these times, the pressure exceeded 1050 hPa—a value not exceeded since 1957 in Ireland, and since 26 January 1932 over the UK.&lt;ref name="Burt2007b" /&gt; Intense high pressure is usually seen during midwinter with 7 of the 9 occasions where 1050 hPa has been exceeded occurring in January.&lt;ref name="Burt2007b" /&gt;

Pressure values have been recorded to have exceeded 1050 hPa in all areas of the UK and Ireland except south east England, though values close to this are documented from January 1882 and January 1905.&lt;ref name="Burt2007b" /&gt;

:* '''Low pressure''', Two or three (possibly four) non-tropical areas of low pressure with central low pressure over the North Atlantic below 920 hPa have been reported, with a further unverified instance during the [[Night of the Big Wind]] (see above), these represent globally the lowest non-tropical large-scale synoptic values.

Similarly low extra-tropical values elsewhere have only been documented near Antarctica, with 919 hPa observed at [[Casey Station]] on the [[Windmill Islands]] (just outside the Antarctic Circle) on August 8–9, 1976 at [[Vincennes Bay]] ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=66___S_110___E 66°17’S 110°31’E]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassardo|first1=Claudio|title=Very low minima of extratropical cyclones in North Atlantic|url=https://claudiocassardo.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/very-low-minima-north-atlantic/|accessdate=18 June 2016|date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this value is considerably lower than any other on record and could conceivably be a fault with the recording instrument, though values are internally consistent with readings below 940 mb at this time.&lt;ref name="WUBurt"/&gt;

==Local Councils==
Some flags had been used prior to the creation of local councils in 1993. The coats of arms of the local councils are officially recognised, however the flags are not and thus a number of variants exist. Since 1993, a new local council, [[Mtarfa]], has been created, and the local councils of [[Attard]], [[Birżebbuġa]], [[Floriana]], [[Kalkara]], [[Lija]], [[Mellieħa]], [[Mġarr]], [[Mosta]], [[Nadur]], [[Naxxar]], [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], [[Qrendi]], [[Siġġiewi]], [[Xgħajra]] and [[Żebbuġ, Malta|Żebbuġ]] have changed their flags and coats of arms. Some, such as Mosta, had minor differences, but others, like Xgħajra changed the arms completely.

[[File:Ludogorie Sunset Iz2.JPG|thumb|Sunset over southern Ludogorie]]
The '''Ludogorie''' ({{lang-bg|Лудогорие}}, usually used with a definite article, Лудогорието, ''Ludogorieto'') or '''Deliorman''' (Делиорман, {{lang-tr|Deliorman}}), all meaning "region of mad forests" (Bulgarian: lud - "mad", "crazy" and gora - "forest"), is a region in northeastern [[Bulgaria]] stretching over the plateau of the same name. Major cities in the region are [[Razgrad]], [[Novi Pazar, Bulgaria|Novi Pazar]], [[Pliska]] and [[Isperih]]. Part of the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], the region is hilly in the east, reaching up to {{convert|485.70|m|ft}} in height near the village of [[Samuil (village)|Samuil]], but merges with the plains of [[Dobruja]] and the [[Danube]] to the north, with the lowest point near [[Yuper]] ({{convert|39.14|m|ft|abbr=on}}). The region is bordered to the west by the [[Provadiya River]] and the [[Rusenski Lom|Beli Lom]]; to the east it transitions into the [[Dobruja]] plateau.

The plateau was formed of [[Karst]] [[limestone]] from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] covered by [[loess]] material. Among the region's geological resources are [[kaolinite]], [[fireclay]] and [[mica]]. The climate is temperate [[continental climate|continental]], with up to {{convert|650|mm|in}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] yearly. Although the Ludogorie is poor in overground water resources, with only a few low rivers such as the Krapinets and the Kulak, it is rich in underground waters. 

In ancient times, the Ludogorie was inhabited by the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes of the [[Getae]] who left behind local architectural landmarks such as the [[Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari]], a richly-decorated 3rd-century BC tomb that is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Until the end of the 18th century, the Ludogorie was largely dominated by forests that merged with the ones of the [[Balkan Mountains]] (''Stara Planina'') to the south, giving the name of the region both in Bulgarian and Turkish, literally translated as "region of wild forests" in [[English language|English]]. In recent times, the forests have been nearly completely replaced by [[arable land]] and only the woods in the [[Voden Reserve]] are the reminiscent of the former larger forest area. The soil from the chopped down forests is a rich soil with [[humus]], very eligible for agriculture.

''Ludogorie'' is a relatively new name, a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[calque]] of the older Turkish name ''Deliorman''; it was officially introduced in 1950. In 1942, the name had been changed to ''Polesie'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Енциклопедия "България"|publisher=Българска академия на науките|location=София|date=1982|volume=Т. 3. И-Л|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Slavic [[toponym]] meaning "place by the woods", but this name never entered common use. The Turkish name is etymologically and semantically akin to the name of [[Teleorman County]] in southern [[Romania]].

The Ludogorie mostly belongs to [[Razgrad Province]], with a western part in [[Ruse Province]], and has a mixed population of [[Bulgarians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Romani people|Romani]]. The Ludogorie has attained fame for its [[Yağlı güreş|oil wrestlers]] throughout the time, including [[Koca Yusuf]] and [[Hergeleci Ibrahim]].

[[Ludogorie Peak]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] bears the name of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarmarbin.be/gazetteer.php?p=details&amp;id=14472|title=Composite Antarctic Marine Gazetteer Placedetails: Ludogorie Peak|publisher=SCAR-MarBIN Portal|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad]], the football club of Razgrad, was also named after the Ludogorie region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2679">[[Image:Thailand Nakhon Suvarnabhumi.png|right|Map of Thailand highlighting the location of the proposed province]]
'''Nakhon Suvarnabhumi''' ({{lang-th|นครสุวรรณภูมิ}}) was a proposed new province of [[Thailand]] in the southeast of [[Bangkok]] around the [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|new Bangkok airport]]. It is planned to cover the districts [[Lat Krabang]] and [[Prawet]] of Bangkok and [[King Amphoe Bang Sao Thong|Bang Sao Thong]] and [[Amphoe Bang Phli|Bang Phli]] of [[Samut Prakan Province]], an area of 521&amp;nbsp;km² with about 462,000 residents.

The proposal was announced in October 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/18/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_18900651.html The Nation, October 18, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322124919/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/18/headlines/index.php?news=headlines_18900651.html |date=March 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a draft bill approved by the cabinet in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=22732 Cabinet approves plan for Maha Nakhon Suvarnabhumi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311083320/http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=22732 |date=2007-03-11 }}, Thai News Agency, June 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to the bill, for the first four years the province will be run by a governor appointed by the Interior Ministry and supervised by a 30-member administrative board chaired by the prime minister. After the four years the administrative board will be dissolved, but the final administrative structure of the province is not yet set. It is planned to become a special administrative zone, probably having an elected governor like Bangkok. A final bill was scheduled to be submitted after the [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006|political crisis of 2006]], however after the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|coup d'état]] it has become quiet about the project.

The establishment of a new province and the further development of the area around the airport have been criticized by several groups, most notably the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority. The previously unsettled areas are used as part of the flood-prevention system of Bangkok, which may be compromised by further urbanization in that area. The plan also found negative response in surveys among the local population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=30031044&amp;date=2007-04-04 The Nation, April 4 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was finally withdrawn by a resolution of the cabinet dated 3 April 2007.

A '''nullah''' or '''nulla''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|نلہ}}}} or "nallah" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) is an 'arm of the sea', [[stream]], or [[watercourse]], a steep narrow [[valley]].  Like the [[wadi]] of the [[Arabs]], the nullah is characteristic of mountainous or hilly country where there is little rainfall.

In the drier parts of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], and in many parts of [[Australia]], there are small steep-sided valleys penetrating the hills, clothed with rough brushwood or small trees growing in the stony soil.  During occasional heavy rains, torrents rush down the nullahs and quickly disappear.  There is little local action upon the sides, while the bed is lowered, and consequently these valleys are narrow and steep.  In cities on the [[Delhi]] plain in India, nullahs are concrete or brick-lined ditches about {{convert|3|m|0}} deep and {{convert|6|m}} wide, used to divert [[monsoon]] rain away from the cities.

In  [[East Asia]], a nullah ({{zh|c=明渠}}) refers to an open, usually concrete-lined [[channel (geography)|channel]] designed to allow rapid drainage of storm precipitation or industrial wastewater from high ground, to prevent flooding of urbanised coastal areas.&lt;ref name=FYI&gt;{{cite news|title=FYI: Why do some Hong Kong street names seem to have no connection to the area they are in?|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/623667/fyi-why-do-some-hong-kong-street-names-seem-have-no-connection-area-they-are|date=January 20, 2008|accessdate=January 8, 2014|first=Jason|last=Wordie|page=10|newspaper=South China Morning Post}} '''{{subscription required}}'''&lt;/ref&gt;  It basically is a [[canal]] that is dry most of the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10908">[[Image:OblateSpheroid.PNG|250px|right|thumb|Flattened sphere]]{{Geodesy}}
In [[geodesy]], a '''reference ellipsoid''' is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the [[geoid]], the truer [[figure of the Earth]], or other planetary body.
Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which [[geodetic network]] computations are performed and point coordinates such as [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[elevation]] are defined.

In the context of standardization and geographic applications, a ''geodesic reference ellipsoid'' is the mathematical model used as foundation by [[Spatial reference system]] or [[Geodetic datum]] definitions.

== Ellipsoid parameters ==
In 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] in which he included a proof&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Isaac Newton:''Principia'' Book III Proposition XIX Problem III, p. 407 in Andrew Motte translation, available on line at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA239]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}} that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate [[ellipsoid]] of revolution which he termed an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroid]]. Current practice&lt;ref name=torge&gt;Torge, W (2001) Geodesy (3rd edition), published by de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3-11-017072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flattening&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. |title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections | publisher =University of Chicago Press|year=1993|isbn=0-226-76747-7 | page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the word 'ellipsoid' alone in preference to the full term 'oblate ellipsoid of revolution' or the older term 'oblate spheroid'. In the rare instances (some [[asteroid]]s and [[planet]]s) where a more general ellipsoid shape is required as a model the term used is [[Triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial]] (or scalene) ellipsoid. A great many ellipsoids have been used with various sizes and centres but modern (post-[[GPS]]) ellipsoids are centred at the actual [[center of mass]] of the Earth or body being modeled.

The shape of an (oblate) ellipsoid (of revolution) is determined by the shape parameters of that [[ellipse]] which generates the ellipsoid when it is rotated about its minor axis. The [[semi-major axis]] of the ellipse, ''a'', is identified as the equatorial radius of the ellipsoid: the [[semi-minor axis]] of the ellipse, ''b'', is identified with the [[Geographic pole|polar]] distances (from the centre). These two lengths completely specify the shape of the ellipsoid but in practice geodesy publications classify reference ellipsoids by giving the semi-major axis and the ''inverse ''[[flattening]], {{sfrac|''f''}}, The flattening, ''f'', is simply a measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius: 
:&lt;math&gt; f=\frac{a-b}{a}. &lt;/math&gt;
For the [[Earth]], ''f'' is around {{sfrac|300}} corresponding to a difference of the major and minor semi-axes of approximately {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}}. Some precise values are given in the table below and also in [[Figure of the Earth]]. For comparison, Earth's [[Moon]] is even less elliptical, with a flattening of less than {{sfrac|825}}, while [[Jupiter]] is visibly oblate at about {{sfrac|15}} and one of [[Saturn|Saturn's]] triaxial moons, [[Telesto (moon)|Telesto]], is nearly {{sfrac|3}} to {{sfrac|2}}.

A great many other parameters are used in [[geodesy]] but they can all be related to one or two of the set ''a'', ''b'' and ''f''. They are listed in [[ellipse]].

== Coordinates ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
{{main|Latitude|Longitude}}
A primary use of reference ellipsoids is to serve as a basis for a coordinate system of [[latitude]] (north/south), [[longitude]] (east/west), and [[elevation]] (height).
For this purpose it is necessary to identify a ''zero [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]'', which for Earth is usually the [[Prime Meridian]]. For other bodies a fixed surface feature is usually referenced, which for Mars is the meridian passing through the crater [[Airy-0]]. It is possible for many different coordinate systems to be defined upon the same reference ellipsoid.

The longitude measures the rotational [[angle]] between the zero meridian and the measured point. By convention for the Earth, Moon, and Sun it is expressed in degrees ranging from −180° to +180° For other bodies a range of 0° to 360° is used.

The latitude measures how close to the poles or equator a point is along a meridian, and is represented as an angle from −90° to +90°, where 0° is the equator. The common or ''geodetic latitude'' is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference ellipsoid. Depending on the flattening, it may be slightly different from the ''geocentric (geographic) latitude'', which is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the ellipsoid. For non-Earth bodies the terms ''planetographic'' and ''planetocentric'' are used instead.

The coordinates of a geodetic point are customarily stated as geodetic latitude and longitude, i.e., the direction in space of the geodetic normal containing the point, and the height ''h'' of the point over the reference ellipsoid. See [[geodetic system]] for more detail. If these coordinates, i.e., latitude ''ϕ'', longitude ''λ'' and height ''h'', are given, one can compute the ''geocentric rectangular coordinates'' of the point as follows:&lt;ref name="gps-chap10"&gt;{{cite book|title=GPS - theory and practice|author=B. Hofmann-Wellenhof, H. Lichtenegger, J. Collins|isbn=3-211-82839-7|page=282|others=Section 10.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\cos{\lambda} \\
Y &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\sin{\lambda} \\
Z &amp;= \left( \frac{b^2}{a^2} N(\phi) + h\right)\sin{\phi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;N(\phi) = \frac{a^2}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\phi + b^2\sin^2 \phi }},&lt;/math&gt;
and ''a'' and ''b'' are the equatorial radius ([[semi-major axis]]) and the polar radius ([[semi-minor axis]]), respectively. ''N'' is the ''[[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] in the [[prime vertical]]''.

In contrast, extracting ''φ'', ''λ'' and ''h'' from the rectangular coordinates usually requires [[Iterative method|iteration]]. A straightforward method is given in an [[OSGB]] publication&lt;ref name=osgb&gt;A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain. This is available as a pdf document at
[{{cite web |url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/information/coordinatesystemsinfo/guidecontents |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211075826/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/information/coordinatesystemsinfo/guidecontents/ |archivedate=2012-02-11 |df= }}]] Appendices B1, B2&lt;/ref&gt; and also in web notes.&lt;ref name=osborne&gt;Osborne, P (2008). [http://mercator.myzen.co.uk/mercator.pdf The Mercator Projections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118224152/http://mercator.myzen.co.uk/mercator.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }} Section 5.4&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated methods are outlined in [[Geodetic system#From ECEF to geodetic|geodetic system]].

== Historical Earth ellipsoids ==
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
{{Main|Earth ellipsoid#Historical Earth ellipsoids}}
Currently the most common reference ellipsoid used, and that used in the context of the Global Positioning System, is the one defined by [[WGS 84]].

Traditional reference ellipsoids or ''[[geodetic datum]]s'' are defined regionally and therefore non-geocentric, e.g., [[ED50]]. Modern geodetic datums are established with
the aid of [[GPS]] and will therefore be geocentric, e.g., WGS 84.

== Ellipsoids for other planetary bodies ==
Reference ellipsoids are also useful for geodetic mapping of other planetary bodies including planets, their satellites, asteroids and comet nuclei. Some well observed bodies such as the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] now have quite precise reference ellipsoids.

For rigid-surface nearly-spherical bodies, which includes all the rocky planets and many moons, ellipsoids are defined in terms of the axis of rotation and the mean surface height excluding any atmosphere. Mars is actually [[Oval (geometry)|egg shaped]], where its north and south polar radii differ by approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=in}}, however this difference is small enough that the average polar radius is used to define its ellipsoid. The Earth's Moon is effectively spherical, having almost no bulge at its equator. Where possible, a fixed observable surface feature is used when defining a reference meridian.

For gaseous planets like [[Jupiter]], an effective surface for an ellipsoid is chosen as the equal-pressure boundary of one [[Bar (unit)|bar]]. Since they have no permanent observable features, the choices of prime meridians are made according to mathematical rules.

Small moons, asteroids, and comet nuclei frequently have irregular shapes. For some of these, such as Jupiter's [[Io (moon)|Io]], a scalene (triaxial) ellipsoid is a better fit than the oblate spheroid. For highly irregular bodies, the concept of a reference ellipsoid may have no useful value, so sometimes a spherical reference is used instead and points identified by planetocentric latitude and longitude. Even that can be problematic for [[convex set|non-convex]] bodies, such as [[433 Eros|Eros]], in that latitude and longitude don't always uniquely identify a single surface location.

'''Richard Winer''' (May 14, 1925 – October 11, 2016) was an American author of books dealing mainly with mysteries and the [[paranormal]]. 

==Bermuda Triangle==

He is best known for his work on the [[Bermuda Triangle]]: ''The Devil's Triangle'' (1974, Bantam Books), ''The Devil's Triangle 2'' (Bantam Books 1975), and ''From The Devil's Triangle to The Devil's Jaw'' (Bantam Books 1977). He also completed a TV film documentary on the [[Bermuda Triangle|Devil's Triangle]].&lt;ref Name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Rosenberg  | first = Howard L.   | title = Exorcizing the Devil's Triangle  | work = FAQ  | publisher = DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY – NAVAL HISTORICAL CENTER; 805 KIDDER BREESE SE – WASHINGTON NAVY YARD WASHINGTON DC 20374-5060  | date = June 1974  | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-3.htm  | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winer claimed that there were "mysterious" things going on in the Bermuda Triangle but denied any paranormal involvement. He stated that "all the answers lie in human error, mechanical malfunction, freak weather or magnetic anomalies."&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne, Peter. ''Infernal Triangle''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. January 9, 1975. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghosts==

Winer was a [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunter]]. He wrote several books about [[ghost]]s and [[haunted house]]s. His book ''Haunted Houses'' (1979) was co-authored with Nancy Osborn.

'''Rocky Island''' ({{zh|s=石岛|t=石島|p=Shí Dǎo|l=stone island}}; Vietnamese: ''Đảo Đá'') is one of the [[Paracel Islands]] in the [[South China Sea]]. It is under the administration of the [[People's Republic of China]] and guarded by the [[PLA Navy]]. The island is also claimed by [[Taiwan]] and [[Vietnam]].

==Geography==
Until 2016-2017, Rocky Island was connected to [[Woody Island, South China Sea|Woody Island]] by an 800 metre concrete causeway. Land reclamation in 2016-2017 has joined the two islands by a larger area of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recent developments surrounding the South China Sea|url=http://www.startribune.com/recent-developments-surrounding-the-south-china-sea/413544433/|accessdate=31 March 2017|work=Star Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As US-China tussle, Asean frets|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/us-china-tussle-asean-frets-south-china-sea/|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://amti.csis.org/woody-island/ Woody Island], Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A signals intelligence station was built on Rocky Island in 1995, mainly because the island is the highest point in the Paracel Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url= http://www.freeman.org/m_online/bodansky/beijing.htm |title= Beijing's surge for the Strait of Malacca |author=Yossef Bodansky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Australian expert's opinions on Chinese deployment of air defences on Spratly Islands - News VietNamNet |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/marine-sovereignty/151428/australian-expert-s-opinions-on-chinese-deployment-of-air-defences-on-spratly-islands.html |website=english.vietnamnet.vn |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Strait of Dover''' or '''Dover Strait''', historically known as the '''Dover Narrows''' ({{lang-fr|pas de Calais}} {{IPA-fr|pɑ d(ə)‿kalɛ|}} - ''Strait of Calais''); {{lang-nl|Nauw van Kales}} {{IPA-nl|nʌu̯ vɑn kaːˈlɛː|}} or ''Straat van Dover''), is the [[strait]] at the narrowest part of the [[English Channel]], marking the boundary between the Channel and [[North Sea]], separating [[Great Britain]] from [[continental Europe]]. The shortest distance across the strait, {{convert|33.3|km|mi nmi|abbr=off}}, is from the [[South Foreland]], northeast of [[Dover]] in the English county of [[Kent]], to [[Cap Gris Nez]], a [[Headlands and bays|cape]] near to [[Calais]] in the French [[département]] of [[Pas-de-Calais]]. Between these points lies the most popular route for [[English channel#By swimming|cross-channel swimmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Crystal|editor1-first=David|title=Cambridge Paperback Encyclopedia|date=September 28, 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521668002|pages=1080|edition=3rd|language=English|format=paperback|chapter=English Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire strait is within the [[territorial waters]] of France and the United Kingdom, but a right of [[transit passage]] under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS]] exists allowing unrestricted shipping.&lt;ref name="AnaLM"&gt;{{cite book|last1=López Martín|first1=Ana G.|title=International Straits: Concept, Classification and Rules of Passage|date=August 31, 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642129063|page=95 &amp; 102|edition=illustrated|language=English|format=hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarinePB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glegg|first1=G|last2=Jefferson|first2=R|last3=Fletcher|first3=S|editor1-last=Sheppard|editor1-first=Charles|editor2-last=Galgani|editor2-first=Francois|editor3-last=Hutchings|editor3-first=Pat|editor4-last=Quintino|editor4-first=Victor|title=Marine governance in the English Channel (La Manche): Linking science and management|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|date=30 June 2015|volume=95|issue=2|pages=707-718|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.02.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X15001101#b0305|accessdate=19 June 2017|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Jon M.|chapter=Transit Passage Through International Strait|editor1-last=Chircop|editor1-first=Aldo|editor2-last=McDorman|editor2-first=Ted|editor3-last=Rolstons|editor3-first=Susan|title=The Future of Ocean Regime-Building|date=2009|publisher=Brill (1618)|isbn=978-9004172678|pages=175-232|language=English|format=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a clear day, it is possible to see the opposite coastline of England from France and vice versa with the naked eye, with the most famous and obvious sight being the [[white cliffs of Dover]] from the French coastline and shoreline buildings on both coastlines, as well as lights on either coastline at night, as in [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem "[[Dover Beach]]".

==Shipping traffic==
[[File:AIS Manche Est.png|thumb|left|[[Automatic Identification System]] display showing traffic in the strait in 2006]]

Most maritime traffic between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] passes through the Strait of Dover, rather than taking the longer and more dangerous route around the north of [[Scotland]]. The strait is the busiest [[International waterway|international seaway]] in the world, used by over 400 commercial vessels daily.&lt;ref name="MarinePB"/&gt; This has made traffic safety a critical issue, with [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] and the [[Maritime Gendarmerie]] maintaining a 24-hour watch over the strait and enforcing a strict regime of [[shipping lane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-hm_coastguard/channel_navigation_information_service_(cnis).htm The Channel Navigation Information Service (CNIS)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200620/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-hm_coastguard/channel_navigation_information_service_(cnis).htm |date=17 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the intensive east–west traffic, the strait is crossed from north to south by [[ferry|ferries]] linking [[Dover]] to [[Calais]] and [[Dunkirk]].&lt;ref name="MarinePB"/&gt; Until 1994 these provided the only route across it for land transport. The [[Channel Tunnel]] now provides an alternative route, crossing beneath the strait at an average depth of {{cvt|45|m|ft}} below the seabed.

The town of Dover gives its name to one of the sea areas of the British [[Shipping Forecast]].

==Geological formation==&lt;!--[[Goodwin Sands]] and [[Doggerland]] redirect here--&gt;

[[File:Doggerland.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the hypothetical extent of Doggerland (c.&amp;nbsp;10,000&amp;nbsp;BCE), which provided a land bridge between Great Britain and continental Europe]]

The strait is believed to have been created by the [[erosion]] of a land bridge that linked the [[Weald]] in [[Great Britain]] to the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]] in the [[Pas de Calais]]. The predominant geology on both the British and French sides and on the seafloor is [[chalk]]. Although somewhat resistant to erosion, erosion of both coasts has created the famous [[white cliffs of Dover]] in the UK and the [[Cap Blanc Nez]] in France. The [[Channel Tunnel]] was bored through solid chalk.

The [[Rhine]] (as the [[Urstrom]]) flowed northwards into the North Sea as the sea level fell during the start of the first of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Ice Age]]s. The ice created a [[dam]] from [[Scandinavia]] to [[Scotland]], and the Rhine, combined with the [[Thames]] and drainage from much of [[north Europe]], created a vast lake behind the dam, which eventually spilled over the Weald into the [[English Channel]]. This overflow channel became the Strait of Dover about 425,000 years ago. A narrow deep channel along the middle of the strait was the bed of the [[Rhine]] in the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]]. A geological deposit in [[East Anglia]] marks the old [[Rhine#Geologic history|preglacial]] northward course of the Rhine.


[[File:Strait of Dover MODIS.jpg|thumb|left|NASA Satellite image&lt;br /&gt;December 2002]]
A 2007 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Sanjeev|last2=Collier|first2=Jenny S.|last3=Palmer-Felgate|first3=Andy|last4=Potter|first4=Graeme|title=Catastrophic flooding origin of shelf valley systems in the English Channel|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=448|year=2007|page=342–346|doi=10.1038/nature06018|pmid=17637667|issue=7151|bibcode=2007Natur.448..342G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Europe cut adrift|first=Philip|last=Gibbard|page=259–260|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=448|date=19 July 2007|doi=10.1038/448259a|bibcode=2007Natur.448..259G}}&lt;/ref&gt;  concluded the English Channel was formed by erosion caused by two major floods. The first was about 425,000 years ago, when an ice-dammed lake in the southern North Sea overflowed and broke the [[Weald]]-[[Artois]] chalk range in a catastrophic erosion and flood event. Afterwards, the [[Thames]] and [[Scheldt]] flowed through the gap into the English Channel, but the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and Rhine still flowed northwards. In a second flood about 225,000 years ago the Meuse and Rhine were ice-dammed into a lake that broke catastrophically through a high weak barrier (perhaps chalk, or an [[Moraine#End or terminal moraines|end-moraine]] left by the ice sheet). Both floods cut massive flood channels in the dry bed of the English Channel, somewhat like the [[Channeled Scablands]] or the [[Wabash River]] in the USA.
A further update in 2017, attributed a series of previously described underwater holes in the Channel floor -"100m deep" and in places "several kilometres in diameter" to lake water plunging over a rock ridge causing isolated depressions or [[plunge pool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39494740|title=Evidence of ancient 'geological Brexit' revealed|author=Rebecca Morelle|work=BBC News:Science &amp; Environment|date=4 April 2017|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The melting ice and rising sea levels submerged [[Doggerland]], the area linking Britain to France 6,500–6,200 BCE.

The Lobourg strait, a major feature of the strait's seafloor, runs its {{cvt|6|km|0}} wide slash on a NNE–SSW axis. Nearer to the French coast than to the English coast, it runs along the [[Varne Bank|Varne sandbank]] where it plunges to {{cvt|68|m}} at its deepest, and along the latter's south-east neighbour the Ridge bank (French name "''Colbart''"&lt;ref name="seaSeek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sea-seek.com/?geo=1354|title=Pas de Calais – Dover Strait|website=sea-seek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with a maximum depth of {{cvt|62|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/geography/researchprojects/coastview/Offshore/offshore.htm|title=CoastView – What happens offshore?|work=GEOSYNTH-Project|publisher=University of Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marine wildlife ==

[[File:Dover AST 2001073 lrg.jpg|thumb|right|[[NASA]] [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] satellite image, March 2001]]
The submarine depth of the strait varies between {{cvt|68|m}} at the Lobourg strait and {{cvt|20|m}} at the highest banks. It presents a succession of rocky areas relatively deserted by ships wanting to spare their nets, and of sandy flats and [[dune#Sub-aqueous dunes|sub-aqueous dunes]]. The strong currents of the Channel are slowed down around the rocky areas of the strait, with formation of [[wikt:Special:Search/countercurrent|countercurrents]] and calmer zones where many species can find shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfTrDGK3j3w|title=Underwater video of the ridens|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these calmer zones, the water is clearer than in the rest of the strait; thus [[alga]]e can grow despite the {{cvt|30|m}} average depth and help increase diversity in the local species – some of which are [[endemic]] to the strait. Moreover, this is a transition zone for the species of the Atlantic Ocean and those of the southern part of the North Sea.

This mix of various environments promotes a wide variety of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|language=fr|last1=Davoult|first1=D.|last2=Richard|first2=A.|title=Les Ridens, haut-fond rocheux isolé du Pas de Calais : un peuplement remarquable|trans-title=The Ridens, rocky shallows in the center of the Channel: a distinguished settlement|journal=Cahiers de biologie marine|publisher=Station Biologique, Roscoff|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=7856448|volume=29|date=1988|issue=1|page=93–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[:fr:Ridens|Ridens]] de Boulogne'', a {{cvt|10|-|20|m}} deep&lt;ref name=RichessesAAMP/&gt; rocky high ground partially covered with sand located {{cvt|15|nmi}} to the west of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], boasts the highest production of [[maerl]] in the strait.&lt;ref name=RichessesAAMP&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|format=PDF|url=http://www.eptb-bresle.com/userfiles/files/PNM_%203estuaires_Vol1_richesses%20de%20la%20mer.pdf|title=Richesses de la mer|trans-title=Richness of the sea|publisher=Picardy Estuaries and Opal Sea Marine Natural Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{cvt|682|km2}} area of the strait is classified as a [[Natura 2000]] protection zone listed under the name ''[[:fr:Ridens|Ridens]] et dunes hydrauliques du Pas de Calais'' (Ridens and [[dune#Sub-aqueous dunes|sub-aqueous dunes]] of the Dover Strait). This area includes the [[dune#Sub-aqueous dunes|sub-aqueous dunes]] of [[Varne Bank|Varne]], Colbart, Vergoyer and Bassurelle, the ''Ridens de Boulogne'', and the Lobourg channel which provides calmer and clearer waters due to its depth reaching {{cvt|68|m}}.&lt;ref name="natura2000Ridens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inpn.mnhn.fr/site/natura2000/FR3102004|title=Ridens et dunes hydrauliques du Pas de Calais|publisher=Natura 2000|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unusual crossings==
{{details|English channel#Channel crossings}}

Many crossings other than in conventional vessels have been attempted, including by [[pedalo]], [[jetpack]], [[bathtub]], [[amphibious vehicle]] and more commonly by [[human swimming|swimming]]. [[French law]] bans many of these while [[English law]] does not, so most such crossings originate in England.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Ice==
In the late 17th century during the "[[Little Ice Age]]", there were reports of severe winter ice in the Strait of Dover, including a case in 1684 of only a [[League (unit)|league]] of open water remaining between Dover and Calais.&lt;ref&gt;From "The World of Wonders: A Record of Things Wonderful in Nature, Science, and Art ..." (London, 1869); https://archive.org/stream/worldofwondersre00londrich/worldofwondersre00londrich_djvu.txt (search for text "''In 1684 the frost was so severe that nearly all the birds perished;''", and https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005566154&lt;/ref&gt;; see [http://www.pastpresented.info/frost1683.htm] for another report of severe ice in the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;"Notes and Queries" Second Series, volume 11, page 219 (16 March 1861)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''supercorridor''' is a proposed new type of transportation infrastructure in the United States. 

A supercorridor would use swaths of land up to 1,200 feet (370 m) wide to carry parallel links of freeways, rails, and utility lines. The freeway portions would be divided into two separate elements: truck lanes and lanes for passenger vehicles.  Similarly, the rail lines in the corridor would be divided among freight, commuter, and high-speed rail. Services expected to be carried in the utility corridor include water, electricity, natural gas and petroleum, plus [[fiber optic]] lines and other telecommunications services.

Supercorridors bypass traditional national borders instead using [[inland port]]s known as "smartports". Border guards and customs officers would check the cargo at these inland ports.

==Criticism==
Critics of supercorridors complain that existing transportation infrastructure is not being invested in and maintained. Other critics are concerned about the environmental damage which might occur by creating a supercorridor.&lt;ref&gt;

Corsi--"NASCO Alters Super-Corridor Message":] &lt;/ref&gt; Still others are concerned about issues of national and state sovereignty, and the possible increased danger of [[terrorism]], in the rapid transfer of individuals, goods and materials across borders. Acquisition of large swaths of land for such corridors have created questions about [[property rights]] and the use of [[eminent domain]].

'''William Desborough Cooley''' (1795?–1883) was an Irish geographer. Discoveries by European explorers gradually showed that a number of his theories about Central Africa, though strongly held, were incorrect. In other controversies his position is now considered to have had some justification. His major contributions are now seen as relating to source criticism of historical records, the understanding of West Africa, and as a perceptive historian of [[globalisation]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=6201|title=Cooley, William Desborough|first=Roy|last=Bridges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Cooley was born in [[Dublin]], the son of William Cooley, a barrister, and grandson of [[Thomas Cooley (architect)|Thomas Cooley]] the architect.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He studied at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] from 1811 to 1816. He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) of London in 1830, being made an honorary free member in 1864. On the publication of [[Jean Baptiste Douville]]'s ''Voyage au Congo'' in 1832, Cooley wrote an article in the ''[[Foreign Quarterly Review]]'', which was instrumental in exposing the fraud practised by Douville.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Cooley, William Desborough|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Douville incident, Cooley became an influential figure for a time in the RGS. He proposed, working with [[William Fitzwilliam Owen]], a naval expedition to East Africa. One set off under Captain James Alexander, but on calling at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] became involved in the [[Sixth Xhosa War]], was diverted to South-west Africa, and proved financially burdensome for the RGS. Cooley's concrete plans for exploration never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Bridges, ''W. D. Cooley, the RGS and African Geography in the Nineteenth Century: Part I: Cooley's Contribution to the Geography of Eastern Africa'', The Geographical Journal Vol. 142, No. 1 (Mar. 1976), pp. 27–47, at p. 30. Published by: The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1796021&lt;/ref&gt; He also quarrelled with Alexander Maconochie, secretary of the RGS, and undermined his position there. His main achievement in the learned world was the foundation in 1846 of the [[Hakluyt Society]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Cooley held and defended strong views on the geography of Central Africa. He rejected the existence of snow-covered mountains there, even after [[Karl Klaus von der Decken]] and Richard Thornton's return from [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in 1863. In 1864 he was still insisting that [[Lake Nyassa]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]] formed a single body of water.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

A speaker of [[Kiswahili]], which he had learned in London from a [[Zanzibari]], Cooley was for many years supported almost solely by the [[civil list pension]] granted to him in 1859. He died on 1 March 1883.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Cooley wrote, for [[Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia|Lardner's ''Cabinet Cyclopædia'']], ''The History of Maritime and Inland Discovery'', 3 vols. 1830–1.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; This book, a contribution to the [[history of globalisation]], is now considered innovative and influential. It was the first work to have covered seriously the topic of communication between the different parts of the globe, and to have treated "exploration" as a historical process. It was translated into French, Dutch and Italian.&lt;ref name="WithersLorimer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Withers|author2=Hayden Lorimer|title=Geographers: Biobibliographical Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYowyxAHn-sC&amp;pg=PA49|date=21 November 2008|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-3657-2|pages=49–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852 Cooley published ''Inner Africa laid open'', an attempt to trace the major lines of communication across the continent south of the Equator. In this work, relying based on Portuguese and African sources, he maintained that there existed just one great lake in Central Africa, and that the snowy mountains reported by [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] and [[Johannes Rebmann]] were myths.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Cooley contributed to the ''Journal of the Royal Geographical Society'', and wrote a series of controversial articles on African subjects to the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]''. With some treatises on geometry, he also published:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''The Negroland of the Arabs examined and explained; or, an Inquiry into the early History and Geography of Central Africa'', London 1841. This work drew on Cooley's friendship with [[Pascual de Gayangos y Arce]], in finding Arabic sources.&lt;ref name="WithersLorimer2008"/&gt;
* An edition of [[Pierre Henri Larcher]]'s ''Notes'' on [[Herodotus]], 2 vols. 1844.

* ''The Memoir on the Lake Regions of East Africa reviewed'', London 1864. In reply to [[Richard Francis Burton]]'s letter in the ''Athenæum'', No. 1899, which contradicted his theories, Cooley cast doubt on Burton's use of reports from Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dane Keith Kennedy|title=The Highly Civilized Man: Richard Burton and the Victorian world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCh8EIv7b04C&amp;pg=PA103|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03948-3|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
