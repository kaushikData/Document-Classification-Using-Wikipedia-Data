The '''Angamis''' are a major  [[Naga people|Naga]] [[ethnic group]] native to the state of [[Nagaland]] in [[North-East India]]. They are listed as a [[Scheduled Tribe]], in the 5th schedule of the [[Indian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes): Order, 1950|publisher=[[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)]]|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule9a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are known for the [[Sekrenyi]] celebrations every February. The Angami Nagas are settled in [[Kohima District]] and [[Dimapur District]].

== Division ==
The territory of the Angamis is made up of the present [[Kohima district and Dimapur District]],which is divided into four regions:
===Southern Angami===
*[[Viswema]]
*Jakhama
*Kigwema
*Phesama
*Kidima
*Khuzama
*Mima
*Mitelephe
*Pfuchama
*Kezoma
*Chakhabama
*Kezo Town
This region is located to the south of ''Kohima'' on the foothills of Mt Japfü.

===Western Angami===
*[[Khonoma]]
*Jotsoma
*Mezoma
*Sechü
*Sechü-Zubza
*Kiruphema
*Peducha
*Mengoujuma
*Thekrejüma
*Dzülekie
The Western Angami region is located to the west of ''Kohima''.
===Northern Angami===
*[[Kohima|Kewhima/Kohima]]
*Chiechama
*Tuophema
*Zhadima
*Tsiemekhuma
*Chüziema
*Chedema
*Meriema
*Nerhema
*Chiephobozou
*Gariphema
*Dihoma
*Rüsoma
This region is located to the north of Kohima.

===Chakhro Angami===
Mostly small villages around Dimapur district, with large villages being Medziphema, Chumoukedima, Sovima, Rüzaphema, etc. Other villages include Piphema, Tsiepama, Vidima, Kirha, Pherima, etc.)

The former Eastern Angami have separated and are now recognised as [[Chakhesang]].

== Culture and religion ==
[[File:Capt. Butler and assembled Nagas.jpg|thumb|Captain Butler and assembled Nagas; seated left to right: Lt. Ridgeway, Capt. Butler, Angami Naga interpreter Sezele of Chephama, Mikir coolie.

The Angami Nagas are hill people depending basically on cultivation and livestock-rearing. The Angamis are known for [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced wet-rice cultivation]]; because of this labor-intensive cultivation, land is the most important form of property among them. They are one of the only two groups of [[Naga people|Nagas]] out of the seventeen who practice wet-rice cultivation on terraces made on the hill slopes. This allows them to cultivate the same plot year after year. They depend, to a very small extent, on slash-and-burn cultivation. 

Angamis  were traditionally warriors. The Angami men spent the majority of their time in warfare with hostile villages and [[Head hunting|taking heads]]. Since 1879, when the [[United Kingdom|British]] succeeded in annexing their territory, the inter-village feuds have come to an end. With the introduction of [[Christianity]] in the region several Angamis changed their faith to Christianity.

[[Social stratification]] is not observed in the Angami community. Traditionally, property was divided equally among sons with daughters also receiving a share; in modern families it is shared among children. The youngest male in the family inherits the parental home, ''Kithoki'', which means he is responsible for their care until they pass away.

The Angami Christians are composed of five major denominations: [[Baptist]], [[Christian revival|Revival]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Pentecostal]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist]]. Baptists constitute more than 80% of the total Angami Christian population and all the Baptist churches in their region are under the [[Angami Baptist Church Council]].

Although more than 98% of the Angamis are Christians, they are one of the last Naga tribes having an animist population. The Angami animists practice a religion known as Pfutsana. According to the 1991 census, there were 1,760 Angami practitioners, but 10 years later the figure had halved to 884.&lt;ref&gt;Table ST-14, Table ST-14a, Census of India 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are several hundred adherents of the Pfutsana religion, scattered in nine villages of the southern [[Kohima district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nscn.livejournal.com/201698.html |title=nscn: Japfuphiki Pfutsana annual feast |publisher=Nscn.livejournal.com |date=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A religious organization, 'Japfuphiki Pfutsana', was founded in 1987 to streamline indigenous religious practices among the Angamis. According to the 2011 Census, 98.62% of the Angami are Christian, 0.47% are Buddhist, 0.37% Hindu, 0.24% Muslim and 0.19% Pfutsana.

== Sekrenyi ==
{{main|Sekrenyi festival}}
The Angamis celebrate a ten-day festival called Sekrenyi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nagaland.nic.in/profile/festivals/angami.htm |title=Festival of Angami Naga |publisher=Nagaland.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620045852/http://nagaland.nic.in/profile/festivals/angami.htm |archivedate=2014-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes also called Phousanyi) in February. The term Sekrenyi literally means sanctification festival (''sekre'' = sanctification; ''nyi'' = feast; ''thenyi'' = festival). The festival takes places after the harvest and falls on the twenty-fifth day of the month Kezei (January–February).

The festival follows a circle of ritual and ceremony, the first being ''kizie''. A few drops of rice water taken from the top of a type of jug called ''zumho'' are put on leaves. These are placed at the three main posts of the house by the lady of the household. On the first day, the young and old go to the village well to bathe.

In the night, two young men clean the well. Some of the village youth guard the well, as no one is allowed to fetch water after the cleaning. As women are especially not allowed to touch the well water at this time, they must make sure that water is fetched for the household before then. Early next morning, all the young men of the village attend the washing ritual. They wear two new shawls (the white ''Mhoushü'' and the black ''Lohe'') and sprinkle water on their chests, knees, and right arms. This ceremony is called ''dzüseva'' ('touching the sleeping water'); in it, the well water symbolically washes away all their ills and misfortunes.

On their return from the well, a [[rooster]] is sacrificed. It is taken as a good omen when the right leg falls over the left leg as it falls down. The [[Viscera|innards]] of the rooster are then hung outside the house for the village elders to inspect. A three-day session of singing and feasting starts on the fourth day of the festival.

The most interesting part is the ''thekra hie''. The ''thekra hie'' is when the young people of the village sit together and sing traditional songs throughout the day. Jugs of rice beer and plates of meat are placed before the participants. On the seventh day, the young men go hunting. The most important ceremony falls on the eighth day when the bridge-pulling, or gate-pulling, is performed and inter-village visits are exchanged. All field work ceases during this season of feasting and song.

The [[Armenians]] have historically been one of the main ethnic groups in the city of [[Tbilisi]], the capital of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Armenians are the largest ethnic minority in [[Tbilisi]] at 4.8% of the population. Armenians migrated to the Georgian lands in the Middle Ages, during the Muslim rule of Armenia. They formed the single largest group of city's population in the 19th century. Official Georgian statistics of 2014 put the number of '''Armenians in Tbilisi''' 53,409 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=145&amp;plang=1 ETHNIC GROUPS BY MAJOR ADMINISTRATIVE-TERRITORIAL UNITS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831235152/http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=145&amp;plang=1 |date=August 31, 2006 }} Statistics Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;

Tbilisi or Tiflis (as most Armenians call it) was the center of cultural life of [[Armenians in the Russian Empire]] from early 19th century to early 20th century.

===Early period===

The Armenian history and contribution to the capital city of [[Tbilisi]] (known as Tiflis in Armenian, Russian, Persian, Azerbaijani and Turkish) is significant. After the Russian conquest of the area, Armenians fleeing persecution in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Persia]] caused a jump in the Armenian population until it reached about 40% of the city total. Many of the mayors and business class were Armenian, and much of the old city was built by Armenians. Until recently the neighborhoods of [[Havlabar]] and the area across the river were very heavily Armenian, but that has changed a great deal in the last two decades.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

An Armenian community has been known to have existed in Tbilisi since at least the 7th century, however a large Armenian community was not formed until the [[Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen-214"&gt;{{Hewsen 2001|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Middle Ages, there were some 24 Armenian churches and monasteries in and around the city.&lt;ref name="Hewsen-214"/&gt; According to Tournefort, Armenians constituted three-quarters of the population of Tiflis in the 18th century, and owned 24 churches.&lt;ref name="ArmenianArt-317"&gt;{{Armenian Art 1989|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Russian Empire, the city of Tiflis became the center of Russian rule for the whole viceroyalty of Caucasia. During the 19th century, Tiflis became the center of the Eastern Armenian cultural revival and an Armenian cultural hub second only to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Hewsen-214"/&gt;

Until recently, the neighborhoods of [[Avlabari]] (Havlabar) and the area across the river were very heavily Armenian. The older Armenian neighborhood of Tbilisi, on both sides of the river between Freedom Square and Havlabar carry Armenian names, including Tumanyan, Abovian, Akopian, Alikhanian, Sundukian, Yerevan, Ararat and Sevan.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The Diocese Church (the [[St. George's Armenian Apostolic Church, Tbilisi|Saint Gevorg Church]]) in Tbilisi where the Armenian primate of Tbilisi sits is very close to the [[Narikala|city fortress]]. In front of the church is the tomb of the 18th-century Armenian–Georgian bard, [[Sayat-Nova]]. In Havlabar, the other Armenian Church of Echmiadzin is undergoing renovation and reconstruction. The [[Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi]] has the tombs of many famous Armenians including writers [[Hovhannes Tumanyan]] and [[Raffi (poet)|Raffi]].

{{main|List of Armenian churches in Tbilisi}}
According to Tournefort, Armenians constituted three-quarters of the population of Tiflis in the 18th century, and owned 24 churches.&lt;ref name="ArmenianArt-317"/&gt; Ten of the churches were destroyed in the 1930s, and as of 1979, fourteen were still standing.&lt;ref name="ArmenianArt-586"&gt;{{Armenian Art 1989|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still two working Armenian Churches in the city, and an Armenian Theatre. The [[Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi|Armenian Pantheon]], where prominent Armenians are buried has the tombs of some of Armenian's favorite personalities ever, including [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]] and [[Hovhannes Tumanyan]]. The adjacent Armenian cemetery was taken over by the Georgian Church and their new national cathedral was built upon it. The remaining space in between the Pantheon and the new Georgian cathedral is now the construction site of what appears to be a Georgian Seminary. Again, the Armenian tombs here are being ignored, and human bones are being moved around like dirt.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A number of Armenian churches have been confiscated by the Soviet state and then passed to the Georgian Church in the post-Soviet era. According to the United States [[State Department]]: "The Roman Catholic and Armenian Apostolic Churches have been unable to secure the return of churches and other facilities closed during the Soviet period, many of which later were given to the Georgian Orthodox Church by the State. The prominent Armenian church in Tbilisi, Norashen, remained closed, as did four other smaller Armenian churches in Tbilisi and one in Akhaltsikhe. In addition, the Roman Catholic and Armenian Apostolic Churches, as with Protestant denominations, have had difficulty obtaining permission to construct new churches due to pressure from the GOC." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51553.htm U.S. Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petros Adamian Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theatre===
[[File:Petros Adamian Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theatre. Avlabar, Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|200px|Pedros Adamian Armenian Theatre]]
Petros Adamian Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theatre was established in 1858 by the Armenian theatre figure George Chmshkian. The first staging was "Adji Suleyman" performance. From 1922 through 1936 before building of the new current theatre building the theatres name was "Artistic theatre". In 1936 was built a new theatre building which was named Stepan Shahumian Armenian Theatre, after [[Bolshevik]] [[Stepan Shahumian]]. The first performance was Mkrtich (Nikita) Djanan's performance "[[Shahname]]". Here worked [[Petros Adamian]], Siranoush (Merobe Kantarjian), Vahram Papazian, [[Hovhannes Abelian]], Olga Maysourian, Isaac Alikhanian, Mariam Mojorian, Artem and Maria Beroians, Artem Lusinian, Babken Nersesian, Darius Amirbekian, Ashot Kadjvorian, Emma Stepanian, Armenian directors: Arshak Bourdjalian, Leon Kalantar, Stepan Kapanakian, Alexander Abarian, Ferdinand Bzhikian, Hayk Umikian, Mickael Grigorian, Ivan Karapetian, Roman Chaltikian, Roman Matiashvili, Robert Yegian. Music for theatres often was written by [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[Armen Tigranian]], [[Alexander Spendiarian]], and others.

Nowadays Peter Adamian Tbilisi State Armenian Drama Theatre is the main spiritual and public center of Georgian-Armenian community.&lt;ref&gt;http://amtheater.gq.nu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nersisyan School===

===Freedom Square===
{{main|Freedom Square, Tbilisi}}
Once formally known as Paskevich Yerevanski Square, then Lenin Square, it was commonly called Yerevan Square. [[Ivan Paskevich]] was a Russian general and was called Paskevich of Yerevan (''Yerevanski'')  in honor of his taking of Yerevan for the Russian Empire. Abutting the north side of Freedom Square is a small open space with a fountain. Buried between the bust of Pushkin and the fountain is the Bolshevik revolutionary Kamo ([[Simon Ter-Petrossian]]). His grave has been paved over and is unmarked.

===Armenian Street Names===
The heavily Armenian old neighborhoods of Tbilisi still have many Armenian street names, though some have been changed over time. Leselidze Street was once called Armenian Bazaar Street.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Vera cemetery===
{{main|Vera cemetery}}
Vera cemetery was used by local Armenians before the Soviet takeover. Now  it is used by Georgians.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The '''Australian Red Cross''' is a leading [[humanitarian aid]] and [[community services]] charity in Australia and an [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary to government]]. Tracing its history back to 1914 and being incorporated by [[royal charter]] in 1941, the Australian Red Cross Society is the Australian National Society of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] and part of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. The Australian Red Cross is guided by the Fundamental Principles of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] and as such is a secular, neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organisation. 

The Australian Red Cross provides a range of services and programmes including [[international aid]] across the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, [[international humanitarian law]] advocacy, [[Immigration to Australia|migration support]], [[emergency management]], [[blood donation]] via the [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]], and [[community services]] for [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples]], youth, families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. 

His Excellency [[General (Australia)|General]] [[The Honourable]] [[Peter Cosgrove|Sir Peter Cosgrove]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|sep=,|AK|MC}}, [[Governor-General of Australia]], is the Patron of the Australian Red Cross Society and a non-voting member of the National Council. The  National Council is the peak governance decision-making body and is made up of 53 voting members including the President and the National Board. The National Council delegates operational and management decisions and other responsibilities to the National Board and the CEO.&lt;ref name="govern"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.redcross.org.au/governance.aspx |title=Governance |publisher=Australian Red Cross |accessdate=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Australian Red Cross was a recipient of the [[Queensland Greats Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/about/events-awards-honours/awards/qld-greats-awards/2013-recipients/|title=2013 Queensland Greats recipients|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531024212/https://www.qld.gov.au/about/events-awards-honours/awards/qld-greats-awards/2013-recipients/|archive-date=31 May 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A branch of the [[British Red Cross]] was established in Australia in 1914, nine days after the start of [[World War I]], by [[Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar|Lady Helen Munro Ferguson]]. The British Red Cross Australian Branch changed its name to the Australian Red Cross Society and was incorporated by [[royal charter]] on 28 June 1941. 

[[File:Australia Hall, Pembroke.jpeg|thumb|[[Australia Hall]] in [[Pembroke, Malta|Pembroke]], [[Malta]], which was built in 1915 by the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross Society as an entertainment hall for soldiers from the [[British Empire]]]]

The organisation grew at a rapid rate. Lady Helen wrote to the mayors of every [[shire]] and [[municipality]] in [[Australia]] asking them to initiate a local branch.  Typically, a letter was published in the local [[newspaper]] and a meeting called. By November 1914, [[New South Wales]] had 88 city or suburban branches and 249 country branches, all established within the previous four months. The Society was accepted by the community from the beginning. Much of the World War I [[home front]] activities such as knitting socks and rolling bandages was done by local Red Cross branches.  The Red Cross Information Bureau was established in 1915 in order to coordinate information gathered on the dead and their burial beyond what was provided by the armed forces.  The Red Cross Wounded and Missing files were extensive with searchers sometimes sent overseas to clarify information, make better judgements and to resolve conflicting accounts.&lt;ref name="cwod"&gt;{{cite book |title=Changing Ways of Death in Twentieth Century Australia: War, Medicine and the Funeral Business |last=Jalland  |first=Patricia |year=2006 |publisher=UNSW Pres|page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GALw2tzJ7MC |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 the Australian Red Cross Society sent a team of 21 civilian nurses to France; these nurses were dubbed the "[[Bluebirds (Australian nurses)|Bluebirds]]" in reference to the colours of their specially-designed uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Les|title=The Bluebirds in France|journal=Wartime|date=January 2009|volume=45|pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II the Red Cross provided assistance to the sick, wounded, maimed and their dependents.&lt;ref name="vww"&gt;{{cite book |title=Volunteering: Why We Can't Survive Without it |last=Oppenheimer |first=Melanie |year=2008 |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=1742240437 |pages=43–47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8lUpbodX1sC |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By agreement with the federal government they provided hostel accommodation to those with no living relatives or friends to support them upon returning home from war.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia's Forgotten Prisoners: Civilians Interned by the Japanese in World War Two |last=Twomey |first=Christina |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521612896 |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDkxDTwxk0MC |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time the majority of the volunteers were unemployed married women.  High rates of membership in the organisation were attributed to their annual, national, recruitment drive.&lt;ref name="vww"/&gt;  Membership grew from 260,000 in 1941 to 450,000 in 1944. The Australian Red Cross proved to be an important link between the public and Japanese [[prisoners of war]].&lt;ref name="vww"/&gt;

In 2005, the organisation made an agreement with the Maldives Government to help clear debris created by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref name="tcm"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2005/s1370863.htm |title=Australian Red Cross to clean up Maldives |author=Mark Colvin |accessdate=16 April 2013 |date=17 May 2005 |work=PM |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2010, aid workers from the Australian Red Cross were sent to Christmas Island to assist the survivors of the [[2010 Christmas Island boat disaster]].&lt;ref name="item"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Emergency Management |last=Phillips |first=Brenda D. |author2=David M.

==Volunteers==
The passion and commitment of the [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s is widely acknowledged.{{by whom?|date=August 2017}}  They rise to [[natural disaster]] or personal crisis from [[bushfire]] to [[flood]] or [[drought]]. Today there are more than 60,000 trained volunteers and the entire Australian Red Cross program is funded by public [[donation]]s and corporate partnerships.{{source?|date=August 2017}}

==Priorities==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
The eight priority areas of Red Cross in Australia are:

*Strengthening national emergency preparedness, response and recovery
*Increasing international aid and development 
*Strengthening communities in areas of locational disadvantage
*Championing international humanitarian law(IHL or ‘the laws of war’) 
*Addressing the impact of migration 
*Partnering with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
*Overcoming social exclusion by providing bridges back into the community
*Provide a safe, secure supply of blood and blood products - through the Australian Red Cross Blood Service

There is a small but growing population of '''Chinese people in Senegal''', largely consisting of expatriates from the [[People's Republic of China]] who began arriving in [[Senegal|the country]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gaye 2008 129"/&gt;

==Migration history==
Migrants from the People's Republic of China (PRC) began flowing into Senegal in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Gaye 2008 129"/&gt; They rented properties at above-market rates in the Centenaire area, and remained in the country even after [[President of Senegal|Senegalese president]] [[Abdou Diouf]]'s administration granted official recognition to the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]] in 1996. The ROC's diplomatic success was not matched by the development of economic relations; instead, the traders from the PRC, actually on the ground in Senegal, were able to cultivate political and popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaye|2008|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts paid off in October 2005, when Senegal broke off relations with the ROC and restored its relations with the PRC, an event which was greeted with celebrations by local Chinese migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Xinhua News|title=旅居塞内加尔华侨华人对中塞两国复交欢欣鼓舞/Chinese migrants in Senegal celebrate restoration of China-Senegal bilateral relations|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2005-10/26/content_3683809.htm|date=2005-10-26|accessdate=2009-04-01|last=Gao|first=Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www2.sdnews.com.cn/news/shizheng/2005-10/31_80174.html|periodical=Shandong News|date=2005-10-31|accessdate=2009-04-01|title=塞内加尔与台湾"断交"多米诺效应已经形成/Senegal breaks off relations with Taiwan; domino effect taking shape}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC responded by accusing the PRC of "buying" Senegal's allegiance by pledging [[United States dollar|US$]]600 million in [[foreign aid]].&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt;

In 2004, the PRC's official ''[[People's Daily]]'' published an estimate of 300 Chinese in Senegal.&lt;ref name="PeoplesDaily2004"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200410/27/eng20041027_161830.html|periodical=People's Daily|date=2004-10-27|accessdate=2009-03-31|title=Two Chinese citizens killed in Senegal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' published official numbers from an unspecified source stating that 150 Chinese families totalling 200 to 300 people lived in Dakar alone, but Chinese in Senegal who were interviewed estimated the true number might be as high as 1,000.&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt; Another report by [[Radio Australia]]'s Chinese edition in January 2009 put the total number at 2,000.&lt;ref name="RadioAustralia"/&gt;

==Business and employment==
{{asof|2009}}, there were roughly 200 Chinese-owned shops in Dakar, largely concentrated around Dakar's Boulevard du Centenaire.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{citation|title=Les commerçants chinois, un des symboles forts de la présence de Pékin au Sénégal/Chinese businesspeople, a strong symbol of Beijing's presence in Senegal|periodical=Agence de Presse Africaine|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2009-04-01|url=http://www.apanews.net/apa.php/administration/abonnes/apa.php?page=show_article&amp;id_article=88587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is rapidly becoming known as the local "[[Chinatown]]", though it still lacks some of the visual features associated with Chinatowns in other countries, such as Chinese [[paper lantern|lanterns]]. Chinese merchants typically convert their buildings into [[shophouse]]s, with living space in the back and retail space in the front.&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;{{citation|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39027|periodical=[[Inter Press Service]]|title=Senegal: Finding Opportunities Through Cheap Chinese Goods|first=Hamadou Tidiane|last=Sy|accessdate=2009-04-01|date=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Voice of America]] report, Chinese wholesalers can [[gross (economics)|gross]] several thousand dollars per day.&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-09/2005-09-23-voa29.cfm|periodical=Voice of America|date=2005-09-23|accessdate=2009-04-01|title=Chinese Goods Flood Dakar, Anger Competitors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their influence has largely shifted the centre of commerce in Dakar away from the historic Sandaga market to the Centenaire area.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dakar: China-Africa Trade Reshapes Street Commerce|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-11/2006-11-07-voa24.cfm|date=2006-11-07|accessdate=2009-04-01|periodical=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese merchants largely sell imported goods; in 2006, imports from China to Senegal accounted for 94% of the two countries' total trade relationship. Larger Senegalese traders who compete with the Chinese shops them often blame them for flooding the market with cheap goods, and even organised a strike in 2004 through their business association UNACOIS (a French acronym for "Senegalese Union of Traders and Industrialists") to demand caps on Chinese immigration.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; In particular, they accuse Chinese merchants of paying bribes and [[tax evasion|evading taxes]].&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt; However, the low prices they offer benefit both consumers as well as [[peddler|small itinerant vendors]] who go door-to-door in poor neighbourhoods reselling goods they purchase from the Chinese.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; The head of Senegalese consumer association ASCOSEN even organised a counter-protest in opposition to UNACOIS's 2004 protest, in turn accusing them of cheating consumers by selling goods imported from China at prices up to ten times as much as those offered by Chinese traders.&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt; Others credit Chinese traders with creating jobs for locals. Each shop employs about two or three local assistants, and one local observer noted that they have had the effect of decreasing crime, as "young kids who used to be pickpockets are now hired as messengers".&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt;

As a result of the low prices they offer, Chinese traders have not only been able to outcompete large Senegalese merchants in Dakar, but have also begun to displace [[Lebanese people in Senegal|diasporic Lebanese]] from their traditional position as the [[market-dominant minority]] there as well; members of those two groups have begun to shift to a business pattern of buying goods from the Chinese and reselling them in more remote areas of the country where no Chinese migrants live. Chinese wholesalers also attract merchants from nearby West African countries, especially [[Gambia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[Mali]], who find it cheaper to come to Senegal to purchase Chinese goods for resale in their home countries, rather than go through the expensive and time-consuming process of obtaining a PRC visa and flying to China themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaye|2008|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and community==
Chinese shop-owners often teach their African employees [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and learn [[Wolof language|Wolof]] and [[French language|French]] from them in return, a form of [[language exchange]]. However, they have little contact with local people outside of work, instead mostly socialising with and living near other Chinese people.&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt; They are perceived by local people as a secretive community.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt;

Chinese in Senegal have formed a variety of community associations, including:
*The Senegalese Association of Overseas Chinese, established in Dakar in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Senegalese Association of Overseas Chinese set up in Dakar|periodical=Xinhua News|date=2007-09-23|accessdate=2009-03-31|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-09/23/content_6776103.htm|last=An|first=Lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese traders in Senegal often become the victims of violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=塞内加尔一华侨被杀害/Chinese migrant killed in Senegal|periodical=Xinhua News|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2009-02/21/content_10864463.htm|date=2009-02-21|accessdate=2009-03-31|last=Yan|first=Shinan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a woman went missing and was never heard from again; in 2004, Sun Fengzhi and her son Wang Kun were murdered in their home in Dakar.&lt;ref name="PeoplesDaily2004"/&gt; In February 2009, after the murder of businessman Zhao Suiqin (赵遂勤) from [[Henan]], 214 Chinese-owned shops held a work stoppage to protest the slow police investigations of violence against them; some Senegalese merchants also closed their shops in solidarity.&lt;ref name="RadioAustralia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xinhua20090227"/&gt;

'''Con Errico''' (November 4, 1921 - March 21, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] [[jockey]] who went to [[prison]] after being convicted of race-fixing.

Among his noted race wins, Errico captured the 1949 [[Travers Stakes]] aboard the future [[Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame]] colt, [[Arise (horse)|Arise]] and rode [[Crafty Admiral]] for part of the 1952 season when the horse was voted [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Male Horse|U.S. Champion Handicap Male Horse]].

After twenty-nine years as a jockey, Errico's career came to an end when he was [[Indictment|indicted]] on race-fixing charges. In his 1980 New York trial in [[Circuit Court|2nd Circuit Court]] ("United States v. Errico, 635 F. 2d 152"), the chief Government witness was jockey [[Jose Amy|José Amy]] who himself would be banned from New York racing for almost twenty-five years for his role in the scandal. Amy testified that Con Errico paid him and other jockeys as much as $7,500 per race to hold back their horses. Convicted, Errico was fined $25,000 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. In poor health, in 1985 he was released from the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Sandstone, Minnesota]].

In 1993, Con Errico was living at [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]] when he suffered a [[stroke]] after [[open-heart surgery]] and died a short time later on March 21.

''Cultural feminism'' is the view that there is a "female nature" or "female essence" or related attempts to revalidate  attributes ascribed to femaleness.&lt;ref name="Alcoff"/&gt;  It is also used to describe theories that commend innate differences between women and men.&lt;ref name="Kramarae"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kramarae, Cheris |author2=Spender, Dale |title=''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge'' |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0415920906 |page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==

Unlike [[radical feminism]] or [[socialist feminism]], cultural feminism was not an ideology widely claimed by proponents, but was more commonly a pejorative label ascribed by its opponents. [[Alice Echols]], a feminist historian and cultural theorist, credits Brooke Williams with applying the term "cultural feminism" in 1975 to describe the depoliticisation of radical feminism, which led to the term being picked during the 1990s by academic feminists to describe various individuals.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, R. "Slain and Slandered: A Content Analysis of the Portrayal of Femicide in Crime News." Homicide Studies 13.1 (2009): 21-49. {{doi|10.1177/1088767908326679}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term surfaced as early as 1971, when Tor Bay, in a letter printed in ''[[Off Our Backs]]'', condemned the literary magazine ''Aphra'' as having "served the cause of cultural feminism."&lt;ref&gt;Tor Bay, "goodbye", ''Off Our Backs'' 1, no. 19 (25 March  1971): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist feminist Elizabeth Diggs, in 1972, used the label "cultural feminism" to apply to all of [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Diggs, "What Is the Women's Movement?", ''Women: A Journal of Liberation'' 2, no. 4 (1972): 11-12, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974, editors of ''[[The Lesbian Tide]]'' asked: "[I]s dyke-separatism a logical extension of cultural feminism?"&lt;ref&gt;"A Kiss Does Not A Revolution Make," ''Lesbian Tide'' 3, no. 11 (July 1974): 10.&lt;/ref&gt; As these varied uses reveal, no single definition of the term existed even among participants in the women's movement.

==Cultural feminist ideas==

Although the term "cultural feminist" is generally applied to individuals in the 1970s, similar lines of thought have been traced  to earlier periods. [[Jane Addams]] and [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] argued that in governing the state, cooperation, caring, and nonviolence in the settlement of conflicts society seem to be what was needed from women’s virtues.&lt;ref name=Ritzer&gt;Ritzer, George. Contemporary Sociological Theory and Its Classical Roots. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-07-299759-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josephine Donovan]] argues that the nineteenth century  [[journalist]], [[critic]] and [[women's rights]] activist, [[Margaret Fuller]], initiated cultural feminism in ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1845). She stressed the emotional, intuitive side of knowledge and expressed an organic worldview that is quite different from the mechanistic view of Enlightenment rationalists.&lt;ref name=Donovan&gt;Donovan, Josefine. ''Feminist Theory''. 3d ed. (New York: Continuum, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levine, Amy-Jill |author2=Blickenstaff, Marianne |title=A Feminist Companion to the Acts of the Apostles |year=2004 |publisher=T &amp; T Clark |location=London  |isbn=0-8264-6252-9 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was Linda Alcoff's argument in "Cultural Feminism Versus Post-Structuralism: the Identity Crisis in Feminist Theory" that led to the widespread adoption of the term to describe contemporary feminists, not their historical antecedents.  Alcoff claims cultural feminism places women in an overly determined position  [[Overdetermination|overdetermined]] by what she sees as patriarchal systems.&lt;ref name=Alcoff/&gt;  She contends that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Man has said that woman can be defined, delineated, captured, understood, explained, and diagnosed to a level of determination never accorded to man himself, who is conceived as a rational animal with free will.&lt;ref name=Alcoff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alcoff|first1=Linda|title=Cultural Feminism versus Post-Structuralism: The Identity Crisis in Feminist Theory|journal=Signs|date=1988|volume=13|issue=3|pages=405–436|jstor=3174166}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Alcoff makes the point that "the cultural feminist reappraisal construes woman's passivity as her peacefulness, her sentimentality as her proclivity to nurture, her subjectiveness as her advanced self-awareness".&lt;ref name=Alcoff/&gt;

Taylor and Rupp have argued that critiques of cultural feminism are often an attack on lesbian feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Verta Taylor and Leila J. Rupp, "Women's Culture and Lesbian Feminist Activism: A Reconsideration of Cultural Feminism" ''Signs'', 19, No. 1 (Autumn, 1993): 32–61.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174744].&lt;/ref&gt;  Suzanne Staggenbourg's case study of Bloomington, Indiana led her to conclude that engagement in activities labeled as cultural feminist "provides little evidence ... a decline in political activity in the women's movement."&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Staggenborg, "Beyond Culture versus Politics: A Case Study of a Local Women's Movement,"Gender and Society, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Aug., 2001), pp. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural feminist theory ==
The theory emerged in the mid-1970's where it exposed women's oppression in gendered constructions that devaluate feminine attributes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminisms Matter: Debates, Theories, Activism|last=Bromley|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Daly, a cultural feminist theorist, linked "female energy," or her term Gyn/Ecology to the essential life-affirming, life-creating condition of the female spirit/body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Problem of Speaking For Others|last=Alcoff|first=Linda|publisher=|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women-only spaces were made by cultural feminists to challenge negative gendered constructions, where they were ran "by women for women."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women only events were being criticized because they excluded men and by excluding men, they were being defined as the problem, rather than locating the problem in the structures of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Illyrian times Peć was a major residential center. It lies in the north-western edge of the [[Metohija]] valley before the gorge of the scenic [[Rugova Canyon|Rugova]] Mountain.

'''Elizabeth Ward Greenwood''' (1849 – November 28, 1922) was an American social reformer in the [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]], and [[evangelism|evangelist]] in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|Bailey|1898|p=491}}

Early on, she became involved in the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU). She served as President of a large Union, Superintendent of Scientific Temperance Instruction in her state; National Superintendent of Juvenile work; and World's and National Superintendent of Evangelistic work. As lecturer, preacher, evangelist, she held immense audiences in most conservative churches, also lecturing in jails, asylums, factories and halls. For 20 years, Greenwood preached during the summer to a large congregation, near her country home, ministering also in homes, and at funerals. Though she was a Methodist, for some years, she attended upon the ministry of Dr. [[Richard Salter Storrs]], of [[Brooklyn]].{{sfn|Chapin|1895|p=9}}

==Early years and education==
Elizabeth Ward Greenwood was born in a home of wealth in Brooklyn, New York, in 1849,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=340}} or 1850.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=580-83}} Her parents were Joseph M. Greenwood, Brooklyn lawyer, and Cynthia Ward Greenwood of [[Sheffield, Massachusetts]]. Greenwood was born in the old family home in Brooklyn, and lived there the greater part of her life.&lt;ref name="Newspapers.com1922" /&gt; She was converted at the age of fourteen and turned away from a fashionable life to her books and to philanthropic work.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=340}}  

She was educated at Miss Harvey's private school and later, at the age of 18, graduated from the Brooklyn Heights Seminary under Dr. Charles K. West, winning highest honors and acting as valedictorian of her class. Dr. West pronounced her one of the most brilliant pupils he had ever known.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=580-83}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=340}}&lt;ref name="Newspapers.com1922" /&gt; 

After graduating, in 1869, she took a post-graduate course, and then spent some time at Brooklyn Heights Seminary as a teacher of the higher branches, and in giving weekly lectures in the Senior and Junior departments. Then came years of continued study and literary pursuits.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=580-83}}{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=340}} 

==Career==
[[File:Elizabeth W Greenwood.png|thumb|Elizabeth Greenwood]]
As the temperance enthusiasm spread from [[Ohio]] eastward, Greenwood became interested in the movement in her own city. When the [[Women's Crusade]] opened, she enlisted at once. She was conspicuous in the [[White ribbon|white-ribbon movement]] throughout [[New York (state)|New York]] and the nation. When scientific temperance instruction in the [[New York City]] schools was being provided for, Greenwood did important work with the legislature, as State superintendent of that department. She served as national superintendent of juvenile work.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=340}} 

Beginning in the WCTU, and many of the churches of Brooklyn, her work extended to nearly all the conservative churches of the large cities and towns in the Eastern seaboard. She was equally at home in jails, asylums, factories, and saloons.{{sfn|Willard|1888|p=580-83}} For years, served as president of the WCTU on the Hill in Brooklyn, as superintendent of its juvenile work, and as lecturer and evangelist. She spent her summers in the [[Berkshire Hills]], [[Massachusetts]] where she preached on Sundays to large audiences. In 1888, she was made superintendent of the evangelistic department of the National WCTU.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=340}} "She was but 24 years old," wrote [[Frances E. Willard]] in 1889, "when the woman's crusade began. Her remarkable quickness and versatility, her culture and her consecration admirably adapted her to the variety of methods in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Beginning as an evangelist in her own city and a lecturer upon literary and other themes, her work extended through its own success, throughout the Nation."&lt;ref name="Newspapers.com1922" /&gt; As superintendent of the New York State Department of Temperance Instructions in Schools and Colleges, a position she was instrumental in creating through her tireless efforts to bring about the law warranting it, Greenwood made a strenuous campaign in favor of the bill, which carried her all over the State of New York, and worked for it unceasingly. The measure was signed by [[POTUS|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]].&lt;ref name="Newspapers.com1922" /&gt; 

In 1889, she visited Europe, and there she continued her reform efforts. She did frequent work abroad as a lecturer and evangelist.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=340}} Greenwood was also keenly interested in woman's suffrage and was one of its early champions in the United States.&lt;ref name="Newspapers.com1922" /&gt;  

For eighteen years, she was a preacher of the Gospel at [[Collinsville, Connecticut]], and for an even longer period at [[Sheffield, Massachusetts]], where, at the request of neighbors, she commenced a summer Sunday service in the old Ward School House near her home. These services eventually became so crowded that a regular church was opened for her nearby. It was attended by a congregation drawn from a dozen different towns. For seven years, Greenwood occupied the pulpit of the Mayflower Mission of [[Henry Ward Beecher]]'s church in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="Newspapers.com1922" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1914, she suffered a breakdown which made her a semi-Invalid and forced her virtual retirement from active work in the field. For the last eight or nine years, she was forced to curtail her active interests in the varied crusades to which she gave her life, but to the last, she read magazines of current events. She died November 28, 1922 at her Brooklyn home after a lingering illness. She was buried Greenwood Cemetery. Greenwood was survived by a sister, Mrs. William C. Hitter; a brother, William Greenwood, and two nieces.&lt;ref name="Newspapers.com1922"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brooklyn Woman Cave Forty Years of Her Life to Cause of Temperance|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/57413809/|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=Newspapers.com|publisher=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|date=28 November 1922|location=Brooklyn, New York|pages=3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1332">'''Estonians in Abkhazia''' are a minority residing in [[Abkhazia]], recognized worldwide as an autonomous region of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] but ''de facto'' an independent country. Estonians began to emigrate to Abkhazia when the region became part of the [[Russian Empire]] and many Abkhazians left or were expelled. The tsarist regime began to repopulate the area with its Christian subjects, including Estonians. There were numerous waves of migration from Estonia to Abkhazia, where the peasants were promised land. Among others, they founded the villages [[Psou (village)|Salme]] and Estonka. In the villages, the Estonians also had their own schools.[https://sputnik-georgia.ru/reviews/20170118/234580343/Malenkaja-estonija-v-Gruzii.html]

During and after the [[Georgian-Abkhazian war]], many Estonians fled to Estonia; in one single operation in 1992, the Estonian authorities evacuated 170 Estonians.[https://dea.digar.ee/cgi-bin/dea?a=d&amp;d=eestiekspress20140220.2.33.1]

Estonians currently (2003 data) number 0.2% of the population of Abkhazia. The biggest share of Estonians living in the capital [[Sukhumi]] was back in 1939 - 206 Estonians resided there that made up 0.5% of the population. Most Abkhazian Estonians live in Western Abkhazia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10528">[[Sierra Leone]] is home to about sixteen [[ethnic groups]], each with its own language. In Sierra Leone, membership of an ethnic group often overlaps with a shared religious identity.[[File:Sierra Leone ethnic groups.svg|thumb|400px|The distribution of major ethnic groups within Sierra Leone.]]

== Ethnic groups and national politics ==
The largest contest within Sierra Leone's political culture centres upon the competition between the ethnic [[Temne people|Temne]] in Sierra Leone's north-west, and the [[Mende people|Mende]] in Sierra Leone's south-east.&lt;ref name="thenewpeople.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewpeople.com/national-news/politics/item/1764-sierra-leone-the-temnes-and-the-politics-of-the-all-peoples%E2%80%99-congress-apc |title=Sierra Leone: The Temnes and the Politics of the All Peoples’ Congress (APC)|date= 29 April 2012 |publisher=Thenewpeople.com|accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the Mende support the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP). The majority of the Temne support the [[All People's Congress]] (APC).&lt;ref name="thenewpeople.com" /&gt;

=== Temne ===
{{Further|Temne people}}

The largest ethnic group is the [[Temne people|Temne]] at about 36% of Sierra Leone's population. The Temne predominate in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Sierra Leone]] and the [[Western Area, Sierra Leone|areas around the capital of Sierra Leone]].

The vast majority of Temne are Muslims, with a small Christian minority.

The Temne are thought to have come from [[Futa Jallon]], which is in present-day [[Guinea]]. Sierra Leone's former president [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] is the first ethnic Temne to be elected to the office. The majority of the Temne support the [[All People's Congress]] (APC).&lt;ref name="thenewpeople.com" /&gt;

=== Mende ===
{{Further|Mende people}}

A major ethnic group are the [[Mende people|Mende]], at about 33% of Sierra Leone's population. The Mende predominate in [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|the Southern Province]] and Eastern Sierra Leone (with the exception of [[Kono District]]).

The Mende are a Muslim majority group, though with a large Christian minority. The Mende, who are believed to be descendants of the [[Mane people|Mane]], originally occupied the Liberian hinterland. They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century.

The vast majority of the Mende support the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP).&lt;ref name="thenewpeople.com" /&gt;

=== Fula ===
{{Further|Fula people}}

One of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the [[Fula people|Fula]] at around 3.4% of the population. Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century [[Fulani]] migrant settlers from the [[Fouta Jallo, Fouta Toro, and Maasina]] regions of Guinea, Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania. The Sierra Leone Fula people settled in the Western Area region of Sierra Leone more than four hundred years ago as settlers from mainly the Fouta Djallon Kingdom that expanded to northern Sierra Leone (Kabala, Bombali).

The Sierra Leonean Fula are traditionally a nomadic, pastoralist, trading people, herding cattle, goats and sheep across the vast dry hinterlands of their domain, keeping somewhat separate from the local agricultural populations. Many of the large shopping centers in Sierra Leone are owned and run by the Fula community.

A significant number of the Sierra Leone Fula population are found in all regions of Sierra Leone as [[merchant|traders]], and many live in middle-class homes. Because of their trading, the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country.

=== Limba ===
{{Further|Limba people (Sierra Leone)}}

The third largest ethnic group are the [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] at around 6,4% of the population. The Limba are Indigenous people of Sierra Leone and speak various dialects of a language largely unrelated to other tribal languages in Sierra Leone. They are primarily found in the Northern Province, particularly in Bombali District, Koinadugu and Kambia District. During Sierra Leone's colonial era thousands of Limbas migrated to the capital city of Freetown and its Western Area. As a result, a significant number of Limbas can be found in Freetown and its surrounding Western Area. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, many Limba people were shipped to North America as slaves.

=== Mandingo ===
{{Further|Mandingo people of Sierra Leone}}

[[File:MandingoMap-1906.jpg|thumb|450px|A map showing the regional distribution of the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] across what are now multiple West African nations.]] 
A significant ethnic group are the [[Mandingo people of Sierra Leone|Mandingo]] (also known as [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]). They are descendants of [[Merchant|traders]] from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country.

They predominate in the large towns, most notably [[Karina, Sierra Leone|Karina]], in Bombali District in the north; [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]] and [[Falaba]] in Koinadugu District in the north; and [[Yengema]], [[Kono District]] in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims. Sierra Leone's third president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], and Sierra Leone's first Vice President [[Sorie Ibrahim Koroma]] were both ethnic Mandingo.

=== Kono ===
{{Further|Kono people}}

Next in proportion are the [[Kono people|Kono]], who live primarily in [[Kono District]] in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners. The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians, though with an influential Muslim minority. Sierra Leone's former Vice-President [[Samuel Sam-Sumana|Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana]] is an ethnic Kono.

=== Krio ===
{{Further|Krio people}}

The small but significant [[Krio people]] (descendants of freed African American, [[West Indian]] and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885) make up about 3% of the population. They primarily occupy the capital city of [[Freetown]] and its surrounding [[Western Area]]. Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated - they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development.

The Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone's judiciacy and Freetown's elected city council. One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions, they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service, beginning during the colonial years. They continue to be influential in the civil service. The vast majority of Krios are Christians, though with a significant Muslim minority.

=== Kuranko ===
{{Further|Kuranko people}}

Other minority ethnic groups are the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko]], who are related to the Mandingo, and are largely Muslims. The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north, particularly in [[Koinadugu District]].

The Kuranko are primarily farmers; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military. Sierra Leone current Finance Minister [[Kaifala Marah]] is an ethnic Kuranko.

=== Loko ===
{{Further|Loko people}}

[[File:Landogo stonemason and carpenter.JPG|thumb|200px|A [[Loko people|Loko]] stonemason and carpenter, 2011.]]
The [[Loko people|Loko]] in the north are native people of Sierra Leone, believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter. Like the neighbouring Temne, the Loko are Muslim majority.

=== Susu and Yalunka ===
{{Further|Susu people}}
{{Further|Yalunka people}}
The [[Susu people|Susu]] and their related [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]] are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and [[Koinadugu District]] close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka are both descendants of migrants from Guinea. They are virtually all Muslims.

=== Kissi ===
{{Further|Kissi people}}
The [[Kissi people|Kissi]] live further inland in South-Eastern Sierra Leone. They predominate in the large town of [[Koindu]] and its surrounding areas in Kailahun District. The vast majority of Kissi are Christians.

=== Vai ===
{{Further|Vai people}}
The much smaller [[Vai people|Vai]] are primarily found in [[Kailahun District|Kailahun]] and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia.  The Vai are largely Muslim.

=== Kru ===
{{Further|Kru people}}

The [[Kru people|Kru]] are also primarily found in [[Kailahun District|Kailahun]] and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia. The Kru predominate in the Kroubay neighbourhood in the capital Freetown. The Kru are largely Christian.

=== Sherbro ===
{{Further|Sherbro people}}

On the coast in [[Bonthe District]] in the south are the [[Sherbro people|Sherbro]]. Native to Sierra Leone, they have occupied [[Sherbro Island]] since it was founded. The Sherbro are primarily [[fisherman]] and [[farmers]], and they are predominantly found in Bonthe District. The Sherbro are virtually all Christians, and their paramount chiefs had a history of intermarriage with British colonists and traders.

=== Lebanese merchants ===
A small number of Sierra Leoneans are of partial or full [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] ancestry, descendants of traders who first came to the nation in the 19th century. They are locally known as Sierra Leonean-Lebanese. The Sierra Leonean-Lebanese community are primarily traders and they mostly live in middle-class households in the urban areas, primarily in [[Freetown]], [[Bo, Sierra Leone|Bo]], [[Kenema]], [[Koidu|Koidu Town]] and [[Makeni]].

Australia is home to the largest Fijian population in the world outside Fiji itself.

According to the 2011 Australian census 48,141 Australians were born in Fiji.&lt;ref name="ABS Country of Birth"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;order=1&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;javascript=true&amp;textversion=false&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp;breadcrumb=POLTD&amp;&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Country%20of%20Birth%20of%20Person%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;topic=Birthplace&amp;|title = 20680-Country of Birth of Person (full classification list) by Sex - Australia|format = Microsoft Excel download |publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] | work = 2011 Census| accessdate = 2013-04-08}} Total count of persons: 19,855,288&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helga Nowotny''' (born 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n83-62721}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is Professor emeritus of [[Sociology of science and technology|Social Studies of Science]], [[ETH Zurich]]. She has held numerous leadership roles on Academic boards and public policy councils, and she has authored many publications the social studies of science and technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = NOWOTNY Helga|url = https://erc.europa.eu/organisation/helga-nowotny|website = ERC: European Research Council|accessdate = 2015-12-14|publisher = European Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Nowotny grew up in [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] during [[World War II]]. In interviews, she has recalled first wanting to become a scientist at the age of 8, when she was sent to [[Vorarlberg]], the westernmost province of Austria, and quickly learned the local dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Helga Nowotny, ERC President|url = http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2011/06/qanda-Helga-novotny.cfm|website = The Engineering and Technology Magazine|accessdate = 2015-12-14|last = Burrows|first = Erika|last2 = Vitaliev|first2 = Vitali|date = 13 Jun 2011|publisher = The Institution of Engineering and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowotny received her [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1959. After completing her degree, she faced opposition to her application for an assistant professorship in the Department of Criminology there on the basis of her being a woman. She agreed with the hiring professor that if a more capable man applied for the position, he could have the job. In the end, she was hired to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Helga Nowotny, President of the ERC: "Europe must regain its confidence through science"|url = http://www.kuleuven.be/english/news/2012/LIF/meet-the-honourees/interviews/helga-nowotny-president-of-the-european-research-council-europe-must-regain-its-confidence-through-science|website = KU Leuven|accessdate = 2015-12-14|publisher = KU Leuven}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that she became interested in the sociology of science. In 1965, she moved to [[New York City]] with her husband, where she enrolled in a sociology doctoral program. There, she met [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Robert K. Merton]], who mentored her throughout her education.&lt;ref name="NowotnyLeroy2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowotny|first1=Helga|last2=Leroy|first2=Pieter|title=Helga Nowotny: an itinerary between sociology of knowledge and public debate|journal=Natures Sciences Sociétés|volume=17|issue=1|year=2009|pages=57–64|issn=1240-1307|doi=10.1051/nss/2009010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Nowotny earned her Ph.D. in [[sociology]] at [[Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], where she completed her thesis on [[macrosociology]] and its methodology. She returned to Vienna to work as an Associate Professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies (Vienna)|Institute for Advanced Studies]].&lt;ref name="NowotnyLeroy2009" /&gt;

==Research and publications==
Nowotny's work in the 1970s and 1980s includes topics such as scientific controversies and technological [[risk]]s, social time, coping with [[uncertainty]], self-organization in science and [[gender]] relations in science, resulting in major monographs, co-edited and edited books and numerous articles. In 1989, she published the book ''Eigenzeit'' (English title: ''Time: The Modern and Postmodern Experience),'' which has since been translated into several languages.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Helga Nowotny awarded honorary doctorate|url = http://www.uib.no/en/svf/92065/helga-nowotny-awarded-honorary-doctorate|website = University of Bergen Faculty of Social Sciences|accessdate = 2015-12-14|publisher = University of Bergen|date = 3 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1995 Helga Nowotny has been President of the [[International Society for the Study of Time]]. 
From the 1990s onwards she focused her research activities on new topics in [[sociology of science and technology|social studies of science and technology]]. She conducted an empirical study on the discovery of high-superconductivity research and its impact on research policy (with [[Ulrike Felt]]) and increasingly on the changing relationship between [[science]] and [[society]].

In 1994 Nowotny helped coin the term “Mode 2” for a new mode of applied research focused on solving specific problems. By contrast, “Mode 1” is basic research done within disciplines, initiated by the interest of the investigator, not from external demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Helga Nowotny, new president of European Research Council|url = http://www.en.globaltalentnews.com/current_news/reports/3123/Helga-Nowotny-new-president-of-European-Research-Council.html|website = www.en.globaltalentnews.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14|publisher = GT Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research policy==
[[File:Helga Nowotny 01.JPG|left|thumb|Nowotny at a public speaking event in December 2015.]]
Next to her teaching and research activities, carried out at several universities and research institutions in Europe, Nowotny had always been intensely engaged in research policy. From 1985-1992 she was Chair of the Standing Committee for the [[Social Sciences]] of the [[European Science Foundation]]. She has been chair and member of the scientific advisory boards of numerous research institutions and policy-related committees throughout Europe. From 2001 until early 2006 she was Chair of [[EURAB]], the European Research Advisory Board of the European Commission.

Nowotny is one of the founding members of the [[European Research Council]], which has been established to fund frontier research at EU level based on the sole criteria of scientific excellence and pan-European competition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There she served as the Vice President and in February 2010, Nowotny was unanimously elected to the position of President of the [[European Research Council]] after the resignation of the founding president, [[Fotis Kafatos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Research Council Elects New President: Helga Nowotny|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/2010/02/european-research-council-elects-new-president-helga-nowotny|website = ScienceMag News|accessdate = 2015-12-14|last = Vogel|first = Gretchen|date = 19 Feb 2010|publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prof. Helga Nowotny appointed as new President of the European Research Council|url = http://epws.org/prof-helga-nowotny-appointed-as-new-president-of-the-european-research-council/|website = European Platform of Women Scientists|accessdate = 2015-12-14|publisher = European Platform of Women Scientists EPWS|date = 22 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As president of the ERC, she promoted increases in research funding across Europe, and advised new EU member states to increase funding support for their own research programs to prevent a "[[Brain-drain|brain drain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ERC stands firm on excellence: to get more grants, newer EU members need to try harder|url = http://www.sciencebusiness.net/news/75660/ERC-stands-firm-on-excellence-to-get-more-grants-newer-EU-members-need-to-try-harder|website = www.sciencebusiness.net|accessdate = 2015-12-14|publisher = Business Publishing Ltd.|last = Koekoek|first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held the position until December 2013.

In 2014, she was appointed chair of the ERA Council Forum Austria, which advises the Austrian Ministry of Science and Research at the interface of European and national research policy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Helga Nowotny - Princeton-Fung Global Forum|url = http://www.princeton.edu/fungforum/2014/speakers/helga-nowotny/|website = Princeton University|accessdate = 2015-12-14|publisher = The Trustees of Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Info-communications Media Development Authority''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''IMDA''') is a [[Statutory boards of the Singapore Government|statutory board]] of the [[Government of Singapore|Singapore government]], under the [[Ministry of Communications and Information]] (MCI). The IMDA was officially formed on 1 October 2016, with the restructuring of the Media Development Authority (MDA) and Infocomm Development Authority (IDA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDA, MDA to be restructured to capitalise on converging media and ICT landscape|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ida-mda-to-be/2433768.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GovTech about using technology to create citizen-centric solutions: CEO|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/govtech-about-using/2740916.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially legislated in Parliament on 18 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliament passes Info-communications Media Development Authority Bill|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/parliament-passes-info/3048966.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==

The '''Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore''' (IDA) was formed earlier in 1999 when the government merged the National Computer Board (NCB) and ''Telecommunication Authority of Singapore'' (TAS), as a result of a growing convergence of information technology and telephony. '''IDA''' is now split into '''GOVTECH''' [[Government Technology Agency]] and '''IMDA'''.

The Media Development Authority (MDA) was set up in 2003, with the merger of the Singapore Broadcasting Authority, the Films and Publications Department and the Singapore Film Commission, to champion the development of a vibrant media sector in Singapore.&lt;ref name=merger&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory Boards|url=http://www.mci.gov.sg/content/mci_corp/web/mci/statutoryboards.html|publisher=Mci.gov.sg|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smart Nation ==

IDA, along with the Smart Nation Program Office collaboratively work on Singapore's Smart Nation Program,&lt;ref&gt; https://www.smartnation.sg/&lt;/ref&gt; a national program to develop Singapore as a Smart Country. With the formation of GOVTECH&lt;ref&gt;https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parliament-bills-to-merge-ida-and-mda-and-to-form-new-govtech-agency-passed&lt;/ref&gt; agency, it will continue to address key technologies needed to implement smart nation platform. The areas specifically addressed by the Smart Nation Program include:

* Smart Health&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smartnation.sg/apps/page/1#3&lt;/ref&gt;

* Smart Transport&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smartnation.sg/apps/page/1#8&lt;/ref&gt;

* Smart Homes

==Intelligent Nation 2015==
IDA was in charge of the nation's 10-year infocomm masterplan, also known as [[IN2015|Intelligent Nation 2015]] (iN2015),&lt;ref name=in2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligent Nation 2015 (iN2015)|url=http://www.mci.gov.sg/content/mci_corp/web/mci/infocomm/developing_infocomm/masterplans/intelligent_nation2015in2015.html|publisher=Mci.gov.sg|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has since been superseded by the Infocomm Media 2025 plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Infocomm Media 2025|url = http://www.mci.gov.sg/infocomm-media-2025|website = Ministry of Communications and Information|access-date = 2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through iN2015, two key components introduced as part of the [[Next Generation National Infocomm Infrastructure]] (NGNII) initiative are, firstly, [[Wireless@SG]]—a wireless broadband programme developed by IDA&lt;ref name=wirelesssg&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Generation National Infocomm Infrastructure (Next Gen NII)|url=http://wiki.nus.edu.sg/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19631393|publisher=Wiki.nus.edu.sg|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and secondly, the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN)—a nationwide ultra-high speed broadband network supporting speeds of up to 1Gbs targeted for completion in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pushing Singapore's ICT ahead to 2015|url=http://www.zdnet.com/pushing-singapores-ict-ahead-to-2015-2062051752/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37024">'''Internalized racism''' is a form of [[internalized oppression]], defined by sociologist Karen D. Pyke as the "[[internalisation (sociology)|internalization]] of racial oppression by the racially subordinated."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pyke |first1=Karen D. |title=What is Internalized Racial Oppression and Why Don't We Study It? Acknowledging Racism's Hidden Injuries |journal=Sociological Perspectives |date=December 2010 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=551–572 |doi=10.1525/sop.2010.53.4.551}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her study ''The Psychology of Racism, '' Robin Nicole Johnson emphasizes that internalized racism involves both "conscious and unconscious acceptance of a racial hierarchy in which whites are consistently ranked above [[People of color|People of Color]]."&lt;ref&gt;Robin Nicole Johnson ''The Psychology of Racism: How Internalized Racism, Academic Self-concept, and Campus Racial Climate Impact the Academic Experiences and Achievement of African American Undergraduates''&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions encompass a wide range of instances, including, but not limited to, belief in negative racial stereotypes, adaptations to white cultural standards, and thinking that supports the status quo (i.e. denying that racism exists).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campón |first1=Rebecca Rangel |last2=Carter |first2=Robert T. |title=The Appropriated Racial Oppression Scale: Development and preliminary validation. |journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology |date=2015 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=497–506 |doi=10.1037/cdp0000037|pmid=25894835 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internalized racism as a phenomenon is a direct product of a racial classification system, and is found across different racial groups and regions around the world where [[Race (human categorization)|race]] exists as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these places, internalized racism can have adverse effects on those who experience it. For example, high internalized racism scores have been linked to poor health outcomes among Caribbean black women, higher propensity for violence among African American young males, and increased domestic violence among Native American populations in the US.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mouzon |first1=Dawne M. |last2=McLean |first2=Jamila S. |title=Internalized racism and mental health among African-Americans, US-born Caribbean Blacks, and foreign-born Caribbean Blacks |journal=Ethnicity &amp; Health |date=28 June 2016 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=36–48 |doi=10.1080/13557858.2016.1196652|pmid=27354264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=Wesley W. |title=Internalized Racism's Association With African American Male Youth's Propensity for Violence |journal=Journal of Black Studies |date=2011 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=690–707 |jstor=41151366 |pmid=21910273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poupart |first1=Lisa M. |title=The Familiar Face of Genocide: Internalized Oppression among American Indians |journal=Hypatia |date=2003 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=86–100 |jstor=3811013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to internalized racism have been varied. [[Internalized racism#Responses|Many of the approaches]] focus on dispelling false narratives learned from racial oppression. An example of opposition to internalized racism is the "[[Black is beautiful]]" cultural movement in the US, which sought to "directly attack [the] ideology" that blackness was ugly.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/video/black-is-beautiful/|title=Black is Beautiful {{!}} Video {{!}} The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross {{!}} PBS|work=The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross|accessdate=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and categorization ==
Although some definitions of internalized racism only include when racial [[stereotype]]s are internalized by the racial marginalized groups, internalized racism has been used to discuss much more than this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valenzuela|first=Angela|date=2010|title=Chapter 8: Uncovering Internalized Oppression|journal=Counterpoints|volume=356|pages=77–83|jstor=42980601}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of the Appropriated Racial Oppression Scale (AROS) note that perhaps a more accurate phrase would be "appropriated racial oppression," because this distances the usage away from potentially "victim blaming" implications that the internalization of racist ideals and attitudes is due to some failure of the oppressed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the term "[[Appropriation of knowledge|appropriation]]" indicates that internalized racism is learned from context, and therefore a product of [[socialization]] in a racialized society.

Alternatively, Bianchi, Zea, Belgrave, and Echeverry propose that internalized racism is a "state of racial self-conceptualization," conforming to racial oppression, as opposed to dissonance, resistance or the internalization of a positive racial identity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Internalized racism has also been referred to as [[indoctrination]] and [[Colonial mentality|mental colonization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These phrases draw attention to the historical context of [[colonialism]] being used to create and maintain a system of [[White supremacy|white superiority]].

Internalized racism is also explored in the Nigrescence model, introduced by [[William E. Cross Jr.|William E. Cross]] in 1971. It explains how internalized racism in Black Americans involves the belief that white cultural values are superior than their own. Cross writes, “The driving force behind this need requires Afro-Americans to seek approval from whites in all activities, to use white expectations as the yardstick for determining what is good, desirable or necessary.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1980-20869-001|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conviction can be corrected when black individuals self-determine their identities apart from the influence of their white counterparts.

=== Dimensions ===
Scholars have picked different dimensions to categorize internalized racism. Psychologists David and Okazaki proposed that examples of internalized racism could be divided into the following: "internalized inferiority, feelings of shame and embarrassment, physical characteristics, within-group discrimination, and minimization or acceptance of oppression."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Gabriel M.|last2=David|first2=E. J. R.|last3=Mapaye|first3=Joy C.|date=2018-07-23|title=Internalized racial oppression as a moderator of the relationship between experiences of racial discrimination and mental distress among Asians and Pacific Islanders.|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|doi=10.1037/aap0000124|issn=1948-1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Campón and Carter use this list: "appropriations of negative stereotypes, thinking that maintains status quo (denying racism), adaptation to white cultural standards, devaluation of own group, and emotional reactions."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These categories influence how scholars organize their measurements of internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Measures ===
Academics have attempted to create reliable measures of internalized racism, in order to test its [[Internalized racism#Implications|correlation to health outcomes]] and other variables of interest. Some examples of existing scales are the Nadanolitization (NAD) and Internalized Racial Oppression Scales (used for [[African Americans|Black Americans]]), the Colonial Mentality scale (used for [[Filipinos]]), and the Mochichua Tepehuani Scale (used for [[Chicano|Chicanx]]/[[Latino|Latinx]] populations).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Appropriated Racial Oppression Scale (AROS) is designed as measure for all racial minorities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the AROS, Campón and Carter use items such as "There have been times when I have been embarrassed to be a member of my race," "I would like for my children to have light skin," and "People take racial jokes too seriously" to assess an individual's level of internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Manifestations ==
To explore the dimensions of internalized racism mentioned above, here are some of the ways in which scholars have observed the effects of internalized racism.[[File:Fair and Handsome - Skin-Whitening Product in Supermarket - Bandarawela - Hill Country - Sri Lanka (14122094934).jpg|thumb|Skin-Whitening Product in Sri Lankan Supermarket]]
=== Self-image/beauty standards ===
An empirical example of internalized racism is [[Kenneth_and_Mamie_Clark#Doll_experiments|Kenneth and Mamie Clark's doll experiment]], which was done in America at a time when black and white children were segregated. It involved an African-American child being presented with two dolls that were identical apart from skin and hair color, one doll being white with yellow hair and the other being brown with black hair. The child was asked which doll they would prefer to play with and why. All children in the study expressed a clear preference for the white doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/segregation.aspx |title=Segregation Ruled Unequal, and Therefore Unconstitutional |publisher=Apa.org |date=2003-05-28 |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Kiri Davis recreated the experiment with 21 African-American preschool children for her documentary ''[[A Girl like Me (film)|A Girl Like Me]]''. Davis found that 15 of the children chose white dolls over black dolls, giving similar reasons as the original study subjects that associated white with "pretty" or "good" and black with "ugly" or "bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/documentary-studies-renew-debate-about-skin-colors-impact-465158/ |title=Documentary, studies renew debate about skin color's impact - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2006-12-26 |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an industry behind [[skin whitening]] products, which can be found from India to China to the United States. Because lighter skin is associated with desirable characteristics, people purchase such products in order to become lighter skinned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/skin-lightening-creams-are-dangerous-yet-business-is-booming-can-the-trade-be-stopped|title=Skin-lightening creams are dangerous – yet business is booming. Can the trade be stopped?|last=Khan|first=Coco|date=2018-04-23|website=the Guardian|accessdate=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stereotype threat ===
[[Stereotype threat]] is a phenomenon studied in psychology in which members of a stigmatized group risk conforming to negative stereotypes through internalization of their validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennington|first=Charlotte R.|last2=Heim|first2=Derek|last3=Levy|first3=Andrew R.|last4=Larkin|first4=Derek T.|date=2016-01-11|title=Twenty Years of Stereotype Threat Research: A Review of Psychological Mediators|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|pages=e0146487|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0146487|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4713435|pmid=26752551}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 study from Taylor, Garcia, Shelton and Yantis, note that both stereotype threat and a "black sheep effect" are products of internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Valerie Jones|last2=Garcia|first2=Randi L.|last3=Shelton|first3=J. Nicole|last4=Yantis|first4=Caitlyn|date=July 2018|title="A threat on the ground": The consequences of witnessing stereotype-confirming ingroup members in interracial interactions.|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=319–333|doi=10.1037/cdp0000190|pmid=29792484|issn=1939-0106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through being reminded of negative stereotypes associated with their race, participants responded with increased uncertainty, lower performance on tasks, and emotional reactions of anger and shame. They also sought to distance themselves from ingroup, stereotype confirming members, so as to avoid being targeted with negative generalizations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Stereotype threat from internalized racism goes beyond the individual. Those who experience internalized racism may end up projecting internalized negative attitudes onto others in their racial group. For example, teachers of color in the United States risk seeing their students through the lens of internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohli|first=Rita|date=2013-11-07|title=Unpacking internalized racism: teachers of color striving for racially just classrooms|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=17|issue=3|pages=367–387|doi=10.1080/13613324.2013.832935|issn=1361-3324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a teacher's expectations for a student's success can have empirical impacts on their educational outcomes, this puts students of color at an increased risk for impaired educational development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pygmalion in the classroom : teacher expectation and pupils' intellectual development|last=1933-|first=Rosenthal, Robert,|date=1992|publisher=Irvington Publishers|others=Jacobson, Lenore.|isbn=978-0829031539|edition= Newly expanded|location=New York|oclc=9080861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Intra/Interracial discrimination ===
Internalized racism manifests itself in both intraracial and inter[[racial discrimination]]. As an example of the intraracial case, Karen Pyke uses the term "defensive othering" to describe an individual or collective act of distancing oneself from members within one's own race that have a closer proximity to negative stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Defensive othering includes the use of the derogatory term "FOB" (short for "[[Fresh off the boat|Fresh Off the Boat]]") among Asian Americans. Although the racism towards newly arrived immigrants of Asian origin is neither the fault of the immigrants themselves or other Asian Americans, immigrants are often socially ostracized by members of their shared race because of internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In terms of interracial discrimination among the non-dominant racial groups, Robert E. Washington discusses "brown racism," his term for prejudice among non-black people of color towards black people, worldwide.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Washington|first=Robert E.|date=1990|title=Brown Racism and the Formation of a World System of Racial Stratification|journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society|volume=4|issue=2|pages=209–227|jstor=20006991}}&lt;/ref&gt; With examples from Egypt, China, India and other regions, Washington notes that, through internalized racism, non-black people of color are reproducing white desirability and a devaluation of blackness. Internalized racism goes beyond negative attitudes and beliefs about one's own group: one can internalize racism directed towards other races as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== In education ===
The educational environment students are surrounded in can result in the development of internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When students from a minority group are placed in a school where the teachers and/or peers are majority white, the lack of diverse representation can produce feelings of inferiority. The perception of the majority group as superior can compel minority students to take on the cultural norms of that group in order to prevent alienation. Furthermore, the predominately white curriculum incorporated into the education system can give minority students the impression that only Eurocentric history is important. This further makes underrepresented students internalize that the history of their origins are insignificant. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/chiclat26&amp;div=13&amp;id=&amp;page=&amp;collection=journals|title=Redirecting...|website=heinonline.org|accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples by region ==
Although much of the literature that has been produced on internalized racism has been confined to the African American experience in the United States, internalized racism is characteristic of systemic racism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a look at internalized racism in different geographical regions around the world.

=== Native Americans in present day United States ===
In order to create the nation of the United States on land that was already inhabited, a narrative of native inferiority was often employed to justify their subjugation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As a result of an overgeneralized picture of native peoples as being defeated and white invaders as victors, internalized racism continues to present itself in Native American communities. Julian Rice notes that apathy towards cultural traditions, self-centeredness, and materialistic obsession could all be seen as a adoption of narratives from the US government or missionaries that emphasized the superior mindset of whiteness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=Julian|date=1998|title="It Was Their Own Fault for Being Intractable": Internalized Racism and Wounded Knee|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=22|issue=1/2|pages=63–82|jstor=1185108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Poupart adds to these assertions, saying that Native Americans are forced into a "double consciousness," of being simultaneously deprived of past traditions and constantly reminded that those traditions were taken from them. Although she does not seek to use internalized racism to dismiss blame in cases of alcoholism, family violence, and sexual assault, she describes how the combination of stereotypes about the stoic and savage native, the introduction of physical violence to native communities through requiring children to go to boarding schools, and the adoption of white notions of patriarchy combined to create these types of violence and abuses in American Indian communities, where they had been virtually coexistent before European contact.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the case of alcoholism especially, internalized racism about native inferiority created conditions of dependency on European superiority, leading to the creation of negative stereotypes.

=== Brazil ===
[[File:Brazilians 001.JPG|thumb|Brazilians of different ethnicities from the end of the 19th century to the very beginning of the 20th century]]
Because Brazilians have many different ethnic origins, [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|race in brazil]] is often conceptualized as a [[racial democracy]]: a system that involves so much interracial marriage and interaction that systemic racism isn't a national problem. However, many scholars actually contest this definition, referring to this idea as "the myth of racial democracy," because prejudice and discrimination based on race is still prevalent.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=Fernanda T.|last2=Zea|first2=Maria Cecilia|last3=Belgrave|first3=Faye Z.|last4=Echeverry|first4=John J.|date=2002|title=Racial identity and self-esteem among Black Brazilian men: Race matters in Brazil too!|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1099-9809.8.2.157|journal=Cultural Diversity &amp; Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=8|issue=2|pages=157–169|doi=10.1037//1099-9809.8.2.157|issn=1099-9809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it is important to note that race, as a social construct, has a unique conceptualization in Brazil. As opposed the [[One-drop rule|"one-drop" rule]] employed in the US (i.e. "one-drop" of black blood constitutes a person's blackness), Brazilians recognize a spectrum of race and color-based identities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hordge-Freeman|first=Elizabeth|date=October 2013|title=What's love got to do with it?: racial features, stigma and socialization in Afro-Brazilian families|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=36|issue=10|pages=1507–1523|doi=10.1080/01419870.2013.788200|issn=0141-9870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major instance of internalized racism in Brazil comes out of this spectrum. A 1976 national survey found that there were over 100 colloquial terms in use to describe race-related phenotypes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Examples of these terms include "black (preto, negro), white (branco), brown or mixed (moreno, mulato), dark (escuro), light (claro), closed (fechado), freckled (sarard), and others."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Donna|date=1999|title="Interracial" Sex and Racial Democracy in Brazil: Twin Concepts?|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|issue=3|pages=563–578|jstor=683848}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of various terms for color and race often serves as evidence of the following notions, among others: whiteness is beauty, whiteness is clean, whiteness is successful and blackness is dirty.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Anthropologist Elizabeth Hordge-Freeman found this especially apparent when working with and around pregnant women in a poor and working-class neighborhood in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Women expressed a clear desire and preferential treatment for child that were "whiter" in appearance, even engaging in practices of pinching an infant's nose to try to make it smaller.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many of the women she worked with were racially black, or mixed race.

Additionally, race in Brazil is not confined to physical indicators. Individuals who are black can gain higher economic status and gain recognition as "white" or "whitened" by both black and white Brazilians alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ROLAND|first=L. KAIFA|date=2013-07-26|title=T/RACING BELONGING THROUGH CUBAN TOURISM|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume=28|issue=3|pages=396–419|doi=10.1111/cuan.12011|issn=0886-7356}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflates economic success with whiteness and poverty with blackness, as well as incentivizing the idea of "whitening," whether through "money whiteness" or interracial mixture.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This furthers the incidence of internalized racism by getting Brazilians of all race to have largely positive associations with whiteness and largely negative associations with blackness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Zimbabwe and Swaziland ===
In a study designed to compare the incidence of internalized racism in a country that underwent direct European colonization (Zimbabwe) and a country that has maintained is pre-colonial monarchy to date (Swaziland), social science researchers investigated the role of historical context and education in internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cort|first=Malcolm A.|last2=Tull|first2=Eugene S.|last3=Gwebu|first3=Keratiloe|last4=Dlamini|first4=Priscilla|last5=Pinkney|first5=Erica|last6=Gramby|first6=Eundene|last7=Cuthbertson|first7=Shanitria|last8=Daniels|first8=Ashley|last9=Luu|first9=Shay|date=December 2009|title=Education and internalized racism in socio-political context: Zimbabwe and Swaziland|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0362331909001104|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=46|issue=4|pages=644–655|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2009.08.001|issn=0362-3319|pmc=3151557|pmid=21833155}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major motivating factor for this study was the fact that internalized racism has largely gone unstudied in the African continent. The study found that, despite the scholars' hypothesis that Zimbabwe would have more internalized racism, there was no significant difference in internalized racism incidence between the countries. They believe that this is due to the widespread nature of racism systems, which still came into contact with Swaziland through trade relations.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They also found increased education had a significant negative correlation with internalized racism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== China ===
The case of China is of interest because some have argued that racism, and race itself doesn't exist in China.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dikötter|first=Frank|date=1994|title=Racial Identities in China: Context and Meaning|journal=The China Quarterly|issue=138|pages=404–412|jstor=654950}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dutch Historian Frank Dikötter argues that everything from the practice of using cranium weight between races as a measure of white and Chinese superiority to the [[Nanjing anti-African protests|physical attacks and demonstrations of Chinese university students against African students]] make it clear that race is indeed recognized in China.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Indeed the context of race and [[Ethnic issues in China|racism in China]] is heavily affected by the fact that the large majority of the county is identified as Han Chinese (90.56% of the reported population in 2005).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Dong|date=April 2010|title=Policing and racialization of rural migrant workers in Chinese cities|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=33|issue=4|pages=593–610|doi=10.1080/01419870903325651|issn=0141-9870}}&lt;/ref&gt; 55 minority ethnic groups are recognized by the government, giving the government the power to dictate different groups as legitimate (and therefore eligible for less taxes, more subsidies and less restrictions) or illegitimate. This creates an environments in which groups attempt to gain their validation and sense of worth from the dominant Han Chinese and the state, internalizing a subordinate position. Because this system involves policing of social groups, it also involves discriminatory practices which are then internalized by both recognized and unrecognized minority groups.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Implications ==
This section discusses the implications of internalized racism, and why the topic is significant. It should be noted that examples of psychological harm related to internalized racism are not given in attempt to describe internalized racism as product of the psyche of the oppressed. Internalized racism is not defined as a weakness in the minds of the oppressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Health ===
High scores on internalized racism have been repeatedly correlated with a variety of poor psychological and physical health outcomes among sample populations including African Americans, US-Born Caribbean Blacks, foreign-born Caribbean Blacks, Filipino Americans, non-American Pacific Islanders and multiracial samples of Americans.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

A study conducted by researchers Mouzon and McLean found that there is a positive correlation between internalized racism in black individuals and the state of their mental health, specifically depression and psychological distress. The results showed that African-Americans and US-born Caribbean Blacks embodied more internal racism, and thus experienced poorer mental health than foreign born Caribbean Blacks. &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A similar study by researchers Graham and West discovered that anxiety is also correlational to internalized racism in black individuals. This conclusion is significant considering that, “... anxiety disorders have been found to be more persistent in Black American populations as compared to other racial groups.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Jessica R.|last2=West|first2=Lindsey M.|last3=Martinez|first3=Jennifer|last4=Roemer|first4=Lizabeth|date=July 2016|title=The mediating role of internalized racism in the relationship between racist experiences and anxiety symptoms in a Black American sample|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26750994|journal=Cultural Diversity &amp; Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=369–376|doi=10.1037/cdp0000073|issn=1099-9809|pmid=26750994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study goes on to describe the methods therapists can take to mitigate the anxiety in black individuals caused by internalized racism, such as rationalizing negative thoughts.

Asian Americans are also subject to internalized racism, and the Internalized Racism in Asian Americans Scale (IRAAS) was created by researchers to determine the extent in which Asian Americans accepted the negative stereotypes about themselves. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Andrew Young|last2=Israel|first2=Tania|last3=Maeda|first3=Hotaka|date=January 2017|title=Development and evaluation of the Internalized Racism in Asian Americans Scale (IRAAS)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28068131|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|pages=52–64|doi=10.1037/cou0000183|issn=0022-0167|pmid=28068131}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results revealed that there is a correlation between mental health and the degree in which Asian Americans subscribe to the adverse racial stereotypes. These effects include lower self esteem, symptoms of depression, and general psychological distress. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keum|first=Brian TaeHyuk|last2=Brady|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Sharma|first3=Rajni|last4=Lu|first4=Yun|last5=Kim|first5=Young Hwa|last6=Thai|first6=Christina J.|date=October 2018|title=Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Asian American Women: Development and initial validation|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30058827|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=65|issue=5|pages=571–585|doi=10.1037/cou0000305|issn=0022-0167|pmid=30058827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more examples of studies that show significant relations of internalized racism to increased incidence of anxiety and depression, low individual and collective self-esteem, low sense of ethnic identity, lower levels of life satisfaction, higher body fat measures and other measures of psychological distress, please see the [[#Further Reading|Further Reading]] section below. These studies imply that internalized racism subjects the racially oppressed to a wide range of adverse mental and physical health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Contributing to systemic racism ===
In her book, ''What Does It Mean to Be White? Developing White Racial Literacy'', Robin DiAngelo describes the cycle of racism as a [[Feedback|feedback loop]] that uses power, control, and economics to go from (1) systematic mistreatment of a group to creation of misinformation to, (2) societal acceptance of misinformation to, (3) internalized oppression and internalized dominance to, (4) racism perpetuated and enforced by institutions, leading to, (4) justification for further mistreatment.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiAngelo|first=Robin|date=2012|title=Chapter 5: The Cycle of Oppression|journal=Counterpoints|volume=398|pages=65–77|jstor=42981485}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, internalized racism is involved in reinforcing racism, and ensuring that it continues. It creates a justification for continued mistreatment of the racially subjugated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, it can create an acceptance of the status quo, leading some to conclude that racism is not an issue that needs to be addressed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If members of racially oppressed groups internalize the validity of their own oppression, they have no reason to contest the system. Internalized racism can also be seen as a means of "[[dividing and conquering]]" racially subordinate groups to create conflicts between them and suppress united efforts to contest racism.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHISOM|first=RON|last2=BILLINGS|first2=DAVID|date=2003|title=Overcoming Internalized Racial Oppression: A challenge to the people of color Environmental Justice Movement|journal=Race, Poverty &amp; the Environment|volume=10|issue=1|pages=29–30|jstor=41554368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==
[[File:KAS-Black is beautiful-Bild-5479-2.jpg|thumb|KAS-Black is beautiful-Bild-5479-2]]Many have offered approaches to address internalized racism. Ron Chisom, the co-founder and executive director of The People's Institute for Survival and Beyond in New Orleans, suggests a six-point approach for those who experience internalized racism:&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

# Analyze internalized racial oppression in its historical and cultural context
# Recognize negative messages, and have programs to undo/unlearn them
# Learn about how internalized [[racial superiority]] spreads among the racially dominant
# Organize with members of other racially oppressed groups
# Celebrate community and culture
# Support [[community organizing]] and [[leadership development]]&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

David W. Concepción notes that because confronting internalized oppression often creates a paradox for people having to see themselves as both a victim and perpetrator of that oppression, a major factor in addressing internalized oppression is being able to confront false narratives while at the same time employing self-forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Concepción|first=David W.|date=2009|title=Overcoming Oppressive Self-Blame: Gray Agency in Underground Railroads|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=1|pages=81–99|jstor=20618122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Weinblatt and Cheryl Harrison emphasize that one must acknowledge that race is a social category with real implications while at the same time reject the falsehoods behind racist attitudes. Because finding this balance can be difficult, it is often helpful to have separate spaces for those who experience internalized oppression and those who experience internalized privilege. Additionally, Weinblatt makes it clear that there is a need for those with privilege to risk it in order to seek the end of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinblatt|first=Marc|last2=Harrison|first2=Cheryl|date=2011|title=CHAPTER TWO: Theatre of the Oppressor: Working with Privilege Toward Social Justice|journal=Counterpoints|volume=416|pages=21–31|jstor=42981325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a movement that considers some of the above considerations is the "[[Black is beautiful|Black is Beautiful]]" movement. These efforts began during the [[Black Power movement|Black Power]] movement in the [[1960s in the United States]]. In order to contest the narratives that blackness was something ugly, inferior and less valuable, members of the Black community began fighting back with advertising and other media campaigns.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The idea behind the movement has persisted to the present day, with social media based movements such as "[[Black Girl Magic]]" and "Black Boy Joy" that aim to celebrate blackness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-everyones-saying-black-girls-are-magic-20150909-htmlstory.html|title=Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic' - Los Angeles Times|last=Thomas|first=Dexter|website=latimes.com|accessdate=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential healing for African Americans ==
Dr. Watts-Jones indicates in her study that there is a possible method in which African Americans can overcome their internalized racism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watts-Jones|first=Dee|date=December 2002|title=Healing Internalized Racism: The Role of a Within-Group Sanctuary Among People of African Descent|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1545-5300.2002.00591.x|journal=Family Process|volume=41|issue=4|pages=591–601|doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.2002.00591.x|issn=0014-7370}}&lt;/ref&gt; By finding sanctuary within the African American community, members are able to achieve mental and physical security from their racist environment. Dr. Watts-Jones states that the collective experience of pain in African Americans work in tandem to heal together. However, the process of healing can be extended outside the African American community, by allowing other racial groups to perceive African Americans’ internalized racism as well. In doing so, White people can be utilized as an ally rather than another force of oppression.

The '''Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA)''' is an Israeli research institute specializing in public diplomacy and foreign policy founded in 1976. Currently, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs's research portfolio consists of five primary initiatives: the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA), Defensible Borders Initiative, Jerusalem in International Diplomacy, Iran and the New Threats to the West, and Combating Delegitimization.&lt;ref&gt;"About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the think-tank concentrates on the topics of Iran, Radical Islam, the Middle East, Israel, the Peace Process, Jerusalem, Anti-Semitism, and World Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;"Books," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/#&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also publishes the academic journal, ''[https://www.jstor.org/journal/jewpolstudrev Jewish Political Studies Review]''. The journal is published biannually and is "the first and only journal dedicated to the study of Jewish political institutions and behavior, Jewish political thought, and Jewish public affairs."&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish Political Studies Review," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/jpsr-back-issues/jpsr-about/&lt;/ref&gt; The research institute is a registered non-profit organization and produces content in English, Hebrew, French, and German.&lt;ref&gt;"Support Us," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/support-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs also produces the ''[http://www.dailyalert.org/ Daily Alert]'' for the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], a daily news summary and analysis concerning Israel, Iran, radical Islam, and other regional security issues distributed through email.&lt;ref&gt;"Daily Alert," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, June 13, 2017, http://www.dailyalert.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the research behind the ''Daily Alert'' is conducted by the Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs Director of Internet Publishing Mark Amiel.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"&gt;"Key People," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/key-people/&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''Daily Alert'' is published in the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs office in Jerusalem, the time-zone difference between its publication and much of its targeted audience in Europe and North America is greatly beneficial. In part, the project was conceived to ensure that politicians and thought leaders would have an authoritative source of the most important daily news on their desk every morning. According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs website, a member of the United States Department of State commented that, "The [Daily] ''Alert'' is one of the first things I turn to in the morning for information and insight on what may be the talk of the town that day. I'm better prepared because of them."&lt;ref&gt;"What Readers Say About Daily Alert," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/what-readers-say-about-daily-alert/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs was established in 1978 by [[Daniel Elazar]] as an umbrella organization encompassing the Center for Jewish Community Studies and the Jerusalem Institute for Federal Studies. Elazar personally raised most of the funds for the operation of the organization and the restoration of an historic building on Tel Hai Street in Jerusalem, named in honor of the Milken family.&lt;ref name="Elazar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/vp-420-gerstenfeld.htm |title=The Intellectual World of Daniel Elazar |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, Beit Milken, served as the Embassy of [[Uruguay]] from 1957 to 1980, when Uruguay decided to move their embassy to [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="Uruguay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8-ZUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=i5IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6410%2C1424678 |title=Uruguay Embassy Leaves Jerusalem |publisher=The Age |date=1980-08-18 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the 1,200 ton building was moved 16 meters on rails to reach the site it currently occupies.&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/our-building-a-protected-jerusalem-landmark/ |title=Our Building: A Protected Jerusalem Landmark |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Dore Gold]], Israel’s former ambassador to the [[UN]] and former foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], headed the Jerusalem Center from 2000&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/about/|title=About the Jerusalem Center |publisher=jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 2015, when he took a [[leave of absence]] to become director-general of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keinon|first=Herb|title=Dore Gold picked as new Foreign Ministry director-general|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Dore-Gold-picked-as-new-Foreign-Ministry-director-general-404015|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://jcpa.org/dore-gold-returns-to-head-the-jerusalem-center-for-public-affairs/ Dore Gold has returned] as president of the Jerusalem Center.

==Policy positions==

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is an organisation which largely focuses on Israeli security, regional diplomacy, and international law.&lt;ref&gt;"Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs Home Page," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of the organization's positions regarding final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians was articulated within their ''Defensible Borders Initiative''. A continuing project dating back to the early-2000s, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has made explicit their stance on the matter, particularly in a YouTube video released in May 2010.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;"Israel's Critical Security Needs for a Viable Peace," The Jerusalem Center, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWmPqY8TE0&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the Jordan Rift Valley, the organization is opposed to the presence of international peacekeeping troops given their poor track-record in the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and Southern Lebanon (see [[United Nations Emergency Force]] and [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]]). Accordingly, the organization argues that Israel must retain control of the Jordan Valley. Concerning the future of the Palestinian territories, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs advocates for demilitarization and Israel's ability to exercise control of airspace and electromagnetic communications throughout Judea and Samaria (otherwise known as the West Bank).

Research conducted by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs fellow Nadav Shragai, as well as, the organization's program ''Jerusalem in International Diplomacy'' maintain that Jerusalem should remain unified and under Israeli sovereignty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Jerusalem in International Diplomacy," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/jerusalem/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the organization is unequivocally opposed, and actively seeks to undermine, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Another core program of the institute, ''Combating Delegitimization and BDS'', alongside the work of scholar Dan Diker demonstrates the movement's objectives of achieving a one-state solution, dismantling Israel, and its correlation with anti-Semitism incidents.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Combating Delegitimization and BDS," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/combating-delegitimization-and-bds/&lt;/ref&gt;

The think-tank is a supporter of the two-state solution calling for a "demilitarized Palestinian state" alongside Israel.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

As well, it should be noted that the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs does not comment, publish, or advocate any explicit policy decisions concerning Israeli domestic security. Accordingly, no articles, videos, or major publications on the think-tank's website will discuss political coalitions in Israel nor mention its major parties (e.g. Likud, Zionist Union, etc.).

==Institutes and publications==
The Jerusalem Center founded the '''Institute for Contemporary Affairs''' (ICA) jointly with the Wechsler Family Foundation.&lt;ref name="Melson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeforecast.org/richard863/MIDDLEEAST/JCPA-ISRAELIZATIONOFWASHINGTON.html |title=Israelization of Washington Policy: the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |publisher=CambridgeForecast.org |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director of the ICA is Ambassador [[Alan Baker (diplomat)|Alan Baker]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambassadoralanbaker.com/about/ |title=About Alan Baker |publisher=AmbassadorAlanBaker.com |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112233533/http://ambassadoralanbaker.com/about/ |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this outlet, the JCPA publishes ''Jerusalem Issue Briefs'' and ''Jerusalem Viewpoints''.&lt;ref name="ICA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/program/institute-for-contemporary-affairs/ |title=Institute of Contemporary Affairs |publisher =JCPA.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also publish the twice-yearly ''Strategic Perspectives'', special reports presenting studies on Israeli security and diplomacy topics by the Contributing Editors board of the ICA.&lt;ref name="StratPer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=45269 |title=JCPA Strategic Perspectives |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JCPA is also the publisher of the ''Jewish Political Studies Review'', an academic journal which publishes articles on Jewish public affairs, Jewish institutions and behavior, and Jewish political thought. It is published twice yearly.&lt;ref name="JPSR"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction |journal=Jewish Political Studies Review |volume=23 |date=Spring 2011 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, JCPA founded the '''Institute for Global Jewish Affairs''' in response to growing international anti-Semitism. Directed by [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]], the institute addresses a variety of topics related to Jewish communities around the world.&lt;ref name="ovguide.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/institute-for-global-jewish-affairs-9202a8c04000641f8000000009273a03#|title=Watch "Institute for Global Jewish Affairs" Video|work=OVGuide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute helps direct the "Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project" and its associated monthly publication "Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism," both of which attend to global anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="unmaskedthemovie.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmaskedthemovie.com/learn_more/related_websites.html|title=UNMASKED JUDEOPHOBIA - The Threat to Civilization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More can be learned about these below in the Programs and Initiatives section. The JCPA also produces a related publication entitled "Changing Jewish Communities," which is less focused on global anti-Semitism and, therefore, addresses a wide variety of issues related to global Jewish communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/results.cfm?PublicationName=Changing%20Jewish%20Communities|title=Publication name Changing Jewish Communities  - Berman Jewish Policy Archive @ Stanford University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the JCPA has organized a publication called "Jewish Environmental Studies," which looks deeply at Jewish environmental studies as a separate and important field and analyzes Jewish environmental thought through references from the [[Bible]] and classic Jewish texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjpa.org/Publications/details.cfm?PublicationID=3847|title=Jewish Environmental Studies: a New Field|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their written publications, the JCPA produces numerous videos that analyze a variety of issues pertaining to Israel and the Middle East. These include videos created by the center as well as videos of JCPA contributors appearing in various news outlets or conference venues. The videos can be found on the JCPA website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/media/videos/|title=TheJerusalemCenter|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on the JCPA’s YouTube page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJerusalemCenter|title=TheJerusalemCenter|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent publications==

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs has recently published multiple studies relating to Israeli security, international diplomacy, and the status of Jerusalem. As part of the organization's emphasis on making their material public and accessible, all of their major survey studies are digitalized and published on their website.&lt;ref&gt;"Books," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/book/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the so-called 'Knife Intifada', the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs published a collection edited by in-house scholar [[Fiamma Nirenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiamma Nirenstein, ed., "Lessons from Israel's Response to Terrorism," 2017, http://jcpa.org/lessons-israels-response-terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; The collaborative project features articles by, among others, former Ambassadors Dore Gold, 
Alan Baker, and Freddy Eytan, as well as Brigadier General Yossi Kuperwasser and Dan Diker. The overarching theme of the publication focused on the similarity, rather than the misconceived differences, between terrorism in Israel and Europe. Moreover, several articles presented a valuable sociological exploration of Israeli society and its penchant for preparedness, vigilance, and resilience.

Another seminal work published in 2016 by in-house scholar Dan Diker was an in-depth exploration of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction (BDS) movement. Entitled ''[http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends]'', Diker traces the roots of the BDS movement arguing that it represents only the most recent incarnation of a historical attempt to boycott Israel. The publication also references foundational members of BDS (e.g. [[Omar Barghouti]]) in demonstrating the movement's support for the one-state solution and dismantling of the Israeli state.&lt;ref name="Dan Diker"&gt;Dan Diker, BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2016), 6-8, http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6&amp;ndash;8}} The book also demonstrates a powerful relationship between BDS activities and anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses.&lt;ref name="Dan Diker"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jerusalem also features largely in the think-tank's work. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs scholar, [[Nadav Shragai]], published a historical and legal evaluation of Jerusalem and the city's role in final status peace negotiations entitled ''&lt;ref name="Nadav Shragai"&gt;Nadav Shragai, Jerusalem: Delusions of Division (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;''. Informed, in part, by recent polling data from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Shragai argues that a majority of Jerusalem's Arabs favour preserving their Israeli citizenship rather than substituting it for a Palestinian one.&lt;ref name="Nadav Shragai"/&gt;{{rp|Preface}} More importantly for Shagrai, Jerusalem's Arab community is increasingly being incorporated into the Jewish municipal fabric and represents a valuable dimension to future negotiations over the status of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Nadav Shragai"/&gt;{{rp|Introduction}}

==Conferences==

On March 24, 2014, the Jerusalem Center held a conference entitled "Europe and Israel: A New Paradigm." The conference focused on the complicated relationship between Israel and [[Europe]], including topics such as economics and the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS]] movement, security and anti-Semitism. The conference was well attended and received a significant amount of press, including articles in ''[[The Times of Israel]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-ready-to-pay-palestinians-who-renounce-right-of-return/|title=EU ready to pay Palestinians who renounce right of return|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/EU-aid-package-meant-to-assure-Israel-that-Palestine-wont-become-a-failed-state-346334|title=EU aid package meant to assure Israel that ‘Palestine’ won't become a failed state|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; J-Wire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwire.com.au/news/lovehate-relationship/41528 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406204045/http://www.jwire.com.au/news/lovehate-relationship/41528 |archivedate=2014-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ynetnews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4502877,00.html|title=EU-Israel ties growing, despite disagreements|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CBN News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2014/March/Israeli-EU-Trade-Relations-in-Tact/|title=Israeli, EU Trade in Tact Despite BDS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and initiatives==

===Defensible Borders initiative===

One of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs major research initiatives, Defensible Borders for Israel, seeks to "analyzes current terror threats and Israel's corresponding territorial requirements, particularly in the strategically vital West Bank." The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs maintains that Israel must continue to exercise this right to preserve Israel's security requirements.&lt;ref&gt;"Defensible Borders for Israel," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/defensible-borders-for-israel/&lt;/ref&gt;

The program's inception dates back to a joint conference with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in 2004. Accordingly, the think-tank deepened its ties with organizations including the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and the Herzliya Conference based on presentations concerning "defensible borders". According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the organization played a pivotal role in publicizing the term "defensible borders" and its ascension within the lexicon of contemporary Middle Eastern security issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Defensible Borders for Israel," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/program/defensible-borders-for-israel&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jerusalem Center for Public Affair's most recent publication emanating from this initiative was published in 2014 entitled, [http://jcpa.org/requirements-for-defensible-borders/ ''Israel's Critical Requirements for Defensible Borders: The Foundation for a Secure Peace'']. The monograph is the latest version of an earlier study, ''Israel's Critical Security Requirements for Defensible Borders: The Foundations for a Viable Peace''. Most of the updated material was added in late 2013 and early 2014. The publication included sections written by [[Moshe Ya'alon|Moshe Yaalon]], [[Dore Gold]], [[Uzi Dayan]], [[Yossi Kuperwasser]], and [[Dan Diker]]. The content ranged from Israel's long-term security needs and defensible borders, to the shortcomings of United Nations Resolution 242 and key principles for a demilitarized Palestinian state.

===Combating delegitimization and BDS===

A core component of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs concerns efforts by the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement to [[Delegitimisation|delegitimize]] Israel. According to the organization's website, the initiative "is a major multilingual public diplomacy program" which seeks to expose those who undermine Israel's very legitimacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This programme entails reinforcing the connection between "the Jewish people and their historical homeland including Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Many of the institute's scholars, including Dan Diker and Ambassador Alan Baker, have published extensively on subjects pertaining to this initiative. This includes Dan Diker's ''[http://jcpa.org/pdf/Unmasking_.pdf BDS Unmasked: Radical Roots, Extremist Ends]'' as well as Ambassador Baker's ''[http://jcpa.org/overview_palestinian_manipulation/ Palestinian Manipulation of the International Community]''.

===Jerusalem in international diplomacy===

Jerusalem's centrality to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) has ensured that it is a subject which garners disproportionate scrutiny.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The intermingling of religious, political, and legal dimensions has encouraged the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs to publish extensively on the subject. Spearheaded by Nadav Shragai, the initiative has led to such publications as, ''[http://jcpa.org/jerusalem-delusions-division/ Jerusalem: Delusions of Division]'' (2015), ''Jerusalem: Correcting the International Discourse'' (2012), and ''[http://jcpa.org/al-aksa-is-in-danger-libel/ The 'Al-Aksa Is in Danger Libel: The History of a Lie]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;"Nadav Shragai," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/researcher/nadav-shragai/&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined in the organization's policy video, the interlocking Arab and Jewish neighbourhoods of Jerusalem make division unfeasible. Mindful of Jerusalem's history during the Jordanian occupation when religious freedoms were curtailed, the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs believes that the city must remain undivided and under Israeli sovereignty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Iran and the New Threats to the West===

This program focuses on security threats posed by Iran to Israel and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/about/|title=About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|work=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program began with a publication entitled “Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide,” authored by [[Dore Gold]] and [[Elie Wiesel]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots777=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=43807|title=Referral of Iranian President Ahmadinejad on the Charge of Incitement to Commit Genocide|author=ISN Editors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was created in response to multiple threats directed toward Israel by the Iranian leader, including a 2006 declaration that “Israel should be wiped off the map.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/articleuploads/iran_infocus1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105105359/http://www.brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/articleuploads/iran_infocus1.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The JCPA continues to monitor security threats posed by Iran in the post-Ahmadinejad era with this program.

===Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project===

Initiated by [[Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld]], the program focuses on anti-Semitism after the Holocaust and "its origins and lessons, manifestations and mutations."&lt;ref name="gerstenfeld"&gt;"Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism," Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, http://jcpa.org/publication/phas/&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative produces a monthly publication which addresses issues concerning past and presents acts directed against World Jewry and, among other issues, highlights anti-Israel boycotts, the manipulation of Holocaust history, and anti-Semitism emanating from Muslim and Christian communities. The program consists of conferences, seminars, lectures, interviews, and essays. As well, its content is available in English and French. The most recent publication, "[http://jcpa.org/article/why-new-academic-discipline-post-holocaust-studies-established-what-content/ Why a New Academic Discipline of Post-Holocaust Studies Should Be Established and What Its Content Should Be]", argues that while the Holocaust has been instrumental in shaping modern society, its study is often confined to mass murder while its continued influence today is often neglected.&lt;ref name="gerstenfeld"/&gt;

===Global Law Forum===

This program covers issues pertaining to Israel and international law. The goal of the program is to “protect Israel’s legal rights in its conflict with the Palestinians, the Arab world, and radical Islam.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=wYZdOSthmdoC |page=237 |title=Israel’s Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics include the legality of settlements, human rights, and Israeli border issues, among others. [[Avi Bell]] directs the program. Additional contributors include Robert Sabel, [[Ruth Lapidoth]], Irit Kohn, [[Alan Baker (diplomat)|Alan Baker]], [[Meir Rosenne]], and [[Justus Weiner]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

'''John Ince''' (born {{birth date|1952|5|30}}) is a Canadian activist, politician, author, and lawyer. He is a founder of [[The Sex Party]], a [[sex-positive movement]] political party of which he was party leader from 2005 until 2012.

==Sex-positive activism==
In 2002, Ince opened The Art of Loving, a [[sex shop]] in Vancouver, Canada. It sells art, instructional books and videos and pleasure products. It also produces almost one hundred sexual seminars a year, some led by Ince. He produced an erotic event at The Art of Loving that garnered international media attention in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Girard|first=Daniel|title=Will sex on stage tempt police to act?|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=15 June 2013|url=http://www.artofloving.ca/about-us/sexual-politics/will-sex-stage-tempt-police-act|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Charlie|title=Art of Loving unveils planet-friendly sex toy|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/art-loving-unveils-planet-friendly-sex-toy|work=Georgia Straight|publisher=Vancouver Free Press|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=Jul 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Ince and many other erotic arts activists founded [[The Sex Party]], the world’s first officially registered sex-positive political party.  Ince was party leader from 2005 until 2012. He and others ran as candidates in two provincial general elections in 2005 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley|first=Pieta|title=Sex Party leader John Ince to run against Premier Gordon Campbell|url=https://www.straight.com/article-205114/sex-party-leader-john-ince-run-against-premier-gordon-campbell|work=Georgia Straight|accessdate=1 June 2018|date=Mar 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Ince and [[Marke Brunke]] founded VancouverMensGroups.org, a website, to facilitate the formation of groups of men who are interested in connecting at a deeper level than usually occurs at social events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Takeuchi|first=Craig|title=Best of Vancouver 2012 communities: It’s raining men who are addressing men's issues|url=https://www.straight.com/article-782061/vancouver/its-raining-men-who-are-learning-be-men|work=Georgia Straight|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=Sep 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

Ince began practicing law in the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianlawlist.com/listingdetail/contact/john-g-ince-556347/ |title=John Ince |work=CanadianLawList |publisher=Thomson Reuters Canada Limited|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on environmental issues but gradually moved to the human rights field, specializing in sexual issues. He represented performers and individual citizens fighting sexual [[censorship]] laws. One of his cases, ''Luscher v. Canada'',&lt;ref&gt;Luscher v. Deputy Minister, Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise, [1985] 1 F.C. 85;&lt;/ref&gt; was successful in striking down as unconstitutional a federal law that had prohibited sexual material from entering Canada for over one hundred years. He represented the Canadian [[polyamory]] community in the 2011 constitutional reference case concerning Canada’s [[polygamy]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyamorists want court to declare group love legal|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f4471aae-27b3-453c-b343-893c5cc7a5fd|work=Vancouver Sun|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=September 9, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512065642/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f4471aae-27b3-453c-b343-893c5cc7a5fd|archivedate=12 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

Ince's first two books concerned the then emerging field of environmental law.  Both ''Environmental Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ince|first=John G.|title=Environmental Law: A Study of Legislation Affecting the Environment of British Columbia|origyear=1979|year=1984|publisher=Centre for Continuing Education|location=Vancouver, BC, Canada|isbn=0919365019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Land Use Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ince|first=John G|title=Land Use Law|origyear=1978|year=1984|publisher=Butterworths|location=Canada|isbn=0409988634}}&lt;/ref&gt; were
first published by the [[West Coast Environmental Law|West Coast Environmental Law Association]]  and then by the legal publisher [[Butterworths]].

Ince’s third title, ''Sea Kayaking Canada’s West Coast''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ince|first=John G.|title=Sea Kayaking Canada's West Coast|year=1982|publisher=Raxas Books|location=Vancouver, BC, Canada|isbn=0898863422}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was co-authored with Hedi Kottner. It was in print for 20 years and was the first paddling guide to the sport of ocean kayaking.

Ince wrote ''The BC Guide to Buying Rural and Recreational Property'' in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ince|first=John G.|title=The BC Guide to Buying Rural and Recreational Property|year=1993|publisher=Pivitol Press|location=Vancouver, BC, Canada|isbn=0-9696567-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the only detailed guide to the process of acquiring property outside cities in British Columbia.

Ince worked on and off for almost twenty years researching his 2003 publication ''[[The Politics of Lust]]'', ([[Prometheus Books]]) which argues that irrational sexual fear is pervasive in our culture, that it is largely unrecognized, and that it affects our political orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Daniel|title=Sexual freedom|url=https://www.straight.com/sexual-freedom|work=Georgia Straight|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=Dec 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book, ''Joyshift: the journey to primal happiness''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ince|first=John G.|title=Joyshift: the journey to primal happiness|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9696567-2-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joyshift.org/book|title=Joyshift book announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that the ingredients for happiness were genetically set in the hunter-gatherer era, and describes a daily practice to make use of these "primal nutrients of happiness" in modern-day life.

{{Israel cities labeled map}}
This list includes localities that are in [[Israel]] as well as [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] that the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Interior]] has designated as a [[City council (Israel)|city council]]. The West Bank is internationally recognized as [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian territory]] held under [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli occupation]]; Jerusalem includes occupied East Jerusalem. The list is based on the current index of the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)]]. Within [[Local government in Israel|Israel's system of local government]], an urban municipality can be granted a city council by the Interior Ministry when its population exceeds 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/State/Democracy/Pages/Israeli%20Democracy%20-%20How%20does%20it%20work.aspx |title=Israeli Democracy: How Does It Work? |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=8 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622174411/http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/state/democracy/pages/israeli%20democracy%20-%20how%20does%20it%20work.aspx |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "city" does not generally refer to [[Local council (Israel)|local council]]s or [[urban agglomeration]]s, even though a defined city often contains only a small portion of an [[urban area]] or [[metropolitan area]]'s population.

==List==
===Israel===
Israel has 15 cities with populations over 100,000, including [[Jerusalem]] at over 500,000 (including occupied [[East Jerusalem]]), and [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |title=Inventory of World Cities |publisher=Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network |accessdate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014191556/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/citylist.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, there are 77 Israeli localities granted "municipalities" (or "city") status by the Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_22&amp;CYear=2018 2.22 Localities and Population, by Municipal Status and District], 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Two more cities are planned: [[Kasif, Israel|Kasif]], a [[planned city]] to be built in the [[Negev]], and [[Harish, Israel|Harish]], originally a small town currently being built into a large city. The area and population of [[Jerusalem]] includes that of East Jerusalem which has been ''[[de facto]]'' annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem's municipal borders under the [[Jerusalem Law]]. This, however, is not recognized by the international community who regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/2001/israel_and_the_palestinians/issues/1682594.stm |title=Jerusalem: Crucible of the conflict |last=Symon |first=Fiona |date=4 December 2001 |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/jerusalem |title=Background on East Jerusalem |date=8 July 2012 |publisher=B'Tselem |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of [[psychedelic drug]]s of various classes. [[Serotonergic psychedelics]] are usually considered to be the classical psychedelics, whereby the other classes are often only considered to have secondary psychedelic properties. Some of these compounds may be classified differently or under several categories, due to unique structural classification, multiple mechanisms of action, or to the fact that the precise [[pharmacodynamic]] actions of psychedelic drugs are not yet completely understood. Also, due to the vast amount of possible substitutions and analogs of psychedelic compounds, their total number is quite large and is not fully reflected within this list, leaving room for many that have not yet been sufficiently investigated and even others that have not yet been discovered.

Entries marked with a '#' are naturally occurring compounds.

Most [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] immigrants arrived in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in the 2000s, when the [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Irish economy]] started booming.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} According to Census 2011, there are 36,683 people of Lithuanian birth resident in the Republic of Ireland. Approximately one third of these Lithuanians live in [[County Dublin]].&lt;ref name="cso"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=CD707&amp;PLanguage=0|title=Beyond 20/20|work=Census 2006|publisher=Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the beginning of the 20th century, thousands of [[Lithuanian Jews]]  lived in Ireland. [[Robert Briscoe (politician)|Robert Briscoe]], who served as lord mayor of Dublin in 1956-57 and 1961–62, was son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to Ireland. In contrast, the current immigration is of majority Catholic Lithuanians, as Lithuania contained few Jews in 2000.

In 1935, [[Feliksas Vaitkus]], the sixth person who had a successful [[Transatlantic flight|flight over Atlantic Ocean]] with a single engine single seat fixed-wing aircraft, landed in Ireland. Vaitkus flew his transatlantic flight with ''Lituanica II''. Vaitkus had to fight the worst possible weather conditions and was helped considerably by hourly broadcasts from an Irish radio station. He learned that Dublin was fogged in, as well as all areas heading east as far as the [[Baltic Sea]]. He knew that he could not make it to [[Kaunas]] due to his low fuel supply, and being exhausted after a 23-hour struggle fighting the elements, he felt it was best to come down somewhere in Ireland. He spotted an open field in Cloongowla at [[Ballinrobe]], [[County Mayo]] and came down, with the aircraft suffering extensive damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{lt icon}} Karolis Vaitkevičius. ''Airijoje - "Lituanicos II" skrydžio pėdsakai'', Lietuvos žinios No. 116 (11 453), 24 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He was lucky to survive and not sustain any significant injuries. ''Lituanica II'' was crated for shipment to Lithuania, where it was restored. Vaitkus made his way to Kaunas, by ship and train, where he was given a hero’s welcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lithuanian-american.org/bridges/2000/iss6/baranauskas.html Edward W.

==Organisations==
[[Image:Vilnius at Dublin.jpg|thumb|250px|A sign in a Dublin store. Lithuanian text reads: buy cheaper, live better]]
The Lithuanian Association in Ireland Limited, officially registered in January 2005, has been active since 1999. The association organises Lithuanian concerts and other events in Dublin, [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Monaghan]] and [[Portlaoise]], runs eight Lithuanian weekend schools in Dublin, Cork, [[Dundalk]], [[Galway]] etc. for Lithuanian children, runs a mailing list ''lithuaniansinireland''[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/lithuaniansinireland] with over 700 members, publishes information for Lithuanians in Ireland on a web site [http://www.alb.ie] and organises monthly Lithuanian gatherings around Ireland.
''Saloje'' (On the Island) [http://www.saloje.lt] published twice a month, which has around 5000 readers, and the weekly ''Lietuvis'' (Lithuanian) [http://www.lietuvis.ie](5000 copies) are the most popular local papers among the Lithuanian community.

The '''Northern Indo-Aryan languages''', also known as '''Pahāṛi languages''', are a group of [[Indo-Aryan languages]] spoken in the lower ranges of the [[Himalayas]], from [[Nepal]] in the east, through the [[India]]n states of [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The name ''Pahari'' (not to be confused with the various [[Pahari language (disambiguation)|other languages with that name]]) is [[G. A. Grierson|Grierson]]'s term.&lt;ref name="Masica1991"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Masica| first = Colin P.|author-link = Colin Masica| title = The Indo-Aryan languages| series = Cambridge language surveys| date = 1991| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-23420-7| page = 439| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Pahari languages fall into three groups.
;Eastern Pahari
*[[Jumli language|Jumli]] is spoken by an estimated 40,000 people in the [[Karnali Zone|Karnali]] zone of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumli|url=http://www.ethnologue.org.uk/show_language.asp?code=jml|work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=23 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nepali language|Nepali]] is spoken by an estimated 11,100,000 people in Nepal, 265,000 people in Bhutan, and 2,500,000 people in India.  It is an official language in Nepal and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nepali|url=http://www.ethnologue.org.uk/show_language.asp?code=nep|work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=23 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Palpa language|Palpa]] is spoken by an estimated 7,500 people in the [[Lumbini Zone|Lumbini]] zone of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palpa|url=http://www.ethnologue.org.uk/show_language.asp?code=plp|work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=23 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Central Pahari
*[[Kumaoni language|Kumaoni]] is spoken by an estimated 2,360,000 people in [[Uttarakhand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kumaoni|url=http://www.ethnologue.org.uk/show_language.asp?code=kfy|work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=23 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Garhwali language|Garhwali]] is spoken by an estimated 2,900,000 people in Uttarakhand. Most of these are Garhwali people from the state's northwestern division of [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]].
*[[Doti]] spoken by an estimated 1 million people in [[Province No. 7|far west Nepal]], although it is a hybrid language it is recognized as a dialect of Nepali, but also close to Kumaoni and Garhwali.

;Western Pahari
{{main|Western Pahari}}
*There are a dozen Western Pahari languages, of which [[Dogri language|Dogri]] and [[Kangri language|Kangri]] are the best known.

In Eastern and Central Pahari the verb substantive is formed from the root ''ach'', as in both Rajasthani and Kashmiri. In Rajasthani its present tense, being derived from the Sanskrit present ''rcchami'', I go, does not change for gender. But in Pahari and Kashmiri it must be derived from the rare Sanskrit particle ''*rcchitas'', gone, for in these languages it is a participial tense and does change according to the gender of the subject. Thus, in the singular we have: – Here we have a relic of the old Khasa language, which, as has been said, seems to have been related to Kashmiri. Other relics of Khasa, again agreeing with north-western India, are the tendency to shorten long vowels, the practice of ''epenthesis'', or the modification of a vowel by the one which follows in the next syllable, and the frequent occurrence of [[disaspiration]]. Thus, Khas ''siknu'', Kumauni ''sikno'', but Hindi ''sikhna'', to learn; Kumauni ''yeso'', plural ''yasa'', of this kind.

Materials regarding Western Pahari are not so complete. The speakers are not brought into contact with Tibeto-Burman languages, and hence we find no trace of these. But the signs of the influence of north-western languages are, as might be expected, still more apparent than farther east. In some dialects epenthesis is in full swing, as in (Churahi) ''khata'', eating, fern, ''khaiti''. Very interesting is the mixed origin of the [[postposition]]s defining the various cases. Thus, while that of the genitive is generally the Rajasthani ro, that of the dative continually points to the west. Sometimes it is the [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] ''khë''. At other times it is ''jo'', where is here a locative of the base of the Sindhi genitive postposition ''jo''. In all Indo-Aryan languages, the [[dative]] postposition is by origin the [[locative]] of some [[genitive]] one. In vocabulary, Western Pahari often employs, for the more common ideas, words which can most readily be connected with the north-western and [[Pisaca languages|Pisaca]] groups.{{cn|date=October 2017}} (See Indo-Aryan Languages.)

==About==
The Himalayas run along Nepal, India and Pakistan. The word 'Pahar' means a 'mountain' in most local languages such as Nepalese, Hindi (Parbat being a synonym) as well as Urdu (Koh being a synonym). Due to its mass prevalence and usage in the Himalayan Region, the language is also known as Himalayan. Like all other languages of the region, the Pahari languages are also from the Indo-European, and in particular Indo-Iranian branch of languages. As mountains have the tendency of isolating communities from change, dialects in the mountains tend to have their own characteristics with some similarity to others mountain dialects while remaining isolated from one another – there does seem to be a [[dialect continuum]]. All of these dialects are commonly referred to as the 'Pahari' languages, and most people from the Himalayan range as known as Paharis.

'''Paidi Jairaj''' (Telugu: పైడి జయరాజ్) (born '''Paidipati Jayarajulu Naidu''' - 28 September 1909 – 11 August 2000) was an [[Indian film]] [[superstar]], director and producer known for his works primarily in [[Hindi cinema]], Marathi and Gujarati language films, and [[Telugu theatre]].&lt;ref name="rediff.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2000/jul/24jai.htm|title=rediff.com, Movies: Jairaj's son asked to vacate father's flat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Luminaries of 20th Century, Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University, Hyderabad, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

During the talkie period, from 1931 onwards, he started with ''Shikari'' in Urdu and English languages. Subsequently, he became one of the leading actors for about two decades, along with [[V. Shantaram|Shantaram]], [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], [[Motilal Rajvansh|Motilal]] etc. He starred in about 170 feature films in a variety of roles. He directed a few films such as ''[[Mohar]]'', ''Mala'' (1943), [[Pratima (1945 film)|''Pratima'']], ''Rajghar'' and ''Saagar'' (1951), which he produced. In 1980, he was honoured with the [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]], the highest award for films in India, for his contributions to Indian cinema.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dff.nic.in/dadasahebphalke.asp|title=::DIRECTORATE OF FILM FESTIVALS::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jairaj was born in [[Karimnagar]], [[Hyderabad State]] (of which the present day Telangana State was a part) on 28 September 1909. A nephew of [[Sarojini Naidu]], he had three brothers - Paidipati Sundararaja Naidu, Paidipati Deendayal Naidu (Artist) and Paidipati Jairaj was the youngest.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Career==
Jairaj developed an interest in theatre and films during his graduate studies at [[Nizam College]], and left for [[Bombay]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="cinejosh.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinejosh.com/telugu-andhra-others-photos/18765/5/19/paidi-jairaj-105-jayanthi-utsavam.html|title=Paidi Jairaj 105 Jayanthi Utsavam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his acting debut in 1929 with the silent film ''Star Kling Youth'', and subsequently he acted in about eleven silent films including ''Triangle of Love'', ''Mathru Bhoomi'', ''All for Lover'', ''Mahasagar Mothi'', ''Flight into Death'', ''My Hero'' etc.&lt;ref name="rediff.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Jairaj's effective dialogue delivery, and experience in [[Telugu theatre]] made him an instant choice to play the roles of the sword wielding Rajputs. He played the characters of Amar Singh Rathore [1957], Prithviraj Chauhan [1959], and Maharana Pratap [1960] among notable films. He also essayed the roles of Shah Jahan [1947], Tipu Sultan [1959] and Haider Ali [1962] with equal aplomb. His other memorable portrayals have been in films such as ''Sassi Punnu'' [1947], ''Hatimtai'' [1956], ''Chandrashekar Azad'' [1963] and ''Durga Das'' [1964] among others. Jairaj did six films with Suraiya in the 1940s and 1950s, five of them, viz. ''Humaari Baat'' (1943), ''Singaar'' (1949), ''Amar Kahani'' (1949), ''Rajput'' (1951) and ''Resham'' (1952) as her hero, and one of them, ''Lal Kunwar'' (1952), as second lead. In 1952, he produced and directed his own film ''Sagar'', which was not very well received by the audiences. But his commitment to cinema remained undisputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saddahaq.com/the-inevitable-celluloid-man|title=Paidi Jairaj - The Invincible Celluloid Man|first=Vidya|last=Mahajan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] woman, Savitri, from Delhi. It was an arranged marriage. Prithviraj Kapoor's father had chosen the bride for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cineplot.com/jairaj/|title=Jairaj – Profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two sons and four daughters. His wife died a year before him of cancer. His daughter Geeta looked after him in his last year. Rajan Shahi, TV producer-director, is his daughter's son (maternal grandson), the sole person of Jairaj's extended family in Bollywood.&lt;ref name="rediff.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellychakkar.com/fun-zone/did-you-know/did-you-know-director-rajan-shahi-and-veteran-film-actor-pjairaj-are-related|title=Did you know that director Rajan Shahi and veteran film actor P.Jairaj are related?|first=Tellychakkar|last=Team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionpost.com/tvp-special/how-rajan-shahi-became-a-successful-tv-producer/|title=How Rajan Shahi became a successful TV producer - TelevisionPost.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jairaj  died in [[Mumbai]] on 11 August 2000.&lt;ref name="rediff.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref

A one-hour documentary, Life journey of Jairaj, was made by the [[Government of Telangana]] in 2018 to celebrate his life.&lt;ref&gt;https://telanganatoday.com/documentary-on-telanganas-paidi-jairaj-to-be-released-on-july-28&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">The '''Phuan people''' ([[wikt:พวน|พวน]]), also known as Tai Phuan, Thai Puan ({{lang-th|[[wikt:ไทพวน|ไทพวน]]}}) or Lao Phuan, are a [[Theravada]] Buddhist Tai people spread out in small pockets over most of the northeastern [[Isan]] region with other groups scattered in central [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] ([[Xiangkhouang Province|Xieng Khouang]] Province). There are also approximately 5000 Phuan in [[Mongkol Borei District]] of [[Banteay Meanchey Province]] in [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schliesinger|first1=Joachim|title=Ethnic Groups of Cambodia, Volume 3: Profile of the Austro-Thai-and Sinitic-Speaking Peoples|date=8 October 2011|publisher=White Lotus Co Ltd|isbn=9744801794|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ayUjBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Phuan+in+Banteay+Meancheay+Province,+Cambodia&amp;ots=uz9hejuDc0&amp;sig=5vxeZzUj0aTiaEz7jqDEuHaF_L4#v=onepage&amp;q=Phuan%20in%20Banteay%20Meancheay%20Province%2C%20Cambodia&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well in [[Battambang Province]]. According to the Ethnologue Report, the Phuan number 204,704 and that is split fairly evenly between populations in Laos and Thailand. 

== Language ==
The language is closely related to other tribal Tai languages, such as the [[Thai Dam]] and the [[Thai Loei]]. Unlike other tribal Tai languages in the Isan region, the [[Phuan language]] is not losing ground to the standard [[Thai language]] or the local Isan/Lao trade language. 

The Phuan are famous for handwoven textiles, especially the striped and patterned ''pakama'', a short sarong worn by men, and a ''pasin tin jok'', a longer women's skirt. Due to their proximity and very similar culture and language, Phuan culture is very similar to other tribal Tai groups and the [[Isan]] and [[Lao people|Laotian]] people with whom they are neighbours. One interesting custom is the use of elephants to parade initiates into the monastery, usually held before [[Songkran]].&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, J., et al. ''Lonely Planet: Thailand.''

The '''Port Royal School''' is a historic [[South Carolina]] school building. It is located at 1214 Paris Avenue in the town of [[Port Royal, South Carolina|Port Royal]].  Its original main block is a two-story Colonial Revival structure designed by [[Wilson and Sompayrac]] and built in 1911.  In 1954 a single-story brick Modern addition was added to the north of this building; it was designed by William Harleston of Halsey &amp; Cummings.  A second addition was made in 2002, further extending the 1954 building to the north.  The building is believed to be the second-oldest active elementary school building in the state.  It also contributed to the area's checkered history of the provision of so-called "[[separate but equal]]" educational facilities for whites and African Americans: the 1954 addition occurred at a time when the last elementary school for African Americans in Port Royal was closed, requiring the transportation of those students to [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]].  The Port Royal School remained whites-only until 1964.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000163.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Port Royal School|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2014.&lt;ref name = nps/&gt;

'''Qatar Scientific Club''' is a non-profit organization based in [[Qatar]]. It offers training programs, workshops, and activities in a number of scientific fields.&lt;ref name="officialsite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qatarsc.org/about.html |title=النادي العلمي القطري :: عن النادي |trans-title=Qatar Science Club: About the club |language=ar |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111225000/http://www.qatarsc.org/about.html |publisher=Qatar Science Club |archive-date=January 11, 2013 |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The organization's mission is to create a suitable atmosphere for the practices of scientific hobbies; encourage scientific activities among the younger population, and increase their interest in the sciences.&lt;ref name="yearbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qatarembassy.pl/pliki/YEAR%20BOOK%202009-%20ENGLISH.pdf|title=Qatar Yearbook 2009|publisher=Qatar Embassy in Poland|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The club was established in 1987 under a decree which was issued by the vice chairman of Qatar Youth Welfare higher council as a response to a request which was submitted by twenty-five members. Initially, the club only had two sections which were [[Electronics]] and [[Electricity]], however, the number of sections increased as the club members number was growing.&lt;ref name="officialsite"/&gt;

==Departments and sections==
The club consists of a number of departments including astronomy, aviation, engineering and others. There is a dedicated Young Scientists department where children can join and participate in different scientific experiments and activities. Due to cultural reasons, female members have a separate department which is called "Scientific Girl Club" and it runs its activities separately from the other main departments; however there is collaboration between these departments.&lt;ref name="officialsite"/&gt;

==Community initiatives==
In 2008, the club launched the "'''Green Computer'''" project in association with [[Microsoft]]. The project sought to recycle outdated and discarded computers from companies and homes so that they can be re-used by peoples of lower income. In 2012, the project received funding by the Commercial Bank of Qatar in the form of a QR200,000 grant, in addition to receiving funding from Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/209370/green-project-brings-junk-pcs-back-to-life|title=Green project brings junk PCs back to life|publisher=The Peninsula Qatar|date=29 September 2012|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also began extending its operations to other countries the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/194775/qsc-to-donate-computers-among-needy-countries|title=QSC to donate computers among needy countries|publisher=The Peninsula Qatar|date=18 May 2012|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The QSC conducted a joint-venture with [[Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park]] when it co-hosted the "Future Scientist Summer Camp 2010". The main aim of the camp was to explain scientific and technological themes to a predicted 1,000 children between the ages of 6 to 16. It featured interactive exhibits and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/55659/summer-science-camp-for-kids|title=Summer science camp for kids|publisher=The Peninsula Qatar|date=1 July 2010|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rath''' ([[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]]: रथ &lt;small&gt;([[Devanagari]])&lt;/small&gt; {{Nastaliq|رتھ}} &lt;small&gt;([[Perso-Arabic script|Perso-Arabic]])&lt;/small&gt;) are a [[Rajput]] community, found in the state of [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name="popular"&gt;''People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D. K Samanta, S K Mandal  &amp; N.N Vyas pages 808 to 811 Popular Prakashan''&lt;/ref&gt; They also settled in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] provinces [[Pakistan]]. They are also known as '''Rathi''', although their preferred self-designation is [[Rajput]].

==History and origin==
The Rath are said to get their name from the [[Zebu|Rathi]] breed of cattle, which they used to and still herd. They are divided into three major sub-groups, the Parihar or sometimes referred to as Parhar Rath, the [[Joyia]] or and the Bohar, and a number of minor lineages, such as the Chanar, Larr, [[Chhachhar]] and Chandani.  According to the traditions of the Parhar Rath, they were originally [[Parihar]] Rajputs of [[Mandore]], who were defeated by the [[Rathore]]s, and fled to [[Sindh]]. During their period of exile, the Parhar were converted to [[Islam]]. The community than moved to the desert regions of [[Bikaner|Bikaner State]], and spread over time to the [[Cholistan]] desert region. While the Bohar and Johiya Rath both claim descent from the [[Bhatti]] [[Rajput]]s, and have different traditions as to their conversion to [[Islam]].  As a community, they have a strong self-identification as being a [[Rajput]] community. They are culturally close to tribesmen of the [[Cholistan]] region of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]], who are also largely Rath.&lt;ref name="popular"/&gt;

Historically, the Rath were a community of [[pastoral]] [[nomad]]s, breeding mainly cows and sheep, as well as cultivating dry crops, and migrating three to nine months of the year. Till about the 1950s, no recognized rights to the land existed. This was in marked contrast to the related [[Pachhada]] community, who were found in [[Hissar District|Hissar]] and Mahendargarh districts of [[Haryana]], who was forced to settle down by the [[United Kingdom|British]] authorities in the late 19th Century. With the construction of the [[Indira Gandhi Canal]], land was divided up, and a large number granted to settlers. This led to a drastic reduction in the grazing area, and process that has led to the abandoning of the nomadic lifestyle. The community are now only partially nomadic, with some members taking the cattle and sheep to their grazing areas, while the majority remaining in the village.&lt;ref&gt;Resisting Change? Adaptations by Traditional Pastoralists to the Rajasthan Canal Project  by Saurabh Sinha International Institute for Environment and Development, Dryland Development Project page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rath speak [[Saraiki language|Seraiki]] among themselves, and [[Marwari language|Marwari]] with others. They are also closely related to the Pachhadas, a community once found in [[Hisar, India|Hissar]] and [[Mahendragarh district|Mahendragarh]] districts of [[Haryana]], but now found in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="popular"/&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Parhar Rath community is further divided into a number of clans, known as [[gotra]]s. Their main clans include the Parihar, Kotowar, Daiya, Seikh, Lad and Koria. The various gotras observe a set pattern with regards to marriage. For example, the Parihar and Kotowar receive girls from the Koria, while the Daiya and Parihar give girls to the Kotowar and Seikh. Other Rathi communities include the [[Bohar]] and [[Johiya]] tribal groupings, found mainly in the [[Bikaner District|Bikaner]], [[Ganganagar District|Ganganagar]] and the neighbouring region of [[Cholistan]] of [[Pakistan]]. Marriages tend to take place within the three sub-divisions, but marriages are forbidden within the gotra.&lt;ref name="popular"/&gt;

The Rath are found mainly in [[Barmer, Rajasthan|Barmer]], [[Bikaner District|Bikaner]], [[Ganganagar District|Ganganagar]] and [[Jaisalmer]] districts. They are still essentially a community of pastoralists. Agriculture is the other main pursuit of this community.  For six months of the year, from May to October, they cultivate their fields, and for the other six months, they herd their cattle. Their villages are found in the [[Thar Desert]] region, and most of their villages are without electricity.&lt;ref name="popular"/&gt;
Like other [[North India]] communities, they have a council of elders which settles intra-community disputes, and punishes the guilty. Each lineage has an informal caste council, known as a biradari panchayat. This acts as an instrument of social control, by punishes those who breach community norms, such as marriage out with the community, or marriage within the gotra.

'''Rose Warfman''' (née '''Gluck'''; 4 October 1916&lt;ref name="currents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishcurrents.org/october-4-rose-warfman-french-resistance/|title=Rose Warfman and the French Resistance|website=Jewish Currents|date=4 October 2013|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 17 September 2016) was a French survivor of [[Auschwitz]] and member of the [[French Resistance]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gluck was born on 4 March 1916 in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]], the daughter of Pinhas Gluck-Friedman (1886–1964) and Henia Shipper (1887–1968). Her father was a direct descendant of [[Hasidic]] Masters, going back to the [[Maggid|Magid]] [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]] (1704–1772),&lt;ref name="currents"/&gt; the disciple and successor of the [[Baal Shem Tov]] (1698–1760). She had two sisters, [[Antoinette Feuerwerker]] (1912-2003) and Hendel (Hedwig) Naftalis (1913-?), and a brother [[Salomon Gluck]] (born 1914-died during WWII).

===Strasbourg and Paris===
Her parents had moved from [[Tarnów]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Poland]], to Belgium, then to Switzerland, during World War I. The family moved further to Germany, and finally to France in 1921, settling in [[Strasbourg]]. There she went to the famous Lycée des Pontonniers, now called Lycée International des Pontonniers. After moving to Paris, with her family, she studied in 1941 and 1942 to become a nurse, in the modern Ecole de puériculture, 26, boulevard Brune, in Paris 14. She worked before World War II at the COJASOR, a Jewish social service organization, together with Lucie Dreyfus (née Hadamard; 1869–1945), the widow of [[Alfred Dreyfus]].

===French Resistance===
During World War II, she joined her sister, Antoinette Feuerwerker, and her husband, Rabbi [[David Feuerwerker]], in [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]]. They worked together with [[Edmond Michelet]], the future Senior Minister of [[Charles de Gaulle]], in the major Movement of the French Resistance, [[Combat (French Resistance)|Combat]]. In Michelet's Memoirs, she is mentioned as one of the active agents for Combat. Her name in the Résistance was Marie Rose Girardin.

She was arrested in the [[Synagogue]] of Brive in March 1944, taken to [[Drancy internment camp]], and from there, on convoy 72, on 29 April 1944, to Auschwitz concentration camp. Her sister Antoinette Feuerwerker succeeded in getting her a nurse's uniform when she was at Drancy internment camp. She wore that uniform on her arrival in Auschwitz.&lt;ref name="currents"/&gt; Dr [[Josef Mengele]], the infamous Nazi doctor, singled her out for survival. Later, he operated on her, without anesthesia. She survived three selections in Auschwitz concentration camp (Auschwitz-Birkenau), and later was transferred to the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]], before being liberated by the [[Red Army|Russian Army]] in February 1945. The number tattooed on her arm at Auschwitz was 80598. Underneath there is a triangle, meaning she is a Jew.

===Auschwitz===
Convoy 72 took her to Auschwitz on 29 April 1944. [[Serge Klarsfeld]] described the convoy:

''This convoy takes 1004 Jews, and includes 398 men and 606 women. Among them were 174 children below 18. The poet Itzak Katznelson ([[Itzhak Katzenelson]]) is among the deportees of this convoy, as well as many [[Poles]], arrested as he was in [[Vittel]], after having been transferred from Poland. There are families: the children Dodelzak, Ita 12, Georges 3 and Arkadius 3 months; the Rottenberg, Naphtalie 7, Nathan 5, Esther 4, Frantz 2,...''
'' On arrival at Auschwitz, 48 men were selectioned with the numbers 186596 to 186643 and 52 women, whose numbers are around 80600. In 1945, there were 37 survivors, including 25 women.''

Her brother, Dr. [[Salomon Gluck]] was deported on the next convoy, convoy 73, leaving Drancy internment camp on 15 May 1944.

At [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]], she was assigned to a group of 50 women who were forced by a [[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]] to knit undershirts for German newborns. She worked hard, and was well thought-of, but when they were asked to knit socks for men, she resisted by making big knots inside the garments so as to render them unusable. In her block in Auschwitz was another detainee that she saw daily, the future politician [[Simone Veil]].

=== Gross-Rosen ===
The Gross-Rosen concentration camp was situated near [[Breslau]] (called today [[Wrocław]] in Poland) railway station. There Warfman was made to work in a munitions factory from six in the evening to six in the morning, with one half-hour break, and regular beatings.

===Later life===
After the war, she returned to Paris. She became the first and only employee of the new Israeli Airlines, [[El Al]], when it opened in Paris, with a director, Mr. Massis. She welcomed and guided many Israeli leaders during their stays in Paris, including [[Golda Meir]], and [[David Ben-Gurion]]. She was involved in the adventure of the [[Exodus (ship)]] (Exodus1947). Together with Abbé Alexandre Glasberg, recognized posthumously as a [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by the [[Yad Vashem]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], for saving Jews during the war, she made the false identity cards for the passengers of the Exodus.

==Honors==
She was awarded the title of [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honor]] by the [[French Government]] for her work in the [[Résistance]], on 10 February 1959. She also was awarded la [[Médaille Militaire]] 1939–1945, la [[Croix de guerre]] 1939–1945, and la [[Croix du combattant volontaire de la Résistance]]. On 10 April 2009, the French Government made her an [[Officer of the Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020506686&amp;dateTexte=&amp;oldAction=rechJO...... JORF No 0087 du 12 avril 2009 page 6391, texte No 6. Décret portant promotion et nomination]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She was married to Nachman Warfman a Doctor in Law ([[University of Grenoble]]) and a certified public accountant (CPA). She had three children: Bernard, Salomon David, and Anne. She moved to [[Manchester]], [[England]], to be close to her children, her grandchildren and her great grandchildren. She died in Manchester on 17 September 2016, 17 days short of her 100th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160930182907/http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/bde/1100 ROSE GLUCK WARFMAN, OLH., CVR.

'''Russian organized crime''' or '''Russian mafia''' ({{Lang-ru|рoссийская мафия|rossiyskaya mafiya}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rg.ru/2008/06/16/spain-mafia-anons.html|title=В Испании ликвидирована "российская мафия"|publisher=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Lang-ru|русская мафия|russkaya mafiya}}), sometimes referred to as '''Bratva''' ({{Lang-ru|братва}}: "brotherhood"), is a [[collective]] of various [[organized crime]] elements originating in the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|former Soviet Union]]. The acronym OPG is Organized Criminal (Prestupnaya in Russian) Group, used to refer to any of the Russian mafia groups, sometimes modified with a specific name, e.g. Orekhovskaya OPG. Sometimes the acronym is translated and OCG is used.

Organized crime in Russia began in the imperial period of the [[Tsar]]s, but it was not until the Soviet era that ''[[Thief in law|vory v zakone]]'' ("thieves-in-law") emerged as leaders of prison groups in ''lagerya'' (plural form for Russian ''lager'' – an informal nickname for a prison labor camp in the Soviet Union), and their honor code became more defined. With the end of [[World War II]], the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], more gangs emerged in a flourishing [[black market]], exploiting the unstable governments of the former Republics, and at its highest point, even controlling as much as two-thirds of the Russian economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Louis Freeh]], former director of the [[FBI]], said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to [[National Security of the United States|U.S. national security]] in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Freeh"/&gt;

In modern times, there are as many as 6,000 different groups,&lt;ref name="fas.org" /&gt; with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}.&lt;ref name="Mallory"/&gt; In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the Russian National Central Bureau of [[Interpol]], stated "Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad",&lt;ref name="Lakhonin"/&gt; while in August 2010, [[Alain Bauer]], a French criminologist, said that it "is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation."&lt;ref name="Bauer"/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The Russian mafia can be traced back to Russia's [[Russian Empire|imperial period]], which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were [[peasants]], in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned [[Robin Hood]]-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming [[folk heroes]]. In time, the ''Vorovskoy Mir'' (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign.&lt;ref name="history channel"/&gt;

===1917–1991: Soviet era===
During Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to ''[[gulag]]s'' (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become ''vorami v zakone'' ("thieves-in-law"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.&lt;ref name="history channel"/&gt;

After [[Hitler]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who refused to fight in the war referred to the traitors as ''suka'' ("bitch"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the "hierarchy". Outcast, the ''suki'' separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of [[Bitch Wars]] from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.&lt;ref name="Mallory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history channel"/&gt;

After the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from ''gulags''. Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an "every-man-for-himself" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the [[Brezhnev era]], and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Then, in the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.&lt;ref name="Mallory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history channel"/&gt;

Also during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], with most settling in a southern [[Brooklyn]] area known as [[Brighton Beach]] (sometimes nicknamed as "Little [[Odessa]]"). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US.&lt;ref name="Mallory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS worldwide"/&gt; The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the "[[Potato Bag Gang]]," a group of [[con artists]] disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold [[rubles]] for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was [[Evsei Agron]].&lt;ref name="early US crime"/&gt;

Pauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization,&lt;ref name="RICO Act"/&gt; and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated. [[Boris Nayfeld|Boris "Biba" Nayfeld]], his bodyguard, moved on to employ under [[Marat Balagula]], who was believed to have succeeded Agron's authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of [[Merrill Lynch]] customers, and was found in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]] in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.&lt;ref name="early US crime"/&gt;

Balagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 [[credit card fraud]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="influx of gangsters"/&gt; Nayfield took Balagula's place, partnering with the "Polish Al Capone", Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business.&lt;ref name="Ricardo Fanchini"/&gt; In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.&lt;ref name="Elson and Nayfield"/&gt;

===1992–2000: Growth and internationalization===
When the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia's economy, with many ex-[[KGB]] agents and veterans of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan war]] offering their skills to the crime bosses.&lt;ref name="Freeh" /&gt; Gangster [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet's dissolution, so that top ''vory v zakone'' could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-Communist state. It was agreed that [[Vyacheslav Ivankov|Vyacheslav "Yaponchik" Ivankov]] would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America.&lt;ref name="CBS worldwide" /&gt; Within a year, he built an international operation that included, but was not limited to, [[narcotics]], [[money laundering]], and [[prostitution]] and made ties with the [[American Mafia]] and Colombian [[drug cartels]], eventually extending to [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="history channel" /&gt; Those who went against him were usually killed.

Prior to Ivankov's arrival, Balagula's downfall left a void for America's next ''vory v zakone''. Monya Elson, leader of Monya's ''Brigada'' (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides.&lt;ref name="Elson and Nayfield" /&gt; Ivankov's arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former's life.&lt;ref name="Ivankov pdf" /&gt; Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998)&lt;ref name="Sierra Leone" /&gt; and in Italy in 1995, respectively.&lt;ref name="ny daily news" /&gt;

Ivankov's reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence.&lt;ref name="Mallory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history channel" /&gt; Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the ''Solntsevskaya Bratva''), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri "Globus" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in [[Vienna]] rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business. Two months later, Ivankov got into  another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the [[Orekhovskaya gang|''Orekhovskaya'' gang]], Segei "Sylvester" Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt;

Back in Eastern Europe in May 1995, crime boss [[Semion Mogilevich]] held a different summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in [[Anděl (neighborhood)|Anděl]], a neighborhood of [[Prague]]. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]''. However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the ''Solntsevskaya'' were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and ''Solntsevskaya'' leader [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]] had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="prague daily" /&gt;

One person who was not there was Mogilevich himself. He claimed that "[b]y the time I arrived at U Holubu, everything was already in full swing, so I went into a neighboring hotel and sat in the bar there until about five or six in the morning."&lt;ref name="Glenny" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC transcript" /&gt; Mikhailov would later be arrested in [[Switzerland]] in October 1996 on numerous charges,&lt;ref name="Ivankov pdf" /&gt; including that he was the head of a powerful Russian mafia group, but was exonerated and released two years later after evidence was not enough to prove much.&lt;ref name="ny times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="la times" /&gt;

The global extent of Russian organized crime wasn't realized until [[Ludwig Fainberg|Ludwig "Tarzan" Fainberg]] was arrested in January 1997, primarily because of arms dealing. In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to [[Miami]] and opened up a strip club called Porky's, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an [[ambassador]] among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt [[Russian military]]. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a [[submarine]] for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover [[DEA]] agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami. Facing the possibility of life imprisonment, the latter agreed for his testimony against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence, which ended up being 33 months.&lt;ref name="history channel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS worldwide" /&gt;

===2001–present===
As the 21st century dawned, the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan. New Mafia bosses sprang up, while imprisoned ones were released. Among the released were Johanithan Pochival Slokavich{{who|date=August 2013}}, Marat Balagula and [[Vyacheslav Ivankov]], all three in 2004.&lt;ref name="Balagula release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivankov dead"/&gt; The latter was extradited to Russia, but was jailed once more for his alleged murders of two Turks in a Moscow restaurant in 1992; he was cleared of all charges and released in 2005. Four years later, he was assassinated by a shot in the stomach from a sniper.&lt;ref name="Ivankov dead"/&gt; Meanwhile, Monya Elson and Leonid Roytman were arrested in March 2006 for an unsuccessful murder plot against two [[Kiev]]-based businessmen.&lt;ref name="Elson 2nd arrest"/&gt;

In 2009, FBI agents in Moscow targeted{{Clarify|date=August 2013}} two suspected Mafia leaders and two other corrupt businessmen. One of the leaders is Yevgeny Dvoskin, a criminal who had been in prison with Ivankov in 1995 and was deported in 2001 for breaking immigration regulations; the other is Konstantin "Gizya" Ginzburg, who was reportedly the current "big boss" of Russian organized crime in America before his reported assassination in 2009 [http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/europe/russian-mob-boss-laid-to-rest], it being suspected that Ivankov handed over control to him.&lt;ref name="4 criminals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/world/europe/30russia.html |first=Michael |last=Schwirtz |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=In a River Raid, a Glimpse of Russia's Criminal Elite |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that Sheaib was present in Eastern Europe right before the death of [[Vyacheslav Ivankov]] as well as [[Aslan Usoyan]].

In the same year, Semion Mogilevich was placed on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list for his involvement in a complex multimillion-dollar scheme that defrauded investors in the stock of his company YBM Magnex International, swindling them out of $150 million.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; He was indicted in 2003 and arrested in 2008 in Russia on tax fraud charges, but because the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, he was released on bail.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; Monya Elson said, in 1998, that Mogilevich is the most powerful mobster in the world.&lt;ref name="Semion powerful"/&gt;

Around the world, Russian mafia groups have popped up as dominating particular areas: Alec Simchuk and his group robbed unsuspecting tourists and businessmen in [[South Florida]], leading Rick Brodsky of the FBI to say that "Eurasian organised crime is our no. 1 priority";&lt;ref name="South Florida"/&gt; Russian organized crime has a rather large stronghold in the city of Atlanta where members are distinguished by their tattoos. Russian organized crime was reported to have a stronger grip in the [[French Riviera]] region and [[Spain]] in 2010;&lt;ref name="Bauer"/&gt; and Russia was branded as a virtual "mafia state" according to the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|WikiLeaks cables]].&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks"/&gt;

In 2009, Russian mafia groups had been said to reach over 50 countries and, in 2010, had up to 300,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigmafiagangster.blogspot.com/2015/01/russian-mafia-and-their-history.html|title=Russian Mafia and their history|last=Time|first=Big|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to recordings released in 2015, [[Alexander Litvinenko]], shortly before he was assassinated, claimed that [[Semion Mogilevich]] has had a "good relationship" with [[Vladimir Putin]] since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11364900/Listen-Alexander-Litvinenkos-apparent-warning-before-his-death.html Listen: Alexander Litvinenko's apparent warning before his death] By Lyndsey Telford, Edward Malnick and Claire Newell12:00PM GMT 23 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2017, 33 Russian mafia affiliates and members were arrested and charged by the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and NYPD for extortion, racketeering, illegal gambling, firearm offenses, narcotics trafficking, wire fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft, fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices; based in Atlantic City and Philadelphia, murder-for-hire conspiracy and cigarette trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Than 30 Alleged Russian Mobsters Indicted in Odd Case Involving 10,000 Pounds of Chocolate|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Russian-Mob-Bust-Chocolate-Pounds-FBI-Racketeering-New-York-City-Indict-427024801.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|agency=NBC News|publisher=Joe Valiquette|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also accused of operating secret and underground gambling dens based in [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn]], and using violence to those who owed gambling debts, establishing nightclubs in order to sell drugs, plotting to force women associates to rob male strangers by seducing and drugging them with [[chloroform]], and trafficking over 10,000 pounds of stolen [[Chocolate bar|chocolate confectionery]]; the chocolate was stolen from shipment containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Busted Russian casino hackers had an appetite for drugs and chocolate|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/06/08/busted_russian_casino_hackers_had_an_appetite_for_drugs_and_chocolate/|website=The Register|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian mobsters arrested for peddling stolen chocolate|url=https://nypost.com/2017/06/07/russian-mobsters-arrested-for-peddling-stolen-chocolate/|website=The New York Post|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that 27 of the arrested are connected to the Russian mafia ''Shulaya clan'' which are largely based in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members And Associates Of Russian Crime Syndicate Arrested For Racketeering, Extortion, Robbery, Murder-For-Hire Conspiracy, Fraud, Narcotics, And Firearms Offenses|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/members-and-associates-russian-crime-syndicate-arrested-racketeering-extortion-robbery|website=The United States Department of Justice|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prosecution, the ''Shulaya'' also has operations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Nevada. According to law enforcement and the prosecution, this is one of the first federal arrests against a Russian mafia boss and his underboss or co-leader.

On 26 September 2017, as part of a 4-year investigation, 100 [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Spanish Civil Guard officers]] carried out 18 searches in different areas of [[Malaga, Spain]] related to Russian mafia large scale money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TWO MAIN RUSSIAN MAFIA GROUPS DISMANTLED IN SPAIN WITH EUROPOL'S SUPPORT|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/two-main-russian-mafia-groups-dismantled-in-spain-europol%E2%80%99s-support|website=Europol|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raids resulted in the arrests of 11 members and associates of the ''Solntsevskaya'' and ''Izmailovskaya'' clans.

===Bratva structure===
Note that these positions are not always official titles, but rather are understood names for roles that an individual performs.
* '''Pakhan''' – also called Boss, Krestniy Otets ("Capo di tutti capi | Godfather") Vor ("Thief"), Papa, or Avtoritet ("Authority"), controls everything. The Pakhan controls four criminal cells in the working unit through an intermediary called a "Brigadier."&lt;ref name="Russian Crime Structure"&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/rusorg3.htm Russian Organized Crime: Organization and Structure] 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Two Spies''' – watch over the action of the brigadiers to ensure loyalty and that none become too powerful. They are the Sovietnik ("Support Group") and Obshchak ("Security Group").
* '''Derzhatel obschaka''', the bookkeeper, collects money from ''Brigadiers'' and bribes the government with '''Obshchak''' (money mafia intended for use in the interests of the group). This could be Brigadier, Pakhan, Authoritet.
* '''Brigadier''' – also called ''Avtoritet'' ("Authority"), is like a ''captain'' in charge of a small group of men, similar to [[Caporegime]] in Italian-American Mafia crime families and Sicilian Mafia clans. He gives out jobs to Boyeviks ("warriors") and pays tribute to Pakhan. He runs a crew which is called a Brigade (Bratva). A Brigade is made up of 5–6 Patsanov or Brodyag.
* '''Bratok''' – also called '''Patsan''', or '''Brodyaga''' works for a Brigadier having a special criminal activity to run, similar to [[Soldato|soldiers]] in [[American Mafia|Italian-American Mafia]] [[Crime family|crime families]] and [[Sicilian Mafia]] clans. A Boyevik is in charge of finding new guys and paying tribute up to his Brigadier. Boyeviks also make up the main strike force of a brigade (bratva).
* '''Shestyorka''' – is an "associate" to the organization also called the "six", similar to associates in Italian-American Mafia crime families and Sicilian Mafia clans. Is an errand boy for the organization and is the lowest rank in the Russian Mafia. The sixes are assigned to some Avtorityets for support. They also provide an intelligence for the upcoming "delo" or on a certain target. They usually stay out of the main actions, although there might be exceptions, depending on circumstances. During a "delo" Shestyorkas perform security functions standing on the look out (Shukher – literally: danger). It is a temporary position and an individual either making it into the Vor-world or being cast aside. As they are earning their respect and trust in Bratva they may be performing roles of the regular Boyeviks or Byki depending on the necessities and patronage of their Brigadier or Avtorityet. Etymology of 'shestyorka' word comes from the lowest rank of 36 playing card deck – sixes.

In the Russian Mafia, "Vor" (plural: Vory) (literally, "Thief") is an honorary title denoting a made man. The honor of becoming a Vor is only given when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title. When you become a member of the Vor-world you have to accept the code of the Vor v Zakone ("[[Thief in law]]").&lt;ref name="Finckenauer, Waring"&gt;James O. Finckenauer and Elin Waring. ''Challenging the Russian Mafia Mystique''. National Institute of Justice Journal. April 2001. [http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/jr000247b.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallory 2007"&gt;Stephen L. Mallory. ''Understanding Organized Crime''. 2007.

Although Russian criminal groups vary in their structure, there have been attempts to devise a model of how they work. One such model (possibly outdated by now, as it is based on the old style of Soviet criminal enterprises) works out like this:

# Elite group – led by a Pakhan who is involved in management, organization and ideology. This is the highest group that controls both support group and security group.
# Security group – is led by one of his spies. His job is to make sure the organization keeps running and also keeps the peace between the organizations and other criminal groups and also paying off the right people. This group works with the Elite group and is equal in power with the Support groups. Is in charge of security and in intelligence.
# Support group – is led by one of his spies. His job is to watch over the working unit collecting the money while supervising their criminal activities. This group works with the elite group and is equal in power with the Security group. They plan a specific crime for a specialized group or choose who carries out the operation.
# Working Unit – There are four Brigadiers running a criminal activity in the working unit. Each Brigade is controlled by a Brigadier. This is the lowest group working with only the Support group. The group is involved in burglars, thieves, prostitution, extortion, street gangs and other crimes.

The community was traditionally associated with the cultivation and management of [[cinnamon]] and were formerly also involved as [[Weaving|weavers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB5TCgAAQBAJ|title=The Archaeology of South Asia: From the Indus to Asoka, c.6500 BCE–200 CE|last=Coningham|first=Robin|last2=Young|first2=Ruth|date=2015-08-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521846974|location=|pages=60|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The Salagamas were also known as ''Saliya,'' also spelled ''Chaliya''. The name is presumably derived from [[Chaliyam|Chale]] of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sCHCwAAQBAJ|title=Sri Lanka in the Modern Age: A History|last=Wickramasinghe|first=Nira|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780190225797|location=|pages=24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===

The Salagamas trace their roots back to the [[Coromandel Coast]] and [[Malabar Coast]] of [[South India]], and settled in the southern coastal areas of [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbP_AwAAQBAJ|title=Coup Theories and Officers' Motives: Sri Lanka in Comparative Perspective|last=Horowitz|first=Donald L.|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9781400854127|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i1BuAAAAMAAJ|title=400 Years of Dutch-Sri Lanka Relations: 1602 - 2002|last=Kelegama|first=Saman|last2=Madawela|first2=Roshan|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka|year=|isbn=9789558708132|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ancestors were a weaving community who were known as ''[[Saliya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-syAAAAMAAJ|title=Ceylon: A Divided Nation|last=Farmer|first=Bertram Hughes|date=1963|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Salagamas also have the ''vasagama'' or surname "Nambudirige" meaning "of the Nambudiri", indicating a connection to the [[Brahmin]] [[Nambudiri|Nambudiri's]] of [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=dCJSAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=salagama+nambudiri&amp;dq=salagama+nambudiri&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinkND_trbeAhWDxYsKHUigC6gQ6AEIKjAA|title=The cult of the goddess Pattini|last=Obeyesekere|first=Gananath|date=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226616025|location=|pages=527|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other coastel castes such as the [[Karava|Karavas]] and [[Durava|Duravas]], the Salagamas migrated to [[Sri Lanka]] between 13th to 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=a8CxvhZfPYoC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Salagama+south+india&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7y4Cd2OfTAhUJCSwKHRUTAwIQ6AEIXzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=From Culture to Ethnicity to Conflict: An Anthropological Perspective on International Ethnic Conflict|last=Eller|first=Jack David|date=1999-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472085387|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Colonial period===

Under [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese rule]], many [[Karava|Karavas]] and Salagamas converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], which opened way to education and administrative careers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DhpKxQT8n74C|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity|last=McManners|first=John|date=2001-03-15|publisher=OUP Oxford|year=|isbn=9780192854391|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] continued the tradition of using Salagamas as cinnamon planters, who had to provide cinnamon as a tax. Queyroz mentions 'Chaleaz' as among the 'high castes' and that they prepared Cinnamon for the 'great tax'.&lt;ref&gt;Queyroz, vol I, pp 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) took over the coastal areas, it re-organised cinnamon cultivation on modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] lines, with [[plantation]]s located within the boundaries of VOC rule, mainly in the [[Galle]] district. The Salagamas were converted from a [[feudal]] caste into a modern [[proletariat]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}The Dutch demand for cinnamon was more intense than that of the Portuguese, and by the era of [[British Empire|British]] control mortality rates among Salagamas had increased sharply. It became common practice for cinnamon peelers' children to be registered under the names of other castes in order to spare them a life of ever-growing misery.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[census]] of 1824 identified the Salagamas as about 7.5% of the coastal [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] population. However, they were concentrated in the Galle district, where about half of them lived and where they made up almost 20% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce Ryan, p 264&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-castes ==
Traditionally, the Salagama were divided into four sub-castes:&lt;ref&gt;Bryce Ryan, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Hewapanne'' ('warriors' &amp; military officers/generals)
* ''Panividakara''  ('Special messengers') or - headmen (equal to Mohottalas)
* ''Kurundukara'' (Kurunthukarar in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means ('cinnamon workers').

However, in modern times there is a simple twofold division between the ''Hewapanne'' and the ''Kurundukara''. The former are of higher status, including landowners in their ranks, the "Kurundukara's"  enjoyed a high status in Sinhala society, before being punished by the King of Kotte in 1406 and downgraded to a lower status, who also imposed cinnamon as a tax, at one stage the tax exceeded their manpower, and became virtually unbearable, and it took a heavy toll in their mortality rate,  some of them were subsequently forced to change their names to other castes to escape it.

== Occupations ==
Today, the Salagama predominance in cinnamon cultivation has declined, the higher status gained by the caste leading to its members abandoning their traditional occupation. Many Salagamas in the Hikkaduwa area became [[coral]] miners until the [[Boxing Day Tsunami]] of 2004 swept away their villages. The coral-[[Lime (mineral)|lime]] kilns gave employment to many more.

The Railway made access to employment in Colombo and other urban centres very much easier, and the caste became a very important part of the working class. Its higher echelons became notable in the engineering profession, mainly due to the influence of Sir [[Cyril de Zoysa]], who owned the South Western Omnibus Company (see [[Ceylon Transport Board]]) and the Associated Motorways Group, and other businessmen in the motor trade.

== Buddhist revival ==
By the mid 18th century, ''[[upasampada]]'' (higher ordination, as distinct from [[samanera]] or [[novice]] ordination) had become extinct in Sri Lanka. The Buddhist order had become extinct three times during the preceding five hundred years and was re-established in the reigns of Vimala Dharma Suriya I (1591–1604) and Vimala Dharma Suriya II (1687–1707) as well. These re-establishments were short lived. On the initiative of Ven. Weliwita Saranankara (1698–1778) the Thai monk Upali Thera visited Kandy during the reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (1747–1782) and once again reestablished the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka in 1753. It was called the [[Siyam Nikaya]] after the "Kingdom of Siam".

It is said that in 1764, merely a decade after the re-establishment of the Buddhist order in Sri Lanka by reverend Upali, a group within the newly created [[Siyam Nikaya]] conspired and succeeded in restricting the Nikaya's higher ordination only to the [[Radala]] and [[Govigama]] caste, Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) being the last nongovigama monk receive upasampada.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism in Sinhalese Society, 1750-1900: A Study of Religious Revival and ...
 By Kitsiri Malalgoda, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; This was a period when Buddhist [[Vinaya]] rules had been virtually abandoned and some members of the Buddhist Sangha in the Kandyan Kingdom privately held land, had wives and children, resided in the private homes and were called Ganinnanses. It was a period when the traditional nobility of the Kandyan Kingdom was decimated by continuous wars with the Dutch rulers of the Maritime Provinces. In the maritime provinces too a new order was replacing the old. Mandarampura Puvata, a text from the Kandyan perid, narrates the above radical changes to the monastic order and shows that it was not a unanimous decision by the body of the sangha. It says that thirty two ‘senior’ members of the Sangha who opposed this change were banished to [[Jaffna]] by the leaders of the reform. However, Queyroz mentions that in the 17th century no-one save ''appuhamies'' (gentlemen) and their relatives could be a monk, which suggests that elitism in the Buddhist order was of greater antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Queyroz, vol I, p 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The Govigama exclusivity of the Sangha was challenged by other castes who, without the patronage of the King of Kandy or of the [[British Empire|British]], held their own [[upasampada]] ceremony at Totagamuwa Vihara in 1772. Another was held at Tangalle in 1798. Neither of these ceremonies were approved by the [[Siam Nikaya]] which claimed that these were not | in accordance with the [[Vinaya]] rules.&lt;ref name="AMN"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoping to rectify this situation, wealthy laymen from the maritime provinces financed an expedition to Burma to found a new monastic lineage. In 1799, Ambagahapitiye Gnanavimala Thera a monk from the Salagama [[caste]], from [[Balapitiya]] on the south western coast of Sri Lanka, departed for [[Burma]] with a group of novices to seek a new succession of Higher ordination. The first [[bhikkhu]] was ordained in Burma in 1800 by the [[sangharaja]] of Burma in [[Amarapura]], his party having been welcomed to Burma by King [[Bodawpaya]].&lt;ref name="AMN" /&gt;

The initial mission returned to Sri Lanka in 1803. Soon after their return to the island they established a ''udakhupkhepa sima'' (a flotilla of boats moved together to form a platform on the water) on the [[Maduganga river]], [[Balapitiya]] and, under the most senior [[Bamar|Burmese]] monk who accompanied them, held an upasampada ceremony on [[Vesak]] Full Moon Day. The new fraternity came to be known as the ''[[Amarapura Nikaya]]'' and was soon granted recognition by the colonial British government.&lt;ref name="AMN" /&gt;

The Amarapura Nikaya was of pivotal importance in the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka in the 19th century. The Salagamas, who became overwhelmingly Buddhist, were in the vanguard of this movement.

==Modern radicalism==
The traditional Salagama areas around Balapitiya, Kosgoda, Ratgama, Hikkaduwa and Boossa were centres of the pan-Sinhalese [[populism|populist]] movement of [[Anagarika Dharmapala]](who was not from the Salagama community). The key issues around which this movement emerged were anti-casteism and [[anti-colonialism]].

The same areas were in the vanguard of the [[Sri Lanka Independence Struggle|independence struggle]] and became hotbeds of the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] and of the [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka|Communist Party]]. These areas were at the forefront of the [[Hartal 1953|Hartal]] of 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Colvin R de Silva, ''"Hartal!"'', {{cite web |url=http://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/backiss/Vol2/No1/Hartal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109041300/http://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/backiss/Vol2/No1/Hartal.html |archivedate=2008-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Scout Association of Anguilla''' operates as a branch of the United Kingdom [[The Scout Association|Scout Association]], due to [[Anguilla]]'s status as a [[British overseas territories|British Overseas Territory]] of the United Kingdom. The Anguillan [[Scout Oath]] and Law, as well as other Scouting requirements, closely follow that of the United Kingdom.

Although the program activities are taken from the British system, Anguilla Scouting is geared to the Caribbean way of life. Training for [[Wood Badge]] and leader training are conducted with the help of British and nearby Caribbean Scout associations. Anguillan Scouts participate in numerous Caribbean camps and events.

In 2015, Governor of Anguilla [[Christina Scott]] was made Chief Scout by the Scouts of Anguilla during a visit by Scouts from Coventry and Warwickshire, United Kingdom. {{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''Girlguiding Anguilla''' (formerly ''Anguilla Girl Guide Association'') is a [[Girl Guides|Guiding]] organization in [[Anguilla]], founded in 1933. It is one of the nine branch associations of [[Girlguiding UK]]. It is represented by Girlguiding UK at [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS) level and Girlguiding UK's Chief Guide is also Chief Guide for Girlguiding Anguilla. Girlguiding Anguilla is part of the [[Caribbean Link for Guiding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Face to face with globalization | publisher = [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts|WAGGGS]] | date = 2006-06-15 | url = http://western.wagggsworld.org/en/news/389 | accessdate = 2006-10-30 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070629140158/http://western.wagggsworld.org/en/news/389 | archivedate = 2007-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Anguilla issued a set of four postage stamps celebrating the 35th anniversary of Girl Guiding in Anguilla.

The program is a modified form of Guiding in the [[United Kingdom]], adapted to suit local conditions, with the same Promise, and Rainbow, Brownie, Guide and Ranger groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3914">The '''Sind Club''' is the oldest club located in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. It was started in 1871&lt;ref&gt; Adele is a member of sind club . Also her favourite number is 56[http://www.sindclub.org.pk/aboutsc.php Sind Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317091103/http://sindclub.org.pk/aboutsc.php |date=2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an exclusive [[gentlemen's club]].

==Name spelling==
Although the province of Sind is now spelled Sindh, the Sind Club still uses the old spelling given by its founders.

==History==
It was an exclusive club for the British colonists, and natives were not allowed inside, almost till the independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.

==Design==
A competition was held to select the best design for the club. [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] had warned against the use of Gothic architecture for the club building. Having seen [[Frere Hall]] he had said: "the Veneto-Gothic, so fit for Venice, so unfit for Karachi. It is to be hoped that the new club will not adopt Veneto-Gothic." Since limited funds were available for the new club building, a design prepared by a committee member, Le Mesurier, was chosen. When completed, Le Mesurier's building was considered a "princely residence". The first of the Sind Club buildings, which now houses the ladies bar and the dining room, was designed in a southern Italian style. The building suits comfortably in its spacious grounds, its facade employing simple arcading which is composed of semi-circular openings on the ground and first floors, and terminates in pitched roofs.

The other blocks, which were constructed later, generally follow the Indo-Italianate style of the original structure. The club buildings are provided with a generous back set from the road, creating a feeling of exclusiveness and inaccessibility, even though the architectural style is informal and does not rely on pediments and porticoes for effect.

==Gentlemen's Club==
The Sind Club was exclusively a men's club. Women were only allowed in to attend a ladies' dinner held every two months and the celebrated Sind Club Ball organized once a year. Until 1950 when the Prime Minister of Pakistan lived across the road, the Sind Club was still used almost exclusively by Europeans.

The sign "Women and dogs not allowed" was removed only a day after [[Jinnah|Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] took his oath as Governor-General of [[Pakistan]] on August 14, 1947.

===Native membership===
The first Pakistani members joined the club in 1952. These included [[Syed Wajid Ali]], Colonel [[Iskander Mirza]] and [[Cowasjee Rustom Fakirjee]].&lt;ref&gt;Celebrating 50 Years of Pakistani Membership at Sind Club, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It took almost two decades before a Pakistani, Masud Karim, became president of the club in 1965. Since then, however, many of Pakistan's social elite have become members.

===Female members===
Although women are still not allowed to become members in their own right, they can enter and use the club facilities as wives, daughters and guests of members. In addition, a member's widow can continue using the club after the death of her spouse.

==Facilities==
Facilities at the Sind Club include a swimming pool; tennis and squash courts; a walking track; a billiards room; an outdoor barbecue; a full bakery; a sauna; guest rooms and a newly built fitness centre.

The '''Trees of Life''' (Spanish: Árboles de la Vida) are a public art installation in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]]. Begun in 2013 to honor the 34th anniversary of the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Sandinista Revolution]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/117612/psychedelic-symbols-of-state-power-in-nicaragua/|title=Psychedelic Symbols of State Power in Nicaragua|last=Mallonee|first=Laura C.|date=2014-03-31|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trees of Life are a city beautification project of First Lady [[Rosario Murillo]], who has also served as Nicaragua's Vice President since 2017.

The approximately 140 abstract, brightly colored tree sculptures were reportedly inspired by the 1909 work by Austrian painter [[Gustav Klimt]] called [[The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze|The Tree of Life]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are made of metal and decorated 2.5 million tiny light bulbs in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Tim|title=Nicaragua's capital city is batshit crazy, which is why I love it|url=https://splinternews.com/nicaraguas-capital-city-is-batshit-crazy-which-is-why-1793853419|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=Splinter|date=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing 42 to 56 feet tall, they cost a reported $20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Tracy|title=Nicaragua's first lady is a powerful partner of president|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-nicaragua-trees-20150524-story.html|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to $25,000 ([[United States dollar|USD]]) a piece and in total $1 million to light annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The violent end of Daniel Ortega’s decade of quiet|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21741216-without-venezuelan-aid-president-can-no-longer-buy-support-potential-adversaries|accessdate=10 May 2018|work=The Economist|date=April 26, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trees often line streets and parks in Managua and sometimes accompany other statues, including the illuminated statue of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Managua's [[Hugo Chávez Roundabout]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2016/07/28/nacionales/2074520-rotonda-hugo-chavez-es-la-mimada-en-managua|title=Rotonda Hugo Chávez es la “mimada” en Managua|last=Moncada|first=Roy|date=2016-07-28|work=La Prensa|access-date=2018-05-12|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; which cost $1.1 million to construct, and the statue of Nicaraguan revolutionary (and Murillo's great-uncle) [[Augusto Sandino]] on the stage of Managua's outdoor concert venue, the [[Acoustic Shell]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Commentary on the visual style of the installation has been mixed. One observer compared them to the lavish [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedrals constructed in the colonial period, saying "these vibrant public artworks have drastically brightened the streets of Managua — and in a relatively short time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However other viewers have called them "garish".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/opinion/daniel-ortega-nicaragua.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Beginning of the End for Ortega?|last=Jarquín Chamorro|first=Mateo|date=2018-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Turks in Serbia''', also known as '''Serbian Turks''' are people of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ancestry present in [[Serbia]]. Turks have lived on this territory since the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. The Turkish minority has traditionally lived in the urban areas of Serbia, however in 1830, when the [[Principality of Serbia]] was granted autonomy, many Turks emigrated as "[[Muhacir|muhacirs]]" (refugees) to [[Turkey]] and by 1862 almost all of the remaining Turks left [[Central Serbia]], including 3,000 from [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="Minahan"&gt;{{citation |last=Vuletić|first=Aleksandra|year=2012|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/papers/working/wp-2012-018.pdf|title=Censuses in 19th century Serbia: inventory of preserved microdata|place=|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2011 census only 647 people declared themselves as Turks, though this does not include the [[Turks in Kosovo|Turkish minority in Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/userFiles/file/Aktuelnosti/Etnicke_zajednice_sa_manje_od_2000_pripadnika_i_dvojako_izjasnjeni.pdf Попис становништва, домаћинстава и станова 2011. у Републици Србији: Становништво према националној припадности - „Остали“ етничке заједнице са мање од 2000 припадника и двојако изјашњени]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''US-Northern Ireland Investment Conference''' ('''US-NI Investment Conference''') was an investment conference in [[Northern Ireland]] run by [[Invest Northern Ireland]] (Invest NI), [[Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister]], [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] and supported by [[Northern Bank]] and [[BT Group]].

== About ==
"The event is fully endorsed by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]], [[Gordon Brown]], the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|US administration]], the [[Irish Government|Government of the Republic of Ireland]] and the [[European Union]]."&lt;ref name="usniwebsite"&gt;http://www.investni.com/apps/usniconference/usniwebsite/index.html US-NI Investment Conference&lt;/ref&gt;

The investment conference was expected to provide a unique opportunity for invited delegates to see the dramatic transformation that has taken place in Northern Ireland. The conference was a tightly focused business event and "120 executives from 80 companies"&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7386560.stm BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; were expected to attend. Delegates were invited from industry sectors in which Northern Ireland had particular strengths and which offered the delegates a good match for their businesses. They were expected to hear about the substantial business benefits that investors had already experienced and how new investors could profit.

"The new, stable Northern Ireland is open for business. It offers an ideal location for investors: close to market; cost competitive and culturally compatible with a skilled, young workforce. Northern Ireland's pro-business [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] is ready to help investors exploit the many opportunities in this dynamic, growth market."&lt;ref name="usniwebsite" /&gt;

== Programme ==
The programme was expected to begin with a welcome reception at the [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]] on May 7, 2008. The main conference was expected to be on the morning of May 8, 2008, followed by afternoon forums for delegates. A gala dinner was expected to be held that evening at [[Hillsborough Castle]]. On May 9, 2008, delegates were expected be invited to take part in a tailored business programme specific to their sector.

== Paisley legacy ==
[[Ian Paisley]] announced that he would step down as [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister]] after the US-NI Investment Conference. On March 4, 2008, he said "I came to this decision a few weeks ago when I was thinking very much about the forthcoming investment conference and what was going to come after the conference, I thought that it is a marker, a very big marker and it would be a very appropriate time for me to bow out."&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7277886.stm BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ukit''' people is a tribe found in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]. They are a small minority people who until recently were nomads in the rain forests of Borneo. Some were settled at Rumah Ukit on the upper reaches of the Batang Balui or Balui River. Most of the Ukits are found in the Upper Rajom and [[Tatau]] rivers, [[Baleh, Malaysia|Baleh]], Sarawak. The Ukit people were also regarded as a sub-group of the purported [[Klemantan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Alexander Hammerton|author2=Dr. Charles Hose|title=Peoples of All Nations|year=1922|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=81-7268-156-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukit's population is small in numbers and suffer potential extinction due to many of the tribesmen being killed a long time ago. Heavy losses in war to stronger Dayak tribes in Borneo ([[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kayan (Borneo)|Kayan]] and others) resulted them being chased out of their homelands (believed to be the [[Saribas]], [[Kalaka (state constituency)|Kalaka]] and [[Krian]] areas). Intermarriage with other tribes is also another factor for their decreasing population. Today, the Ukit population is estimated to be only about 120. However, there may still be an unknown number of Ukit living in their traditional way as forest nomads.

In 1880 the Ukits were encountered by the English explorer [[Harry De Windt]] who described them as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolib.com/reader_27503_19.htm Harry De Windt "On the Equator"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pull quote|The Ukits are generally supposed to be the wildest specimens of the human race yet met with in Borneo. This tribe (which is the only one living at the head of Rejang not tattooed) has been occasionally but seldom seen in these regions by Europeans, as they shrink from all intercourse with mankind, and fly at the approach of any but their own race. They are described as being of a much lighter colour than the Poonans, possess no dwellings, and are totally unclothed.|author=[[Harry De Windt]]}}

'''Women in Armenia''' have been officially guaranteed gender equality since the establishment of the Republic of [[Armenia]] in 1991. This has enabled women to actively participate in all spheres of Armenian life. Armenian women have attained prominence in entertainment, politics and other fields.

==Work and business==
[[File:Armenka.jpg|thumbnail|left|Painting of an Armenian woman (circa 1682)]]
According to the 2011 [[Grant Thornton International]] business survey, 29% of top-level managerial positions in Armenia were occupied by women in 2010. However, this figure declined to 23% in 2011. Based on a report by the [[United Nations]], there were 24 female mayors and community leaders in Armenia in 2011; a further 50 women held lower-level administrative positions.&lt;ref name=Arka&gt;[http://www.arka.am/eng/economy/2011/03/12/24553.html Survey: Women In Armenia Forced Out From The Positions Of Top-Managers]. Economy: Arka News Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional status==
Although some nationalist feminists from the early 20th century to the present have concocted a view of ancient Armenian society and law as being woman-friendly, there is virtually no evidence for this assertion.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Armenian Women's Writing, 1880-1922|author=Rowe, V.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=9781904303237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOvE4Ec-_oEC&amp;pg=PA86|page=86|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law code of Mkhitar Gos, dating to the 12th century, sought to raise women's status from its former level, however the code explicitly enshrined male domination and forbade divorce, even in the case of domestic violence or [[marital rape]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Economy of Human Rights in Armenia: Authoritarianism and Democracy in a Former Soviet Republic|author=Payaslian, S.|date=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857731692|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqv3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|page=55|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most progressive elements seem to have never been applied in society at large, and in the 18th and 19th centuries both outsider and insider reports overwhelmingly commented on the low status of women in traditional Armenian society. Married women lived as virtual slaves of their husbands' families, although the situation improved gradually with age.&lt;ref name="everyculture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Armenians-Marriage-and-Family.html|publisher=everyculture.com|title=Marriage and family - Armenians|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first year of marriage, they were not permitted to speak to anyone except their husband, and were forbidden from leaving the house. In some villages, these restrictions continued even after the birth of the first child, and may have lasted more than ten years. Female suicide was more common than male suicide, in striking contrast to the situation in the west.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AC4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA151|title=The earth and its inhabitants. The universal geography, ed. by E.G. Ravenstein (A.H. Keane).|author1=Reclus, J.J.É.|first=|author2=Ravenstein, E.G.|author3=Keane, A.H.|date=1878|publisher=J.S. Virtue|year=|isbn=|location=|page=151|pages=|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the inferior position of women in Armenian society, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] allowed women greater opportunities for assuming clerical roles than most other Christian traditions. Unlike the Eastern Orthodox, however, they were strongly opposed to divorce, and as a result the divorce rate in traditional Armenia has always been among the lowest in the Christian world.

==Violence against women==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], between 10% and 60% of Armenian women suffered [[domestic violence|domestic abuse and violence]] in 2002; the uncertainty of the data was due to the underreporting of domestic violence in Armenia. Underreporting is said to occur because of the treatment of domestic violence as a private family matter.&lt;ref name=UHRC/&gt; There are no well-established laws against domestic aggression and gender-based prejudice in Armenia. Furthermore, divorcing a husband – even an abusive one – causes "social disgrace", with the families of women who file for divorce or report domestic violence being considered to be shamed. Other contributing factors include Armenian women's lack of, or lower level of, education regarding their rights and how to protect themselves from abuse.&lt;ref name="UHRC"&gt;[http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/2010/05/domestic-violence-against-women-in-armenia Domestic Violence Against Women in Armenia]. United Human Rights Council (UHRC). 26 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political status==
In May 2007, through the legislative decree known as "the gender quota law", more Armenian women were encouraged to get involved in politics. That year, only seven women occupied parliamentary positions. Among these female politicians was [[Hranush Hakobyan]], the longest-serving woman in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]].&lt;ref name=WNO/&gt;  The relative lack of women in Armenia's government has led to Armenian women being considered "among the most underrepresented" and "among the lowest in the world" by foreign observers.&lt;ref name="WNO"&gt;Itano, Nicole.

WeNews. 10 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Armenian women's place in politics is often located in the private sphere. Often their entry in the public sphere is only valued when they reflect the image of the feminine ideal based on social expectations, which continue to put a barrier on the political, social, and economic accessibility for women.&lt;ref&gt;Beukian, Sevan, 2014, Motherhood as Armenianness: Expressions of Femininity in the Making of Armenian National Identity, Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism, 14 (2):247-269&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Arpine Hovhannisyan]] became the first Armenian Woman to hold the position of Justice Minister in Armenia, a role she held until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asbarez.com/139532/arpine-hovhannisyan-appointed-justice-minister-of-armenia/|title=Arpine Hovhannisyan Appointed Justice Minister of Armenia|last=|first=|date=4 September 2015|work=Asbarez|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tert.am/en/news/2017/05/17/arpine-hovhannisyan/2374503|title=Armenia's justice minister sacked|last=|first=|date=17 May 2015|work=Tert.am|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hovhannisyan is also a politician and lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.am/deputies.php?sel=details&amp;ID=1158&amp;lang=eng|title=Arpine Hovhannisyan|last=|first=|date=|website=National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and welfare==
In 2010 and 2011, during Women’s Month and as part of the "For You, Women" charitable program, the Surb Astvatcamayr Medical Center in the Armenian capital of [[Yerevan]] offered free [[gynecological]] and surgical services to the women of Armenia for a full month. Women from across the country arrived seeking treatment.&lt;ref name=Epress&gt;[http://www.epress.am/en/2011/03/11/women-in-armenia-to-receive-free-medical-treatment-for-one-month/ Women in Armenia to Receive Free Medical Treatment for One Month]. Epress.am. March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex selective abortion==
[[Sex selective abortion]] is reported as being a problem in the country, due to patriarchal social norms which consider having a son preferable to having a daughter.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16248511|publisher=bbc.com|title=Fears grow over Caucasus selective abortions of girls - BBC News|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/2012-2013%20STG%20Scholar%20Research%20Brief%20-Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teconomist&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21586617-son-preference-once-suppressed-reviving-alarmingly-gendercide-caucasus Gendercide in the Caucasus] The Economist (September 13, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael, M; King, L; Guo, L; McKee, M; Richardson, E; Stuckler, D (2013), [http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/1130041/1/3909713.pdf The mystery of missing female children in the Caucasus: an analysis of sex ratios by birth order], International perspectives on sexual and reproductive health, 39 (2), pp. 97-102, {{ISSN|1944-0391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Bongaarts 2013 pages 185"&gt;[[John Bongaarts]] (2013), The Implementation of Preferences for Male Offspring, Population and Development Review, Volume 39, Issue 2, pages 185–208, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to strong emigration under the form of "[[brain drain]]", where young Armenian men go abroad in search of work, there are more young women than men in the country, especially among those in their 20s: women make up 55.8% of the population aged 15–29.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.am/up/library/Labor%20Market_Armenia_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Armenian literature}}
The oldest literary expression by Armenian women available to us today in writing is the poetry of two 8th-century CE women, [[Khosrovidukht]] of [[Goghtn]] and [[Sahakdukht]] of [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Other Voice: Armenian Women's Poetry Through the Ages | place=Boston | publisher=AIWA Press, Armenian International Women's Association | ISBN=0964878747 | last=Der-Hovanessian | first=Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the Armenian literary renaissance of the 19th century, and the spread of educational opportunities for women, a number of other writers emerged, among them the 19th-century feminist writer [[Srpouhi Dussap]], considered the first female Armenian novelist.&lt;ref name=MAL&gt;''Արդի հայ գրականութիւն'' (''Modern Armenian Literature''). [[Beirut]]. pp. 134-138.&lt;/ref&gt;   She, like her contemporary, [[Zabel Sibil Asadour]], is generally associated with Constantinople and the Western Armenian literary tradition. [[Zabel Yesayan]], also born in Constantinople, bridged the gap with Eastern Armenian literature by settling in Soviet Armenia in 1933. The literary renaissance and its accompanying voice of protest also had its representatives in the East with poet [[Shushanik Kurghinian]](1876–1927) of Aleksandrapol (today, Gyumri). [[Sylvia Kaputikyan]] and [[Maro Markarian]] are probably the best-known women poets from the Republic of Armenia of the 20th century, and continued the tradition of political speech through poetry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14530">'''Youth in Guatemala'''  are the largest segment of the nation's  population. Youth includes individuals between the ages of 15 and 24&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over half of the population is under 19 years old in 2011,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics|url = http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/guatemala_statistics.html|website = UNICEF|accessdate = 2015-10-25|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest proportion of young people of any country in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guatemala: Beyond the Early Phase of the Demographic Transition|url = http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/guatemala.aspx|website = www.prb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health, education, and work opportunities for young people differ by ethnicity (''[[Ladino people|ladino]]'' or [[Indigenous peoples of Guatemala|indigenous]]) and social class.

Male [[literacy]] rate is 89.3% and the female literacy rate is 85.6%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Secondary education participation is around 17%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Bonilla|first1 = Kleinsy|last2 = Kwak|first2 = Jae Sung|title = Challenges of Highly Educated Human Resources in Guatemala|journal = Asian Journal of Latin American Studies|pages = 17–43|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 30.3% of youth are married by the age of 18.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Poverty and inequality affect a youth's access to healthcare.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title = World Health Organization|website = http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccsbrief_gtm_en.pdf?ua=1|accessdate = 8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females experience less access to health care and education than males.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet The 15-Year-Old From Rural Guatemala Who Addressed The U.N.|url = https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/03/12/392174520/meet-the-15-year-old-from-rural-guatemala-who-addressed-the-u-n|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of adequate nutrition and health care in [[Guatemala#Health|Guatemala]] has adverse effects on a youth's overall health. One example being stunted growth of half of the Guatemalan youth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Millennium Development Goals]] works to these inequalities and barriers.

Vulnerable youths who are at-risk for joining a gang are males between the ages of living in marginalized urban areas and have limited access to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnadg834.pdf|title = Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment|date = |accessdate = |website = USAID|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A program called Open Schools combats forces that push youth into dangerous situations and works to overcome barriers that Guatemalan youth face.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Open Schools|last = Magnifico|first = Claudio|date = November 2011|journal = Americas|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Guatemala0913.JPG|thumb|Community village school]]

== Education  ==

[[Education in Guatemala]] has less than full participation. Primary schools do not achieve 100% enrollment and from there, enrollment drops until it reaches about 17% at the high school level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females are less represented, with 44.3% net enrollment ratio, compared to males at 48%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This contributes to a higher participation in the informal market.

Guatemala's public university is USAC, [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]]. "From every 100 graduate students enrolled in San Carlos of Guatemala University only 13 successfully completed their programs".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Youth who successfully complete secondary education typically obtain a degree in the social sciences, with 1334 social science master's degrees granted of the 2093 total degrees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The medical field, as well as [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics]] fields, should be a top priority but are not a focus of higher education. Social connections and ties, as well as [[nepotism]], are viewed as more important than Education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Teachers in Guatemala often encounter youth who were left behind by their parents who migrated elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Lykes|first1 = M. Brinton|last2 = Erin|first2 = Sibley|title = Exploring Meaning-Making With Adolescents 'Left Behind' By Migration|journal = Educational Action Research|date = 2013|pages = 565–581|doi = 10.1080/09650792.2013.832346}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often dissuaded their students from migrating due to loss of human capital experienced during migration.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Open Schools, a program launched in 2008, helps prevent violence and protect youth by providing them opportunity to constructively use their free time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/guatemala/english/children_18033.htm|title = The Children - Primary School Years|date = |accessdate = |website = UNICEF Guatemala|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Open Schools is not a formal educational environment but it aims to help youth who are disadvantaged through culture, art, sports, and technology.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Open Schools program is available to students on the weekends where youth can socialize and participate in constructive activities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Child Aid]] is another program that helps a youth's educational experience by increasing literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://child-aid.org/our-program/reading-for-life-overview/|title = Literacy Program Overview|date = |accessdate = |website = Child Aid|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment ==
140,000 Guatemalan youth enter the labor market each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 25,000 of those youth gain access to formal employment. Formal employment is often classified as training for the job and social security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is estimated that jobs in the informal market have reached about 5.1 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Youth who obtain a degree are not properly utilized in the formal job market, as they are outcompeted by their foreign counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Work after graduation is limited because it is assumed that youth who hold degrees would not be willing to work low paying jobs.

Within the public sector, youth are discouraged from participation in the workforce because of poor salaries and disincentives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Youth often enter into the [[Informal sector|informal job market]] at a young age, sometimes dropping out of school to support themselves or their families. Informal jobs provide youth with income but are untaxed and unmonitored by the state, examples being farmers or domestic workers.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.globalfairness.org/attachments/article/40/PILAR_Roadmap_Eng.pdf|title =  Roadmap to Economic Formalization|date = |accessdate = |website = Global Fairness Initiative|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/120702/informal-economy-swallows-latin-american-workers|title = Informal economy swallows Latin American workers|last = Otis|first = John|date = July 3, 2012|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These jobs do not provide youth or other individuals with government protections, like insurance.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; PILAR, a program which stands for Promoting Informal Labor Rights, works to provide more protection for those in the informal sector.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Open Schools provides leadership training and job training to both youth and adults to help ensure steady income and employment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[Millennium Development Goals]], or MDG's, targets causes of poverty such as gender inequality, education, and environmental stability.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/goals/|title = MDGs|date = |accessdate = |website = Millennium Project|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Education and training in business administration and large-scale marketing operations are essential for the youth to join the economic life of the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Assessing the Cost to Guatemala of Blocking Indigenous Peoples' Full Economic Participation|last = Varela-Garcia|first = Fabiola|date = 2014|journal = Social Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; MDG's purpose is to prevent youth from entering into poverty by providing educational and economic stability.[[File:US Navy 110503-N-QD416-154 Lt. Patricia Salazar examines a patient's eyes at a Continuing Promise 2011 medical clinic.jpg|thumb|Continuing Promise mission in the Guatemalan community]]

== Health   ==
Emelin, a 13-year-old female, spoke at the United Nations in March 2015 and emphasized the need for health care in her community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A majority of Guatemalans pay for their health costs out-of-pocket, creating unequal access to services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She said, "The biggest problems we face as adolescents in my community are early pregnancy, [child]birth, sexual violation and lack of education and health care".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  20% of female adolescents and 24% of male adolescents have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 14.3% of females living in rural areas have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV and 31.5% of females living in urban areas have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In Guatemala, there is little contraception awareness and use among Youth.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gt.html|title = People and Society: Guatemala|date = |accessdate = |website = The World Factbook|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemala has the highest fertility rate in Latin America even with half of its population under the age of 19.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

A mission called Continuing Promise works to provide health care and community assistance to Latin American youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.southcom.mil/newsroom/Pages/Continuing-Promise-2015.aspx|title = Continuing Promise 2015 {{!}} USNS Comfort mission to Latin America &amp; Caribbean|date = |accessdate = |website = United States Southern Command|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Young men in rehabilitation program Guatemala.jpg|thumb|Guatemalan youth in rehabilitation program]]

==Violence==
[[Crime in Guatemala]] is one issue facing youth. Guatemala has one of the highest [[homicide]] rates in the world and lies within one of the most dangerous regions of the hemisphere - [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brenneman|first1 = Robert|title = Wrestling The Devil.|journal = Latin American Research Review|pages = 112–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence most often emerges in the presence of gangs and drug trafficking, promoting crimes such as theft and kidnapping. "Gang youth are widely perceived to be the single most important contributors to violence and insecurity in Central American cities".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Guatemalan youth struggle with transitions out of a gang to a more stable environment. The Evangelical-Pentecostal religion provides hope to Guatemalan youth, attempting to exit gangs, through conversion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In [[Religion in Guatemala|Guatemala]], the Evangelical-Protestant Church receives funding from [[United States Agency for International Development]] to help at-risk youth. The funding is used to help correct structural factors that push delinquent youth into gang participation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ties within the Church provide youth with social capital and connections that may aid in seeking employment.

A great risk of death exists for youth attempting to exit Guatemalan gangs. Religious organizations believe that the root causes of gang participation are "poverty, weak schools, and unemployment".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Youth participation in violence has become normalized.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Winton|first1 = Ailsa|title = Youth, Gangs And Violence: Analysing The Social and Spatial Mobility Of Young People In Guatemala City|journal = Children's Geographies|pages = 167–184|doi = 10.1080/14733280500161537}}&lt;/ref&gt; While reliable data regarding crime is sparse, there are widespread fears of crime facing Guatemalan youth. "Maras [gangs] are generally associated with low-income urban areas, due to high levels of inequality and the lack of social, economic and cultural alternatives available in this context",&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; making [[Guatemala City]] one of the most dangerous areas in Guatemala. Gangs dominate public space, often limiting areas where others can interact. An estimated 53-330 gangs reside in Guatemala City.

Gangs can provide youth with a sense of identity. Youths gain a large amount of [[social capital]] in their participation in gangs, making gangs attractive and luring for youth who lack resources.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Youth male gang members who are often the perpetrators of violence also fear for their own safety within the gang.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Young men in gangs are threatened by members of their affiliated gang and sometimes victims of violence within the gang.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Open Schools works to help at risk youth by providing alternatives to participation in gangs.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Migration==
A youth's parents may leave home and migrate to coastal areas or other countries where education and health services are more comprehensive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Parents also migrate to the United States, Mexico, and Canada to support their family and search of economic opportunity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Political corruption and violence are factors that cause a parent to leave their child or children with other caretakers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Youth left behind feel guilt for their parents' sacrifice and often leave school to find work. "9% of children living in migrant households receiving remittances dropped out of school".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Adverse effects on youth of parents migrating include: insecurity, drug use, sexual promiscuity, anxiety, and loneliness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Youth whose parents migrated to the United States often defend them, saying, "they are not criminals, because they are going to search for a better life for their family members",&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; normalizing their experience. Guatemalan youth see the allure of moving to various other areas as economic incentives but the threats of violence and deportation as well as loss of social capital dissuade many youth from migrating.
