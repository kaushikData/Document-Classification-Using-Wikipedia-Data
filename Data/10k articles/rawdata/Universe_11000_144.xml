      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8085">'''Acoustic emission''' ('''AE''') is the phenomenon of radiation of acoustic (elastic) waves in solids that occurs when a material undergoes irreversible changes in its internal structure, for example as a result of crack formation or plastic deformation due to aging, temperature gradients or external mechanical forces. In particular, AE is occurring during the processes of ''mechanical loading'' of materials and structures accompanied by structural changes that generate local sources of [[elastic wave]]s. This results in small surface displacements of a material produced by elastic or [[stress wave]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacuk.co.uk/default.asp?id=53 pacuk.co.uk website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227105512/http://www.pacuk.co.uk/default.asp?id=53 |date=December 27, 2011 }}.

==Phenomena==
Acoustic emission is the transient elastic waves within a material, caused by the rapid release of localized stress energy. An ''event'' source is the phenomenon which releases [[elastic energy]] into the material, which then propagates as an elastic wave. Acoustic emissions can be detected in frequency ranges under 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, and have been reported at frequencies up to 100&amp;nbsp;MHz, but most of the released energy is within the 1&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1&amp;nbsp;MHz range. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0&amp;nbsp;Hz, and typically falling off at several MHz.

The three major applications of AE techniques are: 1) source location – determine the locations where an ''event'' source occurred; 2) material mechanical performance – evaluate and characterize materials/structures; and 3) health monitoring – monitor the safe operation of a structure, for example, bridges, pressure containers, and pipe lines, etc.

More recent research has focused on using AE to not only locate but also to characterise the source mechanisms&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; such as  crack growth, friction, delamination, matrix cracking, etc. This would give AE the ability to tell the end user what source mechanism is present and allow them to determine whether  structural repairs are necessary.
 
AE can be related to an irreversible release of energy. It can also be generated from sources not involving material failure, including [[friction]], [[cavitation]] and impact.

==Uses==
{{Main|Non-destructive testing}}

The application of acoustic emission to non-destructive testing of materials typically takes place between 100&amp;nbsp;kHz and 1&amp;nbsp; MHz. Unlike conventional ultrasonic testing, AE tools are designed for monitoring acoustic emissions produced by the material during failure or stress, and not on the material's effect on externally generated waves.  Part failure can be documented during unattended monitoring. The monitoring of the level of AE activity during multiple load cycles forms the basis for many AE safety inspection methods, that allow the parts undergoing inspection to remain in service.&lt;ref name=UltrasonicMethods&gt;{{cite book|last=Blitz|first=Jack|author2=G. Simpson|title=Ultrasonic Methods of Non-Destructive Testing|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|year=1991|isbn=978-0-412-60470-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is used, for example, to study the formation of cracks during the welding process, as opposed to locating them after the weld has been formed with the more familiar ultrasonic testing technique. In a material under active stress, such as some components of an airplane during flight, transducers mounted in an area can detect the formation of a crack at the moment it begins propagating. A group of transducers can be used to record signals, then locate the precise area of their origin by measuring the time for the sound to reach different transducers. The technique is also valuable for detecting cracks forming in pressure vessels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Also, this technique is used for estimation of corrosion in reinforced concrete structures.&lt;ref name="UltrasonicMethods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estimation of corrosion in reinforced concrete by electrochemical techniques and acoustic emission, journal of advanced concrete technology, vol. 3, No 1, 137–144, February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to non-destructive testing, acoustic emission monitoring has applications in process monitoring. Applications where acoustic emission monitoring has successfully been used include detecting anomalies in fluidized beds, and end points in batch granulation.

Standards for the use of acoustic emission for non-destructive testing of pressure vessels have been developed by the [[ASME]], [[ISO]] and the European Community.

The '''Aeroprediction''' Code is a semi-empirical [[computer program]] that estimates the [[aerodynamics]] of weapons over the Mach number range 0 to 20, angle of attack range 0 to 90 degrees and for configurations that have various cross sectional body shapes. Weapons considered include [[projectiles]], [[missiles]], [[bombs]], [[rocket]]s and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. Both static and dynamic aerodynamics are predicted with good accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The code also predicts the trajectory of the weapon using the aerodynamics predicted by the code.

The code may be used to compute the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] and [[static margin]] of missiles.

The [[Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act]] provides insights into how to use aerodynamic prediction codes such as Aeroprediction in the design of missile for US acquisition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The '''aircraft design process''' is the [[engineering design process]] by which [[aircraft]] are designed. These depend on many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand, safety protocols, physical and economic constraints etc. For some types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities. This article deals with powered aircraft such as [[airplane]]s and [[helicopter]] designs.

Aircraft design is a compromise between many competing factors and constraints and accounts for existing designs and market requirements to produce the best aircraft.

==Design constraints==
===Purpose===
The design process starts with the aircraft's intended purpose. Commercial airliners are designed for carrying a passenger or cargo payload, long range and greater fuel efficiency where as fighter jets are designed to perform high speed maneuvers and provide close support to ground troops. Some aircraft have specific missions, for instance, [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious airplanes]] have a unique design that allows them to operate from both land and water, some fighters, like the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], have [[VTOL]] (Vertical Take-off and Landing) ability, helicopters have the ability to hover over an area for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hovering|url=http://www.dynamicflight.com/flight_maneuvers/hovering/|work=Flight maneuvers|publisher=www.dynamicflight.com|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose may be to fit a specific requirement, e.g. as in the historical case of a [[list of Air Ministry specifications|British Air Ministry specification]], or fill a perceived "gap in the market"; that is, a class or design of aircraft which does not yet exist, but for which there would be significant demand.

===Aircraft regulations===
Another important factor that influences the design of the aircraft are the regulations put forth by [[National aviation authority|national airworthiness authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-lra-2-0-2566.htm#2-7 | title=Airworthiness - Transport Canada | publisher=Transport Canada | work=Airworthiness Directives | access-date=2011-12-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417023605/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-lra-2-0-2566.htm#2-7 | archive-date=2011-04-17 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.casa.gov.au/scripts/nc.dll?WCMS:STANDARD::pc=PC_90822 | title=Airworthiness - CASA | publisher=CASA - Australian Government | work=Airworthiness Directives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airports may also impose limits on aircraft, for instance, the maximum wingspan allowed for a conventional aircraft is 80 m to prevent collisions between aircraft while taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAO Aerodrome Standards|url=http://www.icao.int/fsix/_Library%5CManual%20Aerodrome%20Stds.pdf|work=ICAO Regulations|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial factors and market===
Budget limitations, market requirements and competition set constraints on the design process and comprise the non-technical influences on aircraft design along with environmental factors. Competition leads to companies striving for better efficiency in the design without compromising performance and incorporating new techniques and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft Design|year=1999|publisher=Arnold Publishers|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-340-74152-X|author=Lloyd R. Jenkinson|author2=Paul Simpkin|author3=Darren Rhodes|page=10|chapter=Aircraft Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and ’60s, unattainable project goals were regularly set, but then abandoned, whereas today troubled programs like the [[Boeing 787]] and the [[Lockheed Martin F-35]] have proven far more costly and complex to develop than expected.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
More advanced and integrated design tools have been developed.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; [[Model-based systems engineering]] predicts potentially problematic interactions, while [[Computational science|computational analysis]] and optimization allows designers to explore more options early in the process.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; Increasing [[automation]] in engineering and manufacturing allows faster and cheaper develoment.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
Technology advances from materials to manufacturing enable more complex design variations like multifunction parts.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; Once impossible to design or construct, these can now be [[3D printed]], but they have yet to prove their utility in applications like the [[Northrop Grumman B-21]] or the re-engined [[A320neo]] and [[737 MAX]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; [[Airbus and Boeing]] also recognize the economic limits, that the next [[airliner]] generation cannot cost more than the previous ones did.&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology-milestones/problems-aerospace-still-has-solve |title= Problems Aerospace Still Has To Solve |date= May 6, 2016 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental factors===
An increase in the number of aircraft also means greater carbon emissions. Environmental scientists have voiced concern over the main kinds of pollution associated with aircraft, mainly noise and emissions. Aircraft engines have been historically notorious for creating noise pollution and the expansion of airways over already congested and polluted cities have drawn heavy criticism, making it necessary to have environmental policies for aircraft noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel(Air) - Aircraft Noise|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air/environment/aircraft_noise_en.htm|work=Mobility and Transport|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 October 2011|date=2010-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003255/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air/environment/aircraft_noise_en.htm#|archive-date=2009-04-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annex 16 - Environmental Protection |url=http://www.icao.int/icaonet/anx/info/annexes_booklet_en.pdf |work=Convention on International Civil Aviation |publisher=ICAO |accessdate=8 October 2011 |page=29 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005040825/http://www.icao.int/icaonet/anx/info/annexes_booklet_en.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise also arises from the airframe, where the airflow directions are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airframe Noise Reduction|url=http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/airframe.htm|work=NASA Aeronautics|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=William Wilshire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021225904/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/airframe.htm#|archive-date=2011-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved noise regulations have forced designers to create quieter engines and airframes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment: Aircraft Noise Reduction|url=http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/noise.htm|work=NASA Aeronautics|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Neal Nijhawan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018200346/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/noise.htm#|archive-date=2011-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions from aircraft include particulates, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Sulfur dioxide]](SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO), various [[oxides]] of [[nitrates]] and unburnt [[hydrocarbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safeguarding our atmosphere|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs10grc.html|work=Fact Sheet|publisher=NASA - Glenn Research Center|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To combat the pollution, ICAO set recommendations in 1981 to control aircraft emissions.&lt;ref name="Doc 9889"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAO Airport Air Quality Guidance Manual |url=http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/9889/9889_en.pdf |work=ICAO Guidelines |publisher=ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) |accessdate=7 October 2011 |format=PDF |date=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214220636/http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/9889/9889_en.pdf |archivedate=December 14, 2013 }}(see http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Documents/Publications/FINAL.Doc%209889.1st%20Edition.alltext.en.pdf for updated manual.&lt;/ref&gt; Newer, environmentally friendly fuels have been developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biofuel Flight Demonstration|url=http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/en/us/allaboutus/environment/biofuel.jsp|work=Environment|publisher=Virgin Atlantic|accessdate=7 October 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of recyclable materials in manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft Recycling : Life and times of an aircraft|url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/airlines-international/august-2011/pages/aircraft-recycling.aspx|work=Pressroom - Airlines International|publisher=IATA|accessdate=7 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027053159/http://www.iata.org/pressroom/airlines-international/august-2011/Pages/aircraft-recycling.aspx#|archive-date=2011-10-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have helped reduce the ecological impact due to aircraft. Environmental limitations also affect airfield compatibility. Airports around the world have been built to suit the topography of the particular region. Space limitations, pavement design, runway end safety areas and the unique location of airport are some of the airport factors that influence aircraft design. However changes in aircraft design also influence airfield design as well, for instance, the recent introduction of new large aircraft (NLAs) such as the superjumbo [[Airbus A380]], have led to airports worldwide redesigning their facilities to accommodate its large size and service requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Aircraft Characteristics Related To Airport Planning|url=http://my.fit.edu/~dkirk/3241/Lectures/Atrgpap.pdf|work=First ATRG Conference, Vancouver, Canada|publisher=Air Transport Research Group of the WCTR Society|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Alexandre Gomes de Barros|author2=Sumedha Chandana Wirasinghe|format=PDF|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airports prepare for the A380|url=http://atwonline.com/airline-financedata/article/airports-prepare-a380-0309|work=Airline Finance/Data|publisher=ATW (Air Transport World)|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Sandra Arnoult|date=2005-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The high speeds, fuel tanks, atmospheric conditions at cruise altitudes, natural hazards (thunderstorms, hail and bird strikes) and human error are some of the many hazards that pose a threat to air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bird hazards|url=http://www.airsafe.com/birds.htm|work=Hazards|publisher=www.airsafe.com|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The human component in air accidents|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/safe/safety/human_and_accidents.htm|work=Air Safety|publisher=www.pilotfriend.com|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Weather Hazards |url=http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/2-P32E.PDF |work=LAKP Prairies |publisher=www.navcanada.ca |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030637/http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/2-P32E.PDF |archivedate=16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airworthiness]] is the standard by which aircraft are determined fit to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airworthiness|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/airworthiness|work=Dictionary|publisher=The Free online Dictionary|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The responsibility for airworthiness lies with [[National aviation authority|national aviation regulatory bodies]], [[Aircraft manufacturers|manufacturers]], as well as owners and operators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] sets international standards and recommended practices for national authorities to base their regulations on &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/technology-standards.aspx | title=ICAO regulations | publisher=ICAO | accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www2.icao.int/en/ism/ICAO%20Annexes/Annex%208.pdf | title=Annex 8 - ICAO | publisher=ICAO | accessdate=May 5, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905175315/http://www2.icao.int/en/ism/ICAO%20Annexes/Annex%208.pdf# | archive-date=2012-09-05 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national regulatory authorities set standards for airworthiness, issue certificates to manufacturers and operators and the standards of personnel training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft Design|year=1999|publisher=Arnold Publishers|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-340-74152-X|author=L. Jenkinson|author2=P. Simpkin|author3= D. Rhodes|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every country has its own regulatory body such as the [[Federal Aviation Authority]] in USA, [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation)]] in India, etc.

The aircraft manufacturer makes sure that the aircraft meets existing design standards, defines the operating limitations and maintenance schedules and provides support and maintenance throughout the operational life of the aircraft. The aviation operators include the [[Civil aviation|passenger and cargo airliners]], [[Military aviation|air forces]] and owners of private aircraft. They agree to comply with the regulations set by the regulatory bodies, understand the limitations of the aircraft as specified by the manufacturer, report defects and assist the manufacturers in keeping up the airworthiness standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Most of the design criticisms these days are built on [[crashworthiness]]. Even with the greatest attention to airworthiness, accidents still occur. Crashworthiness is the qualitative evaluation of how aircraft survive an accident. The main objective is to protect the passengers or valuable cargo from the damage caused by an accident. In the case of airliners the stressed skin of the pressurized fuselage provides this feature, but in the event of a nose or tail impact, large bending moments build all the way through the fuselage, causing fractures in the shell, causing the fuselage to break up into smaller sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crashworthy Design Principles|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=AD0623575|work=Technical Report|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)|accessdate=9 October 2011|author=D. L. Greer|author2=J. S. Breeden|author3=T. L. Heid|date=1965-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the passenger aircraft are designed in such a way that seating arrangements are away from areas likely to be intruded in an accident, such as near a propeller, engine nacelle undercarriage etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFullText/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-HFM-113/EN-HFM-113-07.pdf|title=Basic Principles of Crashworthiness|publisher=NATO|author=Dennis F. Shanahan}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the cabin is also fitted with safety features such as oxygen masks that drop down in the event of loss of cabin pressure, lockable luggage compartments, safety belts, lifejackets, emergency doors and luminous floor strips. Aircraft are sometimes designed with emergency [[water landing]] in mind, for instance the [[Airbus A330]] has a 'ditching' switch that closes valves and openings beneath the aircraft slowing the ingress of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airbus A330-A340 Overhead Panel |url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/data/pdfs/plane/airbus/a340/instructor/A330-A340_Overhead_Pushbuttons.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330161341/http://www.smartcockpit.com/data/pdfs/plane/airbus/a340/instructor/A330-A340_Overhead_Pushbuttons.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 March 2012 |work=Data |publisher=www.smartcockpit.com |accessdate=9 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design optimization==
Aircraft designers normally rough-out the initial design with consideration of all the constraints on their design. Historically design teams used to be small, usually headed by a Chief Designer who knows all the design requirements and objectives and coordinated the team accordingly. As time progressed, the complexity of military and airline aircraft also grew. Modern military and airline design projects are of such a large scale that every design aspect is tackled by different teams and then brought together. In general aviation a large number of light aircraft are designed and built by [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur hobbyists and enthusiasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Built Aircraft|url=http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/gen_av/ultralights/amateur_built/|work=General Aviation and Recreational Aircraft|publisher=FAA|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer-aided design of aircraft==
[[File:Navion in Datcom3d.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The external surfaces of an aircraft modelled in [[MATLAB]]]]
In the early years of aircraft design, designers generally used analytical theory to do the various engineering calculations that go into the design process along with a lot of experimentation. These calculations were labour-intensive and time-consuming. In the 1940s, several engineers started looking for ways to automate and simplify the calculation process and many relations and semi-empirical formulas were developed. Even after simplification, the calculations continued to be extensive. With the invention of the computer, engineers realized that a majority of the calculations could be automated, but the lack of design visualization and the huge amount of experimentation involved kept the field of aircraft design stagnant. With the rise of programming languages, engineers could now write programs that were tailored to design an aircraft. Originally this was done with mainframe computers and used low-level programming languages that required the user to be fluent in the language and know the architecture of the computer. With the introduction of personal computers, design programs began employing a more user-friendly approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft Design Software|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/ct11.html|work=Computer Technology|publisher=NASA|accessdate=29 December 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990824052440/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/ct11.html |archivedate = 24 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}

== Design aspects ==
The main aspects of aircraft design are:
#[[Aerodynamics]]
#[[Powered aircraft|Propulsion]]
#[[Aircraft flight control system|Controls]]
#[[Mass]]
#[[Fixed-wing aircraft#structure|Structure]]

All aircraft designs involve compromises of these factors to achieve the design mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Techniques for Aircraft Configuration Optimization|url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/design/optimization1.html|work=Aircraft Design : Synthesis and Analysis|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2011-09-20|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701103526/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/design/optimization1.html#|archive-date=2012-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wing design ===
{{See also|Wing configuration}}
The wing of a fixed-wing aircraft provides the lift necessary for flight. Wing geometry affects every aspect of an aircraft’s flight. The wing area will usually be dictated by the desired [[stalling speed]] but the overall shape of the [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]] and other detail aspects may be influenced by wing layout factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil jet aircraft design|isbn=0-340-74152-X|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wing can be mounted to the fuselage in high, low and middle positions. The wing design depends on many parameters such as selection of [[aspect ratio]], taper ratio, [[sweepback]] angle, thickness ratio, section profile, [[Washout (aviation)|washout]] and [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft design|isbn=0-340-74152-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cross-sectional shape of the wing is its [[airfoil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding aircraft structures|isbn=1-4051-2032-0|author=John Cutler|author2=Jeremy Liber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the wing starts with the [[Rib (aircraft)|rib]] which defines the airfoil shape. Ribs can be made of wood, metal, plastic or even composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aero Engineering Vol II Part I|year=1938|publisher=George Newnes|author=Hugh Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing must be designed and tested to ensure it can withstand the maximum loads imposed by maneuvering, and by atmospheric gusts.

=== Fuselage ===
{{Main|Fuselage}}
The fuselage is the part of the aircraft that contains the cockpit, passenger cabin or cargo hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuselage Layout|url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/fuselayout/fusesection.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2011-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010307121441/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/fuselayout/fusesection.html#|archive-date=2001-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propulsion ===
[[File:Aircraft engine.jpg|thumb|Aircraft engine]]
{{Main|Aircraft engine}}
Aircraft propulsion may be achieved by specially designed aircraft engines, adapted auto, motorcycle or snowmobile engines, electric engines or even human muscle power. The main parameters of engine design are:{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
 
*Maximum engine thrust available
*Fuel consumption
*Engine mass
*Engine geometry

The thrust provided by the engine must balance the drag at cruise speed and be greater than the drag to allow acceleration. The engine requirement varies with the type of aircraft. For instance, commercial airliners spend more time in cruise speed and need more engine efficiency. High-performance fighter jets need very high acceleration and therefore have very high thrust requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beginner's Guide to Propulsion|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/bgp.html|work=Beginner's Guide|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight ===
{{Main|Aircraft gross weight}} 
The weight of the aircraft is the common factor that links all aspects of aircraft design such as aerodynamics, structure, and propulsion, all together. An aircraft's weight is derived from various factors such as empty weight, payload, useful load, etc. The various weights are used to then calculate the center of mass of the entire aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft weight and balance|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/wt_bal.htm|work=Pilot friend - Flight training|publisher=www.pilotfriend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The center of mass must fit within the established limits set by the manufacturer.

=== Structure ===
The aircraft structure focuses not only on strength, stiffness, durability ([[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]), fracture toughness, stability, but also on fail-safety, [[corrosion]] resistance, maintainability and ease of manufacturing. The structure must be able to withstand the stresses caused by [[cabin pressurization]], if fitted, turbulence and engine or rotor vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Structures|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|isbn=978-1-85617-932-4|author=T.H.G Megson|edition=4th|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design process and simulation==
{{Expand section|date=December 2011}}
The design of any aircraft starts out in three phases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Performance and design|year=1999|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-001971-1|pages=382–386|author=John D. Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual Design===
[[File:Br-673.svg|thumb|Conceptual design of a [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]] 673]]
The first design step, involves sketching a variety of possible aircraft configurations that meet the required design specifications. By drawing a set of configurations, designers seek to reach the design configuration that satisfactorily meets all requirements as well as go hand in hand with factors such as aerodynamics, propulsion, flight performance, structural and control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Design - A conceptual approach|year=1992|publisher=American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=0-930403-51-7|page=4|author=D. Raymer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called design optimization. Fundamental aspects such as fuselage shape, wing configuration and location, engine size and type are all determined at this stage. Constraints to design like those mentioned above are all taken into account at this stage as well. The final product is a conceptual layout of the aircraft configuration on paper or computer screen, to be reviewed by engineers and other designers.

===Preliminary design phase===
The design configuration arrived at in the conceptual design phase is then tweaked and remodeled to fit into the design parameters. In this phase, [[wind tunnel]] testing and [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational fluid dynamic]] calculations of the flow field around the aircraft are done. Major structural and control analysis is also carried out in this phase. Aerodynamic flaws and structural instabilities if any are corrected and the final design is drawn and finalized. Then after the finalization of the design lies the key decision with the manufacturer or individual designing it whether to actually go ahead with the production of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft design - A conceptual approach|year=1992|publisher=American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=0-930403-51-7|page=5|author=D. Raymer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this point several designs, though perfectly capable of flight and performance, might have been opted out of production due to their being economically nonviable.

===Detail design phase===
This phase simply deals with the fabrication aspect of the aircraft to be manufactured. It determines the number, design and location of [[Rib (aircraft)|ribs]], [[Spar (aviation)|spars]], sections and other structural elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft performance and Design|year=1999|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|isbn=0-07-001971-1|author=John D. Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All aerodynamic, structural, propulsion, control and performance aspects have already been covered in the preliminary design phase and only the manufacturing remains. [[Flight simulator]]s for aircraft are also developed at this stage.

== Program development ==

An existing aircraft program can be developed for performance and economy gains by stretching the [[fuselage]], increasing the [[MTOW]], enhancing the aerodynamics, installing new [[aircraft engine|engine]]s, new wings or new avionics.
For a 9,100 nmi long range at Mach 0.8/FL360, a 10% lower [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|TSFC]] saves 13% of fuel, a 10% [[Lift-to-drag ratio|L/D]] increase saves 12%, a 10% lower [[OEW]] saves 6% and all combined saves 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=11837 |title= Improving the Efficiency of Engines for Large Nonfighter Aircraft |author= Committee on Analysis of Air Force Engine Efficiency Improvement Options for Large Non-fighter Aircraft |work= [[US Air Force]] Studies Board - Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences |publisher= [[US National Research Council]] |isbn= 0-309-66765-8 |date= 2007 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ammonal''' is an [[explosive]] made up of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[aluminium]] powder, not to be confused with T-ammonal which contains [[trinitrotoluene]] as well to increase properties such as [[brisance]].

The ammonium nitrate functions as an [[oxidizer]] and the aluminium as fuel. The use of the relatively cheap ammonium nitrate and aluminium makes it a replacement for pure [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]].

The mixture is affected by humidity because ammonium nitrate is highly [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]. Ammonal's ease of detonation depends on fuel and oxidizer ratios, 95:5 ammonium nitrate and aluminum being fairly sensitive, however not very oxygen balanced. Even copper metal traces are known to sensitize bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate and further increase danger of spontaneous detonation during a fire, most likely due to the formation of [[tetramine]]s. More oxygen balanced mixtures are not easily detonated, requiring a fairly substantial shock, though it remains more sensitive than [[trinitrotoluene]] and [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]].

The [[detonation velocity]] of ammonal is approximately 4,400 metres per second or 9,842 miles per hour.

==History==
From early 1916, the [[British Army]] employed ammonal for their [[Military mining|mines]] during [[World War I]], starting with the [[Hawthorn Ridge mine]] during the [[Battle of the Somme]], and reaching a zenith in the [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|mines in the Battle of Messines]] which were exploded on 7 June 1917 at the start of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (also known as the Battle of Passchendaele). Several of the mines in the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] contained 30,000&amp;nbsp;lbs (over 13.6 [[tonne]]s) of ammonal, and others contained 20,000&amp;nbsp;lbs (over 9 tonnes). The joint explosion of the ammonal mines beneath the German lines at Messines created 19 large craters, killing 10,000 German soldiers in one of the [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|largest non-nuclear explosions]] in history. Not all of the [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|mines laid by the British Army at Messines]] were detonated, however. Two mines were not ignited in 1917 because they had been abandoned before the battle, and four were outside the area of the offensive. On 17 July 1955, a [[lightning]] strike set off one of these four latter mines. There were no human casualties, but one cow was killed. Another of the unused mines is believed to have been found in a location beneath a farmhouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Tweedie  | first = N. | title = Farmer who is sitting on a bomb | work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2004-01-12 | accessdate = 2010-05-17 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1451468/Farmer-who-is-sitting-on-a-bomb.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no attempt has been made to remove it.

Ammonal used for military mining purposes was generally contained within metal cans or rubberised bags to prevent moisture ingress problems. The composition of ammonal used at Messines was 65% ammonium nitrate, 17% aluminium, 15% [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT), and 3% [[charcoal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Brown, G. I. | year = 1998 | title = The Big Bang: A History of Explosives | publisher = Sutton Publishing | isbn = 0-7509-1878-0 | page = 163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonal remains in use as an industrial explosive. Typically, it is used for [[quarry]]ing or [[mining]] purposes.

[[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], a [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatist organisation, used 250&amp;nbsp;kg of ammonal in a [[car bomb]] in its attack on the [[1987 Zaragoza Barracks bombing|Zaragoza barracks]] on 11 December 1987 in [[Zaragoza]], Spain.

'''Auguste Rateau''' (13 October 1863 – 13 January 1930) was an [[engineer]] and [[industrialist]] born in [[Royan]], France, specializing in [[turbine]]s.

==Biography==
After studies, first at the [[École Polytechnique]] and then at the [[École des Mines de Paris]], he began his career as a teacher at the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Saint-Étienne|École des Mines de Saint-Étienne]] from 1888 to 1897.

He then embarked on an industrial career exploiting turbines. He manufactured fans for mines, blowers for steel mills, water pumps, and [[steam turbine]]s for ships. To this end, he created a design office in [[Paris]] and, in 1903, the ''Société pour l’exploitation des appareils Rateau'', which moved in 1917 to [[La Courneuve]] where he opened a [[factory]] two years later. The company has since been integrated into [[Alstom]], and La Courneuve's premises are still operated by [[GE Power Service]]. This entity manages the maintenance of turbomachines, [[turbo-pump]]s and [[turbocompressor]]s installed on nuclear, thermal and industrial sites in France and in some parts of the world.

In 1928 he founded the ''[[Association Française de Normalisation]]'', the French national organization for [[standardization]], and served as president.

Rateau was a [[Commander (order)|Commander]] of the [[Legion of Honour]] ({{lang|fr|Commandeur de l'Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur}}) and a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] ({{lang|fr|Académie des sciences}}).

One type of lamp has a violet [[light filter|filter]] material, either on the bulb or in a separate glass filter in the lamp housing, which blocks most visible light and allows through UV,&lt;ref name="Booth" /&gt; so the lamp has a dim violet glow when operating.&lt;ref name="GlowInc"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blacklight lamps which have this filter have a lighting industry designation that includes the letters "BLB".&lt;ref name="Booth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GlowInc" /&gt;  This stands for "blacklight blue", which is a contradiction in that they are the type that does ''not'' look blue.

A second type of lamp produces ultraviolet but does not have the filter material, so it produces more visible light and has a blue color when operating.&lt;ref name="Booth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GlowInc" /&gt;  These tubes are made for use in "[[bug zapper]]" insect traps, and are identified by the industry designation "BL".&lt;ref name="GlowInc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rorie" /&gt; 

Blacklight sources may be specially designed [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs), [[lasers]], or [[incandescent lamp]]s; although incandescents produce almost no blacklight (except slightly more for halogen types), and so are not considered true blacklight sources.&lt;ref name="GlowInc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rorie" /&gt;   In [[medicine]], [[forensics]], and some other scientific fields, such a light source is referred to as a Wood's lamp, named after [[Robert Williams Wood]] who invented the original [[Wood's glass]] UV filters.

Although many other types of lamp emit ultraviolet light with visible light, black lights are essential when UV-A light without visible light is needed, particularly in observing [[fluorescence]],&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GlowInc" /&gt; the colored glow that many substances emit when exposed to UV.  Black lights are employed for decorative and artistic lighting effects, diagnostic and therapeutic uses in medicine,&lt;ref name="Booth" /&gt; the detection of substances tagged with [[fluorescent dye]]s, [[rockhound|rock-hunting]], the detection of [[counterfeit money]], the curing of plastic resins, attracting insects&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; and the detection of [[refrigerant]] leaks affecting [[refrigerator]]s and [[air conditioning]] systems. Strong sources of long-wave ultraviolet light are used in [[tanning bed]]s.&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;  Although the low-power UV-A emitted by black lights is not a hazard to skin or eyes and can be viewed without protection, powerful ultraviolet sources present dangers and require [[personal protective equipment]] such as goggles and gloves.

Fluorescent black light tubes are typically made in the same fashion as normal [[fluorescent tube]]s except that a [[phosphor]] that emits UVA light instead of visible white light is used.  The type most commonly used for black lights, designated '''blacklight blue''' or "BLB" by the industry, has a dark blue filter coating on the tube, which filters out most visible light, so that [[fluorescence]] effects can be observed.  These tubes have a dim violet glow when operating.  They should not be confused with "blacklight" or "BL" tubes, which have no filter coating, and have a brighter blue color.&lt;ref name="insect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insect-o-cutor.com/ioclibrary/blacklight.pdf|title=About Black Light|publisher=Insect-O-Cutor|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604215247/http://www.insect-o-cutor.com/ioclibrary/blacklight.pdf|archivedate=2013-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are made for use in "[[bug zapper]]" insect traps, where visible light emission is not a problem.   The phosphor typically used for a near 368 to 371 nanometer emission peak is either [[europium]]-doped strontium fluoroborate ({{Chem|Sr|B|4|O|7|F}}:{{chem|Eu|2+}}) or europium-doped strontium borate ({{chem|Sr|B|4|O|7|}}:{{chem|Eu|2+}}) while the phosphor used to produce a peak around 350 to 353 nanometres is lead-doped barium silicate ({{chem|Ba|Si|2|O|5}}:{{chem|Pb|+}}). "Blacklight Blue" lamps peak at 365&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110141710/http://www.sylvania.com/BusinessProducts/MaterialsandComponents/LightingComponents/Phosphor/PhotocopyandUVEmitting Osram Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers use different numbering systems for black light tubes. Philips uses one system which is becoming outdated (2010), while the (German) [[Osram]] system is becoming dominant outside North America. The following table lists the tubes generating blue, UVA and UVB, in order of decreasing wavelength of the most intense peak.&lt;ref&gt;Compiled from various Philips, Osram and Sylvania Lighting Catalogues&lt;/ref&gt; Approximate phosphor compositions, major manufacturer's type numbers and some uses are given as an overview of the types available. "Peak" position is approximated to the nearest 10&amp;nbsp;nm. "Width" is the measure between points on the shoulders of the peak that represent 50% intensity.

Wood's glass tubes manufactured by Osram use a fairly narrow-band emitting phosphor, europium activated strontium pyroborate with a peak at about 370&amp;nbsp;nm, whereas North American and Philips Wood's glass tubes use lead-activated calcium metasilicate that emits a wider band with a shorter wavelength peak at about 350&amp;nbsp;nm. These two types seem to be the most commonly used. Different manufacturers offer either one or the other and sometimes both.

[[File:Fluorescent Black-Light spectrum with peaks labelled.gif|thumb|250px|Spectrum of a black light fluorescent tube. [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] spectral bandwidth of the 370&amp;nbsp;nm peak is about 20&amp;nbsp;nm.  The tiny secondary peak ''(2)'' is light from the mercury vapor line at 404&amp;nbsp;nm leaking through the filter, which gives the lamp its purple glow.]]

BLB fluorescent lamps tend to run with efficiencies in the 25% range, with an example being a Phillips 40W BLB T12 lamp emitting 9.8W of UVA for 39 Watts of power input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phillips Lighting: F40T12/BLACKLIGHT/48 BLB LF Datasheet|url=https://www.assets.lighting.philips.com/is/content/PhilipsLighting/fp928011310821-pss-en_us|year=2018|publisher=philips.com|accessdate=2018-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829194046/https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.assets.lighting.philips.com%2Fis%2Fcontent%2FPhilipsLighting%2Ffp928011310821-pss-en_us&amp;embedded=true|archive-date=2018-08-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Bug zapper" tubes====
Another class of UV fluorescent bulb is designed for use in "[[bug zapper]]" flying insect traps.  Insects are attracted to the UV light, which they are able to see, and are then [[electrocute]]d by the device. These bulbs use the same UV-A emitting phosphor blend as the filtered blacklight, but since they do not need to suppress visible light output, they do not use a purple filter material in the bulb.

===Incandescent===
[[File:Ultraviolet light bulb 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|100-watt incandescent black light bulb]]

A black light may also be formed by simply using a UV filter coating such as [[Wood's glass]] on the envelope of a common [[incandescent bulb]]. This was the method that was used to create the very first black light sources. Although incandescent black light bulbs are a cheaper alternative to fluorescent tubes, they are exceptionally inefficient at producing UV light since most of the light emitted by the filament is visible light which must be blocked. Due to its [[black body]] spectrum, an incandescent light radiates less than 0.1% of its energy as UV light. Incandescent UV bulbs, due to the necessary absorption of the visible light, become very hot during use. This heat is, in fact, encouraged in such bulbs, since a hotter filament increases the proportion of UVA in the black-body radiation emitted. This high running-temperature drastically reduces the life of the lamp, however, from a typical 1000 hours to around 100 hours.

===Mercury vapor===
[[File:BlackLight.JPG|thumb|upright=0.4|A 160-watt [[mercury vapor]] black light]]
High power [[mercury vapor]] black light lamps are made in power ratings of 100 to 1,000 watts. These do not use phosphors, but rely on the intensified and slightly broadened 350&amp;ndash;375&amp;nbsp;nm spectral line of mercury from high pressure discharge at between {{convert|5|and|10|atm|sigfig=1}}, depending upon the specific type. These lamps use envelopes of Wood's glass or similar optical filter coatings to block out all the visible light and also the short wavelength (UVC) lines of mercury at 184.4 and 253.7&amp;nbsp;nm, which are harmful to the eyes and skin. A few other spectral lines, falling within the pass band of the Wood's glass between 300 and 400&amp;nbsp;nm, contribute to the output.
These lamps are used mainly for theatrical purposes and concert displays. They are more efficient UVA producers per unit of power consumption than fluorescent tubes.

===LED===
[[Image:Uv-LED.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|UV LED]]
Ultraviolet light can be generated by some [[light-emitting diode]]s, but wavelengths below 380&amp;nbsp;nm are uncommon and the emission peaks are broad, so only the very lowest energy UV [[photons]] are emitted, within predominantly visible light.

==Medical applications==
[[File:Black light bulb.jpg|thumb|[[Compact fluorescent lamp|Compact fluorescent]] (CF) black light bulb]]
A '''Wood's lamp''' is a diagnostic tool used in [[dermatology]] by which [[ultraviolet light]] is shone (at a wavelength of approximately 365 nanometers) onto the skin of the patient; a technician then observes any subsequent [[fluorescence]]. For example, [[porphyrins]]—associated with some skin diseases—will fluoresce pink. Though the technique for producing a source of ultraviolet light was devised by [[Robert Williams Wood]] in 1903 using "[[Wood's glass]]", it was in 1925 that the technique was used in [[dermatology]] by Margarot and Deveze for the detection of fungal infection of hair. It has many uses, both in distinguishing fluorescent conditions from other conditions and in locating the precise boundaries of the condition.

===Fungal and bacterial infections===
It is also helpful in diagnosing:

===Ethylene glycol poisoning===
[[File:Fluorescein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fluorescein]] glowing under ultraviolet light]]
A Wood's lamp may be used to rapidly assess whether an individual is suffering from [[ethylene glycol poisoning]] as a consequence of [[antifreeze]] ingestion. Manufacturers of ethylene glycol-containing antifreezes commonly add [[fluorescein]], which causes the patient's urine to [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under Wood's lamp.&lt;ref name="pmid2344083"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Winter M.

{{See also|Ultraviolet#Subtypes|l1=Subtypes of the ultraviolet spectrum}}

Although black lights produce light in the UV range, their spectrum is mostly confined to the longwave UVA region, that is, UV radiation nearest in wavelength to visible light, with low frequency and therefore relatively low energy. While low, there is still some power of a conventional black light in the UVB range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=Curtis |first2=P. Donald |last2=Forbes |first3=Ronald E. |last3=Davies |title=An Action Spectrum for UV Photocacinogenesis |journal=Photochem Photobiol |year=1986 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=275–284 |pmid=3703962 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.1986.tb05605.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0031-8655&amp;date=1986&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UVA is the [[Ultraviolet#Harmful effects|safest of the three spectra of UV light]], although high exposure to UVA has been linked to the development of [[skin cancer]] in humans. The relatively low energy of UVA light does not cause [[sunburn]]. UVA is capable of causing damage to [[collagen]] fibers, however, so it does have the potential to accelerate [[skin]] aging and cause [[wrinkle]]s. UVA can also destroy [[vitamin A]] in the skin.

UVA light has been shown to cause [[DNA damage]], but not directly, like UVB and UVC. Due to its longer [[wavelength]], it is absorbed less and reaches deeper into [[skin layers]], where it produces reactive chemical intermediates such as [[hydroxyl radical|hydroxyl]] and [[oxygen radical|oxygen]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]s, which in turn can damage DNA and result in a risk of [[melanoma]]. The weak output of black lights, however, is not considered sufficient to cause DNA damage or cellular [[mutation]]s in the way that direct summer sunlight can, although there are reports that overexposure to the type of UV radiation used for creating artificial suntans on [[sunbeds]] can cause DNA damage, photoaging (damage to the skin from prolonged exposure to sunlight), toughening of the skin, suppression of the immune system, cataract formation and skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ESPCR Blog |publisher=European Society for Pigment Cell Research |url=http://www.espcr.org/blog/?cat=19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726034833/http://www.espcr.org/blog/?cat=19 |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Zeman |title=Ultraviolet Radiation |date=2009 |publisher=Health Physics Society |url=http://www.hps.org/hpspublications/articles/uv.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113032517/http://www.hps.org/hpspublications/articles/uv.html |archivedate=2010-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

[[File:Sorpion Under Blacklight.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Scorpion]] [[Fluorescence|fluorescing]] under ultraviolet from a black light]]
Ultraviolet radiation is invisible to the human eye, but illuminating certain materials with UV radiation causes the emission of visible light, causing these substances to glow with various colors.  This is called ''[[fluorescence]]'', and has many practical uses.   Black lights are required to observe fluorescence, since other types of ultraviolet lamps emit visible light which drowns out the dim fluorescent glow.

Black light is commonly used to authenticate [[oil paintings]], [[antique]]s and [[banknote]]s. Black lights can be used to differentiate real currency from [[counterfeit]] notes because, in many countries, legal banknotes have fluorescent symbols on them that only show under a black light. In addition, the paper used for printing money does not contain any of the brightening agents which cause commercially available papers to fluoresce under black light. Both of these features make illegal notes easier to detect and more difficult to successfully counterfeit. The same security features can be applied to identification cards.

Other security applications include the use of pens containing a fluorescent ink, generally with a soft tip, that can be used to "invisibly" mark items. If the objects that are so marked are subsequently stolen, a black light can be used to search for these security markings. At some [[theme park]]s, [[nightclub]]s and at other, day-long (or night-long) events, a fluorescent mark is [[rubber stamp]]ed onto the wrist of a guest who can then exercise the option of leaving and being able to return again without paying another admission fee.

In medicine, the Wood's lamp is used to check for the characteristic fluorescence of certain [[Dermatophyte|dermatophytic]] fungi such as species of ''Microsporum'' which emit a yellow glow, or [[corynebacterium]] which have a red to orange color when viewed under a Wood's lamp. Such light is also used to detect the presence and extent of disorders that cause a loss of pigmentation, such as [[vitiligo]]. It can also be used to diagnose other [[Mycosis|fungal infections]] such as [[ringworm]], [[microsporum canis]], [[tinea versicolor]]; bacterial infections such [[erythrasma]]; other skin conditions including [[acne]], [[scabies]], [[alopecia]], [[porphyria]]; as well as [[cornea]]l scratches, foreign bodies in the eye, and blocked tear ducts.&lt;!-- spam ref pulled --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=I.

Fluorescent materials are also very widely used in numerous  applications in molecular biology, often as "tags" which bind themselves to a substance of interest (for example, DNA), so allowing their visualization. Black light can also be used to see animal excreta such as urine and vomit that is not always visible to the naked eye.

Black light is used extensively in non-destructive testing. Fluorescing fluids are applied to [[metal]] structures and illuminated with a black light which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It is also used to illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black [[velvet]], which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a [[sensory room]] under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students with profound and multiple learning difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://callcentre.education.ed.ac.uk/SEN/Early_Ed/Sensory_Stim_EEA/Visual_Stim_EEB/UV_Light_EEC/uv_light_eec.html Communication Aids for Language and Learning&amp;mdash;UV light] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605051942/http://callcentre.education.ed.ac.uk/SEN/Early_Ed/Sensory_Stim_EEA/Visual_Stim_EEB/UV_Light_EEC/uv_light_eec.html |date=2010-06-05 }} Equipment for use in sensory rooms for students with profound and multiple learning difficulties in United Kingdom schools.&lt;/ref&gt; Such fluorescence from certain textile fibers, especially those bearing [[optical brightener]] residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]''. [[Puppet#Black light puppet|Black light puppet]]ry is also performed in a black light theater.

One of the innovations for night and all-weather flying used by the US, UK, Japan and [[Germany]] during [[World War II]] was the use of UV interior lighting to illuminate the instrument panel, giving a safer alternative to the [[radium]]-painted instrument faces and pointers, and an intensity that could be varied easily and without visible illumination that would give away an aircraft's position. This went so far as to include the printing of charts that were marked in UV-fluorescent inks, and the provision of UV-visible [[pencils]] and [[slide rules]] such as the [[E6B]].

Thousands of moth and insect collectors all over the world use various types of black lights to attract moth and insect specimens for photography and collecting. It is one of the preferred light sources for attracting insects and moths at night.

It may also be used to test for [[LSD]], which fluoresces under black light while common substitutes such as [[25I-NBOMe]] do not.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=1700 The fluorometric determination of lysergic acid diethylamide and ergonovine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225153913/https://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=1700 |date=2015-12-25 }} A fluorometer was designed to detect very small amounts of LSD and ergonovine. The instrument proved less satisfactory than the Bowman fluorometer. Both LSD and ergonovine lost their fluorescence very rapidly upon strong ultraviolet irradiation. The mechanism involved in this decrease in fluorescence is not known.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, if a leak is suspected in a [[refrigerator]] or an [[air conditioning]] system, a UV tracer dye can be injected into the system along with the compressor lubricant oil and refrigerant mixture. The system is then run in order to circulate the dye across the piping and components and then the system is examined with a blacklight lamp. Any evidence of fluorescent dye then pinpoints the leaking part which needs replacement.

'''Castle thunder''' is a [[sound effect]] that consists of the sound of a loud [[thunder|thunderclap]] during a rainstorm. It was originally recorded for the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', and has since been used in dozens of films, television programs, and commercials.

==History==
After its use in ''Frankenstein'', the Castle Thunder was used in dozens of films from the 1930s through the 1980s, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985), and ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/363094/the-castle-thunder-noise-that-rocked-a-thousand-movies |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=The "Castle Thunder" Noise that Rocked a Thousand Movies |website=[[io9]] |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |date= March 3, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atoz"&gt;{{cite book|last= Kroon |first= Richard W. |title=A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and Other Audiovisual Terms|page=127|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|location=Jefferson, N.C.|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7864-9556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the effect in subsequent years has declined because the quality of the original [[analog recording]] does not sufficiently hold up in modern sound mixes.&lt;ref name="atoz" /&gt;

The effect appears in [[List of Disney animated features|Disney]], ''[[Peanuts filmography|Peanuts]]'', and [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons, including the original ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' animated series.&lt;ref name="sound"&gt;{{cite book|last= Cox |first= Trevor |title=The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World|edition=1st|page=193|publisher=[[W.

The sound can be found on a few sound effects libraries distributed by [[Sound Ideas]] (such as the Network Sound Effects Library, the 20th Century Fox Sound Effects Library and the Hanna-Barbera SoundFX Library).

'''College of the Redwoods (CR)''' is a public two-year [[community college]] with its main campus in [[Eureka, California]]. It is part of the [[Redwoods Community College District]] that serves four counties and has two branch campuses, as well as three additional sites. On-campus housing is available at the main campus.

==Curriculum specialties==
'''College of the Redwoods''' is one of 114 colleges in the [[California Community College]] system. The college offers a variety of transfer, vocational, and community-based classes, including its Fine Woodworking Program started by master woodworker [[James Krenov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crfinefurniture.com/|title=The Krenov School of Fine Furniture|website=www.crfinefurniture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Police Academy, Nursing and Dental Programs, Truck Driving School, Computer Information Sciences, Computer-Aided Drafting, and Digital Media Departments, [[Yurok language]]&lt;ref&gt;Atherton, Kelley.

Accessed 30 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hospitality, Restaurant and Culinary Arts Program (added in 2006). The college is named after the [[Coast Redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens'') trees native to the region.

==Satellite campuses==
CR has a satellite branch campuses, '''CR Del Norte''' in [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]], [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Del Norte Site &gt; Home |url=https://www.redwoods.edu/delnorte/ |website=www.redwoods.edu |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another former satellite campus '''CR Mendocino Coast'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoods.edu/mendocino/|title=Mendocino Coast Campus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website= www.redwoods.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Fort Bragg, California|Fort Bragg]], [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino County]], was transferred to [[Mendocino College]] and renamed as the Mendocino College Coast Center in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.mendocino.edu/article/mendocino-college-announces-ribbon-cutting-and-open-house-new-coast-center|date=August 8, 2017|title=Mendocino College Announces Ribbon Cutting and Open House at New Coast Center|accessdate=2018-01-01|website=www.mendocino.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; CR also has other off-campus sites, including the Bianchi Farm in Shively, the Klamath-Trinity Instructional Site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoods.edu/klamath-trinity/|title=College of the Redwoods Home &gt; Klamath-Trinity|website=www.redwoods.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Hupa|Hoopa Valley Tribe]] reservation, and the Southern Humboldt Instructional Site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoods.edu/southernhumboldt/|title=Southern Humboldt Instructional Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=www.redwoods.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Garberville in Southern [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]]. The [[Arcata]] Instructional Site, the McKinleyville Instructional Site, and the Eureka Downtown Instructional Site were closed in the summer of 2012, though Community Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoods.edu/departments/community-ed/|title=College of the Redwoods Home &gt; Academics|website=www.redwoods.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; re-located to a new Eureka downtown site.

==History==
The original Redwoods Community College District was formed in 1964 by a vote of the people of Humboldt County. Founding President Eugene J. Portugal and his wife Dottie Portugal shaped the look of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redwoods.edu/students/newtocr.asp |title=New to CR |website=www.redwoods.edu |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About CR &gt; About CR Home &gt; Mission/Vision |url=https://www.redwoods.edu/aboutcr/Mission |website=www.redwoods.edu |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, residents of the coastal portion of Mendocino County voted to join the District, and in 1978 Del Norte County similarly joined. The college serves these areas, as well as a portion of [[Trinity County, California|Trinity County]].

In 2012, CR's regional accreditor [[Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges]] (ACCJC) placed the college on "Show Cause" status, warning the college that its accreditation might be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accjc.org/all-commission-publications-policies|title=ACCJC Publications &amp; Policies|website=www.accjc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later removed the college from probation and reaffirmed its accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoods.edu/Accreditation/|title=Accreditation &gt; Accreditation Home|website=www.redwoods.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accjc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ACCJC_DIRECTORY_of_ACCREDITED_INSTITUTIONS_NOV_6_2015.pdf |title=Directory of Accredited Institutions |website=www.accjc.org |date=November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
The college is part of the [[Redwoods Community College District]], itself part of the [[California Community Colleges System]]. The district is governed by the elected seven-member Board of Trustees.

==Finances==
Beginning with the passage of [[Proposition 13]] by California in 1978, College of the Redwoods and most public institutions in the state have suffered declining revenue, and this has continued following the [[Dot-Com Bust]]. All of this occurs while simultaneously suffering increasing costs due to [[inflation]], [[population growth]], and increasingly unfunded state and federal mandates. In 2006, voters passed Bond Measure Q/B&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoods.edu/bond/ft.asp/|title=Full Text of Measure Q/B&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=www.redwoods.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ballot Measure Q in Humboldt, northwest Mendocino and western Trinity counties; Ballot Measure B in Del Norte County) to allow issuance of $40,320,000 in bond funding to upgrade and renovate facilities at the main campus in Eureka and the branch campuses in Crescent City and Fort Bragg. Measure Q Bond Funds were also used to acquire the Garberville Site in Southern Humboldt County.

[[File:Corona discharge 1.JPG|thumb|Long exposure photograph of corona discharge on an insulator string of a 500 kV [[overhead power line]].  Corona discharges represent a significant power loss for  [[electric utility|electric utilities]]. ]] 
[[File:Коронный разряд.jpg|thumb|upright|The corona discharge around a high-voltage coil]]

A '''corona discharge''' is an [[electrical discharge]] brought on by the [[ionization]] of a [[fluid]] such as air surrounding a [[conductor (material)|conductor]] that is [[electric charge|electrically charged]]. Spontaneous corona discharges occur naturally in high-voltage systems unless care is taken to limit the [[electric field]] strength. A corona will occur when the strength of the electric field ([[potential gradient]]) around a conductor is high enough to form a conductive region, but not high enough to cause [[electrical breakdown]] or [[electric arc|arcing]] to nearby objects. It is often seen as a bluish (or other color) glow in the air adjacent to pointed metal conductors carrying high voltages, and emits light by the same property as a [[gas discharge lamp]].

In many high voltage applications corona is an unwanted side effect. Corona discharge from high voltage electric power [[transmission line]]s constitutes an economically significant waste of energy for utilities.  In high voltage equipment like [[Cathode Ray Tube]] televisions, [[radio transmitter]]s, [[X-ray machine]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s the current leakage caused by coronas can constitute an unwanted load on the circuit. In air, coronas generate gases such as [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitric oxide]] (NO), and in turn [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and thus [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) if [[water vapor]] is present. These gases are corrosive and can degrade and embrittle nearby materials, and are also toxic to people and the environment. Corona discharges can often be suppressed by improved insulation, [[corona ring]]s, and making high voltage electrodes in smooth rounded shapes. However, controlled corona discharges are used in a variety of processes such as air filtration, [[photocopier]]s and [[ozone generator]]s.

[[File:Nje shkarkese korone ne nje luge.jpg|thumb|alt=|Corona discharge from a spoon attached to the high voltage terminal of a [[Tesla coil]].]]

== Introduction ==
A corona discharge is a process by which a current flows from an electrode with a high [[potential]] into a neutral fluid, usually air, by [[ion]]izing that fluid so as to create a region of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] around the electrode. The ions generated eventually pass [[electric charge|charge]] to nearby areas of lower potential, or recombine to form neutral gas molecules.

When the [[potential gradient]] (electric field) is large enough at a point in the fluid, the fluid at that point ionizes and it becomes conductive. If a charged object has a sharp point, the electric field strength around that point will be much higher than elsewhere. Air near the electrode can become ionized (partially conductive), while regions more distant do not. When the air near the point becomes conductive, it has the effect of increasing the apparent size of the conductor. Since the new conductive region is less sharp, the ionization may not extend past this local region. Outside this region of ionization and conductivity, the charged particles slowly find their way to an oppositely charged object and are neutralized.

Along with the similar [[brush discharge]], the corona is often called a "single-electrode discharge", as opposed to a "two-electrode discharge"; an [[electric arc]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A corona only forms when the conductor is widely enough separated from conductors at opposite potential that an arc cannot jump between them.  If the geometry and gradient are such that the ionized region continues to grow until it reaches another conductor at a lower potential, a low resistance conductive path between the two will be formed, resulting in an [[electric arc]].

Corona discharge only forms when the [[electric field]] (potential gradient) at the surface of the conductor exceeds a critical value, the [[dielectric strength]] or disruptive potential gradient of the fluid.  In air at atmospheric pressure it is roughly 30 kilovolts per centimeter,&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; but decreases with pressure, so corona is more of a problem at high altitudes.&lt;ref name="Fridman"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corona discharge usually forms at highly curved regions on electrodes, such as sharp corners, projecting points, edges of metal surfaces, or small diameter wires. The high curvature causes a high [[potential gradient]] at these locations, so that the air breaks down and forms [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] there first.  On sharp points in air corona can start at potentials of 2 - 6&amp;nbsp;kV.&lt;ref name="Hurley" /&gt;  In order to suppress corona formation, terminals on high voltage equipment are frequently designed with smooth large diameter rounded shapes like balls or toruses, and [[corona ring]]s are often added to insulators of high voltage transmission lines.

Coronas may be ''positive'' or ''negative''. This is determined by the polarity of the voltage on the highly curved electrode. If the curved electrode is positive with respect to the flat electrode, it has a ''[[#Positive coronas|positive corona]]'', if it is negative, it has a ''[[#Negative coronas|negative corona]]''. (See below for more details.) The physics of positive and negative coronas are strikingly different. This asymmetry is a result of the great difference in mass between electrons and positively charged [[ion]]s, with only the [[electron]] having the ability to undergo a significant degree of ionising [[inelastic collision]] at common temperatures and pressures.

An important reason for considering coronas is the production of [[ozone]] around conductors undergoing corona processes in air. A negative corona generates much more ozone than the corresponding positive corona.

== Applications ==
Corona discharge has a number of commercial and industrial applications:

* Removal of unwanted electric charges from the surface of aircraft in flight and thus avoiding the detrimental effect of uncontrolled electrical discharge pulses on the performance of avionic systems

Coronas can be used to generate charged surfaces, which is an effect used in electrostatic copying ([[photocopying]]). They can also be used to remove particulate matter from air streams by first charging the air, and then passing the charged stream through a comb of alternating polarity, to deposit the charged particles onto oppositely charged plates.

The free radicals and ions generated in corona reactions can be used to scrub the air of certain noxious products, through chemical reactions, and can be used to produce [[ozone]].

== Problems ==
Coronas can generate audible and radio-frequency noise, particularly near [[electric power transmission]] lines. Therefore, power transmission equipment is designed to minimise the formation of corona discharge.

Corona discharge is generally undesirable in:
* [[Electric power transmission]], where it causes:
** Power loss
** Audible noise
** Electromagnetic interference
** Purple glow
** [[Ozone]] production
** Insulation damage
** Possible distress in animals that are sensitive to ultraviolet light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/12/animals-powerlines-sky-wildlife|title=Animals see power lines as glowing, flashing bands, research reveals|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electrical components such as [[transformer]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[electric motor]]s and [[Electrical generator|generators]]:
** Corona can progressively damage the insulation inside these devices, leading to equipment failure.
** [[Elastomer]] items such as [[O-ring]]s can suffer [[ozone cracking]]
** [[Film capacitor#AC voltage and current|Plastic film capacitors]] operating at mains voltage can suffer progressive loss of capacitance as corona discharges cause local vaporization of the metallization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capacitorindustry.com/vishay-offers-c-stability-in-x2-capacitors|website=CapacitorIndustry.com|title=Vishay Offers C-stability in X2 Capacitors|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases coronas can be suppressed by [[corona ring]]s, toroidal devices that serve to spread the electric field over larger area and decrease the field gradient below the corona threshold.

== Mechanism  ==
Corona discharge results when the electric field is strong enough to create a chain reaction: electrons in the air collide with atoms hard enough to ionize them, creating more electrons which ionize more atoms.  The diagrams below illustrate at a microscopic scale the process which creates a corona in the air next to a pointed electrode carrying a high negative voltage with respect to ground.  The process is: 
# A neutral atom or molecule, in a region of strong electric field (such as the high potential gradient near the curved electrode) is ionized by a natural environmental event (for example, being struck by an ultraviolet [[photon]] or [[cosmic ray]] particle), to create a positive [[ion]] and a free [[electron]].&lt;br&gt;[[File:Corona Discharge initiation.svg]]
# The electric field accelerates these oppositely charged particles in opposite directions, separating them, preventing their recombination, and imparting kinetic energy to each of them. 
# The electron has a much higher charge/mass ratio and so is accelerated to a higher velocity than the positive ion.  It gains enough energy from the field that when it strikes another atom it ionizes it, knocking out another electron, and creating another positive ion.  These electrons are accelerated and collide with other atoms, creating further electron/positive-ion pairs, and these electrons collide with more atoms, in a chain reaction process called an ''[[electron avalanche]]''. Both positive and negative coronas rely on electron avalanches.  In a positive corona all the electrons are attracted inward toward the nearby positive electrode and the ions are repelled outwards.  In a negative corona the ions are attracted inward and the electrons are repelled outwards.&lt;br&gt;[[File:Corona electrical breakdown.svg]]
# The glow of the corona is caused by electrons recombining with positive ions to form neutral atoms.  When the electron falls back to its original energy level, it releases a photon of light.  The photons serve to ionize other atoms, maintaining the creation of electron avalanches.&lt;br&gt;[[File:Corona discharge upkeep.svg]]
# At a certain distance from the electrode, the electric field becomes low enough that it no longer imparts enough energy to the electrons to ionize atoms when they collide.  This is the outer edge of the corona.  Outside this the ions move through the air without creating new ions.  The outward moving ions are attracted to the opposite electrode and eventually reach it and combine with electrons from the electrode to become neutral atoms again, completing the circuit.

Thermodynamically, a corona is a very ''[[Thermodynamic equilibrium|nonequilibrium]]'' process, creating a non-thermal plasma.  The avalanche mechanism does not release enough energy to heat the gas in the corona region generally and ionize it, as occurs in an [[electric arc]] or spark.   Only a small number of gas molecules take part in the electron avalanches and are ionized, having energies close to the ionization energy of 1–3 ev, the rest of the surrounding gas is close to ambient temperature.

The onset voltage of corona or corona inception voltage (CIV) can be found with ''[[Peek's law]]'' (1929), formulated from empirical observations. Later papers derived more accurate formulas.

== Positive coronas ==

=== Properties ===
A positive corona is manifested as a uniform plasma across the length of a conductor. It can often be seen glowing blue/white, though many of the emissions are in the ultraviolet. The uniformity of the plasma is caused by the homogeneous source of secondary avalanche electrons described in [[#Mechanism|the mechanism section]], below. With the same geometry and voltages, it appears a little smaller than the corresponding negative corona, owing to the lack of a non-ionising plasma region between the inner and outer regions.

A positive corona has much lower density of free electrons compared to a negative corona;  perhaps a thousandth of the electron density, and a hundredth of the total number of electrons.
However, the electrons in a positive corona are concentrated close to the surface of the curved conductor, in a region of high potential gradient (and therefore the electrons have a high energy), whereas in a negative corona many of the electrons are in the outer, lower-field areas. Therefore, if electrons are to be used in an application which requires a high activation energy, positive coronas may support a greater reaction constants than corresponding negative coronas; though the total number of electrons may be lower, the number of very high energy electrons may be higher.

Coronas are efficient producers of ozone in air. A positive corona generates much less ozone than the corresponding negative corona, as the reactions which produce ozone are relatively low-energy. Therefore, the greater number of electrons of a negative corona leads to an increased production.

Beyond the plasma, in the ''unipolar region'', the flow is of low-energy positive ions toward the flat electrode.

=== Mechanism ===
As with a negative corona, a positive corona is initiated by an exogenous ionisation event in a region of high potential gradient. The electrons resulting from the ionisation are attracted ''toward'' the curved electrode, and the positive ions repelled from it. By undergoing inelastic collisions closer and closer to the curved electrode, further molecules are ionized in an electron avalanche.

In a positive corona, secondary electrons, for further avalanches, are generated predominantly in the fluid itself, in the region outside the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or avalanche region. They are created by ionization caused by the photons emitted from that plasma in the various de-excitation processes occurring within the plasma after electron collisions, the thermal energy liberated in those collisions creating photons which are radiated into the gas. The electrons resulting from the ionisation of a neutral gas molecule are then electrically attracted back toward the curved electrode, attracted ''into'' the plasma, and so begins the process of creating further avalanches inside the plasma.

== Negative coronas ==

=== Properties ===
A negative corona is manifested in a non-uniform corona, varying according to the surface features and irregularities of the curved conductor. It often appears as tufts of corona at sharp edges, the number of tufts altering with the strength of the field. The form of negative coronas is a result of its source of secondary avalanche electrons (see below). It appears a little larger than the corresponding positive corona, as electrons are allowed to drift out of the ionising region, and so the plasma continues some distance beyond it. The total number of electrons, and electron density is much greater than in the corresponding positive corona. However, they are of a predominantly lower energy, owing to being in a region of lower potential-gradient. Therefore, whilst for many reactions the increased electron density will increase the reaction rate, the lower energy of the electrons will mean that reactions which require a higher electron energy may take place at a lower rate.

=== Mechanism ===
Negative coronas are more complex than positive coronas in construction. As with positive coronas, the establishing of a corona begins with an exogenous ionization event generating a primary electron, followed by an electron avalanche.

Electrons ionized from the neutral gas are not useful in sustaining the negative corona process by generating secondary electrons for further avalanches, as the general movement of electrons in a negative corona is outward from the curved electrode. For negative corona, instead, the dominant process generating secondary electrons is the [[photoelectric effect]], from the surface of the electrode itself. The [[work function]] of the electrons (the energy required to liberate the electrons from the surface) is considerably lower than the [[ionization energy]] of air at standard temperatures and pressures, making it a more liberal source of secondary electrons under these conditions. Again, the source of energy for the electron-liberation is a high-energy photon from an atom within the plasma body relaxing after excitation from an earlier collision. The use of ionized neutral gas as a source of ionization is further diminished in a negative corona by the high-concentration of positive ions clustering around the curved electrode.

Under other conditions, the collision of the positive species with the curved electrode can also cause electron liberation.

The difference, then, between positive and negative coronas, in the matter of the generation of secondary electron avalanches, is that in a positive corona they are generated by the gas surrounding the plasma region, the new secondary electrons travelling inward, whereas in a negative corona they are generated by the curved electrode itself, the new secondary electrons travelling outward.

A further feature of the structure of negative coronas is that as the electrons drift outwards, they encounter neutral molecules and, with [[electronegative]] [[molecule]]s (such as [[oxygen]] and [[water vapor]]), combine to produce negative ions. These negative ions are then attracted to the positive uncurved electrode, completing the 'circuit'.

== Electrical wind == 
[[File:Plasma wheel 2 med DSIR2018.jpg|thumb|Corona discharge on a [[Wartenberg wheel]]]]

Ionized gases produced in a corona discharge are accelerated by the electric field, producing a movement of gas or ''[[Corona wind|electrical wind]]''. The air movement associated with a discharge current of a few hundred microamperes can blow out a small candle flame within about 1&amp;nbsp;cm of a discharge point.  A pinwheel, with radial metal spokes and pointed tips bent to point along the circumference of a circle, can be made to rotate if energized by a corona discharge; the rotation is due to differential electric attraction between the metal spokes and the [[space charge]] shield  region that surrounds the tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Leonard Benedict|last=Loeb|title=Electrical Coronas|publisher=University of California Press|date=1965|pages=406–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anti-ballistic missile]] defence the '''cost-exchange ratio''' is the ratio of the incremental cost to the aggressor of getting one additional warhead through the defence screen, divided by the incremental cost to the defender of offsetting the additional missile.  

In the early part of the [[Cold War]], the cost-exchange ratio favoured the defender, since the cost of missiles increases rapidly with size, and interceptors are generally much smaller than ballistic missiles.  This gave a strong impetus to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles in the 1960s.

However, the deployment of [[multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle]]s ([[MIRV]]'s) required the defender to deploy multiple interceptors for each enemy missile, thus skewing the cost-exchange ratio in favour of the aggressor.

Consideration of cost-exchange ratios was influential in persuading the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] to sign the [[ABM Treaty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4665">The '''Fitzroy Gasworks''' was a [[coal gasification]] plant in [[Fitzroy, Victoria]]. It is notable as the site for the first arc-welded gasholder in the world.

==History==

In 1856 the first gas supply had been instigated in [[Melbourne, Australia]], with the construction of the [[West Melbourne Gasworks]]. In the same year, residents of the Fitzroy Ward of the Corporation of Melbourne met at Clarke's Hotel, Smith Street, ''for the purpose of considering on the best means of obtaining a supply of gas within the ward''.&lt;ref name=Circle&gt;R Proudley. ''Circle of Influence: A History of the Gas Industry in Victoria, Hargreen/Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria, Melbourne, 1987. p. 40-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Public concern that the City of [[Melbourne Gas and Coke Company]] monopoly resulted in excessive price for gas led to the establishment of several local gas companies, the first of which was the Collingwood, Fitzroy and District Gas and Coke Company formed in 1859. The company supplied gas to an area within a six mile radius of the works, which were erected on Reilly Street (now Alexander Parade), North Fitzroy in 1861.&lt;ref name=Circle/&gt;

The original part of the works was on the north side of Alexander Parade and West of Smith Street, was designed by engineer [[William Elsdon]].&lt;ref name="ICE"&gt;[http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/article/10.1680/imotp.1904.16699 Obituary: William Elsdon, 1830–1904], Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 125, Issue 1904, pages 427–8, Thomas Telford-ICE Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10602809 |title=Death of Mr. William Elsdon |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=11 March 1904 |accessdate=28 September 2013 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works was extended across Gore Street to the west as far as George Street. Opposite the works was the Gasometer Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fitzroyhistorysociety.org.au/wp-content/uploads/HDHB-text-13-Dec.pdf ‘Half-Drowned or Half-Baked Essays in the History of North Fitzroy’, proceedings of a seminar at North Fitzroy, 3 December 2017 editor: Miles Lewis, Fitzroy History Society, ISBN 978-0-6482252-0-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company amalgamated with the Melbourne and South Melbourne companies in 1878 to form the [[Metropolitan Gas Company]], and the gasworks were known as the ''Fitzroy Station''. The Fitzroy works was not as profitable as the other Metropolitan company's plants as so gas production was gradually reduced and the site redeveloped to accommodate the company's construction workshops and gas storage. The only riveted gasholder erected by the Metropolitan Gas Company was built at Fitzroy in 1919.&lt;ref name=Circle/&gt; The Chief engineer [[Joseph Newell Reeson]] undertook a number of experiments with gas manufacture, including the application of electric [[arc welding]] to fabrication of large structures, and was responsible for the first arc welded large steel structure in the world, the No 3 gasholder, completed in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;The Metrogram: The Staff Journal of the Metropolitan Gas Company, no. 17, December 1939. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This was dismantled in 1978, and the site covered over, but buried remains may still be present.&lt;ref&gt;''Melbourne Times''. 23 August 1978.

Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a 1¢/gal tax.&lt;ref name="Oregon2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2010/12/a_brief_history_of_oregon_vehi.html |title=A brief history of Oregon vehicle fees and fuel taxes |work=The Oregonian/Oregon Live |date=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade, all of the US states (48 at the time), along with the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], introduced a gasoline tax. By 1939, an average tax of 3.8¢/gal (1¢/L) of fuel was levied by the individual states.

In the years since being created, state fuel taxes have undergone many revisions.&lt;ref name="varrate"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.its.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/publications/UCB/99/WP/UCB-ITS-WP-99-3.pdf |last1=Ang-Olson |first1=Jeffrey |author2=et al. |title=Variable-Rate State Gasoline Taxes |work=Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California Berkeley |date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most fuel taxes were initially levied as a fixed number of cents per gallon, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, nineteen states and [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] have fuel taxes with rates that vary alongside changes in the price of fuel, the inflation rate, vehicle fuel-economy, or other factors&lt;ref name="varrate2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itep.org/itep_reports/2016/02/most-americans-live-in-states-with-variable-rate-gas-taxes-2.php |title=Most Americans Live in States with Variable-Rate Gas Taxes |work=Institute on Taxation Economic Policy |date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below includes state and local taxes and fees. The American Petroleum Institute uses a weighted average of local taxes by population of each municipality to come up with an average tax for the entire state. Similarly, the national average is weighted by volume of fuel sold in each state. Because many of the states with the highest taxes also have higher populations, more states have below average taxes than above average taxes.

Most states exempt gasoline from general sales taxes. However, several states do collect full or partial sales tax in addition to the excise tax. Sales tax is not reflected in the rates below.

The first federal gasoline tax in the United States was created on June 6, 1932, with the enactment of the [[Revenue Act of 1932]] with a tax of 1¢/gal (0.3¢/L). Since 1993, the US federal gasoline tax has been 18.4¢/gal (4.86¢/L). Unlike most other goods in the US, the price displayed includes all taxes, as opposed to inclusion at the point of purchase.

Then-[[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]] stated on August 15, 2007, that about 60% of federal gas taxes are used for highway and bridge construction. The remaining 40% goes to earmarked programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211337/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/transportation/july-dec07/infrastructure_08-15.html Online NewsHour: Conversation | Peters Discusses Infrastructure | August 15, 2007 | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, revenues from other taxes are also used in federal [[transportation]] programs.

==Federal tax revenues==
Federal fuel taxes raised $35.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2014, with $25.0 billion raised from gasoline taxes and $10.2 billion raised from taxes on diesel and special motor fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2014/fe10.cfm |title=Status of The Federal Highway Trust Fund |work=US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tax was last raised in 1993 and is not indexed to inflation. Total inflation from 1993 until 2015 was 64.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ US inflation Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-major-federal-excise-taxes-and-how-much-money-do-they-raise&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy==
Some policy advisors believe that an increased tax is needed to fund and sustain the country's transportation infrastructure.  As infrastructure construction costs have grown and vehicles have become more fuel efficient, the purchasing power of fixed-rate gas taxes has declined.&lt;ref name="itepfedtax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itep.org/itep_reports/2013/09/a-federal-gas-tax-for-the-future.php |title=A Federal Gas Tax for the Future |work=Institute on Taxation Economic Policy |date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To offset this loss of purchasing power, The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission issued a detailed report in February 2009 recommending a 10 cent increase in the gasoline tax, a 15 cent increase in the diesel tax, and a reform tying both tax rates to inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://financecommission.dot.gov/Documents/NSTIF_Commission_Final_Report_Exec_Summary_Feb09.pdf |title=Paying Our Way |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402213541/http://financecommission.dot.gov/Documents/NSTIF_Commission_Final_Report_Exec_Summary_Feb09.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of gas tax increases argue that much of the gas tax revenue is diverted to other government programs and debt servicing unrelated to transportation infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-siphon-gas-tax-for-other-uses-1405558382&lt;/ref&gt;  But other researchers have noted that these diversions can occur in both directions, and that gas taxes and "user fees" paid by drivers are not high enough to cover the full cost of road-related spending.&lt;ref name="taxfoundgastax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taxfoundation.org/article/gasoline-taxes-and-user-fees-pay-only-half-state-local-road-spending |title=Gasoline Taxes and User Fees Pay for Only Half of State &amp; Local Road Spending |work=Tax Foundation |date=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that an increased cost of fuel would also encourage less consumption and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.  Americans sent nearly $430 billion to other countries in 2008 for the cost of imported oil.  However, due to increased domestic output (fracking of shale and other energy resource discoveries) as well as rapidly increasing production efficiencies, since 2008 this has already significantly reduced and expected to continue to fall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15531&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aviation fuel taxes==
'''Aviation gasoline (Avgas)''': The tax on aviation gasoline is $0.194 per gallon. When used in a fractional ownership program aircraft, gasoline also is subject to a surtax of $0.141 per gallon.

'''Kerosene for use in aviation (Jet fuel)''': Generally, kerosene is taxed at $0.244 per gallon unless a reduced rate applies.
For kerosene removed directly from a terminal into the fuel tank of an aircraft for use in non-commercial aviation, the tax rate is $0.219. The rate of $0.219 also applies if kerosene is removed into any aircraft from a qualified refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon that is loaded with the kerosene from a terminal that is located within an airport. The airport terminal doesn't need to be a secured airport terminal for this rate to apply. However, the refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon must meet the requirements discussed under certain refueler trucks, tankers, and tank wagons, treated as terminals, later.

These taxes mainly fund airport and Air Traffic Control operations by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), of which commercial aviation is the biggest user.

'''Glitre Energi''' (formerly '''Energiselskapet Buskerud''', ''EB'') is a [[power company]] based in [[Drammen]], [[Norway]]. The company operates [[electricity]] retailing, operates the [[power grid]] in [[Drammen]], [[Nedre Eiker]] and [[Kongsberg]] and provides services within [[broadband]]. The company is owned by the [[Drammen|City of Drammen]] (50%) and [[Buskerud County Municipality]] (50%). Power production has been spun off in the partially owned subsidiary [[EB Kraftproduksjon]], where EB owns 70% and [[E-CO Energi]] owns 30%.

==History==
The first power plant operated by the company, [[Granfoss power plant]], was established in 1903. In 1991 [[Drammen Energiverk]] is transformed to the limited company [[Drammen Kraft]]. In 1997 it established [[Drammen Kraft Produksjon]] in cooperation with [[Oslo Energi]]. In 1999 Drammen Kraft and the county owned [[Buskerud Energi]] were merged to create EB. In 2003 it bought ten power plants form [[Norske Skog]].

'''Grant McDonald Wilson''' (May 24, 1931 – September 10, 2012) was an American [[thermodynamics|thermodynamicist]]. He founded the company Wilco (now Wiltec) in 1977.

== Biography ==
Wilson was born in Colonia Pacheco, [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] (one of the [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]]). He did his undergraduate work at BYU in 1953 and then attended and graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) with a [[PhD]] in [[Physical Chemistry]] in 1957.

While at MIT he began his career by developing one of the first computer-based [[Activity coefficient]] Equations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Grant McDonald, Vapor-Liquid Equilibria From Measurements of Pressure, Temperature and Over-All Composition. The System Water - 2-Butoxyethanol, Ph.D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Grant M., "Vapor–Liquid Equilibrium. XI. A New Expression for the Excess Free Energy of Mixing," [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]], 86:127-130, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the Wilson Equation,&lt;ref&gt;Walas, Stanley M., (1985) ''[[Phase Equilibria]] in Chemical Engineering'', Boston: Butterworth, pp. 192-201. {{ISBN|0-409-95162-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of the most widely used equations in the field of industrial [[thermodynamics]] for the prediction of phase equilibria.

Wilson has been a [[research scientist]] measuring and reporting physical properties and [[phase equilibria]] data for most of his career. He joined Shell Research and Development in California upon graduating from MIT, he then joined Air Products and later moved to PVT Inc. of Houston, Texas. While there he performed a number of Research Projects for the [[Gas Processors Association]]. At this time he also did extensive work with cubic equations of state (EOS), he was one of the first to modify the alpha form of the Redlich-Kwong EOS to better represent pure component [[vapor pressure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G. M., "Vapor Liquid Equilibria, Correlation By Means Of A Modified Redlich-Kwong Equation Of State," Adv. Cryog. Eng., 9: 168-176, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; He next taught at [[BYU]] in Provo, Utah, from 1970 to 1978 while there he was a part of the on-campus research group, the Thermochemical Institute founded by Profs. James J. Christensen and [[Reed M. Izatt]]. Wilson left BYU to create the company [[Wilco]] (now [http://www.wiltecresearch.com/ Wiltec]) Research Company in 1977 which measured data for the Chemical Process Industries (CPI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |journal= BYU Magazine |url= http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=566 |title= SEVEN HONORED WITH BYU EMERITUS AWARDS |first= Charlene R. |last= Winters |date=Summer 2001 |accessdate= 2013-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wilson equation was published by Grant M. Wilson as "[[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium]]. XI. A New Expression for the Excess Free Energy of Mixing" in the [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] 86:127-130, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= M.

Wilson and his wife, Reta Raphiel were married in the [[Logan Temple]] on September 18, 1950. Together in 2002, they served as [[Mormon missionaries|missionaries]] for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in [[Bangalore]], India for two years.

Wilson died on September 10, 2012 in Orem, Utah.

Wilson's hobby was hiking in the mountains. His favorite climb was [[Mt. Timpanogos]].&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{citation |department=Obituaries |title=Grant M.

[[File:HEPA Filter diagram en.svg|thumb|300px|right|HEPA filter with functional description]]
'''High efficiency particulate air''' ('''HEPA'''),&lt;ref&gt;HEPA Company [https://www.hepa.com/glossary glossary of terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Originally 'High Efficiency Particulate Arrestment - see [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/HEPA thefreedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; originally called '''high-efficiency particulate absorber''' but also sometimes called '''high-efficiency particulate arresting''' or '''high-efficiency particulate arrestance''', is a type of [[air filter]]. Filters meeting the HEPA standard have many applications, including use in clean rooms for IC fabrication, medical facilities, automobiles, aircraft and homes. The filter must satisfy certain standards of efficiency such as those set by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE).

To qualify as HEPA by industry standards, an air filter must remove (from the air that passes through) 99.97% of particles that have a size greater-than-or-equal-to 0.3&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]].&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME AG-1a–2004, "Addenda to ASME AG-1–2003 Code on Nuclear Air and Gas Treatment", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[ASME]] industry standard is not published by any government, it is recognized as an authoritative standard by many governments.

HEPA was commercialized in the 1950s, and the original term became a registered [[trademark]] and later a [[Generic trademark|generic term]] for highly efficient filters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Filter collection mechanisms.png|alt=Four diagram each showing the path of small particle as it approaches a large fiber according to each of the four mechanisms|thumb|The four primary filter collection mechanisms: [[diffusion]], interception, inertial impaction, and [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] attraction]]

HEPA filters are composed of a [[depth filter|mat of randomly arranged fibres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Trends in Planning and Designing of Hospitals: Principles and Practice|last = Gupta|first = |publisher = Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd|year = 2007|isbn = 8180619125|location = |pages = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fibers are typically composed of [[fiberglass]] and possess diameters between 0.5 and 2.0 [[micrometre|micrometers]]. Key factors affecting its functions are fibre diameter, filter thickness, and [[face velocity]]. The air space between HEPA filter fibers is typically much greater than 0.3&amp;nbsp;μm. The common assumption that a HEPA filter acts like a [[sieve]] where particles smaller than the largest opening can pass through is incorrect and impractical. Unlike [[Membrane technology|membrane filter]]s at this pore size, where particles as wide as the largest opening or distance between fibers can not pass in between them at all, HEPA filters are designed to target much smaller pollutants and particles. These particles are trapped (they stick to a fiber) through a combination of the following three mechanisms:
; Interception: where particles following a line of flow in the air stream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it.
; Impaction: where larger particles are unable to avoid fibers by following the curving contours of the air stream and are forced to embed in one of them directly; this effect increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity.
; Diffusion: an enhancing mechanism that is a result of the collision with gas molecules by the smallest particles, especially those below 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this behavior is similar to [[Brownian motion]] and raises the probability that a particle will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; this mechanism becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities.

Diffusion predominates below the 0.1&amp;nbsp;μm diameter particle size. Impaction and interception predominate above 0.4&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref name="Woodford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodford|first1=Chris|title=HEPA Filters|url=http://www.explainthatstuff.com/hepafilters.html|website=Explain That Stuff|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between, near the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) 0.21&amp;nbsp;μm, both diffusion and interception are comparatively inefficient.&lt;ref name="Roza"&gt;{{Citation| first = R. A.| last = Roza| title= Particle size for greatest penetration of HEPA filters - and their true efficiency| year =1982-12-01| place =California| publisher = Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | url =https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/6241348/ | id = 6241348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this is the weakest point in the filter's performance, the HEPA specifications use the retention of particles near this size (0.3&amp;nbsp;μm) to classify the filter.&lt;ref name="Woodford"/&gt; However it is possible for particles smaller than the MPPS to not have filtering efficiency greater than that of the MPPS. This is due to the fact that these particles can act as nucleation sites for mostly condensation and form particles near the MPPS.&lt;ref name="Roza"/&gt;

===Gas filtration===
HEPA filters are designed to arrest very fine particles effectively, but they do not filter out gasses and [[odor]] molecules. Circumstances requiring filtration of [[volatile organic compounds]], chemical vapors, cigarette, pet, and/or [[flatulence]] odors call for the use of an [[activated carbon]] (charcoal) or other type of filter instead of or in addition to a HEPA filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan|first1=Faisal I|last2=Kr. Ghoshal|first2=Aloke|title=Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds from polluted air|journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries|date=November 2000|volume=13|issue=6|pages=527–545|doi=10.1016/S0950-4230(00)00007-3|url=http://www.chem.uw.edu.pl/people/AMyslinski/nowy/zarzadzanie_01/literature_HWW/02.pdf|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon cloth filters, claimed to be many times more efficient than the granular [[activated carbon]] form at [[adsorption]] of gaseous pollutants, are known as '''HEGA''' filters ("'''H'''igh '''E'''fficiency '''G'''as '''A'''dsorption") and were originally developed by the British military as a defense against [[chemical warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glover|first=N. J.|year=2002|title=Countering chemical and biological terrorism|journal=Civil Engineering|volume=72|issue=5|pages=62|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/228557557?pq-origsite=gscholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airenhancing.com/air-purifiers-acronyms-explained/#HEGA_8211_High-Efficiency_Gas_Assistance_or_High-Efficiency_Gas_Absorption_or_High-Efficiency_Gas_Adsorption|title=Air Purifier Acronyms – Stripping Out The Tech Jargon |publisher=AirEnhancing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-filter and HEPA Filter===
The first stage in the [[filtration]] process is made up of a pre-filter which removes most of the larger dust, hair, PM10 and pollen particles from the air. The second stage high-qualitylity HEPA filter, which filters out the finer dust particles which escape the pre-filter. [[Honeywell]] uses H11 class HEPA filters for maximum protection from [[PM2.5]] particles, removing almost 99.97% of these [[pollutants]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Behind Honeywell's HiSiv Filter|url=https://www.honeywellsmarthomes.com/blog/technology-behind-honeywells-hisiv-filter|publisher=Honeywell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
[[File:HEPA filter unit.jpg|thumb|A portable HEPA filtration unit used to clean air after a fire, or during manufacturing processes.]]
HEPA filters, as defined by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) standard adopted by most American industries, remove at least 99.97% of [[Aerosol|airborne particles]] 0.3 micrometers (µm) in diameter. The filter's minimal resistance to airflow, or [[pressure drop]], is usually specified around {{convert|300|Pa}} at its nominal [[volumetric flow rate]].

The specification usually used in the [[EU|European Union]] is the [[European Norm]] EN 1822:2009. It defines several classes of HEPA filters by their retention at the given most penetrating particle size (MPPS):

{| class="wikitable"
! HEPA class !! retention (total) !! retention (local)
|-
| E10 || &gt; 85% || ---
|-
| E11 || &gt; 95% || ---
|-
| E12 || &gt; 99.5% || ---
|-
| H13 || &gt; 99.95% || &gt; 99.75%

| U17 || &gt; 99.999995% || &gt; 99.9999%
|}
* See also the different classes for [[Air_filter#Filter_classes|air filters]] for comparison.  

Today, a HEPA filter rating is applicable to any highly efficient air filter that can attain the same filter efficiency performance standards as a minimum and is equivalent to the more recent [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] N100 rating for respirator filters. The [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) has specific requirements for HEPA filters in DOE regulated applications. In addition, companies have begun using a marketing term known as "True HEPA" to give consumers assurance that their air filters are indeed certified to meet the HEPA standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-air-purifier-guide.com/true-hepa-filter.html|title=Should A True HEPA Filter Mean Anything To You?|author=|date=|work=home-air-purifier-guide.com|accessdate=25 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193943/http://www.home-air-purifier-guide.com/true-hepa-filter.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products that claim to be "HEPA-type", "HEPA-like", "HEPA-style" or "99% HEPA" do not satisfy these requirements and may not have been tested in independent laboratories. Some of these sub-par quality filters may come reasonably close to HEPA filtration, while others will fall significantly short, making them truly inferior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.air-purifier-power.com/hepatypefilter.html|title=HEPA-type filter: The Great Pretender|author=|date=|work=air-purifier-power.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
HEPA filtration works by mechanical means unlike the ionic and ozone filtration which use negative ions and ozone gas respectively. So, the chances of potential pulmonary side-effects like asthma&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/allergies/hepa-filters-for-allergies|title=HEPA Filter Benefits for Allergy Relief|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allergies is much lower with HEPA purifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pureairhub.com/guide-hepa-air-purifiers/|title=Guide to HEPA Air Purifiers|last=Ryback|first=Emily|date=12 August 2016|website=Pure Air Hub|publisher=Kurt Morgan|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that a HEPA filter is working efficiently, they should be checked and changed at least every six months in commercial settings. In residential settings, they can be changed every two to three years. Failing to change a HEPA filter in a timely fashion will result in it putting stress on the machine or system and not removing particles from the air properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.janitized.com/how-often-should-a-hepa-filter-be-changed/|title=How Often Should A HEPA Filter Be Changed {{!}} Janitized|date=2018-03-14|work=Janitized Vacuum Cleaner Bag Manufacturer|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomedical applications==
[[File:Portable HEPA filter.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hospital staff modelling a [[powered, air-purifying respirator]] (PAPR) fitted with a HEPA filter, used to protect from airborne or aerosolised pathogens such as [[tuberculosis]].]]HEPA filters are critical in the prevention of the spread of airborne bacterial and viral organisms and, therefore, infection. Typically, medical-use HEPA filtration systems also incorporate high-energy [[ultra-violet light]] units to kill off the live bacteria and [[virus]]es trapped by the filter media. Some of the best-rated HEPA units have an efficiency rating of 99.995%, which assures a very high level of protection against [[airborne disease]] transmission.

==Vacuum cleaners==
{{anchor|Vacuum cleaners}}
[[File:PHILIPS HEPA H10 air filter for vacuum cleaner.JPG|thumb|left|HEPA original filter for Philips FC87xx-series vacuum cleaners]]
Many [[vacuum cleaner]]s also use HEPA filters as part of their filtration systems. This is beneficial for [[asthma]] and [[allergy]] sufferers, because the HEPA filter traps the fine particles (such as [[pollen]] and [[dust mite]] [[feces]]) which trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. For a HEPA filter in a vacuum cleaner to be effective, the vacuum cleaner must be designed so that ''all'' the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it. This is often referred to as "Sealed HEPA" or sometimes the more vague "True HEPA". Vacuum cleaners simply labeled "HEPA" may have a HEPA filter, but not all air necessarily passes through it. Finally, vacuum cleaner filters marketed as "HEPA-like" will typically use a filter of a ''similar construction'' to HEPA, but without the filtering efficiency. Because of the extra density of a true HEPA filter, HEPA vacuum cleaners require more powerful motors to provide adequate cleaning power.

Some newer models claim to be better than the first models because of "washable" filters. Generally, washable true HEPA filters are expensive. Some manufacturers claim filter standards such as "HEPA 4", without explaining the meaning behind them. This refers to their [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value]] (MERV) rating. These ratings are used to rate the ability of an air cleaner filter to remove dust from the air as it passes through the filter. MERV is a standard used to measure the overall efficiency of a filter. The MERV scale ranges from 1 to 20, and measures a filter's ability to remove particles from 10 to 0.3 micrometre in size. Filters with higher ratings not only remove more particles from the air, they also remove smaller particles.

== Vehicles==

===Airlines===
Modern airliners use HEPA filters to reduce the spread of airborne pathogens in recirculated air. Critics have expressed concern about the effectiveness and state of repair of air filtering systems, since they think that much of the air in an airplane cabin is recirculated.  Almost all of the air in a pressurized aircraft is, in fact, brought in from the outside, circulated through the cabin and then exhausted through outflow valves in the rear of the aircraft.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Motor vehicles===
Some cars have [[cabin air filter]]s that look like HEPA filters but which do not perform at that level. The confusion is perpetuated by guides for changing car filters which misidentify the filters as HEPA filters. The actual performance of these filters is obscured by manufacturers and difficult to evaluate, as they are not rated with the MERV system, though they typically yield MERV 8-equivalent performance.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

More recently, the [[Tesla Model X]] has been attributed to have the world's first HEPA-grade filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/presskit/modelx|title=Model X Press Kit - Tesla Motors|author=|date=|work=teslamotors.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of the Model X, Tesla has updated the Model S to also have an optional HEPA air filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1103380_2016-tesla-model-s-gets-styling-update-48-amp-charger-new-interior-options|title=2016 Tesla Model S gets styling update, 48-amp charger, new interior options, $1,500 price increase (updated)|author=John Voelcker|date=12 April 2016|work=Green Car Reports|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
The original HEPA filter was designed in the 1940s and was used in the [[Manhattan Project]] to prevent the spread of airborne [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtXJzogLCecC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=HEPA+filter+manhattan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHybWO0P7QAhVJzoMKHTdQBQ0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=HEPA%20filter%20manhattan&amp;f=false|title=Green Health: An A-to-Z Guide|last=Ogunseitan|first=Oladele|date=2011-05-03|publisher=SAGE|year=|isbn=9781412996884|location=|page=13|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commercialized in the 1950s, and the original term became a registered [[trademark]] and later a [[Generic trademark|generic term]] for highly efficient filters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSNfCrpcSCAC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=HEPA+filter+registered+trademark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwtuC80P7QAhWr7IMKHZudCQ0Q6AEIMjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=HEPA%20filter%20registered%20trademark&amp;f=false|title=The Vacuum Cleaner: A History|last=Gantz|first=Carroll|date=2012-09-21|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=9780786493210|location=|page=128|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the decades filters have evolved to satisfy the higher and higher demands for air quality in various high technology industries, such as [[aerospace]], [[pharmaceutical drug]] processing, hospitals, health care, nuclear fuels, nuclear power, and [[integrated circuit]] fabrication.

'''Human-powered land vehicles''' are [[Vehicle|land vehicles]] propelled over ground by [[Human_power#Human_power_for_powering_vehicles|human power]]. The main ways to support the weight of a human-powered land vehicle and its contents above the ground are rolling contact; sliding contact; intermittent contact; no contact at all as with anything carried; or some combination of the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]
| edition = 2nd
| year = 1989
| quote = vehicle, ''n.'' 6. A means of conveyance provided with wheels or runners and used for the carriage of persons or goods; a carriage, cart, wagon, sledge, or similar contrivance. 7. a. Any means of carriage, conveyance, or transport; a receptacle in which anything is placed in order to be moved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main methods of using human power to propel a land vehicle are some kind of [[Bicycle drivetrain systems|drivetrain]]; pushing laterally against the ground with a wheel, skate, or ski that simultaneously moves forward; by pushing against the ground directly with an appendage opposite to the direction of travel; or by propeller. Human-powered land vehicles can be propelled by persons riding in the vehicle or by persons walking or running and not supported by the vehicle.

Many human-powered land vehicles can also be gravity-powered land vehicles, and vice versa, although some of the latter are quite awkward to use as the former. For example: [[street luge]]s, [[gravity racer]]s, and [[snow board]]s.

==Types of ground contact==
There are four main ways to support the weight of a human-powered land vehicle and its contents: rolling contact as with wheels; sliding contact as with skates, skis, or runners; intermittent contact as with stilts; and no contact at all as with anything carried. Additionally, these four methods may be combined as in wheelbarrows.

===Wheeled===
The most common wheeled human-powered land vehicle is the [[bicycle]] in all its forms. Other notable examples include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Balance bicycle]]s and [[dandy horse]]s
*[[Handcar]]s, and [[draisine]]s

==Types of propulsion==
There are three main methods of using human power to propel a land vehicle: some kind of [[Bicycle drivetrain systems|drivetrain]] that turns one or more drive wheels; pushing laterally against the ground, to the side relative to the forward motion of the vehicle, with a wheel, skate, or ski that simultaneously moves forward; by pushing against the ground directly with an appendage, such as a hand or a foot, opposite to the direction of travel, or by pushing against the air with a propeller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Johnson's figure of merit''' is a measure of suitability of a [[semiconductor]] material for high frequency power transistor applications and requirements. More specifically, it is the product of the [[charge carrier]] [[saturation velocity]] in the material and the [[electric breakdown]] field under same conditions, first proposed by Edward O. Johnson of [[RCA]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;"Physical limitations on frequency and power parameters of transistors," RCA Review, vol. 26, pp. 163-177, June 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this [[figure of merit]] (FoM) is applicable to both [[field-effect transistors]] ([[FET]]s), and with proper interpretation of the parameters, also to [[bipolar junction transistors]] ([[BJT]]s).

'''Landis+Gyr''', is a publicly listed, [[multinational corporation]] with 45 subsidiary companies in over 30 countries and headquarters in [[Zug]], Switzerland. Landis+Gyr makes meters and related software for electricity and gas utilities.

== History==
Landis+Gyr was originally known as Electrotechnisches Institut Theiler and Company, established on September 11, 1905. It was renamed Landis &amp; Gyr, after Heinrich Landis and Karl Heinrich Gyr, who followed founder Richard Theiler as managers. Landis+Gyr designs and manufactures a range of metering products, systems, and services for electricity, heat, and gas for energy utilities around the world. In 1924, Landis+Gyr opened its first overseas offices in New York and Australia. Besides metering products, with the founding of Cerberus Limited in 1940, Landis+Gyr expanded into fire safety products. Cerberus was later acquired by Elektrowatt Limited and is today a part of Siemens Building Technologies.
The company was also known for producing optical [[phone cards]] until 2006. Landys+Gyr phone cards were used in many countries such as [[Israel]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingtechnologies.siemens.com/bt/global/en/about-us/Pages/about-us.aspx?tabcardname=History# |title=History Siemens Building Technologies |publisher=Buildingtechnologies.siemens.com |date=1998-10-01 |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership and acquisitions===
* 1976 – Landis+Gyr acquired Duncan Electric Company of Lafayette, Indiana.
* 1987 – Landis+Gyr acquired MCC Powers of Chicago. MCC Powers had by then been a long established entity in the US building management market. Spurred by the [[liberalization]] and [[deregulation]] of global markets, Landis+Gyr re-oriented its business, adding electronic products.
* Late 1990s – In the late 1990s, Landis+Gyr went through a series of different investors and owners, amongst them Elektrowatt, [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] and [[Siemens]].
* 2004 – Landis+Gyr was acquired by then Australia-based Bayard Capital for an undisclosed amount. Bayard Capital had already acquired the British metering company Ampy Automation-Digilog. As Bayard Capital continued to add other acquisitions to the group, 2008 saw the Landis+Gyr name being extended to the whole group in May 2008. An organizational realignment took place under Bayard Capital's ownership. The company moved to a regional structure, assigning regional corporate structures for North America; South America; UK/Pre-Payment; Europe; and Asia Pacific.
* 2006 – Landis+Gyr acquired Finnish Enermet Group, and also Hunt Technologies and Cellnet Technologies, both of which are from the [[United States|United States of America]].
* 2011 – Landis+Gyr was acquired by [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] of [[Japan]] for US$2.3 billion.
* 2017 – On July 21, 2017, Landis+Gyr has listed its shares (ticker symbol: LAND) on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]].

==Utilities==
Various [[Public utility|utilities]] have worked with Landis+Gyr in meeting their consumers' demand for energy management tools by rolling out smart meters. Below are some of the utilities that have worked with Landis+Gyr in deploying smart metering technology to energy consumers.

==Criticism==
[[Smart metering]] is opposed by some{{Who|date=July 2018}}, and as a developer of such meters, Landis+Gyr is met with criticism.
* In 2016, Phil Mocek of MuckRock started investigating &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.muckrock.com/foi/seattle-69/smart-meter-security-audit-plans-schedules-proposals-contracts-discussion-results-seattle-10378/#comms|title=Public Records Request: Smart meter security audit plans schedules proposals contracts discussion results (Seattle)|accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project in which Landis+Gyr was involved. After Mocek received the requested information, Landis+Gyr followed up by filing a lawsuit &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/may/25/multinational-demanding-know-who-reads-muckrock-an/|title=A multinational demands to know who reads MuckRock|accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; demanding the documentation not be made public.

'''Liquid crystals (LCs)''' are a [[state of matter]] which has properties between those of conventional [[liquid]]s and those of solid [[crystal]]s. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its [[molecules]] may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different [[Optics|optical]] properties (such as [[Texture (crystalline)|textures]]). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).

Liquid crystals can be divided into [[thermotropic]], [[lyotropic]] and [[metallotropic]] phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of [[organic molecules]], although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a [[phase transition]] into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and [[concentration]] of the liquid-crystal molecules in a [[solvent]] (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.

Examples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Most contemporary  [[Electronic visual display|electronic displays]] use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of [[soap]] and various related [[detergent]]s, as well as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and some [[clays]].

==History==
In 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist [[Friedrich Reinitzer]], working at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität]], examined the physico-chemical properties of various [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[cholesterol]] which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the [[freezing point]], but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative [[cholesteryl benzoate]] were not the most peculiar feature.[[File:Cholesteryl benzoate.png|thumb|250 px|Chemical structure of [[cholesteryl benzoate]] molecule]] He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not [[melting|melt]] in the same manner as other compounds, but has two [[melting point]]s. At {{convert|145.5|°C|°F}} it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at {{convert|178.5|°C|°F}} it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to [[Otto Lehmann (physicist)|Otto Lehmann]], at that time a ''{{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}}'' in [[Aachen]]. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing [[crystallite]]s. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate "fluid" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Beiträge zur Kenntniss des Cholesterins| journal=Monatshefte für Chemie (Wien)| volume = 9| issue =1| pages = 421–441|date =1888| doi =10.1007/BF01516710| last1 = Reinitzer| first1 = Friedrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]], and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.

After his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the [[Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lehmann, O. | title = Über fliessende Krystalle| journal=Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie|volume =4| pages = 462–72|date =1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Otto Lehmann.jpg|thumb|180px|Otto Lehmann]]
Lehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist [[Daniel Vorländer]], who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.&lt;ref name=b3/&gt;

After World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. [[George William Gray]], a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals''&lt;ref&gt;Gray, G. W. (1962) ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals'', Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and later at [[Kent State University]]. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world’s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13583149408628630|title=Professor Horst Sackmann, 1921 – 1993|date=1994|last1=Stegemeyer|first1=H|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|volume=4|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm Liquid Crystals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805230930/http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm |date=August 5, 2012 }}. kfupm.edu.sa&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at [[RCA]] Laboratories.&lt;ref name=castellano/&gt; When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a [[#Nematic_phase|nematic]] liquid crystal at 125&amp;nbsp;°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague [[George H. Heilmeier]] to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the [[para-Azoxyanisole]] that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116&amp;nbsp;°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.

In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of [[Schiff base]] compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmacher, Joel E. and Castellano, Joseph A. “Electro-optical Compositions and Devices,” {{US Patent|3540796}}, Issue date: November 17, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1652453|title=Dynamic Scattering in Nematic Liquid Crystals|date=1968|last1=Heilmeier|first1=G. H.|last2=Zanoni|first2=L. A.|last3=Barton|first3=L. A.|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=13|pages=46|bibcode = 1968ApPhL..13...46H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide [[operating temperature]] range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.

[[File:MBBA cleaner.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of [[MBBA|N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA)]] molecule]]
In 1969, Hans Kelker succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, [[MBBA]], which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.|volume = 8|date =1969| title =A Liquid-crystalline (Nematic) Phase with a Particularly Low Solidification Point| issue =11| doi = 10.1002/anie.196908841| page = 884| last1=Kelker| first1=H.| last2=Scheurle| first2=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next step to commercialization of [[liquid-crystal display]]s was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by [[George William Gray|George Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = New family of nematic liquid crystals for displays| doi = 10.1049/el:19730096| journal=Electronics Lett.|volume =9| issue = 6|date =1973| page = 130| last1 = Gray| first1 = G.W.| last2 = Harrison| first2 = K.J.| last3 = Nash| first3 = J.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD ([[Royal Radar Establishment|RRE Malvern]]), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.

These molecules are rod-shaped, some created in the lab and some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two new types of LC molecules have been discovered, both man-made: [[Columnar phase|disc-shaped]] (created by [[Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar|S. Chandrasekhar]]'s group in India, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandrasekhar|first=S|last2=Sadashiva|first2=B K|last3=Suresh|first3=K A|date=19 September 1977|title=Liquid crystals of disc-like molecules|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02846252|journal=Pramana|language=en|volume=9|issue=5|pages=471–480|doi=10.1007/bf02846252|issn=0304-4289|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bowl-shaped (invented by Lui Lam&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Lei (Lam, Lui) (1982). "Liquid crystal phases and the 'dimensionality' of molecules". ''Wuli (Physics)'' '''11''', 171-178.&lt;/ref&gt; in China, 1982, and synthesized in Europe three years later).

In 1991, when liquid crystal displays were already well established, [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]] working at the [[Université Paris-Sud]] received the Nobel Prize in physics "for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/physics/liquid_crystals/history/|publisher=Nobelprize.org| title = History and Properties of Liquid Crystals| accessdate =June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design of liquid crystalline materials==
A large number of chemical compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object).&lt;ref&gt;Lam, Lui (1994). "Bowlics". ''Liquid Crystalline and Mesomorphic Polymers'', eds. Valery P. Shibaev and Lui Lam. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Lei (Lam, Lui) (1987). "Bowlic liquid crytals". ''Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst'' '''146''': 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for [[preferential alignment]] along one spatial direction.

• The molecular shape should be relatively thin, flat or bowl-like, especially within rigid molecular frameworks. &lt;br /&gt;
• The molecular length should be at least 1.3&amp;nbsp;nm, consistent with the presence of long alkyl group on many room-temperature liquid crystals. &lt;br /&gt;
• The structure should not be branched or angular, except for the bowlics. &lt;br /&gt;
• A low melting point is preferable in order to avoid metastable, monotropic liquid crystalline phases. Low-temperature mesomorphic behavior in general is technologically more useful, and alkyl terminal groups promote this.

An extended, structurally rigid, highly anisotropic shape seems to be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior, and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings.&lt;ref name="Chemical Properties of Liquid Crystals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plc.cwru.edu/tutorial/enhanced/files/lc/chem/chem.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125091905/http://plc.cwru.edu/tutorial/enhanced/files/lc/chem/chem.htm |archivedate=November 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquid-crystal phases==
The various liquid-crystal phases (called [[mesophase]]s) can be characterized by the type of ordering. One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction), and moreover order can be either short-range (only between molecules close to each other) or long-range (extending to larger, sometimes [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], dimensions). Most thermotropic LCs will have an [[isotropic]] phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and [[fluid]]-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant  [[anisotropic]] orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.&lt;ref name=b2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordering of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical [[crystal]]line solids. However some techniques, such as the use of boundaries or an applied [[electric field]], can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one [[dimension]], with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;{{cite book|author=Dierking, I. |title=Textures of Liquid Crystals|location=Weinheim|date=2003|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=3-527-30725-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-0xdzDRB2kC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b5&gt;{{cite book|author1=Collings, P.J.  |author2=Hird, M. |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Introduction to Liquid Crystals|location = Bristol, PA|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=1997|isbn=0-7484-0643-3}}

===Thermotropic liquid crystals===
{{see also|Thermotropic crystal}}
Thermotropic phases are those that occur in a certain temperature range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal.&lt;ref name=b2/&gt;&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating a particular type of LC molecule (called [[mesogen]]) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is [[para-azoxyanisole]].&lt;ref name="Shao"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase Transitions of Liquid Crystal PAA in Confined Geometries|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=1998|volume=102|issue=18|pages=3387–3394|doi=10.1021/jp9734437|last1=Shao|first1=Y.|last2=Zerda|first2=T.

====Nematic phase====
{{see also|Biaxial nematic|Twisted nematic field effect}}
[[File:LiquidCrystal-MesogenOrder-Nematic.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Alignment in a nematic phase.]]
[[File:Smectic nematic.jpg|thumb|Phase transition between a nematic (left) and smectic A (right) phases observed between crossed [[polarizers]]. The black color corresponds to isotropic medium.]]

One of the most common LC phases is the nematic. The word ''nematic'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|νήμα}} (''{{lang-el|nema}}''), which means "thread". This term originates from the thread-like [[topological defect]]s observed in nematics, which are formally called '[[disclination]]s'. Nematics also exhibit so-called "hedgehog" topological defects. In a nematic phase, the ''calamitic'' or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |title=Asymmetric synthesis of a highly soluble 'trimeric' analogue of the chiral nematic liquid crystal twist agent Merck S1011 |last=Rego |first=J.A. |last2=Harvey |first2=Jamie A.A. |last3=MacKinnon |first3=Andrew L. |last4=Gatdula |first4=Elysse |journal=Liquid Crystals |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2010 |pages=37–43 |doi=10.1080/02678290903359291 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oxBzwQCm?url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order. Most nematics are uniaxial: they have one axis that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, some liquid crystals are [[biaxial nematic]]s, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a secondary axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =Thermotropic Biaxial Nematic Liquid Crystals| doi =10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.145505|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|volume = 92| issue =14| page = 145505|date =2004| pmid=15089552|bibcode = 2004PhRvL..92n5505M|last1 =Madsen|first1 =L. A.|last2 =Dingemans|first2 =T. J.|last3 =Nakata|first3 =M.|last4 =Samulski|first4 =E. T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nematics have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCD).&lt;ref name=castellano&gt;{{cite book| author=Castellano, Joseph A. |title =Liquid Gold: The Story of Liquid Crystal Displays and the Creation of an Industry| publisher=World Scientific Publishing|date =2005| isbn = 978-981-238-956-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have discovered that electrons can unite to flow together in high magnetic fields, to create an "electronic nematic" form of matter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170824110624.htm Strange state of matter in superconducting crystal: Discovery could help scientists better understand exotic behaviors of electrons], August 24, 2017, sciencedaily.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Smectic phases====
[[File:LiquidCrystal-MesogenOrder-SmecticPhases.jpg|thumb|Schematic of alignment in the smectic phases. The smectic A phase (left) has molecules organized into layers. In the smectic C phase (right), the molecules are tilted inside the layers.]]
The smectic phases, which are found at lower temperatures than the nematic, form well-defined layers that can slide over one another in a manner similar to that of soap.  The word "smectic" originates from the Latin word "smecticus", meaning cleaning, or having soap-like properties.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web| title=smectic|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smectic |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The smectics are thus positionally ordered along one direction. In the Smectic A phase, the molecules are oriented along the layer normal, while in the Smectic C phase they are tilted away from it. These phases are liquid-like within the layers. There are many different smectic phases, all characterized by different types and degrees of positional and orientational order.&lt;ref name=b2/&gt;&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

====Chiral phases====
[[File:LiquidCrystal-MesogenOrder-ChiralPhases.jpg|thumb|left|Schematic of ordering in chiral liquid crystal phases. The chiral nematic phase (left), also called the cholesteric phase, and the smectic C* phase (right).]]
The [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[nematic]] phase exhibits [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] (handedness). This phase is often called the [[Cholesteric liquid crystal|''cholesteric'']] phase because it was first observed for [[cholesterol]] derivatives. Only [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]] (i.e., those that have no internal planes of [[Molecular symmetry|symmetry]]) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name=b4/&gt;&lt;ref name=b5/&gt;

[[File:Cholesterinisch.png|thumb|Chiral nematic phase; p refers to the chiral pitch (see text)]]
The ''chiral pitch'', p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]]. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold [[laser]] emission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Low threshold lasing at the edge of a photonic stop band in cholesteric liquid crystals |journal=Opt. Lett. |volume=23 |pages=1707–1709 |date=1998 |doi=10.1364/OL.23.001707 |author=Kopp, V. I.; Fan, B.; Vithana, H. K. M.; Genack, A.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b4/&gt; For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and [[elliptically polarized]] if it comes in obliquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Introduction to Liquid Crystals|author1=Priestley, E.

'''Blue phases''' are liquid crystal phases that appear in the temperature range between a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[nematic]] phase and an [[Isotropy|isotropic]] liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with [[Crystal structure|lattice]] periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective [[Bragg's law|Bragg reflections]] in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the [[Cubic phase|cubic lattice]]. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to [[quasicrystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Although blue phases are of interest for fast light modulators or tunable [[photonic crystal]]s, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few [[kelvin]]. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60&amp;nbsp;K including room temperature (260–326&amp;nbsp;K) has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =Liquid crystal 'blue phases' with a wide temperature range|journal=Nature|volume = 436|date =2005| pages = 997–1000| doi =10.1038/nature03932| pmid =16107843| issue =7053|bibcode = 2005Natur.436..997C|last1 =Coles|first1 =Harry J.|last2 =Pivnenko|first2 =Mikhail N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Optical isotropy and iridescence in a smectic blue phase|journal=Nature|volume = 437| issue =7058|date =2005| page = 525|bibcode = 2005Natur.437..525Y|doi = 10.1038/nature04034| last1 =Yamamoto| first1 =Jun| last2 =Nishiyama| first2 =Isa| last3 =Inoue| first3 =Miyoshi| last4 =Yokoyama| first4 =Hiroshi| pmid=16177785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kikuchi H, Yokota M, Hisakado Y, Yang H, Kajiyama T.|title = Polymer-stabilized liquid crystal blue phases|journal=Nature Materials|volume = 1|date = 2002| doi =10.1038/nmat712| pmid =12618852| issue =1|bibcode = 2002NatMa...1...64K| pages=64–8 |last2 = Yokota|last3 = Hisakado|last4 = Yang|last5 = Kajiyama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the first [[Blue Phase Mode LCD]] panel had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.physorg.com/news129997960.html|title = Samsung Develops World’s First 'Blue Phase' Technology to Achieve 240&amp;nbsp;Hz Driving Speed for High-Speed Video| accessdate =April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discotic phases====
Disk-shaped LC molecules can orient themselves in a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a [[columnar phase|discotic columnar]]. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.

====Bowlic phases====

Bowl-shaped LC molecules, like in discotics, can form columnar phases. Other phases, such as nonpolar nematic, polar nematic, stringbean, donut and onion phases, have been predicted. Bowlic phases, except nonpolar nematic, are polar phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wang L, Huang D, Lam L, Cheng Z|title = Bowlics: history, advances and applications|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|doi = 10.1080/1358314X.2017.1398307|volume = 26|date = 2017|issue =4|pages=85–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyotropic liquid crystals===
{{see also|Lyotropic liquid crystal|Columnar phase}}
[[File:Lipid bilayer and micelle.svg|thumb|250 px|Structure of lyotropic liquid crystal. The red heads of surfactant molecules are in contact with water, whereas the tails are immersed in oil (blue): bilayer (left) and [[micelle]] (right).]]
A [[lyotropic liquid crystal]] consists of two or more components that exhibit liquid-crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges. In the [[lyotropic]] phases, [[solvent]] molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide [[viscosity|fluidity]] to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Qizhen Liang |author2=Pengtao Liu |author3=Cheng Liu |author4=Xigao Jian |author5=Dingyi Hong |author6=Yang Li. |date= 2005|title= Synthesis and Properties of Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Copolyamides Containing Phthalazinone Moieties and Ether Linkages|journal= Polymer|volume=46 |issue= 16|pages= 6258–6265|doi= 10.1016/j.polymer.2005.05.059}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, these lyotropics have another degree of freedom of concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases.

A compound that has two immiscible [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]] parts within the same molecule is called an [[amphiphilic]] molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.

The content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into [[micelle]]s or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.

The objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).

For some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).

A generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:
* Discontinuous cubic phase ([[micellar cubic]] phase)
* [[Hexagonal phase]] (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)
* [[Lamellar phase]]
* Bicontinuous [[cubic phase]]
* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase
* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)

Even within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.

Similar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock [[copolymer]]s.

===Metallotropic liquid crystals===

Liquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting ''inorganic'' phases like [[Zinc chloride|ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature. This class of materials has been named metallotropic.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite journal| title =Metallotropic liquid crystals formed by surfactant templating of molten metal halides| doi=10.1038/nmat1610|journal=Nature Materials |volume =5|date =2006| pmid =16547520| issue =4|bibcode = 2006NatMa...5..271M| last1 =Martin| first1 =James D.| last2 =Keary| first2 =Cristin L.| last3 =Thornton| first3 =Todd A.| last4 =Novotnak| first4 =Mark P.| last5 =Knutson| first5 =Jeremey W.| last6 =Folmer| first6 =Jacob C.

===Laboratory analysis of mesophases===

Thermotropic [[mesophase]]s are detected and characterized by two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy,&lt;ref name="Tomczyk2017"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tomczyk| first = W.| last2      = Marzec| first2     = M.| last3      = Juszyńska-Gałązka| first3     = E.| last4      = Węgłowska| first4     = D.| date       = 2017| title      = Mesomorphic and physicochemical properties of liquid crystal mixture composed of chiral molecules with perfluorinated terminal chains| url        = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286016310791| journal    = Journal of Molecular Structure| volume     = 1130| pages      = 503–510| doi        = 10.1016/j.molstruc.2016.10.039| bibcode= 2017JMoSt1130..503T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Juszyńska-Gałązka| first      = E.| last2      = Gałązka| first2     = M.| last3      = Massalska-Arodź| first3     = M.| last4      = Bąk

As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC),&lt;ref name="Tomczyk2017" /&gt; allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.

Lyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of [[mesogen]] in order to analyze that impact.

==Biological liquid crystals==
Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as [[lipid polymorphism]]. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, [[biological membrane]]s and [[cell membranes]] are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. [[phospholipid]]s) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on [[lipid polymorphism]]). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by [[flippase]]s and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely "floating" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.

Many other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated [[protein]] solution that is extruded by a spider to generate [[spider silk|silk]] is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength. [[DNA]] and many [[peptide|polypeptides]] can also form LC phases and this too forms an important part of current academic research.

==Mineral liquid crystals==

Examples of liquid crystals can also be found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was [[Vanadium(V) oxide]], by Zocher in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zocher|first1=H|title=Uber freiwillige Strukturbildung in Solen.

==Pattern formation in liquid crystals==

Anisotropy of liquid crystals is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially than those of ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates ([[viscous fingering]]) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Viscous fingering in liquid crystals|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.36.3984|journal=Phys.

This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and is so strong that usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Phase-field simulations and experiments of faceted growth in liquid crystal| doi = 10.1016/S0167-2789(96)00162-5|journal=Physica D|volume = 99| issue =2–3|date =1996| page = 359| last1 = González-Cinca| first1 = R.| last2 = Ramírez-Piscina| first2 = L.| last3 = Casademunt| first3 = J.| last4 = Hernández-Machado| first4 = A.| last5 = Kramer| first5 = L.| last6 = Tóth Katona| first6 = T.| last7 = Börzsönyi| first7 = T.| last8 = Buka| first8 = Á.|bibcode = 1996PhyD...99..359G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Heat diffusion anisotropy in dendritic growth: phase field simulations and experiments in liquid crystals| doi =10.1016/S0022-0248(98)00505-3|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume = 193| issue =4|date =1998| page = 712|bibcode = 1998JCrGr.193..712G| last1 = González-Cinca| first1 = R| last2 = Ramı́Rez-Piscina| first2 = L| last3 = Casademunt| first3 = J| last4 = Hernández-Machado| first4 = A| last5 = Tóth-Katona| first5 = T| last6 = Börzsönyi| first6 = T| last7 = Buka| first7 = Á }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical treatment of liquid crystals==
Microscopic theoretical treatment of fluid phases can become quite complicated, owing to the high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be ignored. In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.

===Director===

As we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector '''''n''''' called the ''director'', is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, '''''n''''' and '''''-n''''' are fully equivalent.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

===Order parameter===

[[File:Nematic-Director.png|thumb|The ''local nematic director'', which is also the ''local optical axis'', is given by the spatial and temporal average of the long molecular axes]]

The description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second [[Legendre polynomial]]:

:&lt;math&gt;S = \langle P_2(\cos \theta) \rangle = \left \langle \frac{3 \cos^2 \theta-1} 2 \right \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the ''local director'' (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its ''[[optical axis|local optical axis]]''). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, ''S'' is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A model for the orientational order in liquid crystals| doi =10.1007/BF02453342|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento D|volume = 4| issue =3|date =1984| page = 229|bibcode = 1984NCimD...4..229G|last1 = Ghosh|first1 = S. K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, [[diamagnetism]], [[birefringence]], [[Raman scattering]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|EPR]] can be used to determine S.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt;

The order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.&lt;ref name=b2/&gt;

A positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the ''z''-axis the density &lt;math&gt;\rho (z)&lt;/math&gt; is often given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho (\mathbf{r})=\rho (z)=\rho_0+\rho_1\cos(q_sz-\varphi)+\cdots \, &lt;/math&gt;

The complex positional order parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt;\psi (\mathbf{r})=\rho_1 (\mathbf{r})e^{i\varphi(\mathbf{r})}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic &lt;math&gt;\psi=0&lt;/math&gt; and for a smectic phase &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

===Onsager hard-rod model===
{{unsolved|physics|Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a [[background independence|universal]] phase transition?}}
A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by [[Lars Onsager]]. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a ''decrease'' in the net positional [[entropy]] of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|date = 1949| page = 627| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vroege&gt;{{cite journal| title = Phase transitions in lyotropic colloidal and polymer liquid crystals| doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/55/8/003|journal=Rep.

The fundamental insight here is that, whilst parallel arrangements of anisotropic objects lead to a decrease in orientational entropy, there is an increase in positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.&lt;ref name=vroege/&gt;

===Maier–Saupe mean field theory===
This statistical theory, proposed by [[Alfred Saupe]] and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a [[mean-field theory|mean-field]] average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Maier W. and Saupe A.| journal=Z.

===McMillan's model===
McMillan's model, proposed by William McMillan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Simple Molecular Model for the Smectic A Phase of Liquid Crystals|journal=Phys. Rev. A|volume= 4 |date=1971|issue=3|page=1238|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.4.1238|bibcode = 1971PhRvA...4.1238M|last1= McMillan|first1= W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the Maier–Saupe mean field theory used to describe the phase transition of a liquid crystal from a nematic to a smectic A phase. It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]] and the second order parameter is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left\langle\cos\left (\frac{2\pi z_i} d \right )\left (\frac 3 2 \cos^2\theta_i - \frac 1 2 \right )\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

The values ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''d'' are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;U_i(\theta_i,z_i)=-U_0\left(S+\alpha\sigma\cos \left(\frac{2\pi z_i} d \right) \right)\left(\frac 3 2 \cos^2\theta_i-\frac 1 2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Here constant α quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.&lt;ref name=b5/&gt;

===Elastic continuum theory===
In this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the [[Frank free energy density]]. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) '''twists''' of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) '''splay''' of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) '''bend''' of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals| journal=Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics|volume = 4|date= 1992| issue =3| page = 167| doi =10.1007/BF01130288|bibcode = 1992CMT.....4..167L|last1 = Leslie|first1 = F.

==External influences on liquid crystals==
Scientists and engineers are able to use liquid crystals in a variety of applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.

===Electric and magnetic field effects===
The ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takezoe, H|first=|date=2014|title=Historical Overview of Polar Liquid Crystals|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00150193.2014.932653|journal=Ferroelectrics|volume=468|pages=1–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.
The effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=photoswitchable liquid crystal design|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0036-1588913|journal=Synthesis|volume=49|pages=1214–1222|via=DOI: 10.1055/s-0036-1588913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface preparations===
In the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.

Several liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called [[photoalignment]].

===[[Fréedericksz transition|Fredericks transition]]===
The competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.

The Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.

==Effect of chirality==
As already described, [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a [[stereogenic]] center. An additional requirement is that the system not be [[racemic]]: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.

Chiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as [[polarizer|polarization filters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Video camera system using liquid-crystal polarizing filter toreduce reflected light| doi =10.1109/11.735903|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume = 44| issue =4|date = 1998| page = 419| last1 = Fujikake| first1 = H.| last2 = Takizawa| first2 = K.| last3 = Aida| first3 = T.| last4 = Negishi| first4 = T.| last5 = Kobayashi| first5 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and [[molecular weight]], DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Switching of banana liquid crystal mesophases under field| doi =10.1140/epje/e2003-00016-y|journal=European Physical Journal E| volume = 10|date = 2003| pmid =15011066| issue =2|bibcode = 2003EPJE...10..129A|last1 = Achard|first1 = M.F.|last2 = Bedel|first2 = J.Ph.|last3 = Marcerou|first3 = J.P.|last4 = Nguyen|first4 = H.T.|last5 = Rouillon|first5 = J.C.|pages = 129–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be [[ferroelectric]] or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Ferroelectric nematic liquid-crystal phases of dipolar hard ellipsoids|journal=Phys. Rev. A|volume = 40| issue =9| page= 5444| date = 1989| doi =10.1103/PhysRevA.40.5444|bibcode = 1989PhRvA..40.5444B|last1 = Baus|first1 = Marc|last2 = Colot|first2 = Jean-Louis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Pressure-Temperature Phase Diagrams of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals|journal=J.

Chirality can also be incorporated into a phase by adding a chiral [[dopant]], which may not form LCs itself. [[Twisted nematic field effect|Twisted-nematic]] or [[Super-twisted nematic display|super-twisted nematic]] mixtures often contain a small amount of such dopants.

==Applications of liquid crystals==

[[File:Wikipedia Liquid Crystal Display Arduino.jpg|thumb|left|"Wikipedia" displayed on an LCD]]

Liquid crystals find wide use in liquid crystal displays, which rely on the [[optics|optical]] properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in the presence or absence of an [[electric field]]. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two [[polarizer]]s that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see [[Twisted nematic field effect]]).&lt;ref name=castellano/&gt; This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.&lt;ref name=castellano/&gt; Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Integrating liquid crystal based optical devices in photonic crystal| doi = 10.1007/s11082-007-9139-8|journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics|volume = 39| issue =12–13|date =2007| page = 1009|last1 = Alkeskjold|first1 = Thomas Tanggaard|last2 = Scolari|first2 = Lara|last3 = Noordegraaf|first3 = Danny|last4 = Lægsgaard|first4 = Jesper|last5 = Weirich|first5 = Johannes|last6 = Wei|first6 = Lei|last7 = Tartarini|first7 = Giovanni|last8 = Bassi|first8 = Paolo|last9 = Gauza|first9 = Sebastian| last10 = Wu| first10 = Shin-Tson| last11 = Bjarklev| first11 = Anders|url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/integrating-liquid-crystal-based-optical-devices-in-photonic-crystal-fibers(747649e2-5905-4e73-90d0-9e2795a1fa2a).html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid crystal lenses converge or diverge the incident light by adjusting the refractive index of liquid crystal layer with applied voltage or temperature. Generally, the liquid crystal lenses generate a parabolic refractive index distribution by arranging molecular orientations. Therefore, a plane wave is reshaped into a parabolic wavefront by a liquid crystal lens. The [[focal length]] of liquid crystal lenses could be continuously tunable when the external electric field can be properly tuned. Liquid crystal lenses are a kind of [[adaptive optics]]. Imaging system can be benefited with focusing correction, image plane adjustment, or changing the range of [[depth-of-field]] or [[depth of focus]].

A '''lot''' is an old unit of weight used in many European countries since the [[Middle Ages]] until the beginning of the 20th century. Most often it was defined as either {{Fraction|1|30}} or {{Fraction|1|32}} of a [[Pound (mass)|pound]] (or more precisely of whatever mass value one local pound had at the time). Recorded values range from 10 to 50 [[gram]]s.

In the [[Imperial units|Imperial]] and [[United States customary units|US costumary]] systems of measurement, a lot is {{Fraction|1|32}} of a pound, or {{Fraction|1|2}} an [[Ounce#International avoirdupois ounce|ounce]], making it exactly 14.174 761 562 5 grams if derived from the [[International yard and pound|international pound]].

'''Majda's model''' is a qualitative model (in [[mathematical physics]]) introduced by [[Andrew Majda]] in 1981 for the study of interactions in the combustion theory of shock waves and explosive chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Majda, Andrew|title=A qualitative model for dynamic combustion|journal=SIAM Appl.

'''Metal deactivators''', or '''metal deactivating agents''' ('''MDA''') are [[fuel additives]] and [[oil additive]]s used to stabilize fluids by deactivating (usually by [[sequestrant|sequestering]]) metal [[ion]]s, mostly introduced by the action of naturally occurring acids in the fuel and acids generated in [[lubricant]]s by oxidative processes with the metallic parts of the systems. Fuels desulfurized by [[copper sweetening]] also contain a significant trace amounts of copper.

Metal deactivators inhibit the [[catalytic]] effects of such ions, especially [[copper]], retarding the formation of gummy residues (e.g. [[gel]]s containing copper [[mercaptide]]). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060103161525/http://www.octel-starreon.com/Products_RFA_Metal_Deactivators.htm] Even concentrations of copper as low as 0.1 ppm can have detrimental effects.

An example of a metal deactivator used for [[gasoline]] and [[jet fuel]]s is [[1,2-Diaminopropane#N,N-Disalicylidene-1,2-propanediamine|N,N-Disalicylidene-1,2-propanediamine]]. It is used in turbine and [[jet fuel]]s, [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[heating oil]], and [[grease (lubricant)|greases]]. It is approved for military and commercial [[aviation fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Dabelstein, W.; Reglitzky A.; Schutze A.; Reders, K. | title = Automotive Fuels}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benzotriazole]] and its various derivatives are also common in [[lubricant]] formulas.

It is considered the worst ecological disaster ever to befall a [[nature reserve]] in the [[History of Israel|history of the State of Israel]].

In August the Nature and Parks Authority reported that most of the cleanup operations had been completed and that work would soon begin to restore the scenery of the area. At the same time, senior contacts in the nature preservation community told ''[[Haaretz]]'' that the scale on which earth had been removed from the vicinity of the spill was excessive and had turned it into "a mining and quarrying site". An official Nature and Parks Authority report completed in late August indicated that the rehabilitation efforts had indeed taken an ecological toll on the site and seriously disrupted the routines of local wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rinat|first=Zafrir|script-title=he:טענות נגד שיקום נחל צין: העבודות גרמו דווקא לנזקים |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/science/1.1373656 |accessdate=11 August 2014 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=31 August 2011 |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Complaints against Nahal Zin rehabilitation: work actually caused damage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EAPC and representatives from Israel's [[Ministry of the Environment (Israel)|Ministry of the Environment]] held a ceremony marking the completion of cleanup efforts on 27 September. EAPC stated that it successfully restored the Nahal Zin area to its earlier state prior to the leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yedidya|first=Ben-Or|script-title=he:'התחייבנו והשבנו את נחל צין לקדמותו'|url=http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/226601|accessdate=12 October 2011|newspaper=[[Arutz Sheva]]|date=27 September 2011|language=Hebrew|trans-title='We pledged to restor Nahal Zin to its earlier state'|quote=מחברת קצא"א נמסר, כי בשיתוף פעולה מלא ובהנחיית משרד איכות הסביבה ורשות הטבע והגנים, בסופו של תהליך דאגה החברה להשיב את נחל צין לקדמותו.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
EAPC denied responsibility for the disaster, stating that the driver of the backhoe loader was there by [[subcontract]] and that an on-site [[park ranger]] had instructed him to transplant a tree. It attributed the accident to "profound incompetence" on the part of the park ranger and the driver.&lt;ref name=jpostudasin /&gt;&lt;ref name=nrglavi&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavi|first=Aviv|script-title=he:הבהלה לזהב: טלנובלת דלק בנחל צין|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/262/405.html?hp=1&amp;cat=459&amp;loc=17|accessdate=24 July 2011|newspaper=[[Nrg Maariv]]|date=22 July 2011|language=Hebrew|trans-title=The gold rush: a soap opera of fuel at Nahal Zin|quote='שות הטבע והגנים, ואמר לשופליסט להעתיק עץ ממקומו. בגלל טמטום גדול של הפקח ושל השופליסט הוא הכניס את הכף עמוק מדי וגרם פיצוץ'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's Ministry of the Environment called the disaster the worst ever on an Israeli nature reserve.&lt;ref name=upi /&gt; A spokeswoman for the ministry said that no automatic safety valves were ever installed as a precaution should a leak occur, and further charged EAPC with failing to ensure that it had vehicles capable of negotiating the terrain fast enough to deal with the leak before the fuel had a chance to be absorbed by the soil.&lt;ref name=nrglavi /&gt;

The chairman of the [[Knesset]] Environment and Health Committee urged the government to adopt his recommendation for a revised Petroleum Law and radically alter its approach to fossil fuel-related environmental protection.&lt;ref name=jpostjune /&gt;

A spokeswoman for [[Greenpeace]] in Israel called the disaster "a large, black flag" for Israel and said more needed to be done to end Israel's reliance on oil and to promote renewable energy alternatives.&lt;ref name=jpostjune /&gt;

[[The Green Movement (Israel)|Israel's Green Movement]] co-chairman at [[Ben-Gurion University]] accused Israel's infrastructural institutions of being derelict both in protecting the nation's natural resources and in ensuring that adequate measures are in place for immediate cleanup efforts when they become necessary.&lt;ref name=jpostudasin&gt;{{cite news|last=Udasin|first=Sharon|title=Nahal Zin operations halted following huge oil spill|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=228457|accessdate=8 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=8 July 2011|quote=Green Movement Co-Chairman Prof. Alon Tal of Ben-Gurion University said that the event was a testament to the problematic administration of Israel’s big infrastructural bodies in general.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second leak==
On 5 September 2011 an EAPC pipeline was again ruptured as a result of maintenance work. A backhoe loader struck the pipeline at a location half a kilometer south of where the first leak occurred in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben David|first=Lior|script-title=he:בפעם השנייה: דליפת דלק בנחל צין|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3530463,00.html|accessdate=6 September 2011|newspaper=[[Calcalist]]|date=5 September 2011|language=Hebrew|trans-title=For the second time: fuel leak at Nahal Zin|quote=הצינור נפגע על ידי טרקטור שעסק בעבודות השיפוץ כ-500 מ' דרומית מהמקום שבו נפגע בפעם הקודמת.}}&lt;/ref&gt; EAPC workers promptly arrived at the scene and began sealing the pipeline.

The '''Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{lang-fi|Olkiluodon ydinvoimalaitos}}) is on [[Olkiluoto Island]], which is on the shore of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] in the municipality of [[Eurajoki]] in western [[Finland]]. It is one of Finland's two [[nuclear power plant]]s, the other being the two-unit [[VVER]] [[Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant]]. The plant is owned and operated by [[Teollisuuden Voima]] (TVO), a subsidiary of [[Pohjolan Voima]].

The Olkiluoto plant consists of two Boiling Water Reactors ([[Boiling water reactor|BWRs]]) producing 880&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] and 890&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity. 
A third reactor, [[#Unit 3|Unit 3]], is expected to be online in January 2020.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/New-delay-in-start-up-of-Finnish-EPR|title=New delay in start-up of Finnish EPR|last=|first=|date=2018-11-29|website=World Nuclear News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unit 3 is an [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]] reactor and is under construction since 2005. 
The start of commercial operation was originally planned for May 2009&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/docs/2004-4-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but the project is delayed and the latest estimate (as of November 2018) for start of regular production is January 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
In December 2012, the French multi-national building contractor, [[Areva]], estimated that the full cost of building the reactor will be about €8.5 billion, or almost three times the delivery price of €3 billion.&lt;ref name="HS-2012-12-13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ-2012-12-13" /&gt;

A decision-in-principle for a [[#Unit 4|fourth reactor]] to be built at the site was granted by the Finnish parliament in July 2010,&lt;ref name="Reuters-2010-07-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WNN-2012-07-17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-2012-07-16" /&gt; but in June 2015 TVO decided that it will not apply for a construction license for Olkiluoto 4&lt;ref name="TVO-2015-06-24" /&gt;.

== Units 1 and 2 ==

Units 1 and 2 consists of two [[Boiling water reactor|BWRs]] producing 880&amp;nbsp;MW and 890&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity respectively, with unit 1 also planned to be upgraded to 890&amp;nbsp;MW in spring 2018.&lt;ref name="IAEA-Finland-reactors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVO-2018-01-03" /&gt; The main contractor was [[Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA-Atom]], now a part of [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse Electric Sweden AB]]. Turbine generators were supplied by [[Stal-Laval]]. The units' architecture was designed by ASEA-Atom. The reactor pressure vessels were constructed by Uddcomb Sweden AB, and reactor internal parts, mechanical components by Finnatom. The electrical equipment was supplied by [[Stromberg (company)|Strömberg]].&lt;ref name="TVO-2011-03-13" /&gt; Unit 1 was constructed by Atomirakennus and unit 2 by Jukola and Työyhtymä.&lt;ref name="INSC-TVO-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="INSC-TVO-2" /&gt; Unit 1 achieved its initial criticality in July 1978 and it started commercial operations in October 1979.&lt;ref name="INSC-TVO-1" /&gt; Unit 2 achieved its initial criticality in October 1979 and it started commercial operations in July 1982.&lt;ref name="INSC-TVO-2" /&gt;

Major upgrades were carried out to the units in 2010 and 2011, including replacement of turbines and generators, isolation valves, electrical switchgear and seawater pumps. The upgrades increased the net electrical output by 20 MWto 880 MW each.&lt;ref name="NEI-2012-01-09" /&gt;

In 2017, unit 2 was upgraded and modernized, increasing the output further to 890&amp;nbsp;MW from the beginning of 2018. A similar upgrade to unit 1 is planned for spring 2018. The extended maintenance was also made to prepare for a license renewal application.&lt;ref name="TVO-2018-01-03" /&gt; The license extension was granted in September 2018 and allows the reactors to operate until 2038.&lt;ref name="TVO-2018-09-20" /&gt; 

== Unit 3 ==

[[File:OL3.jpg|thumb|left|Olkiluoto 3 in 2009.]]

In February 2005, the [[Cabinet of Finland|Finnish cabinet]] gave its permission to [[Teollisuuden voima|TVO]] to construct a new nuclear reactor, making Finland the first Western European country in 15 years to order one.&lt;ref name="Worldwatch-2010" /&gt; The construction of the unit began in 2005. The start of commercial operation was planned for 2010,&lt;ref name="Areva-2007-09-27" /&gt; but has been pushed back several times.&lt;ref name="WNN-2016-01-14" /&gt; {{As of|2018|11}}, the estimate for start of regular production is January 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Olkiluoto 3 is the first [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]], which is a type of [[Generation III reactor|third generation]] [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]], to have gone into construction. It will have a nameplate capacity of 1600 MW. [[Japan Steel Works]] and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] manufactured the unit's 526-ton [[reactor vessel|reactor pressure vessel]].&lt;ref name="TVO-2009-01-04" /&gt;

At the start of construction, the main contractor was Areva NP (now [[Framatome]], after the sell-off mentioned below), a joint venture of [[Areva]] and [[Siemens]]. However, in 2009, Siemens sold its one-third share of Areva NP to Areva, which is now the main contractor.&lt;ref name="HS-2009-01-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WNN-2011-09-19" /&gt; Siemens remained on the project as the subcontractor with the main responsibility for constructing the [[turbine hall]]. Areva sold its majority stake in Framatome (previously Areva NP), its nuclear reactor and fuel business, to [[Électricité de France]].

According to TVO, the construction phase of the project would create a total of about 30,000 person-years of employment directly and indirectly; that the highest number of on-site employees has been almost 4,400; and that the operation phase would create 150 to 200 permanent jobs.&lt;ref name="TVO-2012" /&gt;

=== Construction delays ===

The first license application for the third unit was made in December 2000&lt;ref name="STUK-2009-04-27" /&gt; and the date of the unit's entry into service was estimated to be 2010.&lt;ref name="Areva-2007-09-27" /&gt; However, since the start of construction, several delays to the schedule have been announced. In July 2012 TVO announced that the unit would not go into service before 2015,&lt;ref name="WNN-2012-07-17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FT-2012-07-16" /&gt; five years after the original estimate. In a statement, the operator said it was "not pleased with the situation" although solutions to various problems were being found and work was "progressing", and that it was waiting for a new launch date from Areva and Siemens.&lt;ref name="BBC-2012-07-16" /&gt; In February 2014, TVO said that it is could not give an estimate of the plant's startup date, because it was still waiting for the Areva-Siemens consortium to provide it with an updated overall schedule for the project."&lt;ref name="WNN-2014-02-17" /&gt; Later the same month it was reported that Areva was shutting down construction due to the dispute over compensations and unfinished automation planning. According to [[Kauppalehti]], the estimated opening was delayed until 2018–2020.&lt;ref name="Kauppalehti-2014-02-28" /&gt;

The delays have been due to various problems with planning, supervision, and workmanship,&lt;ref name="WNN-2012-07-17" /&gt; and have been the subject of an inquiry by [[Säteilyturvakeskus|STUK]], the Finnish nuclear safety regulator.&lt;ref name="WNN-2009-10-16" /&gt; The first problems that surfaced were irregularities in the foundation concrete, and caused a delay of months. Later, it was found that subcontractors had provided heavy forgings that were not up to project standards and which had to be re-cast. An apparent problem constructing the reactor's unique double-containment structure also caused delays, as the welders had not been given proper instructions.&lt;ref name="WNN-2009-10-16" /&gt;

In 2009, Petteri Tiippana, the director of STUK's nuclear power plant division, told the [[BBC]] that it was difficult to deliver nuclear power plant projects on schedule because builders were not used to working to the exacting standards required on nuclear construction sites, since so few new reactors had been built in recent years.&lt;ref name="BBC-2009-11-25" /&gt;

At the end of 2013, TVO said that the Areva-Siemens consortium plans to reduce workers and subcontractors on the construction site and says that it expects the contractor to provide details about the expected impact on the project's schedule.&lt;ref name="Reuters-2013-12-10" /&gt;

After the construction of the unit started in 2005, Areva began constructing EPRs in [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant|Flamanville]], [[France]], and in [[Taishan Nuclear Power Plant|Taishan]], [[China]]. However, as of July 2012, the construction of the EPR in France is four years behind schedule.&lt;ref name="BBC-2012-07-16" /&gt; Taishan 1 in China became the first EPR to start power generation on 29 June 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cost ===

The main contractor, Areva, is building the unit for a fixed price of €3 billion, so in principle, any construction costs above that price fall on Areva. In July 2012, those overruns were estimated at more than €2 billion,&lt;ref name="FT-2012-07-16" /&gt; and in December 2012, Areva estimated that the full cost of building the reactor would be about €8.5 billion, well over the previous estimate of €6.4 billion.&lt;ref name="HS-2012-12-13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ-2012-12-13" /&gt; Because of the delays, TVO and Areva are both seeking compensation from each other through the [[International Court of Arbitration]].

In October 2013, TVO's demand for compensation from Areva had risen to €1.8 billion, and Areva's from TVO to €2.6 billion.&lt;ref name="YLE-2013-10-29" /&gt; In December 2013, Areva increased its demand to €2.7 billion.&lt;ref name="YLE-2014-01-18" /&gt; In November 2016, the case was still ongoing.&lt;ref name="WNN-2016-10-10" /&gt; On March 10th 2018 French newspaper [[Le Monde]] announced that Areva and TVO have reached an agreement.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan-2018-03-12" /&gt; A day later, TVO confirmed that Areva would pay it €450 million in compensation over the delays and lost income.&lt;ref name="TVO-2018-03-11" /&gt; The agreement would settle all legal actions between the two companies.

=== Criticism ===

In 2009, professor [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Stephen Thomas]] wrote, "Olkiluoto has become an example of all that can go wrong in economic terms with new reactors," and that Areva and the TVO "are in bitter dispute over who will bear the cost overruns and there is a real risk now that the utility will default."&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt;

The project has also been criticized by [[Säteilyturvakeskus|STUK]] because "instructions have not been observed in the welding of pipes and the supervision of welding."&lt;ref name="WNN-2009-10-16" /&gt; STUK has also noted that there have been delays in submitting proper paperwork.&lt;ref name="NEI-2009-05-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-2007-09-11" /&gt;

Olkiluoto 3 was supposed to be the first reactor of [[Generation III reactor|3+ generation]] which would pave the way for a new wave of identical reactors across Europe, safe, affordable, and delivered on time. The delays and cost overruns have had knock-on effects in other countries.&lt;ref name="BBC-2009-11-25" /&gt;

The construction workforce includes about 3,800 employees from 500 companies. 80% of the workers are foreigners, mostly from eastern European countries. In 2012 it was reported that one Bulgarian contracting firm is owned by the mafia, and that Bulgarian workers have been required to pay weekly protection fees to the [[mafia]], wages have been unpaid, employees have been told not to join a union and that employers also reneged on social security payments.&lt;ref name="HS-2013-12-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YLE-2012-10-05" /&gt;

== Unit 4 ==

On 14 February 2008, TVO submitted an environmental impact assessment of unit four to the Ministry of Employment and Economy.&lt;ref name="WNN-2008-02-21" /&gt; On 21 April 2010, the government of Finland decided to grant a decision-in-principle to Teollisuuden Voima for the fourth reactor in Olkiluoto. The decision was approved by the parliament on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref name="Reuters-2010-07-01" /&gt; If constructed, the fourth unit would be a [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or a [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]] with a power output of 1,000 to 1,800&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name="WNN-2008-02-21" /&gt;

In September 2014, with unit 3 still unfinished, the Finnish government rejected TVO's request for time extension of the unit 4 decision-in-principle. Economic Affairs Minister [[Jan Vapaavuori]] referred to the long delay of the 3rd reactor and to unsatisfactory assurances by TVO that the 4th unit would ever be built. Nevertheless PM [[Alexander Stubb|Stubb]] stated that the rejection didn't spell the end for the OL4 project, and that TVO would have the opportunity to apply for a construction license before the decision-in-principle expires in June 2015.&lt;ref name="YLE-2014-09-25" /&gt;

In June 2015 TVO decided not to apply for a construction permit for the Olkiluoto 4 unit because of delays with the unit 3, however saying they are prepared to file for a new decision-in-principle later.&lt;ref name="YLE-2015-06-24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVO-2015-06-24" /&gt;

== Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository ==

[[File:Onkalo 2.jpg|thumb|Onkalo pilot repository cave.]]
{{Main|Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository}}

The ''Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository'' is a [[deep geological repository]] for the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the first such repository in the world. It is currently under construction at the Olkiluoto plant by the company [[Posiva]], owned by the nuclear power plant operators [[Fortum]] and [[Teollisuuden Voima|TVO]].

== Agriculture ==

The [[waste heat]], an output common to all [[thermal power plants]], which heats the cooling water (at 13&amp;nbsp;°C) is utilized for small-scale agriculture before being pumped back to the sea. The power plant hosts the northernmost [[vineyard]] in the world, a 0.1 ha experimental plot that yields 850&amp;nbsp;kg Zilga [[grapes]] annually.&lt;ref name="Tiede-2013-02-13" /&gt; Another use is a pond for growing crabs, [[Coregonus lavaretus|whitefish]] and [[sturgeon]] for [[caviar]].&lt;ref name="TVO-dead-link" /&gt;

== Incidents ==

In April 2014 a turbine steam condenser of unit 1 had a small seawater leak, at a rate of two litres per hour. According to the operator, the leak forced to limit the plant output down to 300 MW, but was not serious and was to be repaired in a day.&lt;ref name="YLE-2014-04-14" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7058">'''Particle-laden flows''' refers to a class of [[Two-phase flow|two-phase fluid flow]], in which one of the phases is continuously connected (referred to as the continuous or carrier phase) and the other phase is made up of small, immiscible, and typically dilute particles (referred to as the dispersed or particle phase). Fine aerosol particles in air is an example of a particle-laden flow; the aerosols are the dispersed phase, and the air is the carrier phase.

The modeling of two-phase flows has a tremendous variety of engineering and scientific applications: pollution dispersion in the atmosphere, fluidization in [[combustion]] processes, aerosol deposition in spray medication, along with many others.

== Governing equations ==
The starting point for a mathematical description of almost any type of fluid flow is the classical set of [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. To describe particle-laden flows, we must modify these equations to account for the effect of the particles on the carrier, or vice versa, or both - a suitable choice of such added complications depend on a variety of the parameters, for instance, how dense the particles are, how concentrated they are, or whether or not they are chemically reactive. In most real world cases, the particles are very small and occur in low concentrations, hence the dynamics are governed primarily by the continuous phase. A possible way to represent the dynamics of the carrier phase is by the following modified Navier-Stokes momentum equation:  

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \rho u_i}{dt} + \frac{\partial \rho u_i u_j}{\partial x_j} = - \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i} +  \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_j} + S_i, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; is a momentum source or sink term, arising from the presence of the particle phase. The above equation is an [[Eulerian reference frame|Eulerian]] equation, that is, the dynamics are understood from the viewpoint of a fixed point in space. The dispersed phase is typically (though not always) treated in a Lagrangian framework, that is, the dynamics are understood from the viewpoint of fixed particles as they move through space. A usual choice of momentum equation for a particle is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d v_i}{dt} = \frac{1}{\tau_p} (u_i - v_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; represents the carrier phase velocity and &lt;math&gt; v_i &lt;/math&gt; represents the particle velocity. &lt;math&gt; \tau_p &lt;/math&gt; is the particle relaxation time, and represents a typical timescale of the particle's reaction to changes in the carrier phase velocity - loosely speaking, this can be thought of as the particle's inertia with respect to the fluid with contains it. The interpretation of the above equation is that particle motion is hindered by a drag force. In reality, there are a variety of other forces which act on the particle motion (such as gravity, Basset history and added mass) – as described through for instance the [[Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation]]. However, for many physical examples, in which the density of the particle far exceeds the density of the medium, the above equation is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maxey|first=M. R.|author2=J. J. Riley|journal=Phys. Fluids|year=1983|volume=26|pages=883–889}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical assumption is that the particles are spherical, in which case the drag is modeled using [[Stokes' law|Stokes drag]] assumption: 

:&lt;math&gt; \tau_p = \frac{\rho_p d_p^2}{18 \mu}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; is the particle diameter, &lt;math&gt;\rho_p&lt;/math&gt;, the particle density and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the dynamic viscosity of the carrier phase. More sophisticated models contain the correction factor:

:&lt;math&gt; \tau_p = \frac{\rho_p d_p^2}{18 \mu} (1 + 0.15 Re_p^{0.687})^{-1}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Re_p&lt;/math&gt; is the particle Reynolds number, defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; Re_p = \frac{| \vec{u} - \vec{v} | d_p}{\nu}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Coupling ==
If the mass fraction of the dispersed phase is small, then ''one-way coupling'' between the phases is a reasonable assumption; that is, the dynamics of the particle phase are affected by the carrier phase, but the reverse is not the case. However if the mass fraction of the dispersed phase is large, the interaction of the dynamics between the two phases must be considered - this is ''two-way coupling''.

A problem with the Lagrangian treatment of the dispersed phase is that once the number of particles becomes large, it may require a prohibitive amount of computational power to track a sufficiently large sample of particles required for statistical convergence. In addition, if the particles are sufficiently light, they behave essentially like a second fluid. In this case, an Eulerian treatment of the dispersed phase is sensible.

== Modeling ==

Like all fluid dynamics-related disciplines, the modelling of particle-laden flows is an enormous challenge for researchers - this is because most flows of practical interest are [[Turbulence|turbulent]].

[[Direct numerical simulation]]s (DNS) for single-phase flow, let alone two-phase flow, are computationally very expensive; the computing power required for models of practical engineering interest are far out of reach. Since one is often interested in modeling only large scale qualitative behavior of the flow, a possible approach is to decompose the flow velocity into mean and fluctuating components, by the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes]] (RANS) approach. A compromise between DNS and RANS is [[large eddy simulation]] (LES), in which the small scales of fluid motion are modeled and the larger, resolved scales are simulated directly.

Experimental observations, as well as DNS indicate that an important phenomenon to model is preferential concentration. Particles (particularly those with Stokes number close to 1) are known to accumulate in regions of high shear and low vorticity (such as turbulent [[boundary layer]]s), and the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not well understood. Moreover, particles are known to migrate down turbulence intensity gradients (this process is known as [[turbophoresis]]). These features are particularly difficult to capture using RANS or LES-based models since too much time-varying information is lost.

Due to these difficulties, existing turbulence models tend to be ''ad hoc'', that is, the range of applicability of a given model is usually suited toward a highly specific set of parameters (such as geometry, dispersed phase mass loading and particle reaction time), and are also restricted to low [[Reynolds number]]s (whereas the Reynolds number of flows of engineering interest tend to be very high).

'''Pipe dope''' is any thread [[lubricant]], thread sealing compound, and [[adhesive#Mechanisms of adhesion|anaerobic chemical sealant]]s that are used to make a [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] [[screw thread|thread]] joint leak proof and pressure tight.  Although common pipe threads are tapered and therefore will achieve an [[interference fit]] during proper assembly, machining and finishing variances usually result in a fit that does not result in 100 percent contact between the mating components.  The application of pipe dope prior to assembly will fill the minute voids between the threads, thus making the joint pressure tight.  Pipe dope also acts as a lubricant and helps prevent seizing of the mating parts, which can later cause difficulty during disassembly.

==Composition==
A [[material safety data sheet]] reports that the "Permatex" 51D pipe joint compound contains [[kaolin]], clay, [[vegetable oil]], [[rosin]], [[ethanol]], etc {{cn|date=November 2018}}. The ingredients are designed to: 
# fill minute spaces between mating pipe fittings (kaolin), and 
# serve as a lubricant as the fittings are forced together (vegetable oil).

Various types of pipe dope formulation exist, the appropriate type being determined by the application, e.g., [[pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], [[caustic (substance)|caustic]], etc., as well as the expected [[pressure]].  Improper selection of the type of pipe dope may result in leakage despite best assembly practices.  

==Plastic pipes==
Petroleum-based pipe dope is not intended for use on threaded [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[CPVC]] or [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] pipe and fittings since it will deteriorate the plastic.  Builders in the US are expected to use thread compounds that meet [[ASTM]] F2331 - Standard Test Method for Determining Chemical Compatibility of Thread Sealants with Thermoplastic Threaded Pipe and Fittings Materials or [[thread seal tape]] on PVC, CPVC and ABS threads.

In [[mathematics]], the '''principle of permanence''' is that a complex function (or functional equation) which is 0 on a set with a non-[[isolated point]] is 0 everywhere (or at least on the [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] of its domain which contains the point). There are various statements of the principle, depending on the type of function or equation considered.

==For a complex function of one variable==
For one variable, the principle of permanence states that if ''f''(''z'') is an [[analytic function]] defined on an [[open set|open]] [[connected set|connected]] subset ''U'' of the complex numbers '''C''', and there exists a [[convergent sequence]] {''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} having a limit ''L'' which is in ''U'', such that ''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''n'', then ''f''(''z'') is uniformly zero on ''U''.&lt;ref&gt;'The Language of Science'', [[Tobias Dantzig]], [[Joseph Mazur]], and [[Barry Mazur]], 2007, Penguin Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;98, 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
One of the main uses of the principle of permanence is to show that a functional equation that holds for the real numbers also holds for the complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Dauben|given= Joseph W.|year=1979|title=Georg Cantor: his mathematics and philosophy of the infinite|place=Boston|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-02447-9|ref=Dauben1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the function e&lt;sup&gt;s+t&lt;/sup&gt;-e&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;=0 on the [[real number]]s. By the principle of permanence for functions of two variables, this implies that e&lt;sup&gt;s+t&lt;/sup&gt;-e&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;=0 for all complex numbers, thus proving one of the laws of exponents for complex exponents.&lt;ref name = "Gamelin" &gt;Gamelin, T.

[[File:Aluminium composite material.png|thumb|Aluminium composite material panel structure]]

A '''sandwich panel''' is any structure made of three layers: a low-density core, and a thin skin-layer bonded to each side. Sandwich panels are used in applications where a combination of high structural rigidity and low weight is required.

Sandwich panels are an example of a [[sandwich structured composite]]: the strength and lightness of this technology makes it popular and widespread. Its versatility means that the panels have many applications and come in many forms: the core and skin materials can vary widely and the core may be a [[composite honeycomb|honeycomb]] or a solid filling. Enclosed panels are termed ''cassettes''.

==Applications==
One obvious application is in aircraft, where mechanical performance and weight-saving are essential. Transportation and automotive applications also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renolit.com/composites/en/products/automotive/honeycomb-structure/|title=Gorcell by Renolit|publisher=Renolit.com |accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In building and construction, these prefabricated products designed for use as building envelopes. They appear in industrial and office buildings, in clean and cold rooms and also in private houses, whether renovation or new-build.  They combine a high-quality product with high flexibility regarding design. They generally have a good energy-efficiency and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stinger.coroplast.com/|title=Stinger honeycomb panel|publisher=coroplast.com|accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In packaging, applications include fluted polypropylene boards and polypropylene honeycomb boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karton.it/uk/prodotti.htm|title=Packaging sandwich panels|publisher=Karton.it |accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===SIP===
'''[[Structural insulated panel]]s''', or '''structural insulating panels''', ('''SIP'''), are panels used as a [[building material]].

[[File:Spaceship Earth at night.jpg|thumb|right|[[Epcot]]'s [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]] is an example of the use of ACP in architecture. It is a geodesic sphere composed of 11,324 ACP tiles.]]

===ACP===
[[File:Baustellenschild Dibond Detailansicht.jpg|thumb|Construction site panel made of Aluminium Composite Material panel (detail view)]]

'''Aluminium composite panels''' ('''ACP'''), made of '''aluminium composite material''' ('''ACM'''), are flat panels consisting of two thin [[coil coating|coil-coated]] [[aluminium]] sheets bonded to a non-aluminium core. ACPs are frequently used for external [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] or [[facade]]s of buildings, insulation, and [[signage]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amdnj.com/products.html |publisher=Architectural Metal Designs |title=Architectural Metal Designs-Products |accessdate=2014-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724070744/http://amdnj.com/products.html |archive-date=2014-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACP is mainly used for external and internal architectural [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] or partitions, false ceilings, signage, machine coverings, container construction, etc. Applications of ACP are not limited to external building cladding, but can also be used in any form of cladding such as partitions, false ceilings, etc. ACP is also widely used within the signage industry as an alternative to heavier, more expensive substrates.

ACP has been used as a light-weight but very sturdy material in construction, particularly for transient structures like [[trade fair|trade show]] booths and similar temporary elements. It has recently also been adopted as a backing material for mounting fine art photography, often with an acrylic finish using processes like [[Diasec]] or other face-mounting techniques. ACP material has been used in famous structures as [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], [[VanDusen Botanical Garden]], the Leipzig branch of the German National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alucobond.com/a2-product-properties.html |publisher=Alucobond |title=ALUCOBOND® A2 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These structures made optimal use of ACP through its cost, durability, and efficiency. Its flexibility, low weight, and easy forming and processing allow for innovative design with increased rigidity and durability.
Where the core material is flammable, the usage must be considered. The standard ACP core is [[polyethylene]] (PE) or [[polyurethane]] (PU). These materials do not have good fire-resistant (FR) properties unless specially treated and are therefore not generally suitable as a building material for dwellings; several jurisdictions have banned their use completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Alissa|title=When Will Dubai Fix Its Burning Skyscraper Problem?|url=https://gizmodo.com/when-will-dubai-fix-its-burning-skyscraper-problem-1751398645|website=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arconic, owner of the Reynobond brand, cautions the prospective buyer. Concerning the core, it says that distance of the panel from the ground is a determinant of "which materials are safer to use". In a brochure it has a graphic of a building in flames, with the caption "[a]s soon as the building is higher than the firefighters’ ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material". It shows that the Reynobond polyethylene product is for up to circa 10 meters; the fire-retardant product (c. 70% mineral core) from there to up to c. 30 meters, the height of the ladder; and the European A2-rated product (c. 90% mineral core) for anything above that. In this brochure, ''Fire Safety in High-rise Buildings: Our Fire Solutions'', product specification is only given for the last two products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Safety in High-rise Buildings: Our Fire Solutions|url=https://www.arconic.com/aap/europe/pdf/Our%20fire%20solutions_BR36EN_012017.pdf|work=Arconic Architectural Products SAS|date=December 2016|accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cladding materials, particularly the core, have been implicated as a possible contributing factor in the 2017 [[Grenfell Tower fire]] in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London fire: Grenfell Tower 'renovated with deadly cladding'|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/london-fire-grenfell-tower-may-have-been-renovated-with-deadly-cladding-20170614-gwr9qf.html|work=The Age|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[High-rise fire|high-rise building fires]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia; France; the United Arab Emirates; South Korea; and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cladding in London high-rise fire also blamed for 2014 Melbourne blaze |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/15/cladding-in-2014-melbourne-high-rise-blaze-also-used-in-grenfell-tower|date= 2017-06-15|last=Wahlquist |first= Calla |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire-rated cores, such as mineral wool (MW), are an alternative, but are usually more expensive and often not a legal requirement.

The aluminium sheets can be coated with [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF), fluoropolymer resins (FEVE), or polyester paint. Aluminium can be painted in any kind of colour, and ACPs are produced in a wide range of metallic and non-metallic colours as well as patterns that imitate other materials, such as [[wood]] or [[marble]]. The core is commonly low-density polyethylene (PE), or a mix of low-density polyethylene and mineral material to exhibit fire retardant properties.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

[[File:Baustellenschild Dibond.jpg|thumb|Construction site panel made of Dibond]]

3A Composites (formerly Alcan Composites &amp; Alusuisse) invented aluminium composites in 1964 - as a joint invention with BASF- and commercial production of Alucobond commenced in 1969. The product was patented in 1971, a patent which expired in 1991. After the expiration of the patent several companies started commercial production such as Reynobond (1991), Alpolic (Mitsubishi Chemicals, 1995), etalbond (1995). Today, it's estimated that more than 200 companies across the world are producing ACP.

==History==
Sandwich panel construction techniques have experienced considerable development in the last 40 years. Previously, sandwich panels were considered products suitable only for functional constructions and industrial buildings.  However, their good insulation characteristics, their versatility, quality and appealing visual appearance, have resulted in a growing and widespread use of the panels across a huge variety of buildings.

==Code of Practice==
* Sandwich panels require the CE mark to be sold in Europe.  The European sandwich panel standard is EN14509:2013 Self-supporting double-skin metal-faced insulating-panels - Factory-made products – Specifications.
* Sandwich panels quality can be certified by applying the quality level EPAQ

==Characteristics==
The qualities that have produced the rapid growth in the use of sandwich panels, particularly in construction, include:

===Thermal resistance===
* Sandwich panels have λ-values from 0.024 W/(m·K) for polyurethane to 0.05 W/(m·K) for mineral wool.  Therefore, they can achieve different U-values depending on the core and the thickness of the panel. 
* The installation of a system with sandwich panels minimizes thermal bridges through the joints.

===Acoustic insulation===
* The assessed sound reduction measurement lies at approx. 25&amp;nbsp;dB for PU elements and at approx. 30&amp;nbsp;dB for MW elements.

===Mechanical properties===
* The space between the supports can be up to 11 m (walls), depending on the type of panel used. Normal applications have spaces between the supports that are approx. 3 m – 5 m. 
* The thickness of panels is from 40&amp;nbsp;mm up to more than 200&amp;nbsp;mm.
* The density of sandwich panels range from 10&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; up to 35&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, depending on the foam and metal thickness, decreasing time and effort in: transportation, handling and installation.
* All these geometric and material properties influence the global/local failure behavior of the sandwich panels under different loading conditions such as indentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282402200_Indentation_failure_of_circular_composite_sandwich_plates|title=Indentation failure of circular composite sandwich plates|publisher=Materials &amp; Design |accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259515942_Relative_performance_of_metal_and_polymeric_foam_sandwich_plates_under_low_velocity_impact|title=Relative performance of metal and polymeric foam sandwich plates under low velocity impact|publisher=International Journal of Impact Engineering|accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, fatigue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294425503_Long-term_life_prediction_of_woven_CFRP_laminates_under_three_point_flexural_fatigue|title=Long-term life prediction of woven CFRP laminates under three point flexural fatigue|publisher=Composites Part B Engineering|accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bending&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278395828_Failure_mode_maps_for_circular_composite_sandwich_plates_under_bending|title=Failure mode maps for circular composite sandwich plates under bending|publisher=International Journal of Mechanical Sciences|accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Fire behaviour ===
* Sandwich panels have different fire behaviours, resistance and reaction, depending on: the foam, the metal thickness, the coating, etc.  The user will need to choose between the different sandwich panel types, depending on the requirements.
* Research by the [[Association of British Insurers]] and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in the UK highlighted that "sandwich panels do not start a fire on their own, and where these systems have been implicated in fire spread, the fire has often started in high risk areas such as cooking areas, subsequently spreading as a result of poor fire risk management, prevention and containment measures”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bre.co.uk/filelibrary/rpts/sandwich/ABIsandwichPanels.pdf |title=Technical briefing: fire performance of sandwich panel systems |author=Association of British Insurers |date=May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is evidence that when sandwich panels are used to clad a building it can contribute to the rapid spread of fire up the outside of the building itself. As an architect put it, in choosing the core material for a sandwich panel “I only use the mineral wool ones because your gut tells you it is not right to wrap a building in plastic”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/15/experts-warned-government-against-cladding-material-used-on-grenfell |title=Experts warned government against cladding material used on Grenfell |author=The Guardian |date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Gordon Cooke, a leading fire safety consultant, reported that “the use of plastic foam cored sandwich panels [...] is difficult to justify when considering life safety”. He said the panels “can contribute to the severity and speed of fire development” and this has led to “massive fire losses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cookeonfire.com/pdfs/eurisolgreenreport.pdf |title=Sandwich panels for external cladding – fire safety issues and implications for the risk assessment process |author=Gordon M E Cooke| date=November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Design of a cavity between the cladding and the exterior wall of the building (or its sheath of insulation) is also significant: flames can occupy the cavity and be drawn upwards by convection, elongating to create secondary fires, and do so "regardless of the materials used to line the cavities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.probyn-miers.com/perspective/2016/02/fire-risks-from-external-cladding-panels-perspective-from-the-uk/ |title=Fire Risks From External Cladding Panels – A Perspective From The UK |date= January 2016 |author=Probyn Miers}} section 3.3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impermeability===
* The assembly system of sandwich panels helps create air and water-tight buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9166">[[File:Steady flight.png|thumb|Steady flight is defined as flight with no net acceleration. This means the forces of lift, thrust, drag and weight all cancel out and the plane is left to fly at a constant velocity whether this is level flight, a climb or a shallow dive.]]
'''Steady flight''', '''unaccelerated flight''', or '''equilibrium flight''' is a special case in [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|flight dynamics]] where the aircraft's linear and angular velocity are constant in a [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)#Reference frames|body-fixed reference frame]].{{sfn|McClamroch|2011|p=56}} Basic aircraft maneuvers such as level flight, climbs and descents, and coordinated turns can be modeled as steady flight maneuvers.{{sfn|McClamroch|2011|p=60}} Typical aircraft flight consists of a series of steady flight maneuvers connected by brief, accelerated transitions.{{sfn|McClamroch|2011|p=325}} Because of this, primary applications of steady flight models include aircraft design, assessment of aircraft performance, flight planning, and using steady flight states as the [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] conditions around which flight dynamics equations are expanded.

==Reference frames==

{{Further|Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)#Reference frames}}

Steady flight analysis uses three different reference frames to express the forces and moments acting on the aircraft. They are defined as:
* Earth frame (assumed inertial)
** Origin - arbitrary, fixed relative to the surface of the Earth
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of [[north]]
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of [[east]]
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive towards the center of the Earth
* Body frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' (longitudinal) axis - positive out the nose of the aircraft in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' (vertical) axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' (lateral) axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'',''z&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, positive determined by the [[right-hand rule]] (generally, positive out the right wing)
* Wind frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of the velocity vector of the aircraft relative to the air
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, positive determined by the right hand rule (generally, positive to the right)

The [[Euler angles]] linking these reference frames are:
* Earth frame to body frame: yaw angle ''ψ'', pitch angle ''θ'', and roll angle ''φ''
* Earth frame to wind frame: heading angle ''σ'', flight-path angle ''γ'', and bank angle ''μ''
* Wind frame to body frame: angle of sideslip ''β'', angle of attack ''α'' (in this transformation, the angle analogous to ''φ'' and ''μ'' is always zero)

== Force balance and the steady flight equations ==

The forces acting on an aircraft in flight are the [[weight]], [[aerodynamic force]], and [[thrust]].{{sfn|Etkin|2005|p=141}}  The weight is easiest to express in the Earth frame, where it has magnitude ''W'' and is in the +''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction, towards the center of the Earth. The weight is assumed to be constant over time and constant with altitude.

Expressing the aerodynamic force in the [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)#Reference frames|wind frame]], it has a drag component with magnitude ''D'' opposite the velocity vector in the −''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction, a side force component with magnitude ''C'' in the +''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction, and a lift component with magnitude ''L'' in the −''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction.

In general, the thrust can have components along each body frame axis. For fixed wing aircraft with engines or propellers fixed relative to the fuselage, thrust is usually closely aligned with the +''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction. Other types of aircraft, such as [[rocket]]s and airplanes that use [[thrust vectoring]], can have significant components of thrust along the other body frame axes.{{sfn|Etkin|2005|p=141}} In this article, aircraft are assumed to have thrust with magnitude ''T'' and fixed direction +''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Steady flight is defined as flight where the aircraft's linear and angular velocity vectors are constant in a body-fixed reference frame such as the body frame or wind frame.{{sfn|McClamroch|2011|p=56}} In the Earth frame, the velocity may not be constant since the airplane may be turning, in which case the airplane has a [[centripetal acceleration]] (''V''cos(''γ''))&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''R'' in the ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''-''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' plane, where ''V'' is the magnitude of the true airspeed and ''R'' is the turn radius.

This equilibrium can be expressed along a variety of axes in a variety of reference frames. The traditional ''steady flight equations'' derive from expressing this force balance along three axes: the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-axis, the radial direction of the aircraft's turn in the ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''-''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' plane, and the axis perpendicular to ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' plane.{{sfn|McClamroch|2011|p=216}}

&lt;math&gt; T\cos{\alpha}\cos{\beta} - W\sin{\gamma} - D = 0 \quad (x_w \text{-axis}) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; C\cos{\mu} + L\sin{\mu} + T(\sin{\alpha}\sin{\mu} + \cos{\alpha}\cos{\mu}\sin{\beta}) = \frac{W}{g}\frac{(V\cos{\gamma})^2}{R} \quad (x_E\text{-}y_E\text{ plane radial direction}) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; W\cos{\gamma} + C\sin{\mu} - L\cos{\mu} - T\sin{\alpha}\cos{\mu} = 0 \quad (\text{axis perpendicular to }x_w\text{ in the }x_w\text{-}z_E\text{ plane}) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the [[standard gravity|standard acceleration due to gravity]].

These equations can be simplified with several assumptions that are typical of simple, fixed-wing flight. First, assume that the sideslip ''β'' is zero, or [[coordinated flight]]. Second, assume the side force ''C'' is zero. Third, assume that the angle of attack ''α'' is small enough that cos(''α'')≈1 and sin(''α'')≈''α'', which is typical since airplanes stall at high angles of attack. Similarly, assume that the flight-path angle ''γ'' is small enough that cos(''γ'')≈1 and sin(''γ'')≈''γ'', or equivalently that climbs and descents are at small angles relative to horizontal. Finally, assume that thrust is much smaller than lift, ''T''≪''L''. Under these assumptions, the equations above simplify to{{sfn|McClamroch|2011|p=216}}

&lt;math&gt; T = W\gamma + D &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; L\sin{\mu} = \frac{W}{g}\frac{V^2}{R} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; L\cos{\mu} = W &lt;/math&gt;

These equations show that the thrust must be sufficiently large to cancel drag and the longitudinal component of weight. They also show that the lift must be sufficiently large to support the aircraft weight and accelerate the aircraft through turns.

Dividing the second equation by the third equation and solving for ''R'' shows that the turn radius can be written in terms of the true airspeed and the bank angle,

&lt;math&gt; R = \frac{V^2}{g\tan{\mu}} &lt;/math&gt;

The constant angular velocity in the body frame leads to a balance of moments, as well. Most notably, the pitching moment being zero puts a constraint on the longitudinal motion of the aircraft that can be used to determine the elevator control input.

== Steady flight maneuvers ==

The most general maneuver described by the steady flight equations above is a steady climbing or descending coordinated turn. The trajectory the aircraft flies during this maneuver is a [[helix]] with ''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' as its axis and a circular projection on the ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''-''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' plane.{{sfn|McClamroch|2011|p=57}} Other steady flight maneuvers are special cases of this helical trajectory.
* Steady longitudinal climbs or descents (without turning): bank angle ''μ''=0
* Steady level turns: flight-path angle ''γ''=0
* Steady level longitudinal flight, also known as "flying straight and level": bank angle ''μ''=0 and flight-path angle ''γ''=0
* Steady gliding descents, whether turning or longitudinal: thrust ''T''=0

The definition of steady flight also allows for other maneuvers that are steady only instantaneously if the control inputs are held constant. These include the steady roll, where there is a constant and non-zero roll rate, and the steady pull up, where there is a constant but non-zero pitch rate.

[[File:Single-cylinder T-head engine (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|Schematic single-cylinder T-head engine, from ''[[The Autocar]]'' of 1935]]
[[File:Rose car engine.jpg|thumb|Four-cylinder ''Rose'' car engine of 1902&lt;br&gt;Note the screwed plugs for access, above each valve]]

A '''T-head engine''' is an early type of [[internal combustion engine]] that became obsolete after [[World War I]].
It is a [[sidevalve engine]] that is distinguished from the much more common [[L-head]] by its placement of the valves.  The intake valves are on one side of the engine block and the exhaust valves on the other.  Seen from the end of the crankshaft, in cutaway view, the cylinder and combustion chamber resembles a T - hence the name "T-head".  An L-head has all valves at the same side.  

==Overview==
This was an early form of [[crossflow cylinder head]]. The design was very complex for its day, requiring separate camshafts to operate the intake and exhaust valves. This made the engine much more expensive to produce than a comparable L-head (flathead) engine. Additionally, it was also quite heavy and inefficient for its displacement, producing less horsepower than a [[Flathead engine|flathead]] or modern [[overhead valve]] engine of comparable displacement.

The reason for this design's popularity from the turn of the 20th century into the 1920s is due to the type of [[gasoline]] sold at the time, which ignited at a much lower temperature than modern motor fuels. If the gasoline vapor got too hot or was compressed too much it could explode before being lit by the spark plug, a condition known as [[engine knocking]] or [[engine knocking|detonation]]. Since detonation was-and still is-a primary cause of catastrophic engine failure, limiting both the temperature and compression of the extremely explosive gasoline vapor was critical for maximum engine reliability. 

The T-Head addressed both of these issues by putting the valves in open alcoves on opposite sides of the [[cylinder head]] and having cool water from the radiator enter the engine directly over the intake valves as an extra measure of safety. The heat transfer from the exhaust ports was thus minimized, and the extra volume of the open alcoves that housed the valves also lowered the effective [[compression ratio]] of the engine. Detonation was thus eliminated, and the relative inefficiency of the engine design was offset by the dramatic reliability gains achieved and the generally lower speeds of travel and racing common to the era. This superior reliability made the design a favorite racing engine in the earliest days of auto racing, when engine reliability arguably mattered more than maximum performance. As other engine designs improved in reliability thanks to the intense engine development done in [[World War I]], the T-head's inherent compromises in performance caused it to rapidly fall out of favor for racing applications.

==Obsolescence==
The T-head was rendered obsolete in the passenger car market by a combination of engine advances made in [[World War I]] and the introduction of effective anti-knock compounds such as [[tetraethyl lead]] in the early 1920s. When combined, these advances made [[flathead engine|flathead]] engines just as reliable as T-heads while also being more powerful, lighter, more fuel efficient, and cheaper to manufacture. 
The T-heads' incredible reliability did however keep them in service in heavy equipment, large trucks, and fire trucks until they were finally phased out of production in the 1950s.

==Examples==
This engine type was found on cars like [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] and [[Stutz Motor Company|Stutz]] and the last T-head engine in production for personal cars was manufactured by an American company, [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]].  The [[Pierce-Arrow]] company introduced a production four-valve per cylinder T-head motor (Dual Valve Six) in 1918, one of the few, perhaps the only, multi-valve valve-in-block type engines produced.  [[American LaFrance]] produced T-head engines for their fire engines until the 1950s, though they also built overhead-cam engines in the 1940s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">[[Image:Wine legs shadow.jpg|thumb|260px|Tears of wine show clearly in the shadow of this glass of 13.5% Caluso Passito dessert wine]]
The phenomenon called '''tears of wine''' is manifested as a ring of clear liquid, near the top of a glass of [[wine]], from which droplets continuously form and drop back into the wine.  It is most readily observed in a wine which has a high [[ethanol|alcohol]] content.  It is also referred to as '''wine legs''', "fingers", '''curtains''', or '''church windows'''.

==Cause==
The effect is a consequence of the fact that [[ethanol|alcohol]] has a lower [[surface tension]] than [[water]].  If alcohol is mixed with water inhomogeneously, a region with a lower concentration of alcohol will pull on the surrounding fluid more strongly than a region with a higher alcohol concentration. The result is that the liquid tends to flow away from regions with higher alcohol concentration.  This can be easily and strikingly demonstrated by spreading a thin film of water on a smooth surface and then allowing a drop of alcohol to fall on the center of the film.  The liquid will rush out of the region where the drop of alcohol fell.

Wine is mostly a mixture of alcohol and water, with dissolved sugars, acids, colourants and flavourants. Where the surface of the wine meets the side of the glass, [[capillary action]] makes the liquid climb the side of the glass. As it does so, both alcohol and water [[evaporation|evaporate]] from the rising film, but the alcohol evaporates faster, due to its higher [[vapor pressure]].  The resulting decrease in the concentration of alcohol causes the surface tension of the liquid to increase, and this causes more liquid to be drawn up from the bulk of the wine, which has a lower surface tension because of its higher alcohol content. The wine moves up the side of the glass and forms droplets that fall back under their own weight.

The phenomenon was first correctly explained by physicist [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]],&lt;ref&gt;James Thomson (1855) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA330 "On certain curious motions observable on the surfaces of wine and other alcoholic liquours,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', '''10''' : 330-333.&lt;/ref&gt; the elder brother of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], in 1855.  It is an instance of what is today called the [[Marangoni effect]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Marangoni]], "Sull' espansione delle gocce di un liquido gallegianti sulla superficie di altro liquido" (On the expansion of a drop of liquid floating in the surface of another liquid) (Pavia, Italy:  Tipographia dei fratelli Fusi, 1865).&lt;/ref&gt; (or the Gibbs-Marangoni effect): the flow of liquid caused by surface tension gradients.

The effect can be used to move water droplets around in technical applications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/science/tiny-internal-tornadoes-bring-drops-to-life.html N.Y. Times, "Tiny Internal Tornadoes Bring Drops to Life"]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes claimed incorrectly that wine with "lots of legs" is sweeter or of a better quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kitchensavvy.typepad.com/journal/2004/12/wine_legs.html|title=Wine 'Legs'|publisher=KitchenSavvy|date=2004-12-04|accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact the intensity of this phenomenon depends only on alcohol content, and it can be eliminated completely by covering the wine glass (which stops the evaporation of the alcohol). British physicist [[C. V. Boys]] argues&lt;ref&gt;C.V. Boys, ''Soap Bubbles: Their Colours and Forces Which Mould Them'', 2nd ed., Ch. 2, (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Bible|biblical]] injunction, "Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright", ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 23:31) refers to this effect.  Since the "tears of wine" are most noticeable in wine which has a high alcohol content, the author may be suggesting this as a way to identify wines that should be avoided in the interest of sobriety.

==Related phenomena==

Other fluid phenomena that arise in alcohol-water mixtures are ''beading'' and ''[[viscimetry]]''. These are more pronounced in liquor than in wine, and both phenomena are more pronounced in stronger liquor.

Beading refers to the formation of stable bubbles when liquor is shaken. This occurs only in liquor that contains more than 46% alcohol. It is an example of the [[Marangoni effect]]. Shaking a whisky bottle to form bubbles is referred to as “beating [beading] the whisky”.

Viscimetry is the formation of whorls when water is added to a high-alcohol mixture.

'''Theft of electricity''' is the criminal practice of stealing [[electrical power]]. It is a crime and is punishable by fines and/or [[incarceration]]. It belongs to the [[Losses in electrical systems|non-technical losses]].

According to the annual ''Emerging Markets Smart Grid: Outlook 2015'' study by the Northeast Group, LLC, the world loses US$89.3 billion annually to electricity theft. The highest losses were in [[India]] ($16.2 billion), followed by [[Brazil]] ($10.5 billion) and [[Russia]] ($5.1 billion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/world-loses-893-billion-to-electricity-theft-annually-587-billion-in-emerging-markets-300006515.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

President of Northeast Group [[Ben Gardner]] stated : "India loses more money to theft than any other country in the world. The state of [[Maharashtra]]—which includes [[Mumbai]]—alone loses $2.8 billion per year, more than all but eight countries in the world. Nationally, total transmission and distribution losses approach 23% and some states' losses exceed 50%."&lt;ref&gt;http://tdworld.com/smart-grid/india-spend-216-billion-smart-grid-infrastructure-2025&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
There are various types of electrical power theft, including Tapping a line or bypassing the [[energy meter]]. According to a study {{cn|date=January 2016}}, 80% of worldwide theft occurs in private dwellings and 20% on commercial and industrial premises. The various types of electrical power theft include:

=== Direct hooking from line ===
What's known as "Cable Hooking" is the most used method. 80% of global power theft is by direct tapping from the line. The consumer taps into a power line from a point ahead of the [[energy meter]]. This [[energy]] consumption is unmeasured and procured with or without switches. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Bypassing the energy meter ===
In this method, the input terminal and output terminal of the energy meter is short-circuited, preventing the energy from registration in the energy meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Theft|last=Sreenivasan|first=|publisher=PHI Learning[P]Ltd|year=2017|isbn=9788120352810|location=NewDelhi|pages=87-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Injecting foreign element into the energy meter ===

Meters are manipulated via a remote by installing a circuit inside the meter so that the meter can be slowed down at any time. This kind of modification can evade external inspection attempts because the meter is always correct unless the remote is turned on.

=== Physical obstruction ===

This type of tampering is done to [[electromechanical]] meters with a rotating element. Foreign material is placed inside the meter to obstruct the free movement of the disc. A slower rotating disk signals less energy consumption.

=== ESD attack on electronic meter ===

This type of tampering is done on electronic meter to make it either latent damage or permanent damage. Detection can be done correctly in high end meters only.

== Detection ==

A number of approaches to detect electricity theft have been proposed. The predominant direction in research and development is employing [[artificial intelligence]], and in particular [[machine learning|machine learning methods]], to detect customers that steal electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glauner |first1=P. |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=The Challenge of Non-Technical Loss Detection using Artificial Intelligence: A Survey |url= |journal=International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=760-775 |doi=10.2991/ijcis.2017.10.1.51|arxiv=1606.00626 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

''[[Katiyabaaz]]'' (Powerless), a 2014 Indian [[documentary film]], dealt with issue of power theft in the city of [[Kanpur]], Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Katiyabaaz': A documentary maker challenges mainstream space | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Katiyabaaz-A-documentary-maker-challenges-mainstream-space/articleshow/40768405.cms |date= Aug 23, 2014| accessdate = 2014-08-30 | publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

On March 27, 1886 it was reported that electricity espionage was accomplished by unscrupulous persons tapping into Edison Electricity in New York.  The Superintendent of the power station sent a power surge into the line to burn out or destroy foreign objects trespassing on the line. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = People Who Steal Edison's Electricity | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86075021/1886-03-27/ed-1/seq-2/print/image_681x648_from_493%2C4711_to_2380%2C6508/#Cite_Brian_Cohen |date= March 27, 1886| accessdate = 2016-07-09 | publisher = Daily Yellowstone journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Sulfonium compounds can be synthesised by treating a suitable [[alkyl halide]] with a [[thioether]]. For example, the reaction of [[dimethyl sulfide]] with [[iodomethane]] yields trimethylsulfonium iodide:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–S–CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–I → (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SI

==Related==
An extra oxygen atom can bond to the sulfur atom to yield the [[trimethylsulfoxonium]] ion.

==Use==
[[Glyphosate]] herbicide is often supplied as a trimethylsulfonium salt.
When mixed with [[aluminium bromide]], or [[aluminium chloride]] or even [[hydrogen bromide]], trimethylsulfonium bromide forms an [[ionic liquid]], which melts at temperatures below standard conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=M.|last2=Johnson|first2=K.E.|title=Some physicochemical characteristics of molten salts derived from trimethylsulfonium bromide|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry|date=April 1995|volume=73|issue=4|pages=593–598|doi=10.1139/v95-076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2073">'''Tub''' was a unit of capacity or of weight used in Britain and elsewhere.

==British unit for butter and cheese==
British laws for the sale of goods defined a tub of [[butter]] as a receptacle of a size which could contain 84 pounds of butter.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=William|title=The Magistrate's Pocket-book, Or, An Epitome of the Duties and Practice of a Justice of the Peace,|date=1825|publisher=C.

=== Definition ===

1 tub of butter or cheese = 84 pounds&lt;ref name=robinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=crabb /&gt;

=== Conversion ===

1 tub = 1.5 Firkin (1 Firkin = 56 lbs)&lt;ref name=robinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=crabb /&gt;

===Metric equivalent ===
1 tub = {{convert|84|lb|kg|disp=out}}

==Other commodities==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has quotations illustrating other values of a "tub" as a unit:&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/207129|accessdate=9 April 2015|chapter=Tub, n1, 1, d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tea]] (1706): "about 60 pounds"
*"Camphire" (1706): "from 56 to 86 pounds"
*[[Vermilion]] (1706): "3 to 4 hundred weight" (i.e. 336-448 pounds)
*[[Camphor]] (1858): "130 Dutch lbs"

In [[Newfoundland]], Canada, a tub of [[coal]] was defined as 100 pounds, while a tub of [[herring]]s was 16 Imperial gallons and a tub of [[salt]] was 18 Imperial gallons.&lt;ref name=rowlett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rowlett|first1=Russ|title=How Many?

'''Wonthaggi wind farm''' is a [[wind power]] station at [[Wonthaggi, Victoria|Wonthaggi]] in [[Gippsland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. It has six [[wind turbines]], with a total generating capacity of 12 [[Megawatt|MW]] of [[electricity]].

==Technical Details==
Each of the turbines is a German made [[REpower Systems|REpower]] MM82 turbines, each sitting on an Australian made 66m tall tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keppelprince.com/default.asp?id=1,8,0,36 |title=Keppel Prince - REpower: Wonthaggi Wind Farm |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm is operated by [[Origin Energy]] Australia, and became operational in December 2005.

==Blade Snapping Incident==
In March 2012 one of the rotor blades snapped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Worries at Victorian wind farm after rotor blade snaps|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/worries-at-victorian-wind-farm-after-rotor-blade-snaps/story-e6frg6nf-1226308666686|accessdate=19 January 2015|newspaper=The Australian|date=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senvion]] (formerly [[REpower Systems|REpower]]), the manufacturers of the turbine, replaced the blades and blamed the issue on a manufacturing fault.
