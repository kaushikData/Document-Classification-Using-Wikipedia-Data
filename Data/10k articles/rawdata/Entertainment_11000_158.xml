The '''''11Eleven Project''''' is a [[documentary film]] created by Danielle Lauren. The film features [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] video footage, audio and images taken on 11 November 2011. The film premiered worldwide on 11 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://screen-space.squarespace.com/features/2012/11/5/around-the-world-in-one-day-the-11eleven-project.html SCREEN-SPACE. 5 November 2012. Retrieved 14 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Creative Director, Danielle Lauren, was inspired to initiate this project after watching documentary films ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' and ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' back-to-back in Perth in 2000. She wrote her idea down as ‘A Day in The Life of The World Told by The People of Earth’ after contemplating the idea of capturing various events happening at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbs.com.au/films/movie-news/898881/the-11eleven-project-danielle-lauren-interview SBS.com.au. 6 November 2012. Retrieved 14 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren did not pursue the project until 11 years later, when the technology required to make it possible was prevalent in society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gingerchai.com/2011/11/02/11-eleven-project-capturing-humanity/ 11Eleven Project: Capturing Humanity. Ginger Chai. 2 November 2012. Retrieved 15 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauren has listed four main objectives in achieving the ''11Eleven Project''; to unite the world on a memorable date, to create a time capsule of the world at a stage in time, to reveal the similarities that exist amongst people worldwide, and to raise money and awareness to charities supporting the [[Millennium Development Goals|United Nations Millennium Development Goals.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://inspiringtravellers.com/2011/01/04/world-day-danielle-lauren-11eleven-project-2/ InspiringTravellers.com 4 January 2011. Retrieved 14 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lauren has also mentioned in a statement that "11/11 is [[Remembrance Day]] and Armistice globally. In most of the major religions and philosophies, the number 11 is also considered a very spiritual number."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/project-11eleven-a-day-in-the-life-of-the-world/story-e6frg8n6-1225985222799 The Australian. 11 January 2011.

'''''ABBA: The Movie''''' is a 1977 [[documentary film]] about the Swedish pop group [[ABBA]]'s Australian tour. It was directed by [[Lasse Hallström]], who directed most of the group's videos. The film has become a [[cult film]] among ABBA fans. Its release coincided with the release of ''[[ABBA: The Album]]'', the group's fifth studio album, and features many songs from that album as well as many of their earlier hits, and one, "Get on the Carousel", unavailable anywhere else.

==Plot==
The film has a very thin plot which is no more than a vehicle to link together the concert footage.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It concerns the adventures of Ashley Wallace ([[Robert Hughes (Australian actor)|Robert Hughes]]), a naïve DJ on Radio 2TW, who normally presents a through-the-night country and western-themed show. In spite of this, he is sent by the station's boss (Bruce Barry) to get an in-depth interview ("Not an interview, a ''dialogue''", demands his boss) with the group, which is to be aired on the day ABBA leave [[Australia]]. Needless to say, Ashley, who has never done an interview before, singularly fails, mainly because he has forgotten to pack his [[press pass|press card]], although the fact that he is unable to buy a concert ticket doesn't help matters either. Armed with his trusty [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]], Ashley is forced to follow the group all over Australia, beginning in Sydney, and then travelling, in order, to Perth, Adelaide, and Melbourne, experiencing repeated run-ins with the group's very protective bodyguard ([[Tom Oliver]]), as well as his increasingly exasperated boss. Throughout the movie, we see Ashley interviewing members of the public, asking them if and why they like ABBA.  Almost all the comments are positive, but he interviews a man who is driven mad by his ABBA-obsessed twelve-year-old, and another girl who thinks ABBA are over the top.

Eventually, Ashley has an unbelievably lucky chance encounter with [[Stig Anderson]], the group's manager, in the foyer of ABBA's hotel, who agrees to arrange an interview, and gives him tickets to that evening's concert. But Ashley sleeps in and misses the appointed interview time. Just as Ashley has given up hope (by this time, he doesn't even care that his press card—which has been constantly forwarded by [[Australia Post]]—has finally arrived), a miracle occurs: he steps into an elevator and finds himself face-to-face with ABBA. They agree to give him an interview there and then, and he leaves Melbourne just in time to meet the deadline for the radio show to go out on-air. He puts together the final edit in the back of a taxi on the way back from the airport, as ABBA depart Australia for Europe. With only minutes to go, Ashley makes it back to the radio station where, having set the tape up on the studio's playback machine, he relaxes at his control desk to listen as the interview is broadcast.

* A brief snatch of "[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]" as well as "Dum Dum Diddle" is also heard while Ashley is stuck in a traffic jam; they are presumably coming from the radio of another car.
* "[[Ring Ring (song)|Ring Ring]]" is not performed by ABBA themselves in the film, but is sung by the members of a girls' ballet class Ashley speaks to for the interview while they are practicing their routines (ABBA's version can be heard in the background, which the children are singing along to).
* Other tracks heard in the film are "Johan på Snippen" (Johan Snippen) and "Polkan går" (Polka goes), both Swedish traditional songs being played by Benny Andersson on piano accordion, and "Stoned" (instrumental)&lt;!-- I think "Stoned" is an instrumental; please correct this if I'm wrong. Thank you. --~~~~ --&gt;.
* The [[Country music|country and western]] track that is heard playing when we see Ashley in the radio studio at the start of the film is an early 1970s Björn &amp; Benny song, "Please Change Your Mind", performed by Nashville Train. This song was also recorded by this Swedish country band (several of the musicians are from ABBAs own studio band) and released on their 'ABBA Our Way' in 1977.

==Production==
Hallström indicated that the film's script and plot concept was "conceived on the plane on the way to Australia". Initially, [[16 mm film]] was to be used but producers upgraded the project to [[35 mm film|35 mm]] [[Panavision]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/22/movies/at-the-movies.html?pagewanted=1 | title=At the Movies | first=Dave | last=Kehr | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=22 March 2002 | accessdate=9 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly filmed in Australia some additional scenes were filmed in ABBA's native Sweden (but still set in Australia)—noticeably different from Australia are the street signs and the traffic flowing on the [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Sweden|right-hand side]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090926202140/http://abbasite.com/articles/articles/abba-%E2%80%93-the-movie-on-dvd  ABBA: The Movie]  at Abbasite&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Margaret Geddes]] of Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' concluded that the film was "slick, competent and even for the non-convert entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Wv8QAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5189,6212452 |title=Abba film industry is bjorn |first=Margaret |last=Geddes |authorlink=Margaret Geddes |work=[[The Age]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |page=2 |date=24 December 1977 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''ABBA: The Movie'' was first released in December 1977. The film was also presented in several [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, including the Soviet Union where it was screened at two movie houses in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rferl.org/content/The_Biggest_Western_Pop_Stars_Behind_The_Iron_Curtain/1986337.html | title=The Biggest Western Pop Stars Behind The Iron Curtain | publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] | first=Nikola | last=Krastev | date=17 March 2010 | accessdate=26 November 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101128183843/http://www.rferl.org/content/The_Biggest_Western_Pop_Stars_Behind_The_Iron_Curtain/1986337.html| archivedate= 28 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Whistler''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in Blade II [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a [[vampire]] and the mentor of [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]. Screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] created him for the 1998 film ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (in which the part was played by [[Kris Kristofferson]]), but he first appeared on screen in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' where he was voiced by [[Malcolm McDowell]] and later by [[Oliver Muirhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 19, 2002|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0203/19/bladeindex.htm|title=Comics Continuum|publisher=Comics Continuum|accessdate=2011-01-08|archive-date=2012-07-23|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723143748/http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0203/19/bladeindex.htm|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Abraham Whistler appeared in the television show ''[[Blade: The Series]]''.

==Fictional character biography==

Abraham Whistler is a vampire hunter and the mentor of Blade. Abraham Whistler was once a happily married man with two daughters and a beautiful wife. He lived a normal life, and his family lived comfortably, but all of that changed one night when a drifter came, seeking dinner and place to rest for a while before continuing on his way. Whistler let the man in, only to regret that decision for the rest of his life. The drifter was a vampire, and a sadistic one at that. After torturing the family - mainly Whistler - for a while, he then tried to force Whistler to decide in which order his family would die. Whistler refused, struggling to stop the vampire from killing his wife and daughters. He was unable, and a few hours before dawn, the vampire left him with a damaged leg, other injuries, and the drained corpses of his family.

Whistler dedicated himself to hunting down vampires, learning about their ways and customs, and shut himself off from the world. A few years after his family's death, he went to a bar, got drunk, and ended up sleeping with one of the locals. The next morning, he explained to her that he was on the run from a powerful organization, and she would be in danger if they found out she'd been involved with him. He left her with a name and took her number and address, just in case he needed to get in touch with her should something happen. The one night stand had a big consequence: A daughter, whom Whistler learned about not long after her birth. He almost panicked, forcing his one-time lover and daughter to move somewhere else and change their names. He was determined not to lose this new family to the vampires. Certain they were safe, Whistler then left them to fend for themselves after giving them a substantial amount of money he'd earned from stealing from the vampires and their familiars. He checked in on his new family so often but kept them largely ignorant.

Several years later, Whistler met up with a young boy who he'd almost mistaken for a vampire - Eric Brooks, a half-vampire, half-human miracle. He took the Daywalker in, teaching him to use his powers and was able to create a serum to sate the bloodlust Eric suffered. The two of them became a team, Eric taking on the name Blade, and since then they have stayed together and fought the vampires as partners. In the recent years though, Whistler was diagnosed with lung cancer from his smoking, and he realized that without him, Blade would be alone. Determined Blade wouldn't have to fight the war on his own, Whistler secretly began forming a team of vampire hunters. Around the same time, Abigail Whistler showed up, having tracked down her father, determined to know who had left her and her mother alone while occasionally supporting them. Whistler reluctantly told her everything, only to have an even more determined girl on his hands - one that wanted to follow in his footsteps. Seeing it was useless to convince her otherwise, he put her on the team, thankful that she would at least have others with her and he would be able to check up on her.

Later, Whistler was nearly beaten to death by Deacon Frost's goons and shot himself in an attempt to prevent resurrecting as a vampire. His suicide was in vain, though. He came back, only to be kidnapped by the vampires working for Eli Damaskinos, who saw Whistler as a great advantage over the Daywalker and someone who could prove useful. Kept as a prisoner and tortured regularly, Whistler was eventually saved by Blade and given a cure for the vampirism. Whistler wasn't happy about the temporary alliance between Blade and the vampires, and he sensed something between Blade and Nyssa. He also resented Scud but went along with Blade's plan.

==''Spider-Man'' (1994 TV series)==
[[File:Abrahamwhistler_scrnsht_1994_s2e9.jpg|thumb|upright|Screenshot from ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.]]
Abraham Whistler's background in the animated series is the same as that in the films, although he appears younger and with a much more kempt appearance than the cinematic interpretation of the character. Whistler was a vampire hunter who took on a young Blade and trained him in martial arts and as a vampire hunter. Blade, who was half-vampire himself, was given a serum developed by Whistler that would stop him from craving human plasma. When Blade hunted [[Michael Morbius|Morbius the Living Vampire]], a young human student who was accidentally mutated into a vampire-like creature, Blade discovered the [[Neogenic Recombinator]], which could transform humans into vampires. Whistler told him not to destroy it, as it could also be used to cure Blade of his vampirism. Morbius was eventually driven into hibernation.

While Blade was hunting a vampire in Europe, Whistler was visited by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], who was looking for help to cure Morbius. Whistler told her that the only way he knew to cure him would be to destroy him and gave her a weapon to do so, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.

===''Blade''===
In the first Blade film it is revealed that Whistler lost his wife and two daughters to an attack by a vampire who had arrived at their home posing as a drifter. Whistler was beaten and tortured, being forced to choose which one of his family died first. These events shaped his hatred of vampires and his mission to destroy as many as he could. Whistler is a weapons expert and master of several martial arts, having a part in creating many of Blade's weapons. When he discovered a thirteen-year-old Blade on the streets preying on the homeless, he took him under his wing. Realizing that he was half human and lacked a vampire's normal weaknesses with the exception of their thirst, he developed a serum to suppress Blade's vampiric lust for blood.

Deacon Frost, an ambitious vampire whom Whistler and Blade had been tracking, located their base and attacked Whistler, causing him to be infected with vampirism. After informing Blade of Frost's plan to resurrect an ancient vampire god, Whistler then seemingly commits suicide, considering death a better fate than becoming a vampire. However, his death is not seen on camera; only the sound of a gun firing is heard.

===''Blade II''===
It is revealed in the [[Blade II|second ''Blade'' film]] that Whistler survived his suicide attempt to be kidnapped by another gang of vampires and taken to the Czech Republic. After killing all but one of the vampires responsible for his imprisonment, Blade frees him from [[suspended animation]], taking him to Prague and injecting him with the "cure". During his time with them, he was repeatedly tortured to the point of death, healed, and then tortured again.

Blade, Whistler, and Scud were summoned by the Shadow Council, ruled by overlord Eli Damaskinos, to eradicate the reaper threat. Reinhardt and Chupa (played by [[Matt Schulze]]), a friend of Priest who now wishes to kill Whistler to even the score with Blade, corner Whistler, and Chupa proceeds to savagely beat him. Reinhardt leaves the two. Whistler, to save himself, releases the reaper pheromones into the air. As Chupa is about to finish him off with a gun, reapers swarm the sewers and feed on Chupa, allowing Whistler to slip away. During his escape, Whistler is confronted by Jared Nomak, the original Reaper, who lets Whistler live to reveal the truth about the Reaper strain to Blade. When Blade and Whistler are captured by Damaskinos thanks to Scud's betrayal, Whistler manages to escape after Reinhardt underestimates him, rescuing the injured Blade and taking him to a vat of blood so that Blade can be restored to full health to stop Damaskinos's forces and Nomak.

===''Blade: Trinity''===
In the [[Blade: Trinity|third ''Blade'' film]], Blade is framed for the murder of several humans (who were in fact familiars being used as bait).  Blade, now in the public eye and wanted by the FBI, is hunted down.  In a raid on their new hideout, Whistler set the self-destruct mechanism and seemingly died in an explosion.  He is not seen or heard of afterwards (although [[Drake (Blade character)|Drake]] took the form of Whistler when he attacked the Nightstalkers).

Whistler fathered a daughter out of wedlock or before marriage.  This was Abigail Whistler, who eventually tracked down her natural father when she came of age, and asked to be trained as a vampire hunter.  Whistler trained her, although he trained her separately from Blade, who was totally unaware that Whistler had any protégés other than himself.  Whistler also set up Abigail as the leader of one of the many [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalker]] units he had secretly founded.  It is assumed that these units were set up because one man (or half-vampire) is not enough to destroy an entire species.  Also, since Blade is not immortal (he will eventually die from old age if he is not killed in action first), Whistler did not want the war to die with him.

==''Blade: The Series''==
In ''[[Blade: The Series]]'', which takes place after ''Blade: Trinity'', the writers go further into Whistler's background. In the episode "[[Sacrifice (Blade: The Series episode)|Sacrifice]]", viewers learn that Whistler got his trademark limp from a young Blade, who escaped his father's house and broke Whistler's leg in an attempt to flee. Blade's father called Whistler in at the urging of a helpful policeman, and Whistler tested him to learn that he was not a regular vampire. He asked Blade's father to give him the boy to use as a weapon against vampires, but Blade [[Runaway youth|ran away]] before a decision was made. After Blade joined and turned a [[street gang]] called the "Bad Bloods", Whistler found him and killed several members of the gang before taking Blade under his wing.

'''Binjamin Wilkomirski''', real name '''Bruno Dössekker''' (born '''Bruno Grosjean''' in 1941), is a musician and writer who constructed an identity as a [[Holocaust]] survivor. His fictional 1995 memoir, published in English as ''Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood'', was debunked by Swiss journalist and writer [[Daniel Ganzfried]] in August 1998. The subsequent disclosure of Wilkomirski's fabrications sparked heated debate in the German and English-speaking world. Many critics argued that ''Fragments'' no longer had any literary value. Swiss historian and anti-Semitism expert  [[Stefan Maechler]] later wrote, "Once the professed interrelationship between the first-person narrator, the death-camp story he narrates, and historical reality are proved palpably false, what was a masterpiece becomes kitsch."&lt;ref&gt;Maechler 2000, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
In 1995, Wilkomirski, a professional [[clarinet]]tist and instrument maker living in the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], published a memoir entitled ''Bruchstücke. Aus einer Kindheit  1939–1948'' (later published in English as ''Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood)''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the book, he described what he claimed were his experiences as a child survivor of the [[Holocaust]]. The supposed memories of [[World War II]] are presented in a fractured manner and using simple language from the point of view of the narrator, an overwhelmed, very young [[Jew]]ish child. His first memory is of a man being crushed by uniformed men against the wall of a house; the narrator is seemingly too young for a more precise recollection, but the reader is led to infer that this is his father. Later on, the narrator and his brother hide out in a farmhouse in [[Poland]] before being arrested and interned in two [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camps]], where he meets his dying mother for the last time. After his liberation from the death camps, he is brought to an orphanage in [[Kraków]] and, finally, to Switzerland where he lives for decades before being able to reconstruct his fragmented past.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===First publication===
First published in German in 1995 by the Jüdischer Verlag (part of the highly respected [[Suhrkamp Verlag]] publishing house), ''Bruchstücke'' was soon translated into nine languages; an English translation by [[Carol Brown Janeway]] with the title ''Fragments'' appeared in 1996, published by [[Schocken Books|Schocken]]. The book earned widespread critical admiration, most particularly in Switzerland and in the English-speaking countries, and won several awards, including the [[National Jewish Book Award]] in the United States, the [[Prix Memoire de la Shoah]] in France, and the ''[[Jewish Quarterly]]'' literary prize in Britain.&lt;ref name="Holocaust Denial: A Sequel"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/holocaust-denial-sequel Holocaust Denial: A Sequel]&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold well, but in contradiction to common belief it was not a bestseller. (Maechler, 2001a, pp.&amp;nbsp;111–28; Oels, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;376–79)

Wilkomirski was invited to participate in radio and television programs as a witness and expert, and was interviewed and videotaped by reputable archives. In his oral statements Wilkomirski elaborated on many aspects which remained unclear or unexplained. For example, he provided the names of the concentration camps in which he claimed to have been interned ([[Majdanek]] and [[Auschwitz]]), and added that he had been the victim of unbearable medical experiments. (Maechler, 2001a, pp.&amp;nbsp;22–83)

==Ganzfried's article==
{{BLP sources section|date=February 2016}}
In August 1998, a Swiss journalist and writer named [[Daniel Ganzfried]] questioned the veracity of ''Fragments'' in an article published in the Swiss newsweekly ''[[Weltwoche]]''. Ganzfried argued that Wilkomirski knew the concentration camps "only as a tourist", and that, far from being born in Latvia, he was actually born Bruno Grosjean, an illegitimate child of an unmarried mother named Yvonne Grosjean from [[Biel]] in Switzerland. The boy had been sent to an orphanage in [[Adelboden]], Switzerland, from which he was taken in by the Dössekkers, a wealthy and childless couple in [[Zurich]] who finally adopted him.

Wilkomirski became a [[cause célèbre]] in the English-speaking world, appearing on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and the [[BBC]] and in [[Granta]] and ''[[The New Yorker]]''. He insisted that he was an authentic Holocaust survivor who had been secretly switched as a young boy with Bruno Grosjean upon his arrival in Switzerland. His supporters condemned Ganzfried, who, however, presented further evidence to support his theory. Wilkomirski could not verify his claims, but Ganzfried was also unable to prove his arguments conclusively. (Maechler, 2001a, pp.&amp;nbsp;129–64; Eskin, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–53)

===Exposure===
In April 1999, Wilkomirski's literary agency commissioned the Zurich historian [[Stefan Maechler]] to investigate the accusations. The historian presented his findings to his client and to the nine publishers of ''Fragments'' in the autumn of that year. Maechler concluded that Ganzfried's allegations were correct, and that Wilkomirski's alleged autobiography was a fraud.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Maechler described in detail in his report how Grosjean-Wilkomirski had developed his fictional life story step by step and over decades. Most fascinating was his discovery that Wilkomirski's alleged experiences in German-occupied Poland closely corresponded with real events of his factual childhood in Switzerland, to the point that he suggested the author rewrote and reframed his own experience in a complex manner, turning the occurrences of his real life into that of a child surviving the Holocaust.

It remained unclear to Maechler whether Grosjean-Wilkomirski had done this deliberately or if the writer actually believed what he had written, but he was skeptical that the writer was a "cold, calculating crook", as Ganzfried assumed. (Maechler, 2001b, pp.&amp;nbsp;67–69) Amongst other things, Maechler revealed that a Holocaust survivor Wilkomirski claimed to have known in the camps, a woman named [[Laurel Rose Willson|Laura Grabowski]], had been earlier unearthed as a fraud, and had previously used the name Lauren Stratford to write about alleged [[satanic ritual abuse]] — a story which itself had been debunked nearly a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.org/satan/stratford.html|title=Satan's Sideshow: The True Lauren Stratford Story|last1=Passantino|first1=Bob|last2=Passantino|first2=Gretchen|last3=Trott|first3=Jon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002043633/http://www.answers.org/satan/stratford.html|archivedate=October 2, 2003|website=cornerstonemag.com|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maechler's first report was published in German in March 2000; the English edition appeared one year later (Maechler, 2001a) and included the original English translation of ''Fragments'' which had been withdrawn by the publisher after Maechler's report. Subsequently, the historian published two essays with additional findings and analysis (Maechler, 2001b, 2002), while Ganzfried (2002) published his own controversial version of the case (s. Oels, 2004; Maechler, 2002). Journalist Blake Eskin (2002) covered the affair. Prior to the exposure, Eskin wrote and told the story of Wilkomirski's trip to the US to become reunited with people he claimed to be distant family, of which Eskin was a part. This story was aired in act two of ''[[This American Life]]'' episode 82, "Haunted".&lt;ref&gt;[[This American Life]], Haunted 1997, [http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/82/haunted  Radio archives: episode 82.]&lt;/ref&gt;   The writer Elena Lappin published an extensive report in May 1999. She had become acquainted with Wilkomirski two years before, when the Jewish Quarterly awarded him its prize for nonfiction. At the time, she was editor of that English magazine. In the course of her research, she identified a number of contradictions in Wilkomirski's story and came to believe that ''Fragments'' was fiction. (Lappin 1999)

In addition, she reported that Wilkomirski's uncle, Max Grosjean, said that as children he and his sister Yvonne (Wilkomirski's biological mother) had been ''[[Verdingkinder]]'' (or "earning children")—in other words, that they had been part of the old Swiss institution of orphaned children working for families, with overtones of child slavery. Eskin's interest in Wilkomirski had its origins in genealogy: his family had ancestors in Riga and, initially, they believed that the author of ''Fragments'' could perhaps be a long-lost relative. In the same year (2002) the public prosecutor of the canton of Zurich announced that she found no evidence of criminal fraud. She added that a [[DNA test]] she had ordered had confirmed that Wilkomirski and Grosjean were the same person.&lt;ref&gt;''Neue Zürcher Zeitung'', 13 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The disclosure of Wilkomirski's fabrications altered the status of his book. Many critics argued that ''Fragments'' no longer had any literary value. “Once the professed interrelationship between the first-person narrator, the death-camp story he narrates, and historical reality are proved palpably false, what was a masterpiece becomes kitsch” (Maechler, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;281). But for a few scholars, even as a pseudomemoir, the merits of the work still remain. “Those merits reside in a ferocious vision, a powerful narrative, an accumulation of indelible images, and the unforgettable way in which a small child's voice is deployed in an unfeeling adult world, during the war and thereafter” (Zeitlin, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;177, see also Suleiman, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;170).

The Wilkomirski case was heatedly debated in Germany and in Switzerland as a textbook example of the contemporary treatment of the Holocaust and of the perils of using it for one's own causes. However, the affair transcends the specific context of the Holocaust (see e.g. Chambers, 2002; Gabriel, 2004; Langer, 2006; Maechler, 2001b; Oels, 2004; Suleiman, 2006; Wickman, 2007). Wilkomirski's case raises questions about the literary genre of [[autobiography]], the aesthetics of a literary work's reception, [[oral history]], witness testimony, [[memory]] research,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L. Schacter]], ''How the Mind Forgets and Remembers: The Seven Sins of Memory'', Houghton Mifflin 2001, {{ISBN|0-285-63683-9}}.  In considering the question "Is Wilkomirski simply a liar?" Schachter feels there is a possibility that some of his Wilkomirski's detailed recollections may have been a case of suggestion.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|trauma therapies]], and the like. The case is discussed in great detail by psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson as an interesting case of self-inflicted [[False memory|false memories]] (Tavris and Aronson, 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;82ff.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21856">'''[[Broadcasting]] in the [[Soviet Union]]''' was owned by the Soviet state, and was under its tight control and [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|Soviet censorship]]. Through the development of satellites and SECAM, controlled broadcasting was initialized as the main frequency for distributing information and entertainment. Under the control of the Soviet Union, censorship and limitation on information was filtered for the citizens to ensure the common culture and socialist ideals were maintained.

The USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting ({{Lang-ru|Государственный комитет СССР по телевидению и радиовещанию}}; abbreviated as Gosteleradio SSSR &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Lang-ru|Гостелерадио СССР}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or simply Gosteleradio &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Lang-ru|Гостелерадио}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), Soviet Union's governing body of broadcasting, was in charge both of [[Television in the Soviet Union|television networks]] and [[Radio in the Soviet Union|radio stations]]. During this time of political propaganda and war, controlling the large and spread out population meant censorship and lock downs on the freedoms of public speaking. Soviet Russia did not tolerate "a slip of the tongue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/stable/pdf/23488337.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:4ffe3b322d52eabf161fa90963e3c7a2|title=ASURITE Sign-In|website=www.jstor.org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting Problems==
Size, geography, time, and censorship attributed many issues to the development of broadcasting. The Soviet Union's ''size'' caused several problems to overcome. The first was ''geography''; the European area of the Soviet Union was typical East European. At its peak, almost 8,650,000 square miles of land mass belonged to the U.S.S.R.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union|title=Soviet Union {{!}} History, Leaders, Map, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then there were the mountains such as the [[Urals]]. There were also the taiga and steppes of the east and the north. Another problem was ''time''; the Soviet Union encompassed 11 different [[time zone]]s, and thus what would be shown at 18:00 in [[Moscow]] would be different from 18:00 in [[Bishkek|Frunze]], [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghizia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union|title=Soviet Union {{!}} History, Leaders, Map, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population too was unevenly spread out, the overwhelming majority being west of the Urals. In addition, the Soviet Union also relayed their programming to other [[Warsaw Pact]] states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://schoolshistory.org.uk/topics/world-history/cold-war-1945-1972/soviet-satellite-states/|title=Soviet Satellite States {{!}} Schoolshistory.org.uk|work=Schoolshistory.org.uk|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each population was then characterized by different economic and cultural elements. There was exclusively agricultural regions or industrial regions, needing their own satellite systems from broadcasting services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isj.org.uk/stalins-satellites-in-europe/|title=Stalin’s Satellites in Europe – International Socialism|website=isj.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Soviet television and Soviet radio required ingenuity to overcome the aforementioned problems as well as to transmit programming to the [[Eastern bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://schoolshistory.org.uk/topics/world-history/cold-war-1945-1972/soviet-satellite-states/|title=Soviet Satellite States {{!}} Schoolshistory.org.uk|work=Schoolshistory.org.uk|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
"With the entire apparatus of cultural and artistic practice under centralized control, and production across all media generated by one officially endorsed methodology, the Soviet leadership was in an ideal position to saturate the marketplace with their product. The nature of this product was complex and all-encompassing, and was marketed as a new form of civilization. In order for fundamental changes in behavior and massive transformation of the landscape to occur, the population had to be engaged and mobilized to adopt the ideology (and goals and vision) of the leadership as their own"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n2129/html/ch02.xhtml?referer=2129&amp;page=8|title=- The Personality Cult of Stalin in Soviet Posters, 1929–1953 - ANU|website=press-files.anu.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasting owned by the governing body ensured the right information and propaganda would be distributed in order to keep that vision intact.

==Soviet standards==
===Broadcast radio===
[[File:MathieuC shortwave.gif|thumb]]
Soviet domestic stations broadcast on [[shortwave]], [[medium wave|MW]], [[longwave|LW]] and [[Very high frequency|VHF]] wavebands, though the majority of stations were on medium and long wave. Neither the transmission sites nor the frequencies of domestic FM, MW, LW or SW stations were ever disclosed, thus leaving listeners having to memorize the frequencies.

===Television===
[[File:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.svg|thumb]]
[[File:Spectre SECAM NICAM.png|thumb]]
The Soviet Union used [[SECAM]] D ([[VHF]]) and K ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]) (also known as [[SÉCAM#SÉCAM varieties|CIS-SECAM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drhdmi.eu/dictionary/secam.html|title=SECAM|website=www.drhdmi.eu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union also used the OIRT VHF band (the "R" channels ranging from chs. R1 to R12) and the pan-European/African UHF band.

SECAM (Sequential Color with Memory) was initiated in 1956. Soviets involvement began with the [http://www.drhdmi.eu/dictionary/secam.html# NIR] which was covered by the Nautchno-Issledovatelski research institute. ''Non-linear''  in which a process analogous to gamma correction is used and ''SECAM IV'' that omits this process were the standards utilized initially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drhdmi.eu/dictionary/secam.html#|title=SECAM|website=www.drhdmi.eu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio services==

===Home services===
There were four national radio channels. The first was the ''[[All Union First Programme|All-Union First Programme]]''. It broadcast items of national interest along with local opt-out programmes in each of the Republics. The second channel was called ''Radio Mayak'' (''Radio Beacon'' in Russian) and was a music and speech entertainment channel intended to be the "beacon" of Soviet culture, similar to [[BBC Radio 2]] in the UK or [[Radio National]] in Australia. And the ''All-Union Third Programme'' carried the programme strands ''[[Radio Yunost]]'' and ''[[Radio Orfey]]''.

===External services===
Most people who have listened to shortwave are familiar with '''[[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]]''', the main Soviet shortwave radio station. However, that's only part of the picture. Soviet radio also had '''Radio Station Peace and Progress''', officially called the "Voice of Soviet Public Opinion". Most republics also had an external service, relayed by Radio Moscow's transmitters. Radio Moscow also relayed other radio stations from their satellite states, such as Radio [[Afghanistan]].

==Television services==


===National television channels===
Generally there were five channels (called "programmes" in the typical European fashion then).  The first channel (''1st Programme'') was the main channel.  It was also the most adaptable for the republics to utilize (see "Regional services" below).  Other channels were the ''All Union Programme'' (the second channel), the ''Moscow Programme'' (the third channel aimed mostly at Moscow),  the ''Fourth Programme'' (the fourth channel) and the "Leningrad Programme" (the 5th channel aimed at Leningrad viewers).

===Television programming===
[[Soap opera]]s and [[TV series]] of original cast were rare until the last decade; a notable example is ''[[Seventeen Moments of Spring]]'' which quickly became a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://delo.ua/lifestyle/radi-semnadcati-mgnovenij-vesny-lioznova-stala-tiranom-na-sem-165359/|title=Ради "Семнадцати мгновений весны" Лиознова стала тираном на съемочной площадке|website=delo.ua|language=ru|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the exploits of [[Stierlitz]], a Soviet super-spy in [[Nazi Germany]], who inspired many jokes (see [[Russian humour]]). However, in the later years quite a few of soap operas were brought in from the West ([[United States]], [[Brazil]], etc.), and a number of [[detective fiction|detective]] series were cast locally.

==== Soviet Programs ====
During this period, the state used programs, films, and animations to redraw its citizens to the Soviet culture and away from the western ideas that were brought home during the war. Short animations were introduced that negatively portrayed western culture ans reiterated the ideas of old Russia, such as [[The Stranger's Voice]], which aired in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=KristophShmit|title="Stranger's Voice" 1949 Soviet Cartoon|date=2017-03-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LginZRbSZs&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, this segment targeted American Jazz, comparing it to a magpie's call. Comparing jazz and a magpie's lack of musical ability meant there was no true art as there was in Soviet music, and that this American music was all for show with no actual talent required.

With the initial release of filming worldwide, exciting American movies had almost no competition, which citizens of all classes in the Soviet State flocked into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1924-2/socialist-cinema/|title=Socialist Cinema|date=2015-06-17|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, external influences began to shape the union. from its initial introduction, the Soviet take on films opposed western. In its creation, its prime focus was to maintain the socialist ideals and culture. In most of these cases the films encompassed these socialists values through fact-based films and documentary footage montage with exciting story lines and stunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1924-2/socialist-cinema/|title=Socialist Cinema|date=2015-06-17|work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional services==
[[File:Flag of Chechen-Ingush ASSR (1978-1991).svg|thumb|'''Chechen-Ingush ASSR''']]
In addition to the national radio and television channels, each SSR and ASSR had its own state radio and television company or state broadcasting committees, although other regions were allowed regional state broadcasting companies/committees.  Taking the [[Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] as an example, one would see that there was a lot of flexibility in the Soviet radio and television system.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Like other areas of the Soviet Union, the four national television channels, Radio Mayak, the All-Union First and Third Programmes, and (if equipped with appropriate transmitters) Radio Moscow would be broadcast by either a Television and Radio Company of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic or by a State Committee on Radio and Television Broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the First Programme (TV) and in the All-Union First Programme (radio), the Company/Committee was allowed to broadcast regional programming alongside the official First Programme/All-Union First Programme schedule. Depending on the political status of an administrative division, the Company/Committee would broadcast the regional programming in either [[Russian language|Russian]] or the local language.  In the Chechen-Ingush ASSR's case, the regional programmes would be broadcast in Russian, [[Chechen language|Chechen]], or [[Ingush language|Ingush]].

The Company/Committee would also broadcast additional channels for their coverage area only.  Such cases were usually a second programme, known by a special name, in the main language of the SSR/ASSR.  Other districts had their own local programming, and cities such as [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] had special programs, broadcasting only in the evening and on FM.

==Satellite services==
Aside from [[Canada]]'s [[Anik (satellite)|ANIK]] [[Satellite television|satellite system]] and the [[United States|U.S.]]'s satellite system, the Soviet Union had the largest [[Orbita (TV system)|domestic satellite system]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/05/archives/fcc-authorizes-domestic-satellites-for-western-union-western-union.html|title=F.C.C. Authorizes Domestic Satellites For Western Union|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=1973|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union [[time-shifting|time-shifted]] programmes in order to cover its 11 time zones. This involved several solutions to the Soviet Union's geography and time zone problems:

*"Schedule.  The national television channels were only on the air for part of the day.  This would make it easy for transmitting the channels throughout the country.  For instance, the Fourth Programme aired from 1300-1740 [[GMT]].  This would make it easy for the Fourth Programme to be aired by satellite.
*Time-shifting.  This is the heart of the programming aspect of the Soviet television system.  By time-shifting programmes, this allowed the Soviet Union and countries that relayed Soviet television (such as [[Warsaw Pact]] states) to broadcast programming in their own time zone."

===The timeshift grid===
There were two types of timeshifting in the Soviet Union.  The first was used by both the All-Union First Programme and the First Programme (TV).  For simplicity, this system is denoted as the "Radio/TV Orbita" system (named after the editions of these 1st programmes when they are time-shifted).  All other national television channels (the All-Union, Moscow, Fourth, Leningrad and Sixth Programmes), including Radio Mayak and the Third Programme, used the "Double program" composite time-shifting format.

====The Radio/TV Orbita system====
*Radio/TV Orbita-1 ([[UTC]] +11, +12, and +13 time zones or MSK +7, MSK +8, and MSK +9)
*Radio/TV Orbita-2 (UTC +9 and +10 time zones or MSK +6 and MSK +7)
*Radio/TV Orbita-3 (UTC +7 and +8 time zones or MSK +4 and MSK +5)
*Radio/TV Orbita-4 (UTC +5 and +6 time zones or MSK +2 and MSK +3)
*All-Union First Programme/First Programme (UTC +2, +3, and +4 time zones or MSK -1, MSK, and MSK +1)

====The "Double Program" system====
The "double program" system was the other system used for time-shifting programmes.  Like the "Radio/TV Orbita" system, identical content would be broadcast on the time-shifted versions, and, in the case of the Third Programme (radio), followed the same type of editions as the All-Union First Programme.  However, it was different in that, especially on TV, it was a composite time-shifting system.  This means that multiple services could be broadcast on the same edition and thus reduce the cost of broadcasting several different editions of the channels.

Editions of the Third Programme (radio):
*Third Double-1 (UTC +11 and +12 time zones)
*Third Double-2 (UTC +9 and +10 time zones)
*Third Double-3 (UTC +7 and +8 time zones)
*Third Double-4 (UTC +5 and +6 time zones)
*Third Programme (UTC +2, +3, and +4 time zones)

Composite editions of the All-Union, Moscow, and Fourth Programmes (TV):
*Double 2 (UTC +9 and +10 time zones)
*Double 3 (UTC +7 and +8 time zones)
*Double 4 (UTC +5 and +6 time zones)

===The satellites===
The Soviet Union set up the great space race that would lead to international technological, political, cultural, and scientific exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/|title=Sputnik|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet domestic satellite system was also known as [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]] - in 1990 there were 90 Orbita satellites, supplying programming to 900 main transmitters and over 4,000 relay stations.  The most famous Soviet satellites were the [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] satellites; other satellite groups were the [[Gorizont]], Ekran, and Stasionar satellites.  With the right equipment, people outside the Soviet Union who used [[TVRO]] satellite television could receive Soviet television programming.

Since the 1970s, Russia has implemented the newer ''geostationary orbit "Horizont"'' satellites utilized by the Russian Space Television system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.telesputnik.ru/english/review/russat.html|title=Telesputnik. Russian TV Satellites|website=old.telesputnik.ru|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; New satellites are released into orbit as older versions deteriorate and new technology becomes available. Operated by the State Enterprise ''"[[Russian Satellite Communications Company|Kosmicheskaya Svyaz]]"'' there was constant maintenance of satellites as well as revision, censorship, and management performed through this main facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irkutsk.com/radio/russia.htm|title=Broadcasting in Russia|website=www.irkutsk.com|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the Soviet Space program, in competition with the United States, pushed for newer advancements and technologies, leading to the Space race.

==ITAR-TASS Broadcasting==
The [[Soviet Union]]'s [[radio news]] and [[television news]] was provided almost entirely by the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]], commonly known as TASS until 1991. Under the rule of Emperor Nikolai II, the first broadcasting system began in 1904, and evolved into TASS in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic-eb-com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/levels/collegiate/article/ITAR-TASS/71363|title=ASURITE Sign-In|website=academic-eb-com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TASS still exists today, transformed into the  [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia]] (ITAR-TASS). It occupies a [[Joseph Stalin]]-era building in [[Moscow]], characterised by a [[bas-relief]] sculpture above the main entrance. However, much like its counterparts in cinema and the press, it has suffered since the break-up of Soviet Union. ITAR now broadcasts domestic news, while TASS reports the world news and events abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academic-eb-com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/levels/collegiate/article/ITAR-TASS/71363|title=ASURITE Sign-In|website=academic-eb-com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting post-Soviet Union==
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Soviet broadcasting landscape also changed.  Instead of one uniform system for radio and television broadcasting, there are now multiple systems, one for each country.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in the republics themselves.  Below is an incomplete list of the changes to the television system in the republics, in alphabetical order:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvmuseum.ru/|title=Музей телевидения и радио в интернете   - Главная страница|website=www.tvmuseum.ru|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''CFL Football '99''''' is a [[gridiron football]] [[video game]] developed by [[Victoria, British Columbia]]-based entrepreneur David Winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wintervalley.com/cfl_99/ | title=Official product information | publisher=''Wintervalley Software'' | accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an officially licensed product of the [[Canadian Football League]] and the Canadian Football League Players Association. The title is best known for being the only video game based on the CFL to date.

Designer David Winter originally specialized in administrative and industrial applications, doing business through his private firm Wintervalley Software. He obtained the rights to the CFL brand in 1998 and launched a new company, CDE (Canadian Digital Entertainment Inc.), for the purpose of marketing CFL Football '99. Part of the game's development was outsourced to American [[middleware]] provider Phantom Reality.

==Description==
CFL Football '99 was not a fast-paced, console-style title; rather, it was a simulation in the mold of [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]'s [[Front Page Sports Football]] franchise. Similar to the contemporary Front Page Sports Football, it mostly used 2D graphics.

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews

}}
Reception of the game was mixed. Casual players were disappointed as they were hoping for a more mainstream take on [[Canadian football]]. Simulation veterans were eager to recognize the game's potential, but most accepted the fact that it could not rival established names in the same subgenre.

==Follow-ups==
Winter started working on a second installment in his CFL series, this time using a 3D [[Game engine|graphics engine]]. But over the course of development, he decided to broaden the game's scope by putting the emphasis on customization instead of the CFL licence. Official CFL content was scrapped in favor of more options: the game allowed the player to pick his own ruleset and field size from various gridiron football codes. In 2001, the project was rechristened [[Maximum Football]] and it eventually secured U.S. distribution.

Maximum Football was released in 2006 after a protracted development cycle. In earlier press releases, the developer hinted that Maximum Football would kick-start a franchise of sports games with a common focus on flexibility and management, such as Maximum Hockey, Maximum Baseball, and Maximum Lacrosse. For logistic reasons, none of the planned spin-offs were released. However, Maximum Football 2.0 shipped in 2007 and maintains a dedicated fanbase. The game can still be played using Canadian football rules.

A 2012 Kotaku article revealed that a team of [[Electronic Arts]] developers had prototyped a CFL conversion of [[NCAA Football (series)|EA Sports NCAA Football]] for internal purposes. Despite talks between Canadian-born EA executive Cam Weber and then-CFL commissioner [[Mark Cohon]], the CFL mode never made it to any actual release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://kotaku.com/5916481/maddens-developers-built-a-working-canadian-football-game--but-dont-look-for-it-anytime-soon | title =Madden's Developers Built a Working Canadian Football Game—but Don't Look For It Anytime Soon | last =Good | first =Owen | date =June 7, 2012 | website =Kotaku.com | publisher =Gawker Media | access-date =December 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 it was announced &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://3downnation.com/2016/05/03/an-exclusive-look-at-canadian-football-17/ | title = CFL video game getting closer to reality}}&lt;/ref&gt; that work had begun on a console based game called ''[[Canadian Football 2017]]''. Development started in early December 2015 and is scheduled for release on the Xbox One in June 2017 with other platforms to follow. The game is being developed with the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] 5.5 game engine via Microsoft's Indiependent Development Program (which provides development kits and software licenses) and is supported by the Peterborough Innovation Cluster and Cube. The game will focus on Canadian rules football but its underlying design allows for quickly developing versions that use other rule sets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6274">[[File:Chinlone Burma cropped.jpg|thumb|Chinlone, Myanmar (2009)]]
'''Chinlone''' (Burmese: ခြင်းလုံး), also known as caneball, is the traditional, national [[sport]] of [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It is non-competitive, with typically six people playing together as one team. The ball used is normally made from handwoven [[rattan]], which sounds like a basket when hit. Similar to the game of [[Hacky sack|hacky-sack]], chinlone is played by individuals passing the ball between each other within a circle, without using their hands. However, in chinlone, the players are walking while passing the ball, with one player in the center of the circle. The point of the game is to keep the ball from hitting the ground, all the while passing it back and forth as creatively as possible. The sport of chinlone is played by men, women, and children, often together, interchangeably. Although very fast, chinlone is meant to be entertaining and fluid, as if it were more of a performance or dance.&lt;ref&gt;Dir. Hamilton, Greg (2006). ''Mystic Ball''. Film, Black Rice Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Men playing chinlone.jpg|thumb|One of the first photographs of men playing chinlone, taken around 1899]]
Chinlone has played a prominent role in Myanmar for about 1,500 years. Its style is so performance-based because it was first created as a means of entertaining Burmese royalty. Chinlone is heavily influenced by traditional Burmese [[martial arts]] and dance, another reason as to why so much importance is placed upon technique. As it is such an old game, many variations have been made to it, including hundreds of different ways or moves to use when maneuvering the ball. In addition to the original form of chinlone, there is a single performance style. This form of chinlone is called ''tapandaing''. While chinlone had been widely considered by Europeans to more of a game than a sport, international interest in chinlone grew rapidly. By 1911, chinlone teams were performing in parts of Europe and Asia. As spectators of chinlone, Europeans deemed it to be merely a game of indigenous people, too effeminate to be considered a sport.

After Myanmar's independence from British colonial rule in 1948, many British influences and cultural practices lingered, including British sports such as polo. Past British [[colonialism]] still weighed heavily upon Burmese life. From the 1960s and onward, there was a big governmental push for traditional and historical preservation. The premise was for cultural pride to be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Myanmar since ancient times, Traditions and transformations|last=Aung-Thwin|first=Michael &amp; Maitrii|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myanmar needed traditions that were unique to Burmese culture, free from any colonial influence. Chinlone fit this role perfectly, playing a key part in establishing Myanmar nationalism. Myanmar began implementing physical education in schools, teaching children from a young age about traditional sports like chinlone, as a way to educate and pride them on their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Towards a national culture: Chinlone and the construction of sport in post-colonial Myanmar, (Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media, Politics)|last=Aung-Thwin|first=Maitrii|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=1341–1352|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a small yet effective way in reestablishing Burmese life after colonial rule. With this new found [[nationalism]], chinlone was finally considered a real sport.

The head of the Burma Athletic Association, U Ah Yein, was ordered by Burmese government to write a rulebook for chinlone (1953). These rules forced chinlone into being more competitive, and the first official chinlone competition was held in [[Yangon]] that same year. In addition to providing chinlone with an official set of rules, U Ah Yein's chinlone rulebook claimed chinlone to be unique to Myanmar only, as the birthplace of the game. While chinlone does distinctively go back far into Burmese tradition, there are many similar sports closely related to it across many other [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. These ball games are as follows: [[da cau]] ([[Vietnam]]), kator ([[Laos]]), [[sepak_takraw|sepak raga]] ([[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and [[Indonesia]]), [[sipa]] ([[Philippines]]), and [[takraw]] ([[Thailand]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Sports Studies|last=Tomlinson|first=Alan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bodleian Ms. Burm. a. 5 fol 165.jpg|thumbnail|Watercolor painting of a chinlone game from the 19th century.]]

=== In the 2013 Southeast Asian Games ===
Another notable aspect of chinlone is its significance in the 2013 [[Southeast Asian Games]], hosted in [[Naypyidaw]], Myanmar. After 44 years since the last time Myanmar hosted the games, in 1969, the 2013 games was the perfect chance for Myanmar to show the rest of the region how much they progressed and modernized. While Naypyidaw was still lacking many amenities, with the help of funds from the Chinese government, Myanmar pulled off the highly anticipated event. The closing ceremony featured chinlone as the face of Burmese culture, and chinlone was even included as a separate sport within the competition. This was controversial, since other countries could not adequately compete in a sport that is unique to only Myanmar. By the end of the 2013 Southeast Asian Games, Myanmar had successfully showcased its new modernity, with chinlone at the forefront.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creak|first=Simon|year=2014|title=National Restoration, Regional Prestige: The Southeast Asian Games in Myanmar, 2013|url=|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=73|pages=857–877|via=|doi=10.1017/s0021911814001624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ciné film''' (sometimes ''Cine'', no acute accent) is the term commonly used in the [[UK]] to refer to the [[9.5 mm film|9.5&amp;nbsp;mm]], [[16 mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]], [[8 mm film|8&amp;nbsp;mm]] and [[Super 8 film|Super&amp;nbsp;8]] motion picture [[photographic film|film]] formats used for [[home movies]]. It is not normally used to refer to professional formats such as [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] or [[70 mm film|70&amp;nbsp;mm]] film, and is incorrect if applied to any [[video]] format. In the US, "movie film" is the common informal term for all formats and "motion picture film" the formal one.

''Cine film'' literally means "moving" film; deriving from the Greek "kine" for motion; it also has roots in the Anglo-French word ''[[cinematograph]]'', meaning ''moving picture''.

Although there had been earlier attempts, typically employing larger formats, the introduction of the 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 16&amp;nbsp;mm formats in the early 1920s finally succeeded in introducing the practice of showing rented "play-at-home" copies of professionally made films, which, in the case of feature-length films, were usually much shortened from the originals.

More significantly, these new cine film gauges were the first truly practical formats for making casual amateur "home movies" of vacation trips, family gatherings, and important events such as weddings. Amateur dramas and comedies were sometimes filmed, usually just for fun and without any aspiration to artistic merit. On occasion, professional filmmakers employed cine film for cost-saving reasons or to evoke a particular aesthetic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W79HRUVqw9MC|title=Visual Methods in Social Research|last=Banks|first=Marcus|date=2001-05-01|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761963646|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur 16&amp;nbsp;mm film-making was an expensive hobby limited to the affluent. The 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm format made more efficient use of film and was not quite so costly. The 8&amp;nbsp;mm format, introduced in 1932, consumed only one-quarter as much film as 16&amp;nbsp;mm and finally made home movies a reasonably affordable luxury for the many. Eventually, the 16&amp;nbsp;mm format came to be used mostly for commercial, educational and industrial purposes as a cost-cutting, compact alternative to 35&amp;nbsp;mm film that produced an acceptably sharp and bright image on smaller screens.

Cine film, being commonly available, was used to record scientific data, such as observations of animal behaviour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poole|first=Trevor B.|date=1974-07-01|title=Detailed analysis of fighting in polecats (Mustelidae) using ciné film|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1974.tb04121.x/abstract|journal=[[Journal of Zoology]]|language=en|volume=173|issue=3|pages=369–393|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1974.tb04121.x|issn=1469-7998|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nlg9I-jGccIC|title=Video Techniques in Animal Ecology and Behaviour|last=Wratten|first=Steve|date=1993-12-31|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780412466403|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human [[Gait (human)|gait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutherland|first=David H|title=The evolution of clinical gait analysis part l: kinesiological EMG|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S096663620100100X|journal=Gait &amp; Posture|volume=14|issue=1|pages=61–70|doi=10.1016/s0966-6362(01)00100-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as studies of [[fluid dynamics]], recording was done onto cine film at higher speeds than those used in home movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hernan|first=Miguel A.|last2=Jimenez|first2=Javier|date=1982|title=Computer analysis of a high-speed film of the plane turbulent mixing layer|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/computer-analysis-of-a-highspeed-film-of-the-plane-turbulent-mixing-layer/B37119F7331B25A5E1F820654D0E585C|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume=119|pages=323–345|doi=10.1017/s0022112082001372|issn=1469-7645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s, [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] home [[videocassette]] recorders were introduced. Color video cameras, previously beyond the financial reach of all but the richest amateurs, gradually became cheaper and smaller. Battery-powered [[camcorder]]s combined the recorder and the camera into one portable and increasingly compact and affordable unit. By the early 1980s an hour of blank videotape cost no more than a three-minute 50-foot roll of 8&amp;nbsp;mm film with processing. The writing was on the wall for cine film as a mass market item, though even in the early 2010s all the film formats mentioned above are still supported with new film stock and processing, albeit only from a very few specialist suppliers.

Since cine film is now an obsolete format, some companies offer a service whereby these films are converted to modern formats such as [[DVD]], and hobbyists have devised ways of performing the transfer with do-it-yourself equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/advice/8670347/How-do-I-convert-cine-film-to-digital-format.html|title=How do I convert cine film to digital format?|last=Maybury|first=Rick|date=2011-08-03|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=2018-01-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan]] as [[Adonis Creed|Adonis Johnson Creed]], [[Apollo Creed]]'s son, with [[Sylvester Stallone]] reprising the role of [[Rocky Balboa]]. It also features [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Tony Bellew]] and [[Graham McTavish]]. The film reunites Jordan with ''[[Fruitvale Station]]'' writer-director Coogler, as well as [[Wood Harris]], with whom Jordan had worked on ''[[The Wire]]''.

Filming began in [[Liverpool]] on January 19, 2015, and later also took place in [[Philadelphia]], Rocky's hometown. ''Creed'' was released in the United States on November 25, 2015, the 40th anniversary of the date of the opening scene in 1976's ''[[Rocky]]''. The seventh installment of the series and sequel to 2006's ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', the film received acclaim from critics, who called it the best ''Rocky'' film in many years, and was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2015#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2015]]. For his performance, Stallone was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], his first Oscar nomination since the original film. He also won the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor]], [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor|Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture]]. A sequel, titled ''[[Creed II]]'', was released in November 2018, directed by [[Steven Caple Jr.]]

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1998, [[Adonis Creed|Adonis "Donnie" Johnson]], the son of an extramarital lover of former heavyweight champion [[Apollo Creed]], is serving time in a [[Los Angeles]] youth detention center when Creed's widow, Mary Anne, visits and offers to take him in.
In 2015, Donnie resigns from the Smith Boardley Financial Group to pursue his dream of becoming a professional boxer. Mary Anne vehemently opposes his aspiration, remembering how her husband was killed in the ring by [[Ivan Drago]] [[Rocky IV|thirty years ago]].{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky IV]]''.}} Donnie auditions at Los Angeles' elite Delphi Boxing Academy, managed by family friend [[List of Rocky characters#Tony "Little Duke" Evers, Jr|Tony "Little Duke" Evers Jr.]], the son of Rocky's trainer [[Tony "Duke" Evers]], but is turned down. Undaunted, Donnie travels to [[Philadelphia]] in hopes of getting in touch with his father's old friend and rival, former heavyweight champion, [[Rocky Balboa]].

Donnie meets Rocky at Rocky's Italian restaurant, Adrian's, named in honor of his [[Adrian Pennino|deceased wife]], and asks Rocky to become his trainer. Rocky is reluctant to return to boxing, having already made a one-off comeback{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''.}} at a very advanced age despite having suffered brain trauma{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky V]]''.}} during his career as a fighter. However, he eventually agrees. Donnie asks him about the "secret third fight" between him and Apollo just after Apollo helped Rocky regain the heavyweight title,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky III]]''.}} and Rocky reveals that Apollo won. Donnie trains at the Front Street Gym, with several of Rocky's longtime friends as cornermen. He also finds a love interest in Bianca, an up-and-coming singer and songwriter.

Donnie, now known as "Hollywood Donnie", defeats a local fighter, and word gets out that he is Creed's illegitimate son. Rocky receives a call from the handlers of world light heavyweight champion "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, who is being forced into retirement by an impending prison term. He offers to make Donnie his final challenger—provided that he change his name to Adonis Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy. However, he eventually agrees.

While helping Donnie train, Rocky learns he has [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He is unwilling to undergo [[chemotherapy]], remembering that it was not enough to save Adrian when she had [[ovarian cancer]]. His diagnosis and the fact that his best friend and brother-in-law [[Paulie Pennino]]—Adrian's brother—has now died in addition to Adrian, Apollo, and his old trainer, [[Mickey Goldmill]], further force him to confront his own mortality. Seeing Rocky shaken, Donnie urges him to seek treatment.

Donnie fights Conlan at [[Goodison Park]] in Conlan's hometown of [[Liverpool]], and many parallels emerge between the bout that ensues and Apollo and Rocky's first fight{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky]]''.}} forty years earlier. First, before entering the ring, Donnie receives a present from Mary Anne — new American flag trunks similar to the ones Apollo and later Rocky wore. Additionally, to the surprise of nearly everyone, Donnie gives Conlan all he can handle. Conlan knocks Donnie down, but Donnie recovers to knock Conlan down for the first time in his career. Donnie goes the distance, but Conlan wins on a split decision (just as Apollo retained his title by split decision against Rocky). However, Donnie has won the respect of Conlan and the crowd; as [[Max Kellerman]] puts it while calling the fight for [[HBO Sports|HBO]], "Conlan won the fight, but Creed won the night." Conlan tells Donnie that he is the future of the [[Light heavyweight#Boxing|light heavyweight division]].

The film ends with Donnie and a frail but improving Rocky climbing the [[Rocky Steps|72 steps]] outside the entrance of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

===Music===
{{Main|Creed (soundtrack)}}

The [[film score|musical score]] for ''Creed'' was written by Swedish composer [[Ludwig Göransson]], who is only the third composer in the history of the ''Rocky'' series, following [[Bill Conti]] (''Rocky'', ''II'', ''III'', ''V'', and ''Balboa'') and [[Vince DiCola]] (''Rocky IV''). ''Creed'' also features a soundtrack that consists mostly of music new to the series, including [[hip hop music|hip hop]] tracks by artists such as [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Meek Mill]], and White Dave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future, Jhené Aiko, Meek Mill Appear on Newly Released "Creed" Soundtrack|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2015/11/20/future-jhene-aiko-meek-mill-appear-on-newly-released-creed-s.html|website=[[ABC News Radio]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=November 23, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123235440/http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2015/11/20/future-jhene-aiko-meek-mill-appear-on-newly-released-creed-s.html|archivedate=November 23, 2015|date=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both a score and a soundtrack album were released on November 20, 2015 by [[WaterTower Music]] and [[Atlantic Records]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creed (2015) – Song Credits|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/creed/|website=[[Soundtrack.Net]]|accessdate=November 24, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124180949/http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/creed/|archivedate=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One tribute to Conti's original soundtrack is included – the track "You're a Creed" uses both "Gonna Fly Now" and "Going the Distance".

''A.V. Wire''{{'}}s Herman Dhaliwal gave the film a very positive review, writing, "I will say the film was everything I could have ever wanted and then some. It's a film that could have gone so wrong in so many ways so easily, but the results show something that is genuine and inspired. It takes the smartest possible routes with the story it wants to tell and delivers in basically every way it needed to.

He also appreciated the performances of Stallone and Jordan, saying that Stallone deserved credit for taking a chance on young director Coogler, and that his trust had paid off. He concluded that the director "offered a smart, kinetic, exhilaratingly well-crafted piece of mainstream filmmaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barker|first1=Andrew|title=Film Review-Creed|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/creed-review-michael-b-jordan-1201640507/|accessdate=November 18, 2015|date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] reviewer John Lasser gave the film an 8.5 out of 10, saying, "''Creed'' is a mirror of Rocky's story and we have all been watching that unfold on the big screen for decades. Coogler's film does nothing to break the mold. Rather, it shows that the mold exists for a reason. Jordan delivers a knockout performance, and Stallone does as well. In the end, we can all only hope that we'll get to see Adonis on screen for just as long as we've seen Rocky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/21/creed-review|title=Creed Review – IGN|author=John Lasser|publisher=IGN|date=November 20, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
{{Main|Creed II}}
In January 2016, Sylvester Stallone and MGM CEO [[Gary Barber]] confirmed that a sequel to ''Creed'' was in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Setoodeh|first1=Ramin|title=Sylvester Stallone Says 'Creed' Sequel Could Reunite Rocky and Apollo (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/creed-sequel-sylvester-stallone-1201672298/|accessdate=January 5, 2016|publisher=Variety|date=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Stallone posed the possibility of seeing [[Milo Ventimiglia]] appear in the sequel, reprising his role as Rocky's son Robert Balboa from ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Roger|title=Oscar Favorite Sylvester Stallone Says "Creed II" Could Bring Back Rocky's Son|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2016/01/04/oscar-favorite-sylvester-stallone-says-creed-ii-could-bring-back-rockys-son|accessdate=September 28, 2017|publisher=Showbiz 411|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventimiglia previously revealed during the development of ''Creed'' that he was open to returning to the franchise, stating, "I'll tell you what, if they invited me, I'd love to be there. If they didn't, I wouldn't be offended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Topel|first1=Fred|title=Exclusive: Milo Ventimiglia Ready for Creed Comeback|url=http://www.craveonline.com/site/545137-exclusive-milo-ventimiglia-ready-for-creed-comeback|accessdate=September 28, 2017|publisher=Crave|date=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also that month, it was reported that the sequel's release was tentatively set for November 2017, although it was later pushed back to an unconfirmed date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Creed 2 Gets a Tentative November 2017 Release Date| work= comingsoon.net | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/646467-creed-2-gets-a-tentative-november-2017-release-date#/slide/1 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Creed 2' Aims to Bring Rocky Back in 2017| work=movieweb.com | url=http://movieweb.com/creed-2-release-date-november-2017/ |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Creed 2' Could Hit Theaters In November 2017, Might Lose Director Ryan Coogler | work=collider.com | url=http://collider.com/creed-2-release-date-ryan-coogler/ |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title='Creed' Sequel Aims for November 2017 Release (EXCLUSIVE) | work=variety.com | url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/creed-sequel-release-date-1201677171/|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development was seemingly delayed by the announcement Coogler had cast Michael B. Jordan in his next film, Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', thus delaying production until both men's schedules permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Michael B.

The '''Cuban National Ballet School''' ''(Escuela Nacional Cubana de Ballet)'' in [[Havana]], with approximately 3,000 students&lt;ref name=Rainsford/&gt; is the biggest ballet school in the world and the most prestigious [[ballet]] school in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sp icon}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html La Escuela Nacional de Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=2009-06-23 }} - La Escuela desarrolla una experiencia única en el mundo, enmarcada en la Batalla de Ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is directed by Ramona de Sáa.

==History==

The school dates back to the Ballet School of the Sociedad Pro-Arte Musical de La Habana, founded in 1931, where the [[prima ballerina assoluta]], [[Alicia Alonso]] her former husband [[Fernando Alonso (dancer)|Fernando Alonso]] and his brother [[Alberto Alonso|Alberto]] received their earliest ballet classes.  In 1961, state-sponsored education began with the creation of the [[Alejo Carpentier]] Provincial School of Ballet (''Escuela Nacional de Ballet Alejo Carpentier'').  The following year, the National School of Ballet was created as part of the National School of Art.  The fundamental characteristic of this teaching institution is in its formation, sustained in the methodology of the Cuban school of ballet. Like all the Cuban educational systems, the education of the ballet in the country is free.&lt;ref name=Rainsford/&gt;

===Expansion===
The school was able to accommodate 900 students until the president [[Fidel Castro]], who, in a visit to the school, suggested the idea of new studio space. After some proposals, he decided to raise the number of students from 900 to more than 4,000 children and adolescents. Director of the school, Ramona de Sáa recalls: "''quickly we started doing the study: how many students per classroom, how many professors... and in a few days we were delivering the project to the president for the new social order of the school."''&lt;ref&gt;{{sp icon}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html Bohemia Digital] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the expansion allowed the program to begin the work to select 4,050 students out of the 52,000 that were interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{sp icon}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html Escuela Nacional de Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=2009-06-23 }} -  entre 52 mil alumnos interesados, los cuatro mil 50 que integrarían los talleres.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professionals from the ''National Ballet of Cuba'', the ''Superior Institute of Art'' and the ''Elementary School of Ballet'' divided into 35 teams to select the students that would attend the school.

==Graduates==
Many of the school's alumni are eminent professionals, recognized in Cuba and internationally. Most of them form part of the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba|National Ballet of Cuba]], one of the most important companies of the world.  Some are given permission to join, or defect to, foreign ballet companies,&lt;ref name=Rainsford/&gt; primarily [[United States|American]].

'''''Dead Space''''' is a {{vgy|2011}} science fiction [[survival horror]] [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by Australian company IronMonkey Studios and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for [[iOS]], [[BlackBerry Tablet OS]], [[Xperia Play]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[BlackBerry 10]] devices. The game was also scheduled for release on [[Windows Phone 8]] as part of a deal with [[Nokia]] that saw several EA games released exclusively on Nokia branded Windows Phones, but it was cancelled prior to release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpcentral.com/comment/534868#comment-534868|title=Nokia Exclusive: Electronic Arts confirms Tetris Blitz for Xbox on Windows Phone 8|publisher=Windows Phone Central|last=Acevedo|first=Paul|date=September 5, 2013|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Dead Space (series)|''Dead Space'' series]], the game is set after the events of the original ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', but prior to the events of ''[[Dead Space 2]]'' and shows how the Necromorph outbreak spread from the government to public sectors.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dead Space (mobile) gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A necromorph attacks Vandal. Note the touchscreen specific control method whereby the play must swipe down and to the right to fight back.]]
The gameplay is similar to that of the original ''Dead Space'' game, with most changes centering on adapting the game to play with [[touchscreen]] controls. Players slide their thumbs on either side of the screen to simulate the [[Analog stick#Dual analog sticks|dual analog]] movement scheme of the original; movement on the left of the screen moves the character, movement on the right moves the camera. Players tilt the device to rotate the weapon's alignment. Players can move and explore freely, interact with objects, collect items and currency, and buy upgrades in much the same fashion as the original game. To reload, the player taps the weapon, and contextual swipes upwards or downwards are occasionally necessary.&lt;ref name="Destructoid" /&gt; To fire, the player taps the screen to aim, and taps the screen again to shoot.&lt;ref name="AppSpy" /&gt;

The [[Xperia Play]] version has slightly different controls insofar as it utilizes the slide-out game pad, complete with "touch-pad" controls, with the left and right triggers used for aiming and firing respectively.

==Plot==
In ''Dead Space'', the player controls a figure code-named Vandal, a newly converted Unitologist, on a mission in the mines of Titan Station, orbiting [[Saturn]]. Vandal is directed over a headset to destroy a series of power boxes, thus cutting off communications to certain parts of the station. After doing so, however, Vandal is attacked by a group of Necromorphs and forced to flee towards a tram system. On the way there, the head of Unitology, Daina Le Guin, tells Vandal that destroying the power boxes has released a Necromorph infestation onto the station and that Vandal's death, and the deaths of all the miners, will be a glorious event. Disgusted, Vandal decides to reveal the Unitologists' plans to the government, as they are quite clearly insane. Meanwhile, the station's director, Hans Tiedemann, contacts Vandal and orders the restoration of all quarantine seals. After doing so, Vandal is contacted by Tyler Radikov, a Unitologist contact, who swears that Le Guin duped him too, and that he had no idea what Vandal's real mission was. Radikov promises to guide Vandal in escaping.

Under the direction of Tiedemann and Radikov, Vandal sets out to lock down the doors to the Public Sector. Radikov says that in order to do so, Vandal must shut off the power to the seals, as this will trigger all emergency seals to engage. Vandal does so, but discovers that Radikov has been lying, and in fact has provided instructions that result in the opening of all Public Sector doors, leaving the section without any defense against the Necromorphs. A furious Tiedemann demands that Vandal try to shut down the core of the station, as it is overheating, and is in danger of destroying the entire station.

When Vandal reaches the core, it becomes apparent that a large Necromorph is "suffocating" it. Vandal defeats the creature, but falls into the core with it. A badly injured Vandal manages to crawl out of the core, at which point it is revealed that Vandal is a female, Karrie Norton. She tries to radio Director Tiedemann for help, leaving an audio log relating what has happened. The game ends with Radikov telling Le Guin that the Necromorph outbreak was a success. Back at the core, a trail of blood leads off-screen, with only Vandal's helmet remaining; her fate is unknown.{{efn|In ''Dead Space 2'', [[Isaac Clarke (Dead Space)|Isaac Clarke]] finds Vandal's last audio report floating next to the eviscerated remains of a human female, implying she died some time after emerging from the Core.}}

Upon release, ''Dead Space'' received very positive reviews. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 88 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on twenty-two reviews,&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/dead-space |title=Dead Space for iOS |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 91.67% on [[GameRankings]], based on six reviews.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/iphone/620197-dead-space/index.html|title=Dead Space (iOS) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game won "Best Mobile Game" (2011) at the Meffy Awards&lt;ref name="Meffy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theappwhisperer.com/2011/07/08/dead-space-wins-best-ios-game-at-2011-meffy-awards/|title=Dead Space Wins Best iOS Game At 2011 Meffy Awards |publisher=The App Whisperer|last=Carter|first=Joanne|date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "iPad Game of the Year" (2011) at the App Store Rewind.&lt;ref name="Rewind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toucharcade.com/2011/12/08/apples-app-store-rewind-2011-features-tiny-tower-and-dead-space-for-ipad-as-games-of-the-year/|title=

Reviews emphasized the extent to which the title replicated the look and feel of the ''Dead Space'' series within the limitations of a mobile touchscreen device, whilst also praising the fact that the game was a new story, not simply a port of the original ''Dead Space'' game.

AppSpy's Andrew Nesvadba was extremely impressed, scoring it 5 out of 5 and writing, "''Dead Space'' is a chilling experience that goes well beyond the normal expectations for mobile gaming."&lt;ref name="AppSpy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appspy.com/review/4806/dead-space|title=Dead Space Review|publisher=AppSpy|first=Andrew|last= Nesvadba|date= January 25, 2011|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TouchArcade's Brad Nicholson also scored it 5 out of 5. He was critical of the controls and the combat system, but concluded that "''Dead Space'' is worth a download based on its production values alone. The team has successfully created a very, very dark title bolstered by a rich atmosphere that oozes everything you want out of a solid horror game."&lt;ref name="TouchArcade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toucharcade.com/2011/01/24/dead-space-review/|title='Dead Space' iOS Review - A Fantastically Faithful iOS-Exclusive Installment in the 'Dead Space' Series|publisher=TouchArcade|first=Brad|last= Nicholson |date= January 24, 2011|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TouchGen's Matt Dunn also scored it 5 out of 5. He was slightly critical of the controls, but commented that "literally the only negative aspect of the game involves some control inaccuracy." He praised the sound design and graphics and concluded that "''Dead Space'' is the best action game I've ever played on an iOS device. It's the first time I've felt like a mobile version of a game has had as much developer love put into it as its console counterpart. We've seen decent ports, and good mobile counterparts to console games, but never a game that looks and feels this close to the original [...] This isn't a cash grab or a cheap port, this is a brand new ''Dead Space'' experience."&lt;ref name="TouchGen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchgen.net/dead-space-review|title=Dead Space Review|publisher=TouchGen|first=Matt|last=Dunn|date=January 25, 2011|accessdate=July 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605153715/http://www.touchgen.net/dead-space-review|archivedate=June 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake Grundman of 148Apps was equally impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out of 5, and writing "it is staggering to imagine that such a huge experience could be contained within the constraints of the [[iPhone]], but not only does it succeed, it sets a benchmark that could be nigh impossible to match any time soon," and referring to the control scheme as "shockingly well constructed." He concluded, "To say that ''Dead Space'' is one of the best games that we have seen in 2011 doesn't do it justice. This is one of the most immersive experiences available on the platform. You owe it to yourself to discover that an iOS game can in fact make you shudder in fear and want to jump out of your skin. It isn't merely a game, it is an experience that all iOS gamers should partake in."&lt;ref name="148Apps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/dead-space-review/ |title=Dead Space Review|publisher=148Apps|first=Blake|last= Grundman|date= January 25, 2011|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Levi Buchanan, scoring the game 8.5 out of 10, made a similar point; "''Dead Space'' is not a cop-out, shoehorned experience – it's a real-deal chapter in the ''Dead Space'' franchise that fits right in with the console games even though it takes a slightly different tack by de-emphasizing shock-jumps and laying on action scene after action scene. But that just means EA understands the differences (and, yes, limitations) of the [[iDevice]]s. ''Dead Space'' has good controls, great visuals, and a fun story. It may repeat itself a little too much, but the blood-soaked ride never feels bloated."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2011/01/25/dead-space-ipad-review|title=Dead Space iOS Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Levi|last=Buchanan|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Destructoid]]'s Jim Sterling scored the game 8 out of 10. Although he was somewhat critical of the controls, he was impressed with how genuine a ''Dead Space'' experience the game offered; "''Dead Space'' for the iDevices is no mere cash-in. Rather than go the easy route with an [[Shoot 'em up|on-rails shooter]] or a selection of banal minigames, Electronic Arts and IronMonkey Studios have instead opted to cram a genuine third-person ''Dead Space'' experience into your iPhone. The weird thing is it more or less ''works'' [...] it really is impressive just how authentic a ''Dead Space'' experience has been crafted, and the generally high caliber of the game could at least justify an [[Xbox Live Arcade|XBLA]]/[[PlayStation Network|PSN]] port."&lt;ref name="Destructoid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-dead-space-ios--193003.phtml |title=Review: Dead Space (iOS)|publisher=[[Destructoid]] |first=Jim|last= Sterling|date= February 1, 2011|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Kritan Reed also scored the game 8 out of 10, writing "This all-new ''Dead Space'' is surprisingly faithful to the full-fat versions in every sense. Before you recoil in horror at the thought of another borked touch-screen attempt at twin-stick action-adventuring, ''Dead Space'' is far more entertaining than it has any right to be. It not only captures the intricate, moody visual signature of [[Visceral Games|Visceral's]] originals with stunning efficiency, but manages to faithfully translate the gameplay."&lt;ref name="Euro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-01-31-mobile-games-roundup-review |title=Mobile Games Roundup|publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Kristan|last= Reed|date= January 31, 2011|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pocket Gamer]]'s Tracy Erickson also scored it 8 out of 10, giving it a "Silver Award". He was critical of the controls but concluded that "its presentation, well-constructed levels, and tense combat situations are enough to see you through, even if the controls won't."&lt;ref name="Pocket"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Dead+Space/review.asp?c=26911|title=Dead Space Review|publisher=[[Pocket Gamer]] |first=Tracy|last= Erickson |date= January 31, 2011|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Diamond Jubilee Concert''' was a British music concert and celebration held outside [[Buckingham Palace]] on [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] in [[London]] in 2012. The concert was organised by [[Take That]] singer-songwriter [[Gary Barlow]] and was part of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II's]] [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-02-07/paul-mccartney,-shirley-bassey-and-elton-john-to-play-queen's-diamond-jubilee-gig |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104103932/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-02-07/paul-mccartney,-shirley-bassey-and-elton-john-to-play-queen's-diamond-jubilee-gig |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2013 |title=Radio Times Feb 7, 2012 |publisher=Radiotimes.com |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital Spy Elton John 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a364357/elton-john-paul-mccartney-jessie-j-for-diamond-jubilee-concert.html |title=Digital Spy Elton John, Paul McCartney, Jessie J for Diamond Jubilee Concert |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3060799/Take-That-to-play-concert-for-the-Queen.html |title=That'll relight one’s fire|publisher=The Sun|date=20 July 2010|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9066449/Take-Thats-Gary-Barlow-promises-night-to-remember-at-Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-concert.html |title=Telegraph, Take That's Gary Barlow promises night to remember at Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diamond Jubilee Concert followed two concerts held at the palace for the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]] a decade earlier – the classical themed [[Prom at the Palace]] and the pop/rock themed [[Party at the Palace]].

The concert was partially attended by the Queen, who arrived at 9pm, but not by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] who had been taken to hospital with a [[Urinary tract infection|bladder infection]] earlier in the day.&lt;ref name=BBC_prince_philip /&gt; [[Prince Charles]] and other members of the royal family attended the whole concert.

== Organisation and ticketing ==
[[Gary Barlow]] and the [[BBC]] spent six months planning the concert and 10,000 free tickets for the concert were made available to the public, with applications possible, by post or online, between 7 February and 2 March 2012. After the application period closed, successful applicants were then drawn by random ballot.&lt;ref name=BBC_McCartney_to_play /&gt; A total of 1.2 million applications were eventually received, 240 for every available pair.&lt;ref name=BBC_240_applicants /&gt; Non-ticketed attendees could watch the concert on giant TV screens in the Mall and local Parks.  Estimates of these free attendees range from 250,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Jubilee Concert Buckingham Palace|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/04/diamond-jubilee-concert-buckingham-palace|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wynne Jones|first1=Ros|title="How will that be topped at the Platinum Jubilee?"

== Date, venue and stage ==

[[File:The Mall London.jpg|thumb|The concert was held at the end of [[The Mall, London|The Mall]], directly in front of [[Buckingham Palace]], where a special stage was built.]]

The concert took place on [[bank holiday]] Monday 4 June as part of the extended weekend celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee, which ran from 2 to 5 June.&lt;ref name=BBC_McCartney_to_play /&gt; The acts performed on a specially constructed stage, with a canopy, around the [[Victoria Memorial, London|Queen Victoria Memorial]],&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost-stage" /&gt; in front of the palace.&lt;ref name=BBC_240_applicants /&gt; The stage was designed by [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]].

== House band ==
The [[house band]], led by [[Mike Stevens (saxophonist)|Mike Stevens]], who was also the [[Music director|Musical Director]] of the concert, consisted largely of the [[Take That]]/[[Gary Barlow]] band, a few extra musicians and the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]]. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Elton John]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Paul McCartney]]&lt;ref name=BBC_McCartney_to_play /&gt; brought their own bands to the concert.

==Jubilee song==
[[Gary Barlow]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] wrote a song for the jubilee entitled ''[[Sing (Gary Barlow song)|Sing]]'' which was performed for the first time at the concert by a choir from many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. The song draws inspiration from the music and people of the Commonwealth. Its creation was the subject of a one-hour BBC documentary broadcast on 3 June 2012 by [[BBC One]].&lt;ref name=BBC_Webber_Barlow /&gt;

== Jubilee picnic ==
Concert ticket holders were given access to the palace gardens for an afternoon picnic before the main event. They were served cold hampers with a [[United Kingdom|British]] themed menu specially designed by [[Heston Blumenthal]] and the royal chef Mark Flanagan.&lt;ref name=BBC_Blumenthal /&gt;

'''Digital rhetoric''' is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through [[digital media]]. It is an advancing form of communication composed, created, and distributed through [[multimedia]] platforms. [[Rhetoric]] combines multiple methods such as [[persuasion]], effective writing, and effective speaking to present information in inventive ways.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, G. (n.d.). What is Rhetoric? Retrieved December 3, 2014, from [http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm What is Rhetoric?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm |date=2014-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of rhetoric has changed over time, developing with changes in technologies. Online media are increasingly used as communication and information platforms, and since more text is placed online, there is more opportunity for persuasion through innovative and creative means. Because of this shift in rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed in form, communication style, and effectiveness. Digital rhetoric is advancing and changing how people choose to communicate their ideas with broader audiences. Both rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold various meanings and definitions depending upon who is looking at it; for example, the online journal ''[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]'' holds a competition through Twitter for people to define rhetoric, and the submissions are extremely varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot/article/view/242/153/|title=#DefineRhetoric 2014|work=Harlot of the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Definition===

The term digital rhetoric was coined by [[rhetoric]]ian Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, ''The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3661152.html|title=The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts|author=Lanham, R. A.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|isbn=9780226468853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, rhetorician [[Elizabeth Losh]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://losh.ucsd.edu/ Elizabeth Losh]&lt;/ref&gt; offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, ''Virtualpolitik'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Losh, E.|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/virtualpolitik|title=Virtualpolitik|year=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262123044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conventions of new digital genres that are used for everyday discourse, as well as for special occasions, in average people's lives.
# [[Public rhetoric]],  often in the form of political messages from government institutions, is represented or recorded through digital technology and disseminated via electronically distributed networks.
#  The emerging scholarly discipline concerned with the rhetorical interpretation of computer-generated media as objects of study.
# Mathematical theories of communication from the field of information science, many of which attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a given linguistic exchange or the likely paths through which messages travel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Losh|first1=Elizabeth|title=Virtualpolitik: An Electronic History of Government Media-Making in a Time of War, Scandal, Disaster, Miscommunication, and Mistakes|date=2009|publisher=MIT|pages=47–48|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023101108/http://gossettphd.org/library/losh_hackingaristotle.pdf|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Losh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Though influenced by Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman also offers a definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book ''Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice'': “... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|last=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472052684|language=en|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} Eyman’s definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method, digital rhetoric can be used to analyze a digital text, and 2) as a heuristic for production. It offers rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Eyman locates the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: [[digital literacy]], visual rhetoric, new media, human-computer interaction and critical code studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|45}}

===Scope of influence===
As the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an [[encyclopedia]]. Teachers can use [[podcast]]s, YouTube videos, and [[social media]] sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules, as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. In social media, people come into contact with digital rhetoric on a daily basis whether it be an updated Facebook status, a 140 character tweet, or even the use of [[visual rhetoric]] on websites such as Instagram. Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities.&lt;ref name="Sparby"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparby|first=Erika|date=April 2018|title=Digital Social Media and Aggression: Memetic Rhetoric in 4chan’s Collective Identity|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S8755461516300810|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.

====Education====
The urge for digital rhetoric to be introduced to classrooms is the fact that in the era of Web 2.0, quite a proportion of school managements and instructors stick to the traditional rhetoric and resist the pervasiveness of technology. For the first time, the knowledge taught at and the methods employed by the academia are far behind the social and cultural advancement, rather than leading it. As Clark (2010) argues, "...the traditional essayistic literacy ... needs to be replaced by an intentional pedagogy of digital rhetoric that emphasizes the civic importance of education...".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=J. Elizabeth|date=2010|title=The Digital Imperative: Making the Case for a 21st-Century Pedagogy|url=|journal=Computers and Composition: An International Journal for Teachers of Writing|volume=27|pages=27–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Teaching Digital Rhetoric: Community, Critical Engagement, and Application|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/197069/pdf|journal=Pedagogy|volume= 6| issue =  2|pages=231–259|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world.

Scholars like Jeff Grabill contribute to the use of digital rhetoric by pushing for its use in the classroom. Grabill embraces the age of technology and encourages his contemporaries to do so as well. His backgrounds in English, education, and technology and work in those fields make him a gateway between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Another scholar, Cheryl Ball,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceball.com/ Cheryl Ball]&lt;/ref&gt; specializes in areas that consist of [[wikt:multimodal|multimodal]] composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, and digital publishing. She also focuses on university writing [[pedagogy]]. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all-digital tenure portfolio. For her undergraduate course, Clark created and employed a set of practices, including ePortfolios, digital stories, online games, ''Second Life,'' and blogs. In doing so, she managed to "engage(s) students in the interactivity, collaboration, ownership, authority, and malleability of texts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital rhetoric: Theory, Method, and Practice|last1=Eyman|first=Douglas|first2=|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-472-07268-2|location=|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention to multimodality has &amp;nbsp;also influenced ''Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing''  by Elizabeth Losh and Alexander Jonathan, which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy.

Digital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in the secondary level of education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to collaborate and critique anywhere anytime. By being educated in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs.  Students can have people see their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives.

==== Politics ====
The increase in [[Digitization|digitalization]] of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;Itai Himelboim , Ruthann Weaver Lariscy , Spencer F. Tinkham &amp; Kaye D.Sweetser (2012) Social Media and Online Political Communication: The Role of Interpersonal informational Trust and Openness, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 56:1, 92-93, DOI:10.1080/08838151.2011.6486821&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Likewise, digital rhetoric  has enabled  increasing political participation. Theoretical political research on digital rhetoric has attributed to the increase of political participation to three models; these include the motivation model, learning model, and attitude model. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was utilized by President Obama. This success is measured in the over half a billion dollars raised through the internet. This use of social media has become a large asset for all political candidates and is currently utilized by all. The 2016 elections brought social media to the forefront and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets.

* The motivation model proposes that digital rhetoric has decreased the opportunity costs of participating in politics since it makes information readily available to the people. 
* The learning model established the increase in political participation to the vast amount of political information available in the internet which increases the inclusion of the citizens in the political process. 
* The attitude model extended from the previous two by suggesting that digital rhetoric has changed the perception of citizens towards politics, particularly by providing interactive tools that allow people to engage in the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Liang|last1=Jiang|title=Why context matters: the role of campaign context in the relationship between digital media use and political participation|journal=[[Australian Journal of Political Science]]|volume=52|number=4|pages=580–598|doi=10.1080/10361146.2017.1373064|date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not  characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Lisa M.|last1=Kruse|first2=Dawn R.|last2=Norris|first3=Jonathan R.|last3=Flinchum|title=Social Media as a Public Sphere?

These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people [[demographics]], behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse — especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of there campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel|last1=Kreiss|first2=Shannon C.|last2=McGregor|title=Technology Firms Shape Political Communication: The Work of Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Google With Campaigns During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Cycle|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|volume=35|issue=2|pages=156–157|doi=10.1080/10584609.2017.1364814|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German [[Bundestag]], he found that the types  of information that politicians share on both platforms varied — Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and  law and order.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Stier, Arnim Bleier, Haiko Lietz &amp; Markus Strohmaier (2018) Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter, Political Communication, 35:1, 50-74, DOI: 10.1080/10584609.2017.1334728&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Trump often lacks factual references and has bombastic language that leads to a heavy emphasis on emotional rhetoric. Majority of his tweets lack factual basis that can withstand empirical verification.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Stephen J.|date=December 2015|title=TWITTER AND THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A RHETORICAL ANALYSIS OF TWEETS AND MEDIA COVERAGE|url=http://sjmcconnell.com/donaldtrumptwitter/|journal=New York University, Master's Thesis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If taken a position the language used is vague and abstract. Nearly a quarter of Trump's tweets are Ad Hominem. Mostly, utilizing pathos Trump's twitter is now a major play in the world of politics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Bernie Sanders uses Twitter in response to political events, issues, or fact. 82% of Sanders tweets state a position.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Through these position-based tweets he also makes claim of "values" of himself, his political party, or Americans. While values are not a truth, they are considered a pseudo-truth. These blend together the strong uses of logos as well as pathos.

Hillary Clinton's tweets are mainly driven by facts, logos. This increases the validation through empirical means. Her tweets are written with direct reference to evidence or concrete situation. However, can contain ambiguous language that makes the merit of degree of truth less clear. Clinton also lacks emotive language in her messages, sticking only to the facts.

Jeb Bush employs rhetoric that is mainly fact oriented, with occasional ambiguity. Bush mostly Tweets with ethos through pseudo-concepts. Unlike other candidates, he makes moral statements. Bush's rhetoric mixes logos, pathos, and ethos.

[[Digital media]] has increased its domination of the political sphere, especially with social media. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]] have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication. Especially political communication, fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant amount of people.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wendy|last2=Tinati|first2=Ramine|last3=Jennings|first3=Will|date=2018-01-05|title=From Brexit to Trump: Social Media’s Role in Democracy|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8267982/|journal=Computer|language=en-US|volume=51|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1109/mc.2018.1151005|issn=0018-9162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media that’s primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

* Currently, in the 115th Congress, 428 out of 435 members of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] have Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-05-23-congress-seed-list|title=A List of Twitter Handles for Members of Congress|work=Social Feed Manager|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the [[United States Senate|Senate]] side, all 100 members are active on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Members of Congress use Twitter, and other forms of social media, to connect with their constituency. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues, bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former [[George Miller (California politician)|Congressman George Miller]], Twitter is a mechanism to answer questions from people in his district.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Rolfe Daus|date=December 2012|title=To tweet or not to tweet: Exploring the determinants of early adoption of Twitter by House members in the 111th Congress|journal=The Social Science Journal|volume=49|issue=4|pages=430–438|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2012.07.002|issn=0362-3319|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[John Culberson|Representative John Culberson]] said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the Town Hall feature connects users with their federal, and state officials. According to [[Pew Research Center|PEW Research center]] 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials by a simple “like” or “follow.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/PIP_SocialMediaAndPoliticalEngagement_PDF.pdf|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=Rainie, Smith, Schlozman, Brady, Verba|first=Lee, Aaron, Kay Lehman, Henry, Sidney|date=October 2012|website=PEW Research Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In addition, there have also been various trends in the differences of uses between political parties in the United States and their usage of social media. In the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]], when Twitter was still fairly new; over half of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the House of Representatives were active on twitter.
* When it comes to citizens, according to PEW, 32% of conservatives follow their elected officials on Twitter, and 27% of Democrats follow their officials.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/10/19/social-media-and-political-engagement/|title=Social Media and Political Engagement|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has a significant influence on political campaigns. The use of social media helps both candidates and constituents connect with one another. During the 2016 election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christine|date=July 2017|title=Introduction : Social Media, Political Marketing and the 2016 U.S. Election|journal=Journal of Political Marketing|volume=16|issue=3–4|pages=207–211|via=|doi=10.1080/15377857.2017.1345828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For candidates, Facebook brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; This information has become very valuable for candidates. One super Political Action Committee that was anti-Trump, spent $9.9 million dollars in digital media. For candidates, social media provides them with a platform to highlight their ideas, and curate what they would like voters to see.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook, in getting out to vote.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, it has become a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for [[Barack Obama|President Obama]], the campaign used over 15 different methods of social media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This was to reach out to a broader audience. Social media provides a mechanism for candidates to directly engage with society and potential voters. In Romania, during the elections for Mayor in a town called [[Bacău|Bacau]] only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016 all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Social media also provided candidates with an insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the voting population surveyed used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 election.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/14/facts-about-the-changing-digital-news-landscape/|title=10 facts about the changing digital news landscape|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; [[Donald Trump]], and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==History==

===Rhetoric to digital rhetoric===
[[Rhetoric]] is defined as the art of [[discourse]], and is the root of digital rhetoric. As technology has changed, so have rhetorical situations. While the five canons of rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maryvican.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/cicero%e2%80%99s-classical-canons-of-rhetoric-their-relevance-and-importance-to-the-corporate-workplace/|title=Cicero's Classical Canons of Rhetoric: Their Relevance and Importance to the Corporate Workplace|date=2008-04-23|website=Mary|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed for oratory print still apply, they are reconfigured to work in new contextual forms like the [[database]], the [[hypertext]], the [[cybertext]], and other [[born-digital]] texts. [[Inventio]]n,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Delagrange, Susan|year=2009|title=Wunderkammer, Cornell, and the Visual Canon of Arrangement|journal=Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/delagrange/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dispositio|arrangement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yancey, Kathleen Blake|year=2004|title=Looking for sources of coherence in a fragmented world: Notes toward a new assessment design|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=21|issue=1|pages=89–102|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2003.08.024|url=http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813015840/http://rhetcomp.gsu.edu/~bgu/8121/Reading-Yancey.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elocutio|style]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brooke, Collin|year=2002|title=''Enculturation: Special Multi-journal Issue on Electronic Publication''|volume=4|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; take on new meanings while [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]]&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt; is elevated to new importance, and [[Memoria|memory]] comes to refer to textual forms like search engines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Wysocki|author2=Johndan Johnson-Eilola|author3=Cynthia L.

Ideas evolve as technology evolves, because one way of studying digital rhetoric is to trace the ways that the affordances and constraints of technology "support and enable the transformation of the old rhetoric of persuasion into a new digital rhetoric that encourages self-expression, participation, and creative collaboration".&lt;ref name=Zappen&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zappen, James|title=Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory|year=2005|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=14|issue=3|pages=319–325|url=http://homepages.rpi.edu/~zappenj/Vita/DigitalRhetoric2005.pdf|doi=10.1207/s15427625tcq1403_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many trace the transformation of old rhetoric into digital rhetoric through the classical rhetorical canons.

===Shift from print to digital===
Dennis Baron states, "The first writing technology was writing itself." While previous writing technologies involved pencils and [[hieroglyphics]], the evolution of communication technology now allows for online and immediate rhetorical conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baron, D. (n.d.)|title=From Pencils to Pixels: The Stages of Literacy Technology|accessdate=January 1, 2014|publisher=english.illinois.edu|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/pencils.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of communicative technologies started with the chisel, then the book, the quill, the [[Greek alphabet]], and the pencil, onto more modern technology such as the computer. The origins of modern computing are to be found in the techno-military context of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=What is Digital Rhetoric?|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebsoslgfgts|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the pencil was originally intended as a marking utensil for builders and is now used for writing, the computer was originally intended to compute advanced math problems, but is now used for word-processing and a myriad of other tasks. Technology continues to modify itself to meet the needs of people; in the case of digital rhetoric, technology has become more prevalent to match people's usage of the Internet and computers, which creates a [[technoculture]]. 
Another scholar who highlights the changing landscape from print to digital is Jay Bolter. He argues that the computer is the most significant development since the start of the alphabetic/print tradition and that digital texts will continue to move print to the "margins of literate culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bolter, J.|year=1991|title=Writing space: The computer, hypertext, and the history of writing|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==

===Appropriation===
In the digital age most everything is considered appropriation. Scholars pull their information from a myriad of sources and are constantly redefining terms in order to apply them to the digital world. Appropriation carries both positive and negative connotations. In some ways appropriation is a tool that can be used for the reapplication of outdated ideas to make them better. In other ways appropriation is seen as a threat to creative and cultural identities. Social media receives the bulk of this scrutiny due to the lack of education of its users. Most "contributors are often unaware of what they are contributing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reyman, J.|year=2013|title=User Data on the Social Web: Authorship, Agency, and Appropriation|journal=College English, |volume=75|issue=5|pages=513–532|accessdate=November 1, 2014|via=ncte.org|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CE/0755-may2013/CE0755User.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which perpetuates the negative connotation. Many scholars in digital rhetoric explore this topic and its effects on society such as Jessica Reyman, Amy Hea, and Johndan Johnson-Eilola.

===Avatar===
James E. Porter defines avatar as a "virtual body".&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; With developments in technology, there are new ways to present oneself online. This online presentation of one's own identity is an avatar. While scholars such as Beth Kolko hoped for an online world without physical barriers, making it a "realm of ideas", there are still [[social issue]]s, such as [[gender discrimination]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name="Kolko"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kolko, Beth E.|year=1999|title=Representing bodies in virtual space: The rhetoric of avatar design|journal=Information Society|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177–186|doi=10.1080/019722499128484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beth E. Kolko believes that an idealistic online world would be a "realm of ideas", without definitive factors such as gender, race, or age. Kolko argues that a non-gendered online world would not garner enough attention, because individuals could not relate to each other without [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="Kolko" /&gt; Victoria Woolums found in a study of the video game World of Warcraft that the gender identity of the avatar affected behaviors of other characters, showing a bias even in a realm where gender identity of an avatar may not be physically accurate to its user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woolums, V.|date=Fall 2011|title=Gendered Avatar Identity. Kairos|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/16.1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulation===
[[Rhetorical circulation|Circulation]] theorizes the ways that texts and discourses move through time and space. Any kind of media can be circulated.  Henry Jenkins "sticky vs. spreadable media" applies to circulation.  Essentially, "sticky" media is media that can be spread. 
A new form of communication is composed, created, and distributed through digital technologies. Explained by Henry Jenkins, there is a shift from distribution to circulation which signals a move toward an increasingly participatory model of culture in which people shape, share, reframe and remix media content in ways not previously possible within the traditional rhetorical elements like print.

"A number of scholars have seen delivery in networked systems as circulation of digital texts, following John Trimbur's (2000) argument that circulation should be re-introduced in writing instruction; however, his definition of circulation is as an element or result of delivery. Trimbur suggests that neglecting delivery has led writing teachers to equate the activity of composing with writing itself and to miss altogether the complex delivery systems through which writing circulates. By privileging composing as the main site of instruction, the teaching of writing has taken up what [[Karl Marx]] calls a "one-sided" view of production and thereby has largely erased the cycle that links the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of writing. This cycle of interlocked moments is what Marx calls circulation. (190)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eyman|first=Douglas|date=2015|title=Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/13030181.0001.001/1:5/--digital-rhetoric-theory-method-practice?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.3998/dh.13030181.0001.001|via=|isbn=978-0-472-05268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration===
Collaboration in digital rhetoric does not mean a [[collaborative writing|co-authorship]] directly, even though this could be constituted as that as well, but collaboration looks more like an outlet that scholars can share their work and receive feedback as well. Instead of using solely the individual and their work, scholars use each other to spur on each other's ideas and build their concepts upon another. Collaboration takes on a much more broad meaning in terms of content on the internet. Not only does it offer the opportunity for scholars to collaborate with each other, but it also gives readers the chance to share their reactions with creators of content on the internet. In this way, digital rhetoric allows the audience to interact and work with creators of content. In Braun's book "Cultivating Ecologies for Digital Media Work: The case of English studies", she suggests a collaborative work by interdisciplinary scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultivating ecologies for digital media work: The case of English studies|last=Braun|first=Chaterine, C|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Carbondale|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is scholarship", a digital article published in Kairos 12.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=Catherine, C|last2=Gilbert|first2=Kenneth, L|date=|title=This is Scholarship|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/braun_gilbert/index.html|journal=Kairos|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the example of collaborative multimedia text by Catherine Braun as a rhetorician and compositionist, and Kenneth Gilbert as an audio-technician. The shared authorship from this work is shown in the editorial process including writing, digital production, display, and design to produce a final piece of a scholarly article in the form of webtext.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Daren Brabham defines [[Crowdsourcing]] as, "using an online, ... model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Brabham, Daren. ''Crowdsourcing''. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  As a concept within digital rhetoric, it is a utilization of modern technology to collaborate and create collectively. Companies and organizations use crowdsourcing to build creativity, by acquiring information other than what their immediate employees know. However, there are several concerns that come up when crowdsourcing tactics are used. Issues relating to [[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] and [[Copyright]] are some of the foremost problems when crowdsourced ideas are used for commercial problems. Because the business did not conceive the idea, terms of use must be clearly set while fielding responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ethical concerns have been raised as well when engaging in crowdsourcing without a clear set of compensation practices or protections in place to secure personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bashayr|first=A. (Et al.)|date=|title=Legal and Ethical Issues of Crowdsourcing|url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume167/number10/alqahtani-2017-ijca-914324.pdf|journal=International Journal of Computer Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delivery===
For the general scholar, the term delivery means the way in which a form of information is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term "delivery" is often aligned with the term "performance".  The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, but it is also a translation of the word "hypokrisis", or "acting". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.&lt;ref name="Burton" /&gt;

===Electracy===
[[Electracy]] is a term developed by Gregory Ulmer describing the emerging digital age.&lt;ref&gt;''Electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print'' —Gregory Ulmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Electracy is often discussed as being in transition, advancing along with digital rhetoric. Electracy explains the full communicative potentials of new electronic media. Electracy is embedded in the approach of digital rhetoric and covers a large paradigm of literacy which is enhanced through Ulmer's idea of 'electracy'. The recent decades observes a sound effect of 'electracy' in the field of digital media. According to Arrayo, "Participatory Compositions begins by exploring the apparatus of electracy in many of its manifestation while focus on the participatory practices found in online video culture. As research suggests the concept of 'electracy' has changed through the very idea of Ulmer who once articulated in the orientation of analogue video that serves rhetorical dimension of &amp;nbsp;'Teletheory'. But his vision of 'electracy' changed by bringing in a more broader literary concept that enterprise writing—coding, hypertext etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Composition: Video Culture, Writing and Electracy.|last=Arroyo|first=Sarah|publisher=SIU Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0809331468|location=|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Kairos ===
''[[Kairos]],'' in the traditional rhetorical canon, is defined as catching the opportune moment. Traditionally, Kairos relates to rhetorical time (versus Kronos, or chronological time). It relates to the occasion and context when a text is written or a speech is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheard|first=Cynthia|date=1993|title=Kairos and Kenneth Burke's Psychology of Political and Social Communication|url=|journal=College English|volume=55|pages=291–310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Kairos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotles Rhetorical Situation|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/625/03/|accessdate=2018-04-22|first1=Ethan|last1=Sproat|first2=Dana Lynn|last2=Driscoll|first3=Allen|last3=Brizee|date=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the elements of a speech that acknowledge and draw support from the particular setting, time, and place when and where a speech occurs. It is imperative that the speaker knows when and where to place the argument and, if it is appropriate. However, in the digital age, this is changing. Although Aristotle considers Kairos as related to [[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]],&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a more modern definition expands that view to include [[Multimodality|multimodal]] texts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Sheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel offer an expanded definition of Kairos that asks rhetors to consider the ramifications of circulation, production and re-production, and distribution of compositions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Kairos has been put on the rhetorical back burner, but has become more theorized in the digital age to discuss the ecology of multimodal texts. Digital scholars like Douglas Eyman, Jim Ridolfo, David Sheridan, Anthony Michel, Ellen Cushman, and Isabel Pedersen are on the forefront of reviving the concept of Kairos and applying its use in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David M. Sheridan|author2=Jim Ridolfo|author3=Anthony J. Michel|lastauthoramp=y|date=March 19, 2012|title=The Available Means of Persuasion: Mapping a Theory and Pedagogy of Multimodal Public Rhetoric|location=Anderson, South Carolina|publisher=Parlor Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===
"At first, Memory seemed to have to do solely with [[mnemonics]] (memory aids) that would assist a budding orator in retaining his speech. However, it clearly had to do with more than simply learning how to memorize an already composed speech for re-presentation. The practice of storing up information or other material arrived at through the topics of invention can be called for in a given occasion in order to redistribute information that is already known or given. The canon of Memory also suggests that scholars consider the psychological aspects of preparing to communicate and the performance of communicating itself, especially in an oral or impromptu setting. Typically Memory has to do only with the orator, but invites consideration of how the audience will retain things in mind."&lt;ref name="Burton"&gt;{{cite web|author=Burton, G. (n.d.)|title=What is Rhetoric?|accessdate=December 3, 2014|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/encompassing%20terms/rhetoric.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105226/http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Encompassing%20Terms/rhetoric.htm|archivedate=December 20, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mind sharing ===
Mind sharing is a way to get [[collective intelligence]]—crowd wisdom that is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. One would look for a consensus from the crowd—the answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like "what car should I buy?"), it's the most common answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindsharing: The Art of Crowdsourcing Everything|last=Zoref|first=Lior|publisher=Portfolio|year=2015|isbn=978-1591846659|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimodality===
[[Multimodality]] means having several modes, modalities, or maxima—in simpler terms, it is a form of communication that uses multiple methods (or modes) to inform audiences of an idea. It can involve a mix of written text, pictures, audio, or videos. Online journals often embrace multimodality in their issues and articles by publishing works that use more than just written text to communicate the message. While the digital turn in rhetoric and composition has encouraged more discussion, theorization, and pedagogical application of multimodality and multimodal texts, the history of the field demonstrates a continuous concern with multimodal communication beginning with classical rhetoric's concern with delivery, gesture, and memory. All writing and all communication is, theoretically, multimodal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies|last=Ball|first=Cheryl|last2=Charlton|first2=Colin|publisher=Utah State University Press|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Adler-Kassner|editor-first=Linda|location=|pages=|chapter=All Writing is Multimodal|editor2-last=Wardle|editor2-first=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remix===
[[Remix]] is a method of digital rhetoric that manipulates and transforms an original work to convey a new message. The usage of remix can help the creator make an argument by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas into a convincing whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn|first=Virginia|date=|title=The Rhetoric of Remix|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/358/279|journal=Transformative Works|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As modern [[technology]] develops, self-publication sites like YouTube, SoundCloud, and WordPress have stimulated remix culture, allowing for easier creation and dissemination of reworked content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Rhetoric/Remediation_and_Remix|title=Digital Rhetoric/Remediation and Remix - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike appropriation, which is the use and potential recontextualization of existing material without significant modification, remix is defined in ''Kairos'' as "the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/remix.html|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|last=DeVoss|first=Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole|date=2009-01-15|website=kairos.technorhetoric.net|language=English|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A popular example of remixing is the creation and sharing of [[meme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

===Rhetorical velocity===
[[Rhetorical velocity]] is the concept of authors writing in a way in which they are able to predict how their work might be recomposed. With the advancement of technology, there is no limit to the speed and distance at which an author's work is able to travel. Therefore, it is important for them to be able to predict how their audience will recompose their works. Jim Ridolfo and Danielle DeVoss first coined this idea in 2009 when they describe rhetorical velocity as "a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ridolfo, J.|author2=Devoss, D.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery|journal=Kairos|volume=13|issue=2|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual rhetoric ===
[[Visual rhetoric]] relates to digital rhetoric because they can act together to communicate ideas in a way that is not bound by a linear format. Mary Hocks, a visual rhetoric scholar, states "the screen itself is a tablet that combines words, interfaces, icons, and pictures that invoke other modalities like touch and sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hocks, M.|year=2003|title=Understanding Visual Rhetoric in Digital Writing Environments|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=54|issue=4|pages=629–656|jstor=3594188|doi=10.2307/3594188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By manipulating the tools described by Hocks, a writer in the digital world has access to influence a broader audience, and an influx of modes to communicate their ideas. This in turn creates a way for writers to communicate The use of visual images in rhetoric allows for a writer to convey an idea that may be so abstract that the written linear word will not suffice. Abstract ideas in rhetorical images, as Charles Hill states, that not only are abstract ideas represented in images acceptable but they are prominent, images "do not necessarily have to portray an object, or even a class of objects, that exists or ever did exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Handa, C.|year=2004|chapter=Reading the Visual in College Writing Classes By Charles Hill|title=Visual rhetoric in a digital world: A critical sourcebook|location=Boston|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images allow for the writer to depict the closest representation of their thought possible since they can blend abstract and tangible thoughts. Hill uses the peace sign, swastika, and the confederate flags as examples of abstract ideas represented by images. Ironically the image of a peace sign, which seems to be universally accepted as a call from the 1970s 'hippie' movement, originated as an anti-Christian symbol. The original graphic was used to show an upside down broken cross symbolizing the despair of man and the crucifixion of the Apostle Peter. This shows how visual images can change over time and be adapted in such powerful ways that it actually changes the meaning completely. Images are versatile, and coupled with the motive of the author can provide key components to an argument. By being informed on how visual rhetoric interacts with its different components a reader/viewer can reduce abstract ideas to a more tangible state.

==Controversies==

===Access===
Referred to as the [[digital divide]], issues of economic access and user-level access are recurring issues in digital rhetoric. These issues show up most prevalent in [[computers and writing]] circles. Access can refer to inequality in the access of information, access to a reading public, and access to means of communicating. For those that teach digital rhetoric in schools and universities, student access to technologies at home and in school is an operative concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reynolds, Thomas J.|author2=Charles R. Lewis|lastauthoramp=y|title=The changing topography of computer access for composition students|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=14|issue=2|pages=269–278|year=1997|doi=10.1016/S8755-4615(97)90027-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether mobile computing devices like smartphones make technology access more equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hea, Amy C.K.|year=2009|title=Going Wireless: A Critical Exploration of Wireless and Mobile Technologies for Composition Teachers and Researchers|location=Cresskill, N.J.|publisher=Hampton Press|pages=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright issues===
Copyright controversies in online and digital texts affect the way digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these arguments deal with the problem of cost for the publishers and consumers of scholarly text. Copyrighting materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease of transformation, copyright laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece "Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. "A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand." Zappen's statement of "infinite" is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance of copyright.  These many forms of copyright avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zappen" /&gt; 

=== Cyberbullying ===
One controversy that has been steady on the rise since the transition of utilizing digital rhetoric in social media is [[Cyberbullying]].  An example can be seen in the TLC television series, [[Here Comes Honey Boo Boo]]. Viewers have the opportunity to post their opinions and responses on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. The trend that people posting about the characters and their lifestyles, it reinforces the iconography of stereotypes (such as "hillbillies") is successful because of the way in which the rhetoric of difference is a naturalized component of the ethnic and racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Carissa|date=Spring 2018|title=The rhetoric of the real: stereotypes of rural youth in American reality television and stock photography|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge with social media is that since there is a limited amount of characters to convey the message the digital rhetoric tends to be oversimplified and stereotypes flourish. Erika Sparby evaluated that due to the increase of social media users people have found this stronger sense of confidence from the ability from being anonymous and using pseudonymous in digital social media for them to address either someone or something in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Sparby"/&gt;

===Legitimacy===

There is controversy regarding the innovative nature of digital rhetoric. Arguments opposed to legitimizing webtext are Platonically-based in that they reject the new form of scholarship, web text, and praise the old form, print, in the same way that oral communication was originally favored over written communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Borgman, Christine|title=Scholarship in a Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|year=2007|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally some traditionalists didn't regard online open-access journals with the same legitimacy as print journals for this reason; however, digital arenas have become the primary place for disseminating academic information in many areas of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Gary|title=What are Trends in Scholarly Publishing?|url=http://www.asha.org/Academic/questions/Trends-Scholarly-Publishing/}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=MiguelAngelFimbres |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars struggle to "claim academic legitimacy" in these new media forms, as the tendency of pedagogy is to write about a subject rather than actively work in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ball, Cheryl E.|year=2004|title=Show, not tell: The value of new media scholarship|journal=Computers &amp; Composition|volume=21|issue=4|pages=403–425|url=http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2004.08.001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023081524/http://gossettphd.org/library/ball_shownottell.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the past decade, more scholarly texts have been openly accessible, which provides an innovative way for students to gain access to textual materials online for free, in the way that many scholarly journals like ''Kairos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/ Kairos]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harlot of the Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://harlotofthearts.org/index.php/harlot Harlot of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Enculturation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enculturation.net/ Enculturation]&lt;/ref&gt; are already available through open access.

===Open access===
Open access has removed the barriers of fees associated with accessing a work and restrictions of copyright and licensing. The matter of eliminating fees is most prevalent to digital rhetoric, because it allows for more access to works. Open access and digital rhetoric do not eliminate copyright, but eliminates restrictions by giving authors the choice to maintain their right to copy and distribute their materials however they choose, or they may turn the rights over to a specific journal. Digital rhetoric involves works that are found online and open access is allowing more people to be able to reach these works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4560">[[Image:Tektronix 4014.jpg|right|frame|Tektronix 4014 with a "DVBST" storage display screen]]
'''Direct-view bistable storage tube''' ('''DVBST''') was an acronym used by [[Tektronix]] to describe their line of [[Storage_tube|storage tubes]]. These were [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRT) that stored information written to them using an [[Oscilloscope#Analog storage oscilloscope|analog technique]] inherent in the CRT and based upon the [[secondary emission]] of electrons from the phosphor screen itself. The resulting image was visible in the continuously glowing patterns on the face of the CRT.

DVBST technology was anticipated by Andrew Haeff of the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|US Naval Research Laboratory]], and by Williams and Kilburn in the late 1940s.  Tek's (Tektronix) Robert H. Anderson refined Haeff's concepts in the late 1950s to produce a reliable and simple DVST.

==Principle==
The DVBST implements two [[electron gun]]s: a "flood gun" and a "writing gun". The writing gun scans across a wire grid, charging the grid to create the negative image.  The flood gun then floods the grid.  Previously charged areas repel the incoming electrons so that electrons only pass through the grid to the phosphor in those areas not previously charged.

The technology offered several advantages and disadvantages.

===Advantages===
* No refreshing is needed. 
* Very complex pictures can be displayed at very high resolution without flicker. 

===Disadvantages===
* They ordinarily do not display color.
* Selected part of the picture can not be erased.
* The erasing and redrawing process can take several seconds for complex pictures.
* No animation in DVST.
* Modifying any part of image requires redrawing of entire image.

==Applications==
Tektronix-made DVBSTs were used for analog oscilloscopes (first in the 564 oscilloscope, then the type 601 monitor (1968), the 611 monitor, the 7313 and 7514 plug-in mainframe oscilloscope, all from Tektronix) and for computer terminals such as the archetypal Tek 4010 and its several successors including the [[Tektronix 4014]]. Portions of the screen are individually written-to by a conventional electron beam gun, and "flooded" by a wide, low velocity electron gun. Erasure required erasing the entire screen in a bright flash of green light, leading to the nickname "the mean green flashin' machine".

Some DVBST implementations also allowed the "write-through" of a small amount of dynamically refreshed, non-stored data. This allowed the display of [[cursor (computers)|cursor]]s, graphic elements under construction, and the like on computer terminals.

== Skiatron ==
Another version of a (non-Tekronix) DVBST was the "dark trace" CRT, also known as the '''Skiatron'''. This CRT replaced the conventional light-emitting ''[[phosphor]]'' layer on the face of the tube screen with a ''[[scotophor]]'' such as [[potassium chloride]] (KCl). KCl has the property that when a crystal is struck by an [[electron beam]], that spot would change from translucent white to a dark [[magenta]] color. By [[backlight]]ing such a CRT with a white or green circular [[fluorescent lamp]], the resulting image would appear as black information against a green background or as magenta information against a white background. A benefit, aside from the semi-permanent storage of the displayed image, is that the brightness of the resultant display is only limited by the illumination source and optics.

The image would be retained until erased by flooding the scotophor with a high-intensity [[infrared light]] or by electro-thermal heating. Using conventional deflection and [[raster scan|raster]] formation circuity, a bi-level image could be created on the membrane and retained even when power was removed from the CRT. By using an array of dots, say 8 &amp;times; 8, a larger pixel could be formed to represent 64 gray levels. One such device, the D36 Image Display, was made by [[DICOMED]] Corporation and a technical paper was presented at the 1972 Electro-Optical Conference in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

==Description==
FunTrivia was the first trivia website added to the Yahoo directory and used to be the largest trivia site on the web in terms of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/funtrivia.com "FunTrivia on Alexa"]&lt;/ref&gt; FunTrivia is notable in that it was one of the first entertainment sites on the web in 1995 to use a community-generated content model to create all of its content.

It contains over one million trivia questions in ninety-thousand quizzes, all submitted by over four thousand different contributors. Quizzes are created and submitted by members of the community and placed online for anyone to play for free.

New submissions are checked by category editors before being published, and prior accepted submissions may be modified without editor intervention. All editors on FunTrivia are volunteer community members. As of 2009, there are 40 volunteer editors maintaining the site's content.

FunTrivia also pioneered the "Ask a Question" model in early 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funtrivia.com/ask.cfm "Ask FunTrivia Database"]&lt;/ref&gt; in which visitors could ask a trivia question and receive answers from other guests.

==User Features==

Free (non-subscribing) members of FunTrivia may play most games on the site, such as the Easy game and the Daily game, and are able to play all user-created quizzes. However, scores are only saved for the first 100 quizzes. A free member is able to participate in the majority of hourly and daily trivia games. All players may create quizzes. Members may also join or create a team whose members all share a common similarity.

A subscription (Gold Membership) option is available for frequent players, allowing access to more activities than a free member. A Gold Member can play as many quizzes as they desire and have the quizzes recorded and receive points. Other features only for Gold Members include quiz analysis options, no ads, and faster searching.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.funtrivia.com/gold.cfm]"FunTrivia Gold Membership&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FunTrivia began at the [[University of Waterloo]] as the "Archive for Useless Facts and Trivia" in 1995, a simple website that allowed visitors to submit facts and information into a database. The owner, Terry Ford, contacted [[Yahoo!]] founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] and the website was added under a new "trivia" category in the Yahoo directory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.yahoo.com/entertainment/Trivia/ "Yahoo Trivia Directory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the registering of its domain in 1999, the website became FunTrivia.com, and quickly launched into other areas of quizzing.

'''''Give 'em Hell, Harry!''''' is a biographical play and 1975 film, written by playwright Samuel Gallu. Both the play and film are a one-man show about former President of the United States [[Harry S. Truman]]. ''Give 'em Hell, Harry!'' stars [[James Whitmore]], and was directed by [[Steve Binder]] and [[Peter H. Hunt]].

==Title origin==
The title comes from an incident that took place during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 Presidential election campaign]]. In [[Bremerton, Washington]], Truman delivered a speech attacking the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s. During the speech, a supporter yelled out, "Give 'em Hell, Harry!" Truman replied, "I don't give them Hell. I just tell the truth about them, and they think it's Hell." Subsequently, "Give 'em Hell, Harry!" became a lifetime slogan for Truman supporters.

==History==
The play previewed in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], followed by its official opening at [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D. C. Its April 17, 1975, premiere was hosted by Truman's daughter [[Margaret Truman|Margaret]], and attended by President [[Gerald Ford]]. The play then went on to a six-city tour, during which it was videotaped for film on the stage of the [[Moore Theatre]] in [[Seattle]], using a live editing process called ''Theatrovision''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |title=Review: Give 'em Hell, Harry! |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010324/1023 |date=January 1, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although the play has been regularly revived, it did not make its New York debut until July 2008 at St. Luke's Theatre.

==Awards==
James Whitmore was nominated for Best Actor by both the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Awards]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globes]]. It is only the third film to have its entire credited cast (Whitmore) nominated for an Academy Award, the first two being ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf]]'' in 1966, where almost all members excluding the extras were nominated and ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Follow these clues to the original 'Sleuth' |page=2D |url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20071011/d_cover11_side.art.htm |date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitmore was also nominated for, and won, a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album|Best Spoken Word Recording]].

Her husband gained custody of the children while Keogh and Vernon went on to marry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/interactive/2465/40243_626640_5825-00000/57238?backurl=https://www.ancestry.co.uk/family-tree/person/tree/11930161/person/-368404502/facts/citation/120057491291/edit/record#?imageId=40243_626640_5825-00001 "Divorce of William Thomas Gillett and Harriet Maria Gillett"], England &amp; Wales, Civil Divorce Records, 1858–1916 via [[Ancestry.com]] {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 she was declared a bankrupt.

==Plot==
In 1895, in the aftermath of the death of his [[Brides of Dracula|wife]] Martha ([[Jackie Sandler]]) at the hands of an [[Mobbing|angry human mob]], [[Count Dracula]] ([[Adam Sandler]]) commissions and builds a massive five-star, monsters-only [[hotel]] in [[Transylvania]] in which he raises his [[Hotel Transylvania characters#Mavis|daughter Mavis]] ([[Selena Gomez]]) and to serve as a safe-place getaway for the world's monsters from fear of human persecution. Famous monsters such as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frank]] ([[Kevin James]]) and his wife [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Eunice]] ([[Fran Drescher]]), Wayne and Wanda [[Werewolf]] ([[Steve Buscemi]] and [[Molly Shannon]]) and their massive immediate family, [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Griffin The Invisible Man]] ([[David Spade]]), and Murray the [[Mummy (monster)|Mummy]] ([[CeeLo Green]]) often come to stay at the hotel.

In the present day, on Mavis's 118th birthday, Dracula allows his daughter to leave the castle in order to explore the human world, but he sets up an [[Potemkin village|elaborate plan]] using his [[zombie]] [[bellhop]]s disguised as humans to make them seem intimidating, and frighten her home. The plan works, but the zombies inadvertently lead a 21-year-old&lt;ref name="Deadline1" /&gt; human Jonathan Loughran ([[Andy Samberg]]) back to the hotel. Dracula frantically disguises him as a Frankensteinesque Monster and passes him off as Frank's cousin "Johnnystein". Johnny soon encounters Mavis and the two "Zing", in a form of romantic attraction. Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Dracula quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this disgusts and worries Dracula greatly. Dracula orders Johnny to leave, but Johnny is brought back by Mavis. After being shown the beauty of a sunrise by Johnny, Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance.

Meanwhile, the hotel chef [[Quasimodo]] ([[Jon Lovitz]]) with the help of his pet [[rat]] Esmeralda learns that Johnny is a human and kidnaps him in order to cook him. Dracula intervenes and magically freezes Quasimodo to keep him from telling anyone that Johnny is human. Dracula leads Johnny to his quarters and shows him a painting of Martha, allowing Johnny to realize why Dracula built the hotel and became overprotective of Mavis. Johnny then agrees to leave for good, but Dracula convinces him to stay for the time-being to avoid ruining Mavis's birthday.

The party is a great success the next night, and Mavis looks forward to opening a gift from Martha. However, when Johnny and Mavis share their first kiss, Dracula overreacts, and, in his outburst, inadvertently confesses to deceiving Mavis with the town. A still-frozen Quasimodo bursts in and [[The Fly (George Langelaan)|Mr. Fly]] ([[Chris Parnell]]) reveals from his frozen speech that Johnny is a human disguised by Dracula. The guests are outraged by the deceit at play, but Mavis is undeterred and wants to be with Johnny. Johnny feigns disinterest in Mavis and rejects her out of respect for her father and leaves the hotel.

Mavis flies onto the roof with her mother's present, and Dracula follows her in hopes of comforting her. He learns the present is a book about how Martha and Dracula "Zinged" and fell in love. Dracula realizes he no longer knows humankind's true tolerance of monsters, and manages to convince Frank, Wayne, Griffin, and Murray to head out into the human world to help him find Johnny, and with the scent-tracking ability of Wayne's daughter, Winnie, they learn that he is about to catch a flight to the United States. The four head to the airport, but are held up in a town celebrating a Monster Festival along the way. Admiring the group, the humans agree to help, and a team of men dressed as vampires provide Dracula shelter from the sunlight while he rushes to the airport. Dracula arrives to see Johnny's plane taking off, and he gives chase in bat form, burning in the sunlight. After getting Johnny's attention, Dracula makes his way to the front of the plane and uses his mind-controlling power on the [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]] ([[Brian Stack]]) to help him apologize, stating that Mavis has grown up and can make her own decisions. Jonathan accepts his apology, and Dracula manipulates the pilot to return to the Transylvanian airport.

Dracula returns Jonathan to Mavis, announcing that he approves of Johnny. Johnny confesses to Mavis that their 'Zing' was mutual and the two kiss. The monsters finish celebrating Mavis's party, impressing the hotel guests.

''Hotel Transylvania'' was originally created and developed by comedy writer [[Todd Durham]], which he based on his book of the same name; after creating the [[Bible (screenwriting)|bible]] for a franchise of several films, television series, video games, books, merchandising, hotel chain, and theme park, he took the package unsolicited to Columbia Pictures and set it up at Sony Pictures Animation where he became the first of several screenwriters on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2012/hotel_transylvania/notes.pdf|title=Columbia Pictures Press Kit - Hotel Transylvania|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222034223/http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2012/hotel_transylvania/notes.pdf|archive-date=2012-12-22|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sonypicturesanimation.com/pastfilms.php?s=hotelt|title=Hotel Transylvania|last=|first=|date=|website=Sony Pictures Animation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/HotelT/|title=Hotel Transylvania|last=|first=|date=|website=Facebook|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] editor Geoff Chapman rated the film 9 out of 10 and wrote "This is a fun film, full of quirky gags and lovable characters. There are a few songs that smack a bit like soundtrack marketing for the kids, and the story is of course fairly predictable, but this movie is about enjoying a fun journey with great characters. It's a romp that kids and families will all enjoy.

==''Goodnight Mr. Foot''==
''Goodnight Mr. Foot'' is a traditionally animated short film based on ''Hotel Transylvania'', featuring Bigfoot from the film. Premiering in time for Halloween, on October 26, 2012, the short was shown exclusively in [[Regal Entertainment Group]] Cinemas, before the theatrical shows of ''Hotel Transylvania''. As [[Sony Pictures Animation]]'s first traditionally animated film, it was written and directed by [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] himself, who also animated the short with the help of [[Rough Draft Studios]]. Animated in the style of [[Bob Clampett]], [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]],&lt;ref name=PRNewswireGoodnight /&gt; Tartakovsky created the short in four weeks during the final production stages of the main film.&lt;ref name=CartoonBrewGoodnight&gt;{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=Sony Releases Genndy Tartakovsky’s new short "Goodnight Mr. Foot"|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/animators/genndy-tartakovskys-new-short-goodnight-mr-foot-72407.html|accessdate=October 26, 2012|newspaper=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bigfoot (who has a non-speaking role in ''Hotel Transylvania'') was voiced by [[Corey Burton]] while the [[Witchcraft|Witch]] [[Maid]] was voiced by [[Rose Abdoo]].

''''' Intensive Care  ''''' is a [[1991 in film|1991]] [[Netherlands|Dutch]] action [[horror film]] directed by [[Dorna van Rouveroy]]. It stars popular Flemish singer [[Koen Wauters]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/films/intensive-care&lt;/ref&gt; in his second and final film role and Hollywood actor [[George Kennedy]]. While the movie was not a box office success it did develop a [[cult following]] over the decades due to it being hilariously bad and campy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salonindien.nl/2008/intensive-care-1991/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veronicamagazine.nl/film/horror/intensive-care-829697/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208161402/http://www.veronicamagazine.nl/film/horror/intensive-care-829697/ |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown during the Belgian-Dutch ''[[Nacht van de Wansmaak]]'' film festival.

==Plot==

The famous surgeon Dr. Bruckner suffers a car accident, which leaves him horribly burned and puts him into a coma for seven years. When he awakes at New Years' Night he starts a murdering rampage. As the plot progresses he stalks a girl named Amy, her boyfriend Peter and Amy's brother Bobby and tries to enter their house, while the friends try to fence him off.

==Cast==
*[[George Kennedy]] as Dr. Bruckner
*[[Koen Wauters]] as Peter
*[[Nada van Nie]] as Amy
*[[Michiel Hess]] as Bobby
*[[Dick van den Toorn]] as Ted
*[[Jules Croiset]] as Dr. Horvath
*[[Huub Scholten]] as Inspector Eddy
*[[Nora Tilley]] as Rose
*[[Arthur Boni]] as Steven
*[[Dolf de Vries]] as Hank
*[[Barbara Barendrecht]] as Shirley
*[[Fred Florusse]] as John
*[[Simone Dresens]] as Christine
*[[Fred Van Kuyk]] as Inspector Fox
*[[Luc Theeboom]] as Bert

==Reception==

The film failed to make a huge profit, despite having the hugely popular teen idol [[Koen Wauters]] in the starring role, and was demolished by the critics. ''[[De Volkskrant]]'' reviewed it as: ''"A movie where every aspect goes so disastrously wrong that it almost seems like a [[parody]]."'' &lt;ref&gt;https://nrcwebwinkel.nl/author-review/review/view/id/801/&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it quickly gained a cult following due to its poor acting, unconvincing special effects, bad English pronunciation and a plot hole-ridden story.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salonindien.nl/2008/intensive-care-1991/&lt;/ref&gt; The car accident that puts the surgeon into a coma has many unexplained explosions. For reasons that are never explained the surgeon goes on a murdering spree and manages to survive numerous attacks that would horribly injure any normal person. To top it all off the actor who played him before the accident ([[George Kennedy]]) is now obviously replaced by a different actor, covered in bandages. In one of the most infamous scenes the girl's boyfriend lies on the floor, bleeding due to stab wounds, which causes her to remark: ''"Moet ik een pleister voor je halen? Jeetje mina!" (Translation: "Shall I get you a little [[band-aid]]? Golly gosh")''.&lt;ref&gt;http://cinemagazine.nl/intensive-care-1991-recensie/&lt;/ref&gt; The picture is traditionally shown during each edition of the Dutch-Belgian B-movie festival ''[[Nacht van de Wansmaak]]'' and has frequently been called "the worst Dutch movie ever." Due to this reputation it has been honored in the "Hall of Shame" of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veronicamagazine.nl/film/horror/intensive-care-829697/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208161402/http://www.veronicamagazine.nl/film/horror/intensive-care-829697/ |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://nrcwebwinkel.nl/author-review/review/view/id/801/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gorehoundinc.com/nachtvandewansmaak/achtergrond.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Interactive Gambling Act (IGA)''' was passed in June 2001 by the [[Australian Government]] with the purpose of protecting the Australian public from the detrimental effects of [[online gambling]].

==The law==
&lt;!-- EDITOR, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE ACT WHICH STATES WHAT THE WRITER HAS INCLUDED IN THIS DOCUMENT, THE ACT IS HERE AND THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO REAL MONEY ETC AT ALL http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005C00372  OR EVEN THE WORD OFFSHORE IS NOT MENTIONED , INDEED THE WRITER HAS TAKEN VERY A LIBERAL TRANSLATION OF THE ACTUAL LAW --&gt;

The Interactive Gambling Act (2001) was passed by the [[Australian Commonwealth Parliament]] on 28 June 2001.&lt;ref name = "Assent"&gt;[http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/478/interactive-gambling-act-receives-assent.aspx Interactive Gambling Act Receives Assent]&lt;/ref&gt; It received assent on 11 July 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00851 Interactive Gambling Act 2001: Compilation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGA is targeted at online gambling operators and makes it an offence for them to offer ‘real-money’ online interactive gambling to residents of Australia. It also makes it illegal for online gambling operators to advertise ‘real-money’ interactive gambling services (such as online poker and casino) to Australian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamblinglaw.org/ Gambling Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessing and using the interactive gambling services is not an offence. It is also allowed to companies based in Australia to offer their gambling services to gamblers located outside Australia with the exception of those countries that were called 'designated countries'.&lt;ref name = "Rev"&gt;[http://apo.org.au/research/review-interactive-gambling-act-2001 Review of the Interactive Gaming Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; A country can be called designated upon request of the government of this country and on condition that there is corresponding legislation in this country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=13313 Law comes into effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Offense'''
* The law applies to all interactive gambling operators whether they are Australian or foreign owned or whether they are based in Australia or offshore.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* The offence of offering Interactive Gambling Services to Australian residents carries a maximum fine of $220,000 per day for individuals within an Interactive Gambling operation or $1.1 million per day for the actual company.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* The responsibility of upholding the IGA is the responsibility of individual gambling operators.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The average Australian citizen cannot be punished for signing up and gambling online.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Reasonable diligence'''

An offence will not be deemed to have been committed if the online gambling operator could not, with [[due diligence]], have known that they were offering their services to residents of [[Australia]]. The IGA defines 'reasonable diligence' in the following ways:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* Whether the operator informed potential customers about the law preventing operators offering Interactive Gambling services to Australian residents.
* Whether a customer's contracts with the online gambling operators stated that the customer could not use the service whilst physically present in Australia
* Whether the customers had to provide personal details such as address and whether the customers' details suggested whether they were residents of Australia

'''Online wagering'''

There is some leniency in the Interactive Gambling Act that means not all online gambling was prohibited.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} For example, [[sports betting]] through licensed operators is still legal as long as the betting occurs prior to the sporting event starting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gambling.com/online-casinos/articles/online-gambling-in-australia Online Gambling in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; – this way the individual is not gambling 'interactively'. Online lotteries are also legal according to the Act, as long as they are not the 'instant-win' style scratch cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realmoneyaction.com/the-state-of-online-play/ | title=The State of Online Play | publisher=RMA | accessdate=2014-04-08 | author=Williams, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advertising'''

The IGA made it an offence to advertise an interactive gambling service or product - the advertising ban extended across all forms of media (from electronic to print).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.holdingredlich.com/sports-law/advertising-and-promotion-of-gambling-in-sport | title=Advertising and promotion of gambling in sport | publisher=Holding Redlich | date=3 July 2013 | accessdate=8 April 2014 | author=Loeliger, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Complaints'''

The IGA has a formal complaints process that is managed by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] in which people can register any concerns regarding the advertising of Interactive gambling products.

'''Act review'''

On 24 August 2011, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, released a discussion paper for the review of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The main reasons for reviewing the document are:
* the expansion of online gambling market and the possibility of subsequent growth of problem gambling
* the adequacy of the provisions of the Act to the emerging new technologies
* the necessity to develop an approach to minimisation of negative aspects of online gambling
* the necessity to analyse social, financial and jurisdictional aspects of interactive gambling services in regulated environment
* the necessity to analyse the findings of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform inquiry into interactive and online gambling and gambling advertising and the Productivity Commission Inquiry Report on Gambling
The final report has to be presented by the first half of 2012, subject to the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform reporting by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbcde.gov.au/broadband/online_gambling/2011_review_of_the_interactive_gambling_act_2001 Terms of reference for the review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jungle tourism''' is a subcategory of [[adventure travel]] defined by active multifaceted physical means of travel in the [[jungle]] regions of the earth. Although similar in many respects to [[adventure travel]], jungle tourism pertains specifically to the context of region, culture and activity. According to the ''Glossary of Tourism Terms'', jungle tours have become a major component of green tourism in tropical destinations and are a relatively recent phenomenon of Western international tourism. 

Of the regions that take part in tourism-driven [[sustainable development]] practices and [[eco tourism]], Mexican, Central and South American practices are the most pervasive in the industry; notably Mayan jungle excursions. Other regions include jungle territories in [[Africa]], [[Australia]], and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].

== Central and South America ==
[[Image:Chichen-Itza-Castillo-Seen-From-East.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Chichen Itza]] in [[Mexico]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]]]]
[[Image:Tikalpano.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]]]]
[[Image:CopanRuins.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Copán]] in [[Honduras]]]]

The majority of jungle tour operators are concentrated in what is known as the Mayan World or "Ruta Maya". The Mayan World encompasses five different countries that hosted the entirety of the [[Mayan Civilization]]: [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. Most tours consist of visits to popular Mayan archaeological sites such as [[Tikal]], [[Guatemala]], [[Chichen Itza]], and [[Copan]]. These day visits will usually consist of a guided tour of a heavily tourist-concentrated Mayan and archaeological site. Tikal and Chichen Itza are prime examples of popular day-visit sites. Such sites involve a tour guide, designated either by the state government or by a private company, for the tourists. These tour guides are predominantly trained professionals, certified to take large parties of fifty through heavily populated archaeological sites.  [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]] are also popular destinations for this type of adventure travel. 

Although most of the visits to these more prominent sites involve day trips, there are also many jungle tour operators that showcase less-known, remote Mayan jungle ruins such as Nakum, [[Yaxha]], and [[El Mirador]]. These tours involve much more preparation, time and funding to explore as they are usually in very remote and generally inaccessible regions of the Mayan jungles. These ruins and sites are reached by alternative and physically taxing means of travel such as bicycle, canoe, horseback or hiking. This is what essentially differentiates jungle tourism from any other sort of adventure travel tours. There are several [[tour operator]]s that will employ the use of machetes during tours.

Another difference is that the majority of tour operators that travel deep into the Central and South American jungle will cap the number of persons traveling in the group at ten to fifteen. This is done to minimize the impact on the jungle flora and fauna. Federal laws in some countries prohibit any given group large than fifteen people traveling through the Mayan jungle, a generally protected region, but limited resources for enforcing such laws have allowed such practices to occur under the radar.

In [[Guatemala]] it has become very popular to hike through the jungle of the Mayan Biosphere due to the discovery of El Mirador, also known as the Lost City of Maya. There are no roads. Many take a quick flight from Flores while others hike through the jungles of the department of Petén. Groups should be smaller than 15 people in order not to reduce the impact on the environment.

'''''Life Is Cheap... But Toilet Paper Is Expensive''''' is a 1989 film directed by [[Wayne Wang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Is Cheap...

It won an award at the 1990 [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=International Film Festival Rotterdam |title=KNF Award |url=http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/programme/awards/knf_award/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307232116/http://www.filmfestivalrotterdam.com/professionals/programme/awards/knf_award |archivedate=2013-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:WAYNEWANG1980SF2.tif|thumb|Director Wayne Wang in 1982]]
The film was the subject of controversy when it originally received an [[X rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the distributor, Silverlight Entertainment, chose to release it without this rating and with a self-anointed adults-only A rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|title=Distributor Rejects X Rating, Gives Its Adult Film an A|date=July 25, 1990|first=David|last=Fox|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-25/entertainment/ca-1225_1_adult-rating}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their TV show for the week of August 13–17, 1990, the late film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] praised the decision to apply the A rating since it was a concept they had often discussed on ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' in the context of harshly criticizing the MPAA's standards of forcing serious films aimed at adult audiences to either undergo damaging edits to receive [[MPAA Film Rating System|R ratings]] or be locked out of most theatrical and advertising outlets. Both critics, however, also said the film itself was not very good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://siskelandebert.org/video/YD6AS1NMBDSX/Flatliners--Young-Guns-II--The-Two-Jakes-1990|title = Flatliners / Young Guns II / The Two Jakes (1990).|date = |accessdate = August 12, 2015|website = Siskel &amp; Ebert|publisher = |last = |first = |at = Event begins at 17:46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for anyone who lived in Hong Kong during the preceding five years, the movie was incredibly funny, a series of Hong Kong insider jokes, as well as moving, with a big storyline about what families went through to get precious Western passports.

==Plot summary==
A man is hired, by people he believes to be gangsters, to deliver a briefcase from America to Hong Kong.

==Cast==

* [[Raja Chaudhary]] and [[Sambhavna Seth]] abused each other before getting really intimate.

==Season 3==
{{Main|Bigg Boss (Hindi season 3)}}

* In the third season, housemate [[Vindu Dara Singh]] was often credited as [[Akshay Kumar]]'s favourite housemate after playing Kumar’s sidekick in “[[Kambakkht Ishq]]”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masala.com/15624-akshay-plays-godfather-to-vindu-dara-singh |title=Akshay plays godfather to Vindu Dara Singh |publisher=Masala.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming good friends with him. With being hated by fellow inmates inside the house for his conduct accompanied by the resentment against him from the audiences [[Vindu Dara Singh|Vindu]] survived seven evictions after consecutively getting nominated from eighth week onwards. Vindu went on to win the season and was also announced the most stylish and bold contestant consequently winning a [[Chevrolet Cruze]] and Rs. 1 [[crore]].

* Contestant [[Kamal Rashid Khan]] had caused ruckus inside the house which lead to a controversial exit by makers after he threw a bottle and [[Rohit Verma]] but later hit [[Shilpa Shetty]]'s sister, [[Shamita Shetty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/Bigg-Boss-expels-Kamaal-Khan/articleshow/5147730.cms|title=Bigg Boss expels Kamaal R Khan|date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season 4==
{{Main|Bigg Boss (Hindi season 4)}}

* TV actors [[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] and [[Ali Merchant]] were paid Rs.50 lakh to get married on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sara Khan and Ali Merchant to get paid to marry on 'Bigg Boss'  |  url=http://m.indiatoday.in/story/sara-khan-and-ali-merchant-to-get-paid-to-marry-on-bigg-boss/1/119422.html|publisher=[[India Today]]     }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding is considered forbidden in [[Islam]], because Sara Khan and Ali Merchant were already married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/sara-ali-wedding-against-islam/story-ULOIHfHmJuzQcboAR62gHP.html|title=Sara-Ali wedding against Islam|publisher =[[Hindustan Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Merchant's mother, Salma, however, said Muslim law permitted the same couple to remarry as many times as they wished to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other//amp_articleshow/16072625.cms|title= BIGG MISTAKE, SAY MUSLIM LEADERS|publisher =[[Mumbai Mirror]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  [[Pakistan]]i actress [[Veena Malik]] was involved in physical relationship with [[Ashmit Patel]].&lt;ref name='pinkvilla1'&gt;{{cite web|title= Bigg Boss 11: From KRK to Swami Om, meet Bigg Boss' most controversial contestants ever|   url=https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news-gossip/bigg-boss-11-krk-swami-om-meet-bigg-boss-most-controversial-contestants-ever-387178?amp|publisher =PinkVilla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Bigg Boss (Season 4)|fourth season]], TV actress Sara Khan objected to the Bigg Boss' behaviour towards fellow-housemate [[Dolly Bindra]]. Ever since [[Dolly Bindra]] re-entered the house, there had been quite a bit of a change in her stance and attitude towards the inmates of the house. Dolly became quite polite and got some benefits like she was made the queen immediately after she re-entered, thereby enabling her to get certain benefits that the others couldn't even dream of. Thus, with almost everyone quite flabbergasted, Sara  protested against partiality towards Dolly. Sara kept on complaining that 'Bigg Boss' was not fair at which [[Samir Soni]], who too, had re-entered agreed with what Sara had to say. [[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara]] was later strictly warned by the Bigg Boss and host [[Salman Khan]] regarding these vague accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontierindia.net/big-boss-4-sara-khan-accuses-big-boss-of-being-partial-to-dolly-bindra |title=Big Boss 4 : Sara Khan accuses Big Boss of being partial to Dolly Bindra |publisher=Frontier India |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season 5==
{{Main|Bigg Boss (Hindi season 5)}}

* Pooja Missra who was constantly bullied on the show was ejected. She gave her fellow contestant Siddarth Bhardwaj a little push, which the makers decided to evict her. However, the TRP became really low, as the show started losing its viewership. The TRP even came at 0.69 at one point. &lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/Bigg-Boss-5-Pooja-Missra-thrown-out/opinions/10880054.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season 6==
{{Main|Bigg Boss (Hindi season 6)}}

* Soon after the entry of Kashif Qureshi, a common man chosen via auditions held across India, as an inmate of the house the whole exercise of selecting an unknown person to be part of ''Bigg Boss'' seemed to have come into question and has been reportedly a planned one. After Kashif was selected from the three short-listed hopefuls to enter the house the media scrutinized every detail that linked to Kashif's background. Unexpectedly Qureshi was found to personally know [[Salman Khan]] since he was shooting ''[[Wanted (2009 film)|Wanted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/idiotbox/bigg-boss-6-common-man-kashif-qureshi-s-entry-courtesy-salman-khan_120823.htm|title=Bigg Boss 6: Common man Kashif Qureshi's entry courtesy Salman Khan?|work=[[Zee News]] |accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contestant Iman Siddiqui made a statement about host Salman Khan that Salman Khan owed him money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imam Siddique slams Salman Khan|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/tabloid/imam-siddique-slams-salman-khan/story-OC9ZTVPoImgQdODYMsh1KP.html|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also removed his clothes after a midnight fight with his co-participant.

==Season 7==
{{Main|Bigg Boss (Hindi season 7)}}

* [[Armaan Kohli]] was arrested from the set of the show when a complaint filed by British singer-actress [[Sofia Hayat]] for allegedly assaulting her during their stay in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-bigg-boss-7-actor-armaan-kohli-arrested-for-assaulting-fellow-inmate-sofia-hayat-twitteratti-hail-action-1936386|title=Bigg Boss 7: Actor Armaan Kohli arrested for 'assaulting' fellow inmate Sofia Hayat; Twitteratti hail action |publisher =[[DNA India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The host Salman Khan was caught favoring [[Tanisha Mukherjee]] instead of [[Kushal Tandon]]  despite her unarguably violent behavior and Khan supported all of Mukherjee’s wrongdoings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/salman-khan-explains-his-outburst-at-kushal-on-bigg-boss-7/|title=Salman Khan explains his outburst at Kushal on Bigg Boss 7|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Indian Express]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season 8==
{{Main|Bigg Boss (Hindi season 8)}}

* [[Karishma Tanna]] had a big fight with [[Gautam Gulati]] after he abused her during the Hijack task in the second week after Sonali's eviction. This lead to whole house turning against Gautam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/ugly-fight-between-karishma-tanna-gautam-gulati-bigg-boss-8-has-finally-arrived/|title=‘Bigg Boss 8’ witnesses first ugly fight between Karishma Tanna, Gautam Gulati|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The introduction of special panel members on occasional eviction episodes came under controversy during the season. The production team was mainly accused for violating the concept of the original ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' franchise and allowing interference from external agents into the house environment. The second week saw appearances from [[VJ Andy|Andy]] and [[Kamya Punjabi|Kamya]] who were seen forcing their opinions on the housemates by calling it a guide to their stay. However Kamya, on a relative off-note, went on to malign targeted housemates' stance and reputation by wording her take as the 'viewer's point of view'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkvilla.com/tvtags/salman-khan/bigg-boss-8-dapper-salman-diwali-mood-grills-contestants-not-supporting-sonali|title=Bigg Boss 8: Dapper Salman in diwali mood grills contestants for not supporting Sonali!|publisher=Pinkvilla.com|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the episode's airing critics termed her conduct as 'adding script to a rather spontaneous programme'. A similar incident took place in the fourth week where [[Sargun Mehta]]'s argument with Minissha received much backlash from viewers.&lt;ref name="bollywoodlife.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/bigg-boss-8-gauhar-khan-gets-into-a-war-of-words-with-minissha-lamba/|title=Bigg Boss 8: Gauhar Khan gets into a war of words with Minissha Lamba! – Bollywood News &amp; Gossip, Movie Reviews, Trailers &amp; Videos at Bollywoodlife.com|publisher=[[BollywoodLife.com]] |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glamcapture.com/gauahar-khan-and-sargun-mehta-make-an-appearance-in-big-boss-8/|title=Gauahar Khan and Sargun Mehta make an appearance in Big Boss 8 Weekend Ka Vaar|work=GlamCapture.Com|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignarchives.com/gauhar-khan-and-sargun-mehta-as-special-guests-on-bigg-boss-8-weekend-ka-vaar-episode/|title=Gauhar Khan and Sargun Mehta as special guests on Bigg Boss 8 Weekend Ka Vaar Episode!|author=Sidharth Banerjee|work=Bollywood IGN|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite demands and complaints from viewers, the broadcaster declined the opportunity to explain the addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colors.in.com/in/biggboss/videos/gauahar-comes-to-weekend-ka-vaar-with-salman-bb8-10101228-3.html|title=Bigg Boss season 8 Videos -Gauahar comes to Weekend ka Vaar with Salman, Bigg Boss 8 Reality TV Show Videos, Clips |work=Colors.in.com|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Salman Khan]] was also criticized for siding with [[Sonali Raut]] without a hint of care for housemates' or viewers' opinion and judgement citing the live feed as enough proof for evaluation. However viewers expressed disapprobation since the live feed being released on the channel's website was only broadcasting previously recorded content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/entertainment/bollywood/bigg-boss-8-salman-khan-grills-karishma-tanna-diandra-17806.html|title=Bigg Boss 8: Salman Khan again grills Karishma Tanna, declares Gauahar Khan to be the Bigg Boss (view pics)|publisher=[[India TV]] |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2014, on [[Gautam Gulati]]'s birthday, [[Diandra Soares]] had took him into the bathroom which lead to another controversial topic of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.in/bigg-boss-8-gautam-gulati-diandra-soares-bathroom-scene-shocks-viewers-615399|title=Bigg Boss 8: Gautam Gulati, Diandra Soares Flirt in Bathroom: Viewers Blast them|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Diandra's eviction, there was another controversial topic after reports started saying she was pregnant when she reportedly went to the hospital but later she denied all of the rumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/shocking-bigg-boss-8-is-diandra-soares-pregnant-with-gautam-gulatis-child-220846/|title=Shocking!

* [[Ali Quli Mirza]] was trying to escape from the show by climbing up the rooftop to escape the house where he was slapped by [[Sonali Raut]] for passing inappropriate remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/bigg-boss-celebs-who-were-thrown-out-of-the-house/photostory/45041875.cms|title=Bigg Boss: Celebs who were thrown out of the house|accessdate=9 December 2017|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* This series was marked by a number of downfalls for the ''Big Brother'' franchise in India. The continuation of the regular celebrity season into an All-Stars version garnered initial media and viewer attention but the ratings for the show decreased to an all-time low with the final only managing to score a [[Target rating point|TRP]] of 2.82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-trp-report-bigg-boss-8-does-not-live-up-to-the-mark-2025485|title=TRP Report: 'Bigg Boss 8' does not live up to the mark - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=13 October 2014|publisher=[[DNA India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official tabulators for the show being [[Ernst &amp; Young]] allegedly had formed the final result based on a number of votes which was more than any of the previous seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/satyamev-jayate-3-has-better-trp-ratings-bigg-boss-8-aamir-khan-beats-salman-613913|title='Satyamev Jayate 3' has Better TRP Ratings than 'Bigg Boss 8': Aamir Khan Beats Salman|first=Shekhar H|last=Hooli|publisher=[[IBTimes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional statement released by the firm revealed that the percentage separating the final two contenders was extravagantly huge, with [[Gautam Gulati]] winning by an unprecedented margin, that was larger than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-bigg-boss-halla-bol-gautam-gulati-is-the-winner-2057107|title=Bigg Boss Halla Bol: Gautam Gulati crowned the winner - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=31 January 2015|publisher=[[DNA India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Priyanka Jagga, after creating fights in the house and saying nasty things to [[Lopamudra Raut]] and [[Antara Biswas|Monalisa]] had got kicked out by host [[Salman Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/bigg-boss-10-salman-khan-throws-priyanka-jagga-out-of-the-house/articleshow/56150804.cms|title=Bigg Boss 10: Salman Khan throws Priyanka Jagga out of the house|date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Contestant Swami Om put his urine on co-contestants Bani and Rohan. Later, the makers of the show evicted Swami Om. He has had several exits before on the show but later came back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bigg-boss-season-10/bigg-boss-10-swami-om-pees-bani-and-rohan-bigg-boss-evicts-him-4459807/lite/|title=Bigg Boss 10: Swami Om pees on Bani and Rohan, Bigg Boss evicts him|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Indian Express]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The fight between [[Gurbani Judge|Bani J]] and [[Lopamudra Raut]] got ugly after the BB Call Centre" which lead to Bani trying to strangle Lopamudra's neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bigg-boss-season-10/bigg-boss-10-enemies-bani-j-lopamudra-raut-get-into-scuffle-4471124/|title=Bigg Boss 10: Enemies Bani J, Lopamudra Raut get into scuffle|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The voting rules for the final week were changed abruptly following [[Rohan Mehra]]'s eviction. The previous rule which allowed multiple votes, capped at 99, per IP and phone number were brought down to 1. This created uproar from the viewers who were not officially or appropriately informed of the tweak. The voters were not refunded money for any additional votes they had made since 1 vote submission from online and offline sources was recorded and the rest were discarded. [[Viacom 18]] received 570 complaints during the night of the final when Manu Punjabi was shown to have quit the competition before the results were announced. Realising that the final was pre-recorded with the outcome known to the producers before the episode aired the viewers were appalled that voting lines for Manu were kept open throughout. The complaints increased overnight to a record 1140 after the final had finished airing. Manveer Gurjar, a commoner who ended up winning the season, received one of the highest number of votes in the history of the show. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Priyanka is a progressive maid, who enjoys complete social media presence, is tech-savvy as she uses a high-end [[iPhone]]. She is the woman of the hour who breaks all the stereotypes. Being far more level-headed and sophisticated than her masters themselves, she shows her mistress how to sweep the thick and thins of life under the rug with her witty solutions.
She is back in the second season of MAID IN INDIA, with twice the fun, twice the oomph and twice the craziness. But this time to add to her trouble, enters Tia, Sandhya’s sister, who is an air hostess for a leading American Airline. Tia’s uber-modern approach towards things annoy Priyanka and the game of one-upmanship begins between the two. The person to get caught in the crossfire are Sahil and Sandhya. We start the second season with Tia entering the house and having an instant disagreement with Priyanka setting in motion an uproariously funny chain of events. And to add to the fun, things get a little odd for Sahil who now has to deal with three woman in his life knowing that at times he’s not even able to deal with one. Sandhya’s constant bickering, Tia’s sensual nature and Priyanka’s flirtatious nature add up to more miseries in his life as whatever he does, Sandhya still beats the hell out of him. So expect the second season of Maid In India to be more funny, more raunchy and much more crazy than it’s dhinchak first season.

'''''Meat Is Murder: An Illustrated Guide To Cannibal Culture''''' is a book originally published in 1998, which examines [[cannibalism]] in myth, true crime, and film.

== Description ==
The author of ''Meat Is Murder!'', [[Mikita Brottman]] received her Ph.D. in English Language and Literature from [[Oxford University]],&lt;ref name="Pacifica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacifica.edu/faculty_staff.html |title=Core and Adjunct Faculty |accessdate=2008-11-05 |publisher=[[Pacifica Graduate Institute]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211150303/http://www.pacifica.edu/faculty_staff.html |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jhu"&gt;{{cite web |first=Mikita|last=Brottman|year=2000|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/biography/v023/23.1brottman.html|title="Everybody Loves Somebody": The A&amp;e "Rat Pack" Biographies

"Meat is Murder! An illustrated guide to Cannibal Culture. (Book Reviews)." ''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]'' (March 22, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''Meat is Murder!'' is broken into three sections dealing with different aspects of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="creationbooks"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.creationbooks.com/frameset.asp?p=http://www.creationbooks.com/titles/1840680407.html | title=Meat is Murder!

This aspect of the subject is further broken down into sections dealing with dietary, symbolic, and hunger.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt; Criminal and psychotic cannibalism make up the second part of the book, featuring descriptions of notorious real-life cannibals. Cannibalism as it is portrayed in popular culture finishes this section of the book.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt; The last third of the book discusses the portrayal of cannibalism in film.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt; The first  part of this section covers documentaries and art-house films such as [[Paul Bartel]]'s ''[[Eating Raoul]]'' (1982) and [[Peter Greenaway]]'s ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt; The second chapter of this section of the book covers films on individuals who cannibalize, and the third chapter is on cannibal families or societies.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt;
[[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and [[Ruggero Deodato]]'s ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980) are among the films given coverage in this chapter.&lt;ref name="headpress"/&gt;

In the section on cannibal cinema, [[Mikita Brottman]] asserts that the subject is more widespread than is commonly assumed.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt; She shows that cannibalism is a subject which has been portrayed in all time periods through film history, in films such as the 1908 silent comedy ''King of the Cannibal Islands'', through [[David F. Friedman]]'s exploitation "documentary" ''Cannibal Island'' (1956), through ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973), ''[[Alive (1993 film)|Alive]]'' (1993), and [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001).&lt;ref name="Celluloid"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mikitabrottman.com/articles/CelluloidCannibals.html | title=Celluloid Cannibals That Feed Our Darkest Fears | publisher=mikitabrottman.com | accessdate=2008-11-07 | last=Brottman | first=Mikita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical appraisal==
''Humanities and Social Sciences Online'' calls the ''Meat is Murder!'' a "gruesome but fascinating tour through the anthropological, criminological, literary, and cinematic history of cannibalism".&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt;
Reviewer Philip Simpson judges that the book is "compelling" and takes a scholarly approach to its subject matter.&lt;ref name="h-net"/&gt; 
The ''Headpress Guide to the Counter Culture'' (2004) points out that Brottman is not condescending to her subject matter, but criticizes the book for its lengthy film synopses. The review also deems the illustrations in the book to be of a poor quality.&lt;ref name="headpress"/&gt;
''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]'' writes that Brottman's theories as to the communal ties created through the horror of the subject of cannibalism are "argued persuasively".&lt;ref name="journal pop culture"/&gt;
 
Reviews reprinted at the book's publisher's site include ''Total Film'', which calls Brottman's work, "worryingly exhaustive, [and] hungrily informed," and ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' which writes that the book is "an informed study of both cultural and cinematic cannibalism... [which] combines meticulous research with a fascinating insight into the origins of cannibalism, infamous real-life perpetrators and the celluloid treatment of the subject."&lt;ref name="headpress"/&gt; ''Film Review'' labeled the book, "An excellent study of cannibal culture."&lt;ref name="headpress"/&gt;

The '''Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF)''' is a [[New England]] independent [[professional wrestling promotion]] based in [[Melrose, Massachusetts]]. Founded in January 2001 by promoters Dan Mirade &amp; Neil Manolian, the MWF is one of the top promotions in the [[Northeastern United States]] along with [[Chaotic Wrestling]], [[New England Championship Wrestling]] and [[Top Rope Promotions|Yankee Pro Wrestling]].

Among the wrestlers who have appeared in the promotion include independent wrestlers [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]], [[A.J. Styles]], [[Kofi Kingston]], [[Joey Mercury]], [[Antonio Thomas (wrestler)|Antonio Thomas]], [[Chris Sabin]], [[Alex Shelley]], [[Rick Fuller]], [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]], and [[RJ Brewer|"Hurricane" John Walters]].

Due to its close working relationship with [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]], the promotion is one of several on the [[independent circuit]] to regularly feature a large number of former [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] veterans including [[Road Dogg|"Road Dog" Jesse James Armstrong]], [[Scotty 2 Hotty]], [[Al Snow]], [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) and MWF President [[Paul Bearer]]. Former [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[The Iron Sheik]] served as MWF Lt. Commissioner. Others who have also made appearances include [[The Missing Link (wrestler)|The Missing Link]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Ox Baker]].

John Cena, Sr., the father of multi-time World Heavyweight Champion [[John Cena]], took control of the promotion in September 2007 after [[Buyout|buying out]] Chairman Neil Manolian's partial stock in the company.  Cena became MWF South President after a confrontation with Paul Bearer at Soul Survivor VIII.

==History==
The Millennium Wrestling Federation was founded by Dan Mirade &amp; Neil Manolian in January 2001, partly founded in memory of longtime Boston promoter [[Tony Rumble]], and held their first show on September 28 of that year. Based in [[Melrose, Massachusetts]], the promotion regularly began running shows in the greater Boston area for over a year before the debut of its weekly half-hour television program ''MWF Xtra'' on [[Labor Day]] weekend. The show was hosted by Dan Mirade and MWF on-air personalities The Jackal &amp; Dr. Brad Von Johnson as well as special guest [[Tiger Mulligan]], who would later win the promotion's Heavyweight Championship defeating "2Xtreme" John Brooks in the tournament finals of the "Soul Survivor" competition at the ''Soul Survivor I'' supercard to crown the first MWF Heavyweight Champion and was presented the championship belt by [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/hwtmwf.html|title=MWF Heavyweight Title History|year=2005|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2002, [[Gary Michael Cappetta]] &amp; [[Superstar Billy Graham]] appeared at a MWF benefit show at the America Civic Center in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]]. The card also featured Road Dogg and the MWF debuts of "Die Hard" Eddie Edwards &amp; Todd Hanson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caulifloweralleyclub.org/story4.htm |title=Bobby the Brain's Book is Out, and Drawing Rave Notice |author=Kenyon, J.

A second show, ''MWF ULTRA'', was also introduced with its first episode on October 12, 2003 but eventually became a monthly, one-hour special in October 2004. Its guests have included Johnny Fabulous, Karl Lauer, [[Scotty 2 Hotty]], [[Barry Darsow|Demolition Smash]], The Iron Sheik, [[Paul Bearer|Percy Pringle]] and actress [[Brigitte Nielsen]].&lt;ref name="JWalsh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/5678articles/214232216.shtml|title=Independent Wrestling Results|author=Walsh, James|date=2008-05-31|publisher=WrestlingEpicenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prunderground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prunderground.com/00184/noc-event-fanfest-621-june-ultra-w-abyss-walters-vs-edwards-bauer-vito-join-army-personal-sheik-shoots/|title=NOC Event &amp; Fanfest 6/21 - June ULTRA w/ Abyss, Walters vs Edwards - Bauer &amp; Vito Join Army - Personal Sheik Shoots|date=2008-06-15|publisher=PRunderground.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its wide use of regional [[cable TV]] throughout the New England area, the promotion also began broadcasting its shows via [[Streaming media|internet broadcast]] and [[In Demand|in-demand]] in May 2005 and became available in over 60 countries. That same year, the two more championships were created with [[Eddie Edwards (wrestler)|"Die Hard" Eddie Edwards]] winning a tournament for the MWF Television Championship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/tvtmwf.html|title=MWF Television Title History|year=2005|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at ''MWF Iron Sheik Appreciation Night'', Todd Hanson and Beau Douglas won a Tag Team Royal Rumble eliminating The Islanders for the titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ttmwf.html|title=MWF Tag Team Title History|year=2005|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MWF Heavyweight Championship, which had since become vacant, was won by Dylan Kage when he defeated [[Wagner Brown|Slyck Wagner Brown]] on the first episode of ''MWF ULTRA''.

On November 11, 2005, the ''Soul Survivor III'' supercard featured MWF Heavyweight Champion Dylan Kage joining forces with Paul Bearer defeating Luis Ortiz, and MWF Television Champion Eddie Edwards defending his title against Fergal Devitt &amp; John Walters in the main event in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]]. The show also featured [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]],  [[The Missing Link (wrestler)|The Missing Link]] and [[Ox Baker]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/25598/411-Indy-Report-W--Nate-Stein.htm|title=411 Indy Report W/ Nate Stein|author=Stein, Nate|date=2005-11-01|publisher=411mania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; NWA Ireland wrestler [[Fergal Devitt]] appeared at several MWF events while in New England during his 2005-2006 US tour. Facing Eddie Edwards and John Walters in a triple treat for the MWF TV Title, the match ended after 15 minutes when Edwards pinned Walters for the title. This match, gained considerable attention on the US independent scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwaukhammerlockwrestling.co.uk/hl-news.html |title=More On Fergal Devitt's US Tour |date=November 2007|work=NWA-UK Hammerlock News |publisher=NWAUKHammerlockWrestling.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involved in fundraising and other community projects, the Millennium Wrestling Federation's on-going ''Keep The Kids Off The Streets'' Campaign presents live wrestling events in [[inner city]] neighborhoods. Its efforts in fundraising activities has raised tens of thousands of dollars for a number of charities and non-profit organizations including the [[American Red Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lincolntimesnews.com/Spo_11-01/11-21_Briefs/11-21_briefs.html |title=Millennium Wrestling Federation in town |date=2001-11-21 |work=Sports |publisher=Lincoln Times-News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Special Olympics]]&lt;ref name="JWalsh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prunderground"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1wrestling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1wrestling.com/news/newsline.asp?news=32080 |title=President Cena (SR) Looking For New Athletes! }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWalsh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingepicenter.com/1232008articles/206650631.shtml |title=TNA Forces NOC Postponement - The Iron Sheik Returns|author=Walsh, Caroline |date=2008-03-04|publisher=WrestlingEpicenter.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wrestle-Zone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestle-zone.co.uk/us-wrestling-news-a-results/37-us-wrestling-news-a-results/323-independent-wrestling-news-aamp-notes.html |title=Independent Wrestling News &amp; Notes |date=March 2004 |publisher=Wrestle-Zone.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708135705/http://www.wrestle-zone.co.uk/us-wrestling-news-a-results/37-us-wrestling-news-a-results/323-independent-wrestling-news-aamp-notes.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has received extensive press coverage from [[The Boston Globe]], [[The Howard Stern Show]], [[WXKS-FM|KISS 108 FM]], the [[Eddie Andelman|Eddie Andelman Show]], [[CN8 Sports Pulse]] and [[ESPN Radio]]. The promotion has also been involved in promoting other non-wrestling events in Boston such as hosting the Boston premiere of ''[[The Condemned]]'' (including a Q&amp;A with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|"Stone Cold" Steve Austin]]) and The Iron Sheik's appearance on [[Toronto]]'s [[Hi-Fi Network]] and promoting the Wrestling's Living Legends reunion on the morning of [[WrestleMania 23]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The event also featured [[Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) in their first appearance in sixteen years.

In September 2007, MWF Chairman Neil Manolian sold his share of the promotion to [[John Cena, Sr.]], giving him majority control of the company, and as a result, was named MWF President three months later, replacing on-air personality The Jackal who had been appointed to the position at the beginning of the year.&lt;ref name="NWA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nwa-wildside.com/news/viewnews.cgi?category=all&amp;id=1168272045 |title=Bill Behrens NWA Notes for 1-8-07|author=Behrens, Bill|date=2007-01-08|work=NWA Wildside / Worldwide News |publisher=NWA-Wildside.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first half of 2008, a number of wrestlers from [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] appeared for the promotion. On March 29, the promotion held its first show in [[Nashua, New Hampshire]] at ''Live Free or Die''.&lt;ref name="CWalsh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wrestle-Zone"/&gt;

On June 21, the MWF held the final professional wrestling event at the Good Time Emporium in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] prior to its close at the end of the month. The ''"Night of Champions"'' supercard included MWF Heavyweight Champion Todd Hanson successfully defending his title against Abyss, [[Rick Fuller]] and Executioner Milonas in a [[Monster's Ball#Non-TNA Monster's Ball|Monster's Ball match]].  in the main event.

==Controversy==

===Iron Sheik===
A regular on the independent circuit since the early 1990s, the Iron Sheik became associated with the MWF soon after its establishment and was later named the MWF Lt. Commissioner.  On August 5, 2005, the Iron Sheik, Dan Mirade and MWF Commissioner Dr. Brad Von Johnson were involved in a serious car accident when they were hit head on by a drunk driver following an event, ''Iron Sheik Appreciation Night'', in [[Blackstone, Massachusetts]]. The Iron Sheik caused a disturbance at the event earlier refusing to sign autographs or to actively participate in the show going on a drug induced episode in the parking lot locking himself in a wrestlers car.  The three were later treated at a local hospital and the Iron Sheik later claimed he might never wrestle again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kappapublishing.com/wrestling/pages/wrestlingframe.html |title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated: Wrestling History |author=Pro Wrestling Illustrated |authorlink=Pro Wrestling Illustrated |year=2007 |publisher=PWI-Online.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024004856/http://www.kappapublishing.com/wrestling/pages/wrestlingframe.html |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, during an MWF Studio Shoot Interview [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot interview]] with Dan Mirade, the Iron Sheik went on a tirade when asked about his appearance at [[WrestleMania III]] with [[Nikolai Volkoff]] and their match against [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]] ([[Brian Blair|B. Brian Blair]] and [[Jim Brunzell]]) making several controversial and derogatory statements in reference to Brian Blair. This interview was later released on a three-hour [[DVD]] and has since become popular on websites such as [[YouTube]] and led to his appearances on [[Howard Stern]].  The video has been seen by over one and a half million fans. In 2005, the Iron Sheik was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].

In 2008, the MWF conducted another shoot interview with the Iron Sheik. Similarly released on DVD, the Sheik verbally attacked [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]], making remarks about what he'd do to the Warrior's daughter if she was 18.  He later made a Christmas challenge to [[Michael Richards|Kramer]], footage from the infamous ''Iron Sheik Appreciation Night'' and a ''"drug induced"'' telephone interview. The Sheik was attacked by the MWF Stalker, claiming he had gotten [[Short-term effects of alcohol|alcohol poisoning]] when an MWF cameraman had given him [[beer]] in his hotel room.&lt;ref name="NWA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwa-wildside.com/news/search.cgi?category=1&amp;keyword=backbreaker&amp;page=4|title=NWA Notes: Page 4|publisher=NWA Wildside|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jim Neidhart===
On December 28, 2001, the promotion held its second live event in [[Revere, Massachusetts]] which was to raise money for [[Butch Miller (wrestler)|Butch Miller]], better known as Bushwhacker Butch of [[The Bushwhackers]], who was hospitalized from an untreated [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]]. Among those who headlined the show included [[Brian Gerard James|Road Dogg]] and ECW wrestlers [[James Maritato|Little Guido]], [[Mike Bucci|Super Nova]] and [[Chris Chetti]]. ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'' finalist [[Christopher Nowinski]] also made a surprise appearance.

A few weeks prior to the event, [[Jim Neidhart|Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart]] contacted the promotion via [[e-mail]] offering to appear at the show. Neidhart also said he would donate an official [[The Hart Foundation|Hart Foundation]] [[leather jacket]] for the raffle being held. In exchange, the promotion agreed to provide transportation. When the company was unable to afford to fly him in from [[Calgary]], which would cost at least $1,200 (more than the cost of the actual fundraiser), Neidhart offered to sell his [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flyer miles]] for $500 which the promotion accepted.

The promotion received no contact from Neidhart after that point and, on the day of the fundraiser, Neidhart did not arrive. According to owner Dan Mirade, he was later told that Neidhart had been planning on coming to Boston to spend Christmas week with a "[[Groupie|ring rat]]". When she decided to spend Christmas with her family down south, Neidhart stayed in Calgary and did not return the money he received from the promotion.

Receiving no response to their e-mail and telephone messages, the promotion posted Neidhart's home phone number on the front page of the MWF website. The promotion, which had gotten a number of replies from fans asking for an explanation for Neidhart's absence, explained that they had not received word from Neidhart and suggested fans to confront Neidhart themselves.

Neidhart got in contact with the promotion soon after this and claimed that he had intended to send the money back, but now refused because they had ''"upset him"''. Neidhart eventually claimed in a later e-mail that he had sent the $500 to Butch Miller, however this was denied by both Butch Miller and longtime tag team partner [[Luke Williams (wrestler)|Luke Williams]]. Soon after seeing him on the [[WWE Raw#2007|Raw 15th anniversary show]], Dan Mirade wrote about the incident on his website and challenged Neidhart for an explanation however Neidhart has not responded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.danmirade.com/mirade-20071228neidhart.html |title=Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart:  A Real Piece Of S**t|author=Mirade, Dan|date=2007-12-28 |publisher=DanMirade.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the professional wrestling industry===
Mirade has been increasingly outspoken against both the increasing violence of "[[hardcore wrestling]]" as well as [[steroid]] and [[drug abuse]] which has resulted in the deaths of a high number of professional wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2007/07/12/distant_tragedy_could_affect_boston_wrestling_community/ |title=Distant tragedy could affect Boston wrestling community |author=Berger, J.M.|date=2007-07-12|publisher=[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Mirade also criticized certain ethical standards and business practices, particularly after the ring death of independent wrestler [[Daniel Quirk|Dan Quirk]], advocating some sort of system to regulate the professional wrestling industry.

:''"What most fans of mainstream wrestling don't realize is what a corrupt business it is that they're fans of... Back in the 'good ole days' not EVERYONE that wanted to be a professional wrestler could be one... There are dozens if not hundreds of 'schools' in operations in this country. How many of them are operated by a mark [a fan who believes that some or all of professional wrestling is real] that belongs sitting at home watching it on TV, someone that was never trained properly themselves?''

:''"These schools, will continue to mis-train and horrible shows will continue to ruin what the pros used to do... What's even sadder... is that there are many Dan Quirk situations waiting to happen. For his sake and his family's sake, I hope that wrestling can police itself and weed out those that don't belong."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flakmag.com/features/dws3.html |title=The Dead Wrestlers Society, Part III: Look For the Union Label |author=Frissore, Michael|date=2007-11-27|publisher=[[Flak Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tony Rumble Memorial Battle Royal==
The '''Tony Rumble Memorial Battle Royal''' is the main event held at the semi-annual memorial show for the late [[Tony Rumble]], a wrestler and longtime wrestling promoter in the New England area throughout the 1990s. Todd Hanson won the first on the November 22, 2003 MWF Ultra program.

The next battle royal was held at the MWF's ''Soul Survivor II'' and won by [[Bull Montana]], a close friend of Tony Rumble, on November 13, 2004. The third show was co-hosted by the MWF and [[Wrestling Superstars Live|AWA New England]] which was won by 72-year-old [[Ox Baker]]. This was his first wrestling match in several years. On August 4, 2007, Rick Fuller won the 4th annual Tony Rumble Memorial Battle Royal.

==Plot==
Ren Homura, a middle school student who moves back to his hometown with his mother and sister, but he apparently cannot remember much of his life there. After having to get his cellphone repaired, he finds that the repairman installed ''Monster Strike'' onto it, and he later is attacked by a man who forces him into a real life game of ''Monster Strike'', summoning a monster from within the game to attack Ren. Ren manages to summon a monster of his own, the diminutive dragon Oragon, and with help from his classmate Aoi Mizusawa, as well as an alter ego awoken by his own missing memories, Ren defeats the man's monster, seemingly freeing him from the control of an evil entity. This brings Ren into the world of the town's Monster Strike Stadium leagues, where people play ''Monster Strike'' in what appears to be real life but are advanced holograms, as well as Aoi's desire to reunite her friends Akira Kagetsuki and Minami Wakaba into becoming a team of ''Monster Strike'' players. However, Akira will not play on a team because Ren is nothing like their former fourth member Haruma, and the air-headed Minami has become possessed by the same evil presence that forced other people to attack Ren and Aoi.

The '''New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters''' ('''NZART''') is a non-profit organisation of [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[New Zealand]]. It represents New Zealand [[amateur radio operator]]s nationally and internationally. NZART is a founding member of the [[International Amateur Radio Union]]. It is an association of individual members, however those members are encouraged to form local branches.

Membership of NZART is voluntary; it is estimated that approximately 35% of New Zealand's licensed amateur radio operators belong.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  Members are represented by Councillors to the NZART Council, the executive body tasked with the business management of the association.

==History==

The New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters formed on 16 August 1926. In the same year, Gordon Smithson (Z1AF) made the first NZART broadcast. The first publication of ''Break-in'', the NZART journal, was in 1928. In 1929 NZART became a more powerful organisation, joining the [[International Amateur Radio Union]] and successfully lobbying the New Zealand Government for a reduction in the compulsory licensing fees.

In 1934 the Association became an incorporated society and in 1982 their membership numbers reached a high of 4,397. The first NZART written submission to the New Zealand government was in 1989 and related to the proposed ''Radicommunications Bill''. In 1998 the Association established the Radioscience Education Trust.&lt;ref name="History timeline"&gt;[http://www.nzvrs.pl.net/ccc/Orbell/milestones%20etc.pdf ''New Zealand Amateur Radio Milestones'' New Zealand Vintage Radio Society (Inc.) July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The NZART Council includes 12 executives. Three of these are the NZART President, Vice-President, and Immediate Past President. Regional councillors are elected to represent different geographic regions of New Zealand: three from the Northern District, three from the Central District, two from the Midland District, and one from the Southern District. The number of Councillors in each district is roughly representative of the number of licensed amateurs that they are directly accountable to in their respective geographic areas.

The NZART Council works with an appointed NZART Business Manager. The Business Manager is the only person employed by NZART (20 hrs per week) and is tasked with the day-to-day business operations of the association, including manning their office, located in [[Upper Hutt]], near [[Wellington]].

Additional officers reporting directly to NZART Council include the National Director [[Amateur Radio Emergency Communications]], The Engineering Licensing Group (ELG) and the Administration Liaison Officer (ALO), who is charged with liaison with the Radio Spectrum Management Group of the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).

==Relations with the New Zealand Government==

The NZART has performed an advocacy function, commenting on policy and planning initiatives proposed by the New Zealand government in the areas of radio licences,&lt;ref name="NZART submission"&gt;[http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/pdf-library/policy-and-planning/radio-spectrum/radio-licences-security-of-tenure/07.pdf ''Radio Licenses – Security of Tenure'' New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters Inc, 13 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; spectrum allocations for broadband wireless,&lt;ref name="NZART broadband submission"&gt;[http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/pdf-library/policy-and-planning/radio-spectrum/spectrum-allocations-for-broadband-wireless-access-1/sub%2025.pdf/view ''Spectrum Allocations for Broadband Wireless Access Discussion Paper'' New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters, 4 August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of digital communication.&lt;ref name="NZART Futures Submission"&gt;[http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/pdf-library/policy-and-planning/digital-futures-planning-for-digital-tv-and-new-uses/submissions/Digital%20Futures%20Submission%20-%20NZART.PDF/view ''Digital Futures Discussion Document'' New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters, 30 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The Association also contributed to the creation of EMF exposure standards in their role as member of the NZ RF Standard Committee.&lt;ref name="Gledhill"&gt;[http://www.who.int/peh-emf/meetings/southkorea/en/Martin.pdf ''EMF Exposure Standards in New Zealand'' Martin Gledhill, p 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Ministry of Economic Development's Radio Spectrum Management division was assisted by NZART and the local Coastguard Boating Education Service in the creation of an update to the Spectrum Management and Registration Technology (SMART) which allowed people to search online for radio operator information including callsigns.&lt;ref name="Certificate and callsign holders now searchable in SMART"&gt;[http://news.business.govt.nz/news/info/rsm/article/4892?COMPANIESOFFICE=31992f42d0291dc126860460864ea3d1 ''Certificate and callsign holders now searchable in SMART'' Ministry of Economic Development, Radio Spectrum Management, 5 December 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it was noted that there were some discrepancies between the SMART system and the callsign book produced by NZART.&lt;ref name="Discrepancies between RSM SMART online Register of Radio Frequencies and NZART Callbook"&gt;[http://news.business.govt.nz/news/info/rsm/article/9302?COMPANIESOFFICE=31992f42d0291dc126860460864ea3d1 ''Discrepancies between RSM SMART online Register of Radio Frequencies and NZART Callbook'' Ministry of Economic Development, Radio Spectrum Management, 31 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications and services ==
The official journal of the NZART is ''[[Break-In]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=463780 Break in at the National Library]&lt;/ref&gt; a bi-monthly publication containing articles of interest to the amateur radio community. Also, an annual publication known as the ''Call Book'' provides an index of licensed amateurs in New Zealand by [[call sign]], providing addresses for the purpose of contact acknowledgement ([[QSL card|QSL]]), as well as much other information useful to the New Zealand radio enthusiast. Other publications include ''Ham Shacks, Brass Pounders and Rag Chewers'', a history of amateur radio in New Zealand, published in 1997 with assistance from the [[New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs]] Historical Branch.

In 1980, NZART collaborated with author Jumbo Godfrey to produce a ''Basic radio training manual: a study course for the amateur radio operators''.&lt;ref name="Jumbo Godfrey"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JgTJMgAACAAJ&amp;dq=new+zealand+association+of+radio+transmitters&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yICDS7_EHo7q7APfwMA6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ ''Basic radio training manual: a study course for the amateur radio operators'' Jumbo Godfrey, New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association provides some educational services, such as providing demonstrative lectures on electromagnetic wave theory.&lt;ref name="University of Canterbury"&gt;[http://www.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/newsletter/2007/2007-06-01PDF205KB.pdf ''University of Canterbury Physics and Astronomy Weekly Newsletter'' Volume 24, Number 20, 1 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Another service offered by the Association is to provide trained personnel and radio communications systems to Amateur Radio Emergency Communications, a group which liaises with the New Zealand Police and Civil Defense services in emergency situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzart.org.nz/info/general/|title=Amateur Radio|date=3 September 2012|publisher=New Zealand Association of Radio Transmitters|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branches ==
Branches of NZART are generally radio clubs and related organisations, and are found across the country. The Branches facilitate the representation of individual members at a national level through the NZART National Conference. Most radio clubs are individually [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] and operate on a day-to-day basis independently of the NZART.The number following the branch name is their NZART branch number.

Numerous branches experienced membership decline (possibly proportionate to a national decline), and have been reduced to a status of "recess" for several years.

==Plot==
In December 1941, Japan expands the occupation of its neighbouring countries to Southeast Asia. The railway from Tianjin to Nanjing in East China became a key military transportation route, heavily guarded by Japanese soldiers. Railroad worker Ma Yuan (Jackie Chan) leads a team of freedom fighters. Using his deep knowledge of the train network, he and his men sabotage it, ambushing Japanese soldiers and stealing supplies to feed the starving Chinese. Although the freedom fighters have no weapons of their own, they employ whatever tools are at hand, including a hammer and shovels, loose railway track planks and diverted trains.  The local Chinese call the unlikely heroes the “Railroad Tigers”. The freedom fighters find themselves on the wrong side of the tracks when the Japanese send reinforcements to Shandong. In an act of defiance, Ma Yuan launches his most dangerous mission yet, blowing up a heavily guarded railroad bridge. When the Japanese learn of the crippling plan, which will derail the war effort, the stakes are raised even higher. After many missed opportunities and missed shots, the bridge is blown up by the ragtag Chinese railroad tigers.

'''Real time''' within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them. For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real-time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of screen time is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.

Real time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical [[Greek drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://department.monm.edu/cata/rankin/classes/cata171/lectures/chapter15.htm  "Dramatic Structure: Climactic, Episodic, and Other Forms", Monmouth College, IL]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
Often, use of [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screens]] or [[picture-in-picture]]s are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various [[subplot]]s are affecting each other. Examples include the television series ''[[24 (television)|24]]'' and films ''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]'' and ''[[Phone Booth (film)|Phone Booth]]''. On-screen clocks are often used to remind the audience of the real-time presentation.

==Video games==
In a real-time computer game or simulation, events in the game occur at the same rate as the events which are being depicted. For instance, in a real-time combat game, in one hour of play the game depicts one hour of combat.

*''[[Animal Crossing]]''
*''[[Nintendogs]]''
*''[[Night Trap]]''
*''[[The Last Express]]''
*''[[24: The Game]]''
*''[[Titanic: Adventure Out of Time]]

==Comic books and strips==
In [[comic books]], the use of real time is made more complicated by the fact that most serial comics are released on a monthly basis and are traditionally 20 to 30 pages long, making it difficult to tell a story set in real time without overlooking important events from one month to the next. Another explanation is the prevalence of the [[super-hero]] genre in American comics, and the [[iconic]] status attached to such characters : it is often considered that such mythological, sometimes godlike heroes cannot age in real time without losing the characteristics that make them special. Hence the more common use of [[floating timeline]]s in [[Marvel Comics]] or [[DC Comics]]. Exceptions include [[Marvel Comics]]' [[New Universe]] line of books, [[Erik Larsen]]'s long-running ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' ongoing series, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]'' (three non-canon miniseries exploring the notion of "what if Superman and Batman could age?"), and [[Ben Dunn]]'s ''[[Ninja High School]]''.

Comic strips which feature characters aging in real-time include:

* ''[[Ninja High School]]''
* ''[[Hellblazer]]'' John Constantine's events take place within an "active continuity".
* ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]''
* ''[[Savage Dragon]]''
* ''[[New Universe]]'' (Marvel Comics imprint, 1986–1989)
* ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' A weekly comic book series by [[DC Comics]]
* ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' (Characters have aged in real-time since the series started in 1977)
* ''[[Gasoline Alley]]'' (Characters have grown up, aged and died in real time since the 1920s)
* ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'' (for its first 28 years of existence)
* ''[[Doonesbury]]'' (Characters age in real-time and interact with real history)
* ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]''

==Novels==
In the [[Inspector Rebus]] series of detective novels (17 as of 2010) by the Scottish writer [[Ian Rankin]], characters age in step with the publication date. Rebus is stated to have been born in 1947; in the 2007 novel ''[[Exit Music]]'' he reached 60, and retired.

The [[Mandie]] series of children's mystery novels by [[Lois Gladys Leppard]] are exactly one hundred years from the present real time and ended by the eighteenth year (or one hundred and eighteenth year) of the main protagonist in 2006 at the reader's end of childhood and adolescence.

In ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' the entire story takes place in real time.

'''''Red Cotton Night-Cap Country, or Turf and Towers''''' (1873) is a poem in blank verse by [[Robert Browning]]. It tells a story of sexual intrigue, religious obsession and violent death in contemporary Paris and [[Normandy]], closely based on the true story of the death, supposedly by suicide, of the jewellery heir [[Mellerio (company)|Antoine Mellerio]].  ''Red Cotton Night-Cap Country'' has never been one of Browning's more popular poems, originally because of the perceived sordidness of the story, and later on grounds thus summarised by the critic [[C. H. Herford]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The poet followed on the heels of the journalist, and borrowed, it must be owned, not a little of his methods. If any poem of Browning's may be compared to versified [[War correspondent|special correspondence]], it is this. He tells the story, in his own person, in blank verse of admirable ease and fluency, from which every pretence of poetry is usually remote.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. H. Herford]] ''Robert Browning'' (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1905) p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Synopsis ==

It opens by setting the scene in the Norman village of Saint-Rambert amid countryside which the poet discusses with his friend [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie|Anne Thackeray]], the dedicatee of the poem. Since she has jokingly named the locale "White Cotton Night-Cap Country", from the somnolence of the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] district and the white caps worn by the inhabitants, Browning changes the colour to red by way of pointing up the passion of the story he is about to tell, and alluding to the ''bonnet rouge'' worn by the [[French Revolution|revolutionaries of 1789]] and again during the [[Paris Commune]]. The poem now turns to the story of Léonce Miranda, the heir to a jewellery business, who is raised on a luxurious estate in Saint-Rambert in the shadow of the church towers mentioned in the poem's subtitle, and who is torn between the opposing demands of religious devotion and the sensual, materialist side of his nature – "turf", as Browning calls it. Miranda takes a mistress called Clara de Millefleurs, and houses her in a luxuriously renovated priory. Miranda's scandalised mother exacerbates his sense of guilt over this affair to such good effect that he tries to commit suicide by drowning himself in the [[Seine]]. He fails in this attempt, but on the death of his mother Miranda is more riddled with guilt than ever, and so breaks off his relationship with Clara and, while trying to burn her letters, mutilates himself by burning off both his hands. However, he resumes the affair and tries to work off his guilt by making donations to the church of La Ravissante near his home. He dies by throwing himself from the belvedere of the priory as an act of faith, believing that he will be miraculously borne by the angels of the Virgin Mary to La Ravissante. His will, which divides his estate between the Church and Clara, is contested by his "cousinry", who believe Miranda to have been insane when he made it, but the courts uphold the will, declaring Miranda's death to have been an accident.

== Writing and publication ==

Having been originally told about the case of Antoine Mellerio in 1870 by his friend Joseph Milsand, Browning went on to research the facts with great thoroughness, reading newspaper reports and transcripts of the legal documents and interviewing residents of the district.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Fox]] ''The Challenge of Anthropology'' (New Brunswick: Transaction, 1994) pp. 357–358.&lt;/ref&gt; Browning wrote ''Red Cotton Night-Cap Country'' during December 1872 and January 1873, while the lawsuit over Mellerio's will was still under appeal.  He originally used the real names of the characters and places in the ''affaire Mellerio'', but on submitting the manuscript to his friend [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], then [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]], he was advised that he might be sued for libel. All the names were accordingly changed: Antoine Mellerio to Léonce Miranda, Anna de Beaupré to Clara de Millefleurs, [[Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados|Saint-Aubin]] to Saint-Rambert, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;George Willis Cooke ''A Guidebook to the Poetic and Dramatic Works of Robert Browning'' (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1891) pp. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was published during the first week of May 1873 by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]], but they did not need to reprint it until, in 1889, along with ''The Inn Album'', it formed volume 12 of his ''Poetical Works''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bright (ed.) ''The Complete Works of Robert Browning: With Variant Readings and Annotations'' (Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2007) vol. 11, p. 365; [http://copac.ac.uk/search?au=robert+browning&amp;ti=red+cotton&amp;sort-order=date Catalogue entry] at [[Copac]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==

Reviews were mixed.  ''The Spectator'' spoke for many when it said that "Mr. Browning has not succeeded in giving any true poetic excuse for telling a story so full of disagreeable elements."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Litzinger and Donald Smalley (eds.) ''Robert Browning: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1996) p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous reviewer in ''Harper's Magazine'' was undeterred by the fact that he had not read the poem through:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not necessary to traverse every square mile of the [[Sahara|Great Desert]] to know that its scenery is tame. We have read enough to know both the story and the manner in which it is told, and to enter our strong protest against the endeavour to glorify an illicit love with one who had been in succession a profligate woman and an unfaithful wife…It can only be characterized as harmless because the class of people who would be liable to be harmed by it will not understand nor even read it.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Litzinger and Donald Smalley (eds.) ''Robert Browning: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1996) p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Thomas Carlyle]] remarked in conversation that there were "ingenious remarks here and there; but nobody out of bedlam ever before thought of choosing such a theme".&lt;ref&gt;William Clyde DeVane ''A Browning Handbook'' (New York: F. S. Crofts, 1935) p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''The Examiner'' thanked Browning for "his brave and eloquent unfolding of some of the chief social abuses of the present day".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bright (ed.) ''The Complete Works of Robert Browning: With Variant Readings and Annotations'' (Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2007) vol. 11, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later the poet [[Arthur Symons]] praised it for virtues not normally associated with Browning: "No tale could be more straightforward, no language more lucid, no verse more free from harshness or irregularity",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Symons]] ''An Introduction to the Study of Browning'' (London: J. M. Dent, 1923) p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote that "Browning was one of those wise men who can perceive the terrible and impressive poetry of the police-news which is commonly treated as vulgarity".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Siegchrist ''Rough in Brutal Print: The Legal Sources of Browning's Red Cotton Night-Cap Country'' (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1981) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character rose to fame after he was later presented by the show's host, [[Andreu Buenafuente]], with a song called "[[Baila el Chiki-chiki]]" (Dance the Chiki-chiki), a parody of [[reggaeton]] music filled with jokes and political references, and the show's host decided to enter the song into the Spanish selection process for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]]. Rodolfo landed Spain's best placement since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]].

==Eurovision Song Contest 2008 and "Baila el Chiki-chiki"==
For the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]], the Spanish broadcaster [[RTVE]] decided to make the song selection process more democratic, so, in an agreement with [[MySpace]], a webpage was created where the general public could vote for any of the artists who were interested in participating, possibly discovering new talents. Any aspiring singer could upload a video to enter the contest. The top 5 voted videos, along with 5 more entries selected by a jury, went to a televised final where the Spanish Eurovision Song Contest 2008 entry would be chosen.

More than 530 songs were submitted, the comedic act of Rodolfo Chikilicuatre and his "Baila el Chiki-chiki" song among them. The song was heavily promoted by late night show ''Buenafuente'' and television channel [[La Sexta]] that aired the show, and ended up being selected by a landslide, earning 56.28% of the votes, well ahead of the runner-up, which earned only 14.6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/gente/Chikilicuatre/cambiara/letra/Chikichiki/elpepugen/20080310elpepuage_5/Tes Chikilicuatre cambiará la letra del 'Chikichiki' · ELPAÍS.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was chosen through [[text messaging]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10219 Eurovision Song Contest Serbia 2008|News - Exclusive: Spain Decides: Through MySpace!!!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This selection was met with a certain degree of controversy, as many considered it a gimmick song,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10838 Eurovision Song Contest Serbia 2008|News - The Eurovision gimmick songs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and not worthy of representing Spain. It also met controversy because Rodolfo Chikilicuatre was a comedic act, with no prior songs, and was backed by a particular show (''Buenafuente'') and a private broadcaster (LaSexta). RTVE stood by their choice of voting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/20080309/gente-ocio-tv-radio/apoyo-todas-consecuencias-rodolfo_200803091419.html |title=ABC.es: gente-ocio - tv-radio - TVE da su «apoyo con todas las consecuencias» a Rodolfo Chikilicuatre como representante de España en Eurovisión&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311230149/http://www.abc.es/20080309/gente-ocio-tv-radio/apoyo-todas-consecuencias-rodolfo_200803091419.html |archive-date=2008-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2008, Rodolfo announced some changes to the lyrics of his song to comply with the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest, thus removing partially the names of the politicians included in the song ([[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], [[Hugo Chávez]] and [[Mariano Rajoy]]). Even if Chávez's name was completely removed, a reference to [[¿Por qué no te callas?|a previous incident]] with King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] was kept. A non-political reference to Serbia was added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadenaser.com/sociedad/articulo/chiki-chiki-tiene-letra-definitiva/serpro/20080315csrcsrsoc_5/Tes Cadena Ser article on the new lyrics]&lt;/ref&gt; The song was also made longer, as the original was considered too short, going from 1:20 to 2:56 minutes, and several verses in English were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurovision2008.rtve.es/letra.php |title=New lyrics to ''Baila el Chiki-Chiki'' |access-date=2008-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317052010/http://www.eurovision2008.rtve.es/letra.php |archive-date=2008-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version was presented on March 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision2008.rtve.es/index.php Eurovision 2008 site at RTVE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodolfo performed the "Chiki-chiki" theme with other singers: [[King Africa]], [[Tata Golosa]], [[Mojinos Escozios]] and [[Dustin the Turkey]].

During the final contest of the Eurovision 2008 on May 24, 2008, the song "Baila el Chiki-chiki" reached sixteenth place with 55 points, tied with Albania.

[[File:DDSnowfort.JPG|thumb|A two-story snow fort]]
A '''snow fort''' or '''snow castle''' is a usually open-topped temporary structure made of [[snow]] walls that is usually used for recreational purposes. Snow forts are generally built by children as a [[playground game]] or winter [[hobby|pastime]] and are used as defensive structures in [[snowball fight]]s. They are also built and used for [[Children's games (role play)|make-believe games]] such as "house", "store", or "community", a game where multiple forts are built in a group. Along with the [[snowman]], it is one of the two structures commonly built by children out of snow.

Snow structures made for sleeping are called [[igloo]]s when made from snow blocks and [[quinzhee]]s when made by hollowing out a pile of snow.
[[File:Snow_castle.jpg|thumb|Little snow fort built with a plastic tub ([[Moscow]], Russia)]]

== Variations ==
[[File:Snow Fort 2009.jpg|thumb|A snow fort in Washington, D.C., United States]]
A snow fort consists of walls of piled and compacted snow. They may be "open" or "closed", that is, a person in the snow fort may be completely surrounded by the walls on all sides, there may be a "door", or the person may be completely exposed on one side. The latter variation is used for snowball fights where opponents have forts facing each other and attack exclusively from their own fort. Existing structures such as the walls or concave corners of a building can be used as part of the snow fort, allowing for faster and easier construction. A snow fort can also be a tunneled-out burrow built in a large snow drift.

Although the most common way to pack snow for a fort is by piling, pressing, and/or carving out snow by hand, possibly with the aid of a snow shovel, other ways exist. One way is to roll out several large balls of snow - possibly weighing over 200&amp;nbsp;lbs. each - as if making a snowman, lining them up in a protective barrier, and using loose snow as mortar to hold them together. Another way is to create cylindrical snow blocks by shovelling snow into a [[five gallon bucket]] and then compacting it. If made out of wet snow and left to freeze overnight, these blocks become almost indestructible. They can be difficult to stack into a stable defensive structure, but they can double as unwieldy yet powerful missiles capable of punching holes in enemy snow forts, knocking over a grown man, etc.

Snow forts are usually at least knee-height and one-roomed. Forts built for snowball fights may be higher, and ones built for "house" may have lower walls and multiple rooms. When used for snowball fights, snow forts often have sections where the wall is lower, through which the occupants throw snowballs.

===Finland===
The [[SnowCastle of Kemi]] is claimed to be the biggest snow castle in the world, first built in [[Kemi]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/picturesoftheday/8303080/Pictures-of-the-day-4-February-2011.html?image=4|title=Pictures of the day: 4 February 2011|publisher=''[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]''|date=February 4, 2011|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the world's largest snow castle has been rebuilt annually. The area has varied from 13,000 to over 20,000 square meters. Highest towers have been over 20 meters high and longest walls over 1,000 meters long. Sometimes there have been three-story buildings there. The SnowRestaurant has ice tables and seats covered with [[reindeer]] fur. The [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] SnowChapel decorated with ice sculptures has seen numerous weddings with some couples coming from Japan and Hong Kong. There is also a SnowHotel in the snow castle. The hotel has double rooms and a honeymoon suite with ice decorations.

There are also ice decorations in Lainio Snow Hotel (near Ylläs and [[Levi, Finland]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

[[File:Snowcastle under construction in Yellowknife 01.JPG|thumb|The [[Snowking Winter Festival]] castle under construction]]
In [[Kingston, Ontario]], the annual FebFest [[snow sculpture]] competition in Confederation Park features snow forts by the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] and [[Queen's University]]. The snow forts must not only be pleasing to look at but also safe for children to play on. In 2008, Royal Military College's snow fort was modelled after the MacKenzie Building in the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style with a [[Mansard roof]], and a central tower incorporating a working clock, flanked by projecting end towers and a slide. Both teams worked through the night, filling rectangular recycling bins with snow.

The [[Snowking Winter Festival]] is an annual festival held each March in [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]]. The festival is a major winter tourist draw to Yellowknife. It features a huge snow castle with window panes of ice built on Yellowknife Bay, on [[Great Slave Lake]]. The castle is designed and the construction is supervised by Snowking, Anthony Foliot. The design evolves every year and the castle has grown to include an auditorium, cafe, courtyard, traditional [[igloo]], slide, parapets and turrets. Once the castle is completed, it becomes the center of winter arts activity in Yellowknife. This month-long festival includes concerts, art shows, children's theatre, and fireworks shows. Carvers augment the castle with snow and ice sculptures.

==In popular culture==
''[[The Backyardigans]]'' episode "The Snow Fort" has the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] defending an elaborate version of such a fort while members of the [[ski patrol]] try to get in.

''[[The Dog Who Stopped the War]]'' (1984) is a cult movie and box-office hit in [[Quebec]]. Half of this movie revolves around a very elaborate snow fort.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3853">{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}A '''storyboard artist''' (sometimes called a '''story artist''' or '''visualizer''') creates [[Storyboard|storyboards]] for [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]] and [[Filmmaking|film productions]].

== Work ==
A storyboard artist visualizes stories and sketches frames of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/10672637/Britains-coolest-jobs-the-Hollywood-storyboard-artist.html|title=Britain's coolest jobs: the Hollywood storyboard artist|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quick pencil drawings and marker renderings are two of the most common traditional techniques, although nowadays [[Adobe Flash]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Storyboard Pro]], and other storyboard applications are often used. The digital camera is one of the latest techniques in creating storyboards. 

Most storyboard artists nowadays begin and finish their work on computers using software and digital pencils or a [[graphics tablet]]. Storyboard artists may use photos to create visuals where [[stock photos]] or photos taken specifically for the project are put together digitally to produce a photographic representation called a photovisual. 

For motion pictures, some filmmakers, directors, and producers choose to use clip-art computer programs designed to create storyboards, or use a dedicated 3D storyboarding software, or a more multi-purpose 3D program which can also be used to create elements of the storyboards.

== Industry specific work ==
Storyboard artists have different goals in different industries.

=== Advertising ===
In advertising, the storyboard artist can be called upon to create a representation of what the finished TV commercial, or spot, will look like in order to persuade and engage the client to buy the concept being pitched. This can either be at the time the agency is trying to win the client's business or once the client has signed on with the agency. In either case, the important element is for the storyboards to visualize for the client what the agency's creative director or "creatives" are thinking will sell the client's product. A storyboard artist may also be asked to visually represent several versions of a campaign for print ads.

=== Live-action film ===
In live-action film, a storyboard artist is hired at the beginning of a project. When a storyboard artist is hired by a motion picture company, the artist must break down the scenes of the script into shots which can be filmed. This is done under the supervision of the film's director in order to ensure the director's vision from the start of the project. As the production proceeds, the storyboards are presented to the cinematographer who is then responsible for bringing that vision to the screen. 

Film production companies may also hire a storyboard artist to create polished presentation-style storyboards (which might also include sound) which can be used by an executive producer to raise the money to create the film.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

=== Animation ===
In animation, projects are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone (that is, a screenplay may not be written until later), and storyboard artists continue to work throughout the production to develop particular sequences. After a sequence is edited the director and/or storyboard artist and team may need to rework the sequence as it becomes evident that changes need to be made for timing and story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles_and_stories/job_roles/349_storyboard_artist_animation|title=Storyboard Artist (Animation)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Tourism Queensland]] promoted the [[Great Barrier Reef]] as a global tourism destination with a website encouraging people worldwide to apply for '''The Best Job In The World''', to be a "Caretaker of the Islands" to "house-sit" the islands of the Great Barrier Reef for half a year, based on [[Hamilton Island (Queensland)|Hamilton Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://islandreefjob.com/ The Best Job in the World website (islandreefjob.com)] - Department of Tourism, Regional Development and Industry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestjobben.com/|title=Ben Southall|author=|date=|work=bestjobben.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7823812.stm|title=Wanted: Paradise island 'caretaker'|author=|date=12 January 2009|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/01/12/queensland.australia.hamilton.island/index.html|title=Life's a beach with dream Australian island job|author=Glen Scanlon|date=12 January 2009|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Job benefits included a large salary, free lodging in a multimillion-dollar villa, and transportation there and around the islands. The application process required a [[Video clip|web video]] to be submitted, available publicly for consideration for the position. The job duties listed were primarily publicity-related with web videos, [[blog]]ging, and [[Photoblog|photo diaries]]. The submission web site crashed two days following the launch of the campaign, from excessive visits and application video uploading.&lt;ref name="crash2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jH5xCl4jYiZC_-q6SxmJzfrfFgag|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621051634/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jH5xCl4jYiZC_-q6SxmJzfrfFgag|title=AFP: Global rush for 'best job in world' crashes Australian website|date=13 January 2009 |archivedate=21 June 2012|work=Google News|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public interest==
Interest continued for months. On 11 February 2009, Christopher Grima jumped off the South Causeway Bridge in [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]] in [[Florida]]. The police report said that he "wanted to capture a [[video]] of himself jumping off the bridge, to gain attention of the [[recruiter]]s" for this job.

Two hoaxes also fueled interest. Tourism Queensland invested US$1m in the campaign and generated US$70m of global publicity just one month after the campaign's launch.&lt;ref name="may2009"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick  |last=Bryant|title='Selling' Queensland with a dream job|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8027369.stm |work= |publisher=BBC News |location=Sydney, Australia |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicants==
Over 35,000 applications were received from over 200 countries, and whittled down to 16 finalists (including one chosen by an on-line vote).  Finalists came from Australia (two), United States (two), United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Taiwan, India, China, Japan, France and South Korea.  Ten were male and their ages ranged from 20 to 39.  The candidates were interviewed on the island starting 3 May 2009. The United Kingdom finalist Ben Southall, 34, a charity fundraiser and ostrich-rider from Petersfield, Hampshire, UK, was appointed as the new caretaker of the island on 6 May 2009.&lt;ref name="may2009_2"&gt;{{cite news |title= UK man lands 'world's best job'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8035168.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="may2009_3"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tracy  |last=Ollerenshaw|title= Q&amp;A: Fantasy island job winner|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/newsbeat/newsid_8035000/8035981.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Queers''' are an American [[punk rock]] band, formed in 1981 by the [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], native Joe Queer, along with Scott Gildersleeve (a.k.a. Tulu), and Jack Hayes (a.k.a. Wimpy Rutherford). With the addition of Keith Hages in 1982 the band started playing their first live shows. The band originally broke up in late 1984, but reformed with Joe Queer and a new line-up in 1986. In 1990, the band signed with Shakin' Street Records and released their first album ''[[Grow Up (The Queers album)|Grow Up]]''. The album earned the band notability within [[New England]], but with the release of their next album 1993's ''[[Love Songs for the Retarded]]'', on [[Lookout! Records]], their following grew larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kembrew McLeod |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-queers-mn0000420097/biography |title=The Queers &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=1999-01-21 |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, after releasing six albums on [[Lookout! Records]], the band rescinded their master rights from the label, citing breach of contract over unpaid royalties. Later that year they signed with [[Asian Man Records]].

The Queers' [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Wipe Out (instrumental)|Wipe Out]]" was featured in the 2007 [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Sony Pictures Imageworks|ImageWorks Studios]] [[mockumentary]] film ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]],'' produced by [[Sony Pictures Animation]] and [[National Geographic Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The Queers play a [[Ramones]]-derived style of [[pop punk]]. Much like [[The Ramones]], common lyrical themes are of girls, love, drugs, alcohol and having fun. Musically the band deviates slightly from the driving rhythm guitar sound of the Ramones and augments their songs with harmony vocals and guitar solos. They have been described{{by whom|date=March 2015}} as "The Ramones meets The Beach Boys".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Ben Weasel]] of [[Screeching Weasel]] infrequently collaborates on songwriting with Joe Queer. The band is well known for the variety of [[cover versions]] they include on their records and during live performances. Bands/artists covered by The Queers include [[The Beach Boys]], [[Ramones]] (including a complete re-recording of the ''[[Rocket to Russia]]'' album), Unnatural Axe, [[The Nobodys]], [[Angry Samoans]], [[The Mr. T Experience]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[The Fantastic Baggys]], [[The Who]], [[The Undertones]], [[The Hobos]], [[Tommy James and The Shondells]], [[Helen Love]], The Catalogs (from Hawaii, featuring Les Hernandez of The Quintessentials), The Banana Splits and many more.

==Controversy==
Joe Queer has been publicly outspoken against Nazism and white supremacy over the years as expressed in various interviews and in the song "You're Tripping" off of the 1993 [[Lookout Records]] release ''[[Love Songs for the Retarded]]''. The lyrics state "I hate white power... Can't you see, this ain't Nazi Germany".

In a 2014 open letter, Joe Steinhardt of [[Don Giovanni Records]] called on [[Asian Man Records]] and [[Recess Records]] to drop The Queers after Joe Queer made public statements in support of [[Ferguson, Missouri|Ferguson]] police officer [[Darren Wilson (police officer)|Darren Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JOE QUEER BACKS OFFICER DARREN WILSON, PUNK COMMUNITY CONFUSED|publisher=Impose Magazine|url=http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/news/joe-queer-backs-officer-darren-wilson-punk-community-confused|accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Mitch Clem]], who had previously done work for the band, publicly broke ties as well. Steinhardt later apologized for the open letter, stating "I remain personally appalled by Joe Queer's defense of Darren Wilson, his use of the term Obongo regarding [[Barack Obama|the president]]...at the same time, I recognize that a better way to go about this would be more thoughtful discussion directly with the people involved." Joe Queer later called Steinhardt a 'gutless wimp' and challenged him to a face to face debate to be filmed and put online. Steinhardt has yet to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Giovanni Records owner asks labels to drop The Queers and Screeching Weasel, then apologizes|publisher=PunkNews.org|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/55795/don-giovanni-records-owner-asks-labels-to-drop-the-queers-and-screeching-weasel-then-apologizes|accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Noisey, after their February 2016 show was cancelled due to a call for a petition to boycott the show from a local collective, Babely Shades, Joe Queer voiced his opinion when asked if he "supports racist, misogynistic or homophobic values?" he replied "Of course not. What normal minded person does? My closest pals here in Atlanta are Chris and Chester, two gay black guys. I was actually working a part time job. I was one of two white people on the whole job. If I was so racist, I wouldn't have worked there or be living in Atlanta! The whole city is predominantly black." He also voiced his opinion of the activist group [[Black Lives Matter]], stating 
"Black Lives Matter doesn't care about black people, they just want to cause trouble and hate white people. If they truly cared they'd be in the ghettos of America trying to help there instead of screaming about white America. That's where the murders of black people are happening, but according to BLM it's all white cops who are doing it! It's insane thinking and not getting to the root of the problem at all. [[All lives matter]]."&lt;ref&gt;https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/rygzvm/the-queers-ottawa-controversy&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 interview, Joe Queer stated "“I get called a Nazi and racist because of our name, and then because I had an opinion about the Ferguson thing,” he says. “I’m liberal as hell, and I was taken aback by how quickly people attacked me. To this day, I’ll get snide comments. I was jumped by Nazis as a gay person, even though I’m not gay. I fought Nazis, so to be called a Nazi is lame by this alt-left." In the same interview he states that humor is a way to social change, we shouldn't take ourselves so seriously and that many people are looking for a reason to be offended, "“In the old days of punk rock, all these bands were laughing at themselves, and they got their point across through humor,” King says. “The Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, the Dickies, the Angry Samoans, Flipper, X — they were funny, but they had a message. They were laughing at themselves. I don’t think the new liberals are really offended. I think they’re just looking for a reason to say they’re offended. They completely take everything out of context. It’s so insincere, this faux outrage." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.westword.com/music/joe-queer-of-the-queers-on-milo-yiannopoulos-darren-wilson-and-nazis-9199191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Band members==
Since its formation, the band has gone through a few line-up changes, with Joe Queer as the only constant member. The band currently consists of Joe Queer (Guitar/Vocals),  Cheeto Bandito (Bass), and Hoglog Rehab (Drums). The first line-up was Joe Queer, Tulu, Keith Hages and Wimpy Rutherford. The mid-1980s line-up was Joe Queer, JJ Rassler, Hugh O'Neill with Kevin Kecy or Evan Shore. The best known line-up is from the 1990s Lookout Records era : Joe Queer, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill. After leaving Lookout Records, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill left and Dangerous Dave joined. The Queers continue to actively tour and a new record is in the works.

'''Theatre in Omaha''' has existed since the founding of the city in 1856.  Nationally notable actors have come from the city.  There are active community theatres, and some theatres and acting companies have reached national prominence.

==Theatres==
Omaha is home to the [[Omaha Community Playhouse]]. It is the largest, one of the most famous, and one of the best-endowed [[community theater]]s in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704105639/http://www.omahaplayhouse.com/history.aspx OCP History]. Omaha Community Playhouse. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt; It produces its own season of plays and musicals. The city has a number of other long-standing theatres, including the [[Orpheum Theater (Omaha)|Orpheum Theater]] and the [[Astro Theater|Rose Theater]]. The [[Sokol Auditorium]] and the [[Omaha Civic Auditorium]] are booked for dramatic performances or touring productions occasionally, as well. Other theatres in Omaha include the [[Blue Barn Theatre]], [[Holland Performing Arts Center]], Ralston Community Theatre, and Papillion-LaVista Community Theatre&lt;ref&gt;Hassebroek, A. (2006) "[http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/693246/holland_center_further_energized_omahas_lively_culture/index.html Holland Center Further Energized Omaha's Lively Culture.]" ''Omaha World Herald.'' 10/15/06. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Magic Theatre (Omaha)|Magic Theatre]] has provided a space for [[experimental theatre]] in the city for more than 30 years.  The [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]] Theater &amp; Workshop produces contemporary plays as well as providing many aspects of theater training in the [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|Near North Side]] community. The Chanticleer Community Theater in neighboring [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] also serves the greater metropolitan area.  The Grande Olde Players Theater Company has been performing throughout the city for some time, as well. The [[Shelterbelt Theatre]] focuses on the development of original theatrical works and provides practical theater education to playwrights, performers, creative and technical staff.

==Actors and actresses==
These are actors who were either born in Omaha or lived there for an extensive period of time.

{{for|the Bert Jansch album|Toy Balloon (album)}}
[[Image:InflatableBalloons.jpg|thumb|right|Inflated party balloons]]
A '''toy balloon''' or '''party balloon''', is a small [[balloon]] mostly used for decoration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Balloon|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/balloon.aspx|publication-place=[http://www.encyclopedia.com encyclopedia.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; advertising and children's toys. Toy balloons are usually made of [[rubber]] or [[Metallised film|aluminized plastic]], and [[inflatable|inflated]] with air or [[helium]].  They come in a great variety of sizes and shapes, but are most commonly 10 to 30 [[centimetres]] in [[diameter]]. Toy balloons are not considered to include "[[sky lanterns]]" (hot-air paper balloons), although these too are or were used as child toys in some parts of the world.

According to [[JAMA (journal)|The Journal of the American Medical Association]], out of  373 children who died in the US between 1972 and 1992 after choking on children's products, nearly a third choked on [[latex]] balloons. The Consumer Products Safety Commission found that children had inhaled latex balloons whole (often while trying to inflate them) or choked on fragments of broken balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=COLLINS|first1=CLARE|title=Balloons Made of Latex Pose Choking Hazard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/13/garden/balloons-made-of-latex-pose-choking-hazard.html|publication-place=[https://www.nytimes.com/ nytimes.com]|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parents (magazine)|''Parents'']], a monthly magazine about raising children, advised parents to buy [[BoPET|Mylar]] balloons instead of latex balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kramer|first1=Pamela|title=Babyproofing 101: 10 Household Safety Hazards|url=http://www.parents.com/baby/safety/babyproofing/10-household-baby-safety-hazards/|publication-place=[http://www.parents.com/ parents.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Luttrell Psalter balloon.png|thumb|left|Illustration from the [[Luttrell Psalter]] (c1320-1340) depicting a pig bladder balloon]]
[[File:BoysBlowingBladder by Peter Perez Burdett.jpg|thumb|right|Children inflating a bladder, painting c1773]]
Early balloons were made from [[pig bladder]]s and animal intestines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigfatballoons.co.uk/pages.php?page=about_balloons  All you need to know about balloons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balloonhq.com/faq/history.html Rubber Balloon Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aztecs]] created the first balloon sculptures using cat intestines, which were then presented to the gods as a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Merlin, Kaufman and Greenberg, ''Great Balloons! The Complete Book of Balloon Sculpting,'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; There are references to balloons made of whale intestine in ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1813) and in ''[[Moby Dick]]'' (1851).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.balloonhq.com/faq/history.html The History of Balloons]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rubber balloons were made by Professor [[Michael Faraday#Royal Institution and public service|Michael Faraday]] in 1824 for use in his experiments with [[hydrogen]] at the [[Royal Institution]] in London. "The [[Natural rubber|caoutchouc]] is exceedingly elastic", he wrote in the [[Quarterly Journal of Science]] the same year. "Bags made of it...have been expanded by having air forced into them, until the caoutchouc was quite transparent, and when expanded by hydrogen they were so light as to form balloons with considerable ascending power...." Faraday made his balloons by cutting round two sheets of rubber laid together and pressing the edges together. The tacky rubber welded automatically, and the inside of the balloon was rubbed with flour to prevent the opposing surfaces joining together.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mh9lAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg ''Mechanics' Magazine and Journal of Science, Arts, and Manufactures,'' Vol. 2, Knight and Lacey, 1824; p. 327]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latex rubber toy balloons were introduced by pioneer rubber manufacturer [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] the following year in the form of a do-it-yourself kit consisting of a bottle of rubber solution and a condensing syringe. [[Vulcanized]] toy balloons, which unlike the earlier kind were unaffected by changes in temperature, were first manufactured by J.G. Ingram of London in 1847 and can be regarded as the prototype of modern toy balloons.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Robertson, ''The Book of Firsts,'' Bramhall House, NY, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s [[Neil Tillotson]] designed and produced a [[latex]] balloon with a cat's face and ears from a cardboard form which he cut by hand with a pair of scissors. He managed to make his first sale of these balloons with an order of 15 gross to be delivered for the annual [[Patriots Day]] Parade on April 19, 1931. The first colored balloons were sold at the [[Century of Progress|1933-34 Chicago World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold E. Grummer, ''The Great Balloon Game Book and More Balloon Activities,'' Greg Markim, Inc., Appleton, Wisconsin, 1987 {{ISBN|0-938251-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foil balloons==
Inflatable [[Foil (chemistry)|foil]] balloons are made from plastics, such as aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]]. Foil balloons are not elastic like rubber balloons, so that detailed and colorful pictures printed on their surfaces are not distorted when the balloon is inflated.  Foil balloons are thus named because they sometimes have a metallic coating to make them shiny, however there have been concerns about metallic balloons causing [[short circuit]]s when caught in overhead [[Electric power transmission|power lines]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://safeelectricity.org/dont-let-metallic-balloons-ruin-party/|title=Don’t Let Metallic Balloons Ruin The Party - Safe Electricity|work=Safe Electricity|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because metallic balloons can cause [[power outage]]s like on [[Overhead line|overhead catenary]] train lines &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/train-stalled-it-may-be-balloons-fault|title=Train stalled? It may be balloon's fault|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is recommended that the metallic balloons not only be tied by a string or ribbon with no metal in it, but also securely tied down by a weight to prevent the balloon from floating away and some train operators either issue advisories on how to handle balloons or ban balloons altogether. When no longer required, it is recommended to cut the balloon to release the [[helium]] and dispose of in a garbage container.

==Filling==
[[Image:Balloon Race 10June2006.JPG|thumb|right|Helium filled balloons]]
Every toy balloon has an opening (or ''mouth'') through which gases are blown into it, followed by a connecting tube known as the ''neck''.  Balloons are usually filled by using one's [[breath]], a [[pump]], or a pressurized gas tank.  The opening can then be permanently tied off or clamped temporarily.  Foil balloons are typically self-sealing.  By filling a balloon with a gas [[lighter than air]], such as [[helium]], the balloon can be made to [[buoyancy|float]].  Helium is the preferred gas for floating balloons, because it is [[Inert gas|inert]] and will not catch fire (like [[hydrogen]]) or cause [[toxicity|toxic]] effects when [[inhalation|inhaled]].  Small, light objects (postcards, in [[balloon mail]] for example) are sometimes placed in balloons along with helium and released into the air and, when the balloon eventually falls, the object inside might be found by another person.  Rubber balloons can also be filled with [[liquid]]s (usually [[water]]) and can burst when they impact a solid object.  Liquid-filled balloons are commonly referred to as [[water balloon]]s or water bombs and used in playful fights, and sometimes [[vandalism]].

Most toy balloons are a simple [[oval]]-like shape.  But balloon suppliers also offers other shapes for toy balloons.  Some examples of other shapes are:  "zeppelins" or "airships," where balloons are usually longer than wide; "espirals" or "rattlesnakes," similar to zeppelins, but much longer (not to be confused with balloons for twisting); "hearts," balloons with the shape of a heart; "dolls," two round shapes joined that represent a head and a body; "mouseheads," composed of three round parts, one for the head and two for the ears; "bunnyheads," similar to mouseheads but with long ears; "bunny balloons," which resemble a stuffed toy bunny, having a big long shape for the body, a smaller shape for the head, and two long shapes for the ears; "elephants," with two shapes for the body and the head, and a very long shape for the trunk; and "ducks," with a big shape for the body, a smaller round shape for the head and smaller shape for the beak.  There are many other possible shapes, depending on the manufacturers.

==Balloon modeling==
[[Image:Balloon vendor.JPG|thumb|right| A balloon artist in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]]]
There are balloons that are longer and more cylindrical. These long balloons are often twisted and bent into simple, or intricate shapes which will hold their form when released. Balloon artists are people who quickly twist balloons into familiar or abstract shapes using the techniques of [[balloon modelling]], usually for profit. Other names for balloon modeling include: balloon twisting, balloon bending, or simply twisting. 

Artists who practice balloon modeling are called: Balloon Twisters, Balloon Benders, Balloon Modeler and even have been referred to as a Latex Vessel Reconstruction Engineer.[[File:Balloon Twisting Figures.png|thumb|A number of balloon twisting figures and a child with modeling balloons made into different shapes.]]

The types of balloons used for this practice are pencil balloons and are called 160s, 260s, 350s, 360s, 660s or 646s. These number designations refer to the sizes of the balloons and roughly equate to the diameter and the length of the balloon when fully inflated. The 260, one of the most common animal balloon sizes, would be 2 inches in diameter and then 60 inches long when fully inflated. 

The modeling balloons can be made into simple dogs, hearts, and swords or can be made into more intricate shapes such as dragons, cartoon characters, or even figments of the imaginations. More and more nearly anything is becoming possible with balloon twisting and it shows at major industry conventions such as [http://www.BalloonConvention.com Twist and Shout], the largest balloon twisting convention in the world.

==Noises==
Toy balloons are often characterized with its distinctive noises if manipulated in some ways. These noises include:
* Popping: The common loud noise of an inflated balloon when it bursts. When a balloon bursts, the torn parts of the rubber suddenly contracts with sufficient force to exceed the [[speed of sound]] and forms a small [[sonic boom]]. It happens simultaneously as a sudden air pressure change from the inside, causing a rapid [[shockwave]] that creates the sharp, loud popping sound. ''[[Balloon phobia|Globophobia]]'' is an uncommon kind of [[phobia]] (fear) commonly associated with the popping noise produced by balloons.

* Squeaking: It is done by inflating the balloon, then slowly release the air by stretching the neck or the mouth sideways. The stretched part creates a very tight and tiny gap for air to flow, then the air pressure causes the opening to oscillate and vibrate, creating a loud high-pitched squeaking or screeching noise. The sound can be changed by adjusting the tension of the stretching. This is the same way that how [[vocal cords]] and [[reed (instrument)|reed instrument]] works. [[Balloon rocket|Rocket balloons]], however, could create this noise by simply deflating, due to the tighter neck.

* "[[Blowing a raspberry|Raspberry]]" sound: It is done by simply releasing an inflated balloon and letting it deflate. The escaping air pressure creates a turbulence that causes the flexible opening to flap back and forth rapidly, creating a deep, long "[[flatulence]]"-like noise. The balloon will also propelled away because of the [[Newton's law of motion|Newton's third law of motion]], a phenomenon commonly known as ''[[balloon rocket]]''. This can also be done by pinching the balloon's neck, then slowly open the mouth without letting it loose. The open end vibrates instead of flapping, creating a similar, yet higher pitched noise.

* Scratching: It is done by simply rubbing a hand against the balloon itself, providing the balloon is fully inflated, creating an elastic surface.

* Thrumming: Hold the balloon by the opening valve (usually while it is knotted closed) and shake it. The balloon bounces and stretches, creating another distinctive sound.

==Uses==
[[File:Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Milano, 1962) - BEIC 6328472.jpg|thumb|[[Paolo Monti]], 1962]]
Toy balloons are used as decorations and/or advertising space.  Balloons are usually purchased in deflated form, however, some party stores and vendors at special events will fill their balloons before selling them, this is called "balloon stuffing" where the balloons are filled with objects such as smaller balloons, teddy bears, etc.

While toy balloons are primarily a toy, they are also sometimes used for demonstrations and experiments in classrooms. During the 19th century, it was thought that rubber balloons could be used to replace certain organs, but this was quickly disproved.

Toy balloons can be filled with water and used in a variety of ways, usually for fun. They can be thrown, or set up to drop on the head of an unsuspecting victim. Some Australians report using water balloons around their house during [[bushfires]], as the heat of the flames breaks the balloon and causes the water to land on the fire.

There are [[water balloons]] which are balloons specifically designed to be filled with water.

[[Image:lafayette zayde-1670.gif|thumb|210px|right|Marie de LaFayette's ''Zayde'' (1670), the original context of Huet's ''Traité de l'origine des romans'']]

[[Pierre Daniel Huet]]'s '''Trai[t]té de l'origine des Romans''' (''Treatise on the Origin of [[Novel]]s'', or ''Romances'') can claim to be the first history of fiction. It was originally published in 1670 as preface to [[Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, comtesse de la Fayette|Marie de la Fayette's]] novel ''Zayde''. The following will give extended excerpts from the English translation by Stephen Lewis published in 1715. The title page reads:

:THE| HISTORY| OF| ROMANCES.| AN| Enquiry into their ''Original''| ''Instructions for Composing them;''| AN| Account of the most Eminent| AUTHORS;| With Characters, and Curious Observations| upon the Best Performances of that Kind.| [rule]| Written in ''Latin'' by HUETIUS;| Made English by ''STEPHEN LEWIS.''| [rule]| &amp;mdash;juvat integros accedere fontes,| Atque haurire. ''Lucr.''| [rule]| ''LONDON:''| Printed for J. HOOKE, at the ''Flower-de-luce'', and| T. CALDECOTT, at the ''Sun;'' both against St.| ''Dunstan'''s Church in ''Fleetstreet.'' 1715.

Pages i-xi gave a preface by Lewis, p.[xii] added “Corrigenda”, p.&amp;nbsp;1-149 offered the translation under the short title “Original of Romances”.

The excerpt is extensive and it will mainly serve students of literature interested in the scope of questions and the method of arguing the early historian of literature showed&amp;mdash;Huet was a modern cultural historian, one could say. (The German parallel page [[:de:Traitté de l'origine des romans]] offers a summary of the plot with selected quotes and might be more comprehensive):

== Excerpt ==

===The Preface by Stephen Lewis, 1715 [p.i-xi] ===
[[File:1715 Huet History of Romances translated by Stephen Lewis.png|thumb|Stephen Lewis' translation, 1715]]
:'THERE is not any Speculation, which affords a more agreeable Pleasure to the Mind, than that of beholding from what Obscure and Mean Beginnings, the most Polite and Entertaining Arts have|&lt;j/ij&gt; risen to be the Admiration and Delight of Mankind. To pursue them up to the most abstruse Fountains, and then to view by what Steps they arise to Perfection; does not only excite an Amazement at their Increase; but an Impatient Desire of Inventing some New Subject, to be improv'd and advanc'd by Posterity.

:The first Occasion of introducing ''ROMANCE'' into the World, was, without Dispute to mollify the Rigour of Precepts, by the Allurements of Example. Where the Mind can't be subdued into Virtue, by Reason and Philosophy; nothing can|&lt;ij/iij&gt; influence it more, than to present to it the Success and Felicity, which Crowns the Pursuit of what's Great and Honourable.

The beginning of romances is to be searched for in a far distant past and of interest to “the Curious in Antiquity”

:Upon this Account, They are very much indebted to the Labour and Penetration of ''Huetius;'' who has, with great Judgement, traced the Subject he undertook to Illustrate, till he found it in|&lt;iv/v&gt; its Infancy, involved in the Umbrage of Fable, and perplexed in the Folds of ''Mystery'' and ''Riddle.'' [p.iv-v]

The treatise has found a wide audience in Latin and French translations. The new English translation is designed to attract a growing audience:

:Especially since ''Romance'' has of late convey'd it self very far into the Esteem of this Nation, and is become the Principal Diversion of the Retirement of People of all Conditions. [p.v]

===Huet's Text: The Original of Romances. [p.1-149]===

==== What is a Romance? ====

:The Name of Romance was formerly extended not only to Prose but Verse; ''Giradi'' and ''Pigra,'' in their Treatises de ''Romanzi,'' scarce mention any other, and lay down the ''Bayrdos'' and ''Arioste'' for Instances of their Opinion. But the Custom of this Age prevails to the contrary; so that we esteem nothing to be properly Romance but [[Fiction]]s of Love [[Adventure]]s, disposed into an Elegant Style in Prose, for the Delight and Instruction of the Reader.

:I call them Fictions, to discriminate them from True Histories; and I add, of Love Adventures, because Love ought to|&lt;4&gt; be the Principal Subject of ''Romance.'' It is required to be in Prose by the Humour of the Times. It must be compos'd with Art and Elegance, lest it should appear to be a rude undigested Mass, without Order or Beauty. [p.3-4]

"Instruction" is the next argument, yet Huet does not go into tedious details here. "Virtue" is placed against "Vice", "Disgrace" is to be avoided. The next step is the definition of "Romance" versus "Epic Poem". Both have one thing in common if one follows [[Aristotle]]'s definition of Poesy: they are fictional:

:[...] in several Respects there is a great Relation between them; and according to ''[[Aristotle]]'' (who informs us, That 'tis Fiction rather than Verse which makes a Poet) a Writer of Romance may be reckon'd among the Poets. ''[[Petronius]]'' tells us, That Poems are to move in great Circumference by the Ministry of the Gods, and Expressions vast and audacious; so that First, They may be looked upon as Oracles throughout, from a Spirit full of|&lt;7&gt; Fury, and then for a faithful and exact Narration.

:''Romances'' preserve a much greater Simplicity, and are not so exalted, nor have the same Figures in Invention and Expression.

:''Poems'' have more of the sublime, though they are not always confined to Probability. ''Romances'' have more of Probability, though they don't advance so far toward the Sublime.
:''Poems'' are more regular and correct in the Frame of their Contrivance, and receive less Addition from Events and Episodes than ''Romances,'' which are capable of these Accessions, because their Style is not so elevated, and they don't so far di|&lt;8&gt;sten'd the Intellect, so that they give it leave to admit a greater Number of different Ideas.

:In short, ''Poems'' make some Military Act, or Politick Conduct, their Theme, and only descant upon Love at Pleasure; whereas ''Romances,'' on the contrary, have Love for their Principal Subject, and don't concern themselves in War or Politicks, but by Accident. I speak of Regular ''Romances,'' for those in Old ''French, Spanish,'' and ''Italian,'' have generally more of the Soldier than Gallant. [p.7-8]

The differences between histories and romances are connected with the fictional status&amp;mdash;a problem is here caused by histories full of erroneous notions:

:These Works are true in the Main, and false in some Parts. ''Romances,'' on the contrary, are false in the Gross, and true in some Particulars. [...|&lt;10&gt;] I mean, that Falsehood is so predominant in ''Romance,'' that it may be altogether False in Whole and every Particular. [p.10]

Huet excludes Histories if the authors wanted to give rue accounts and just failed and he excludes "fables":

:[...] for ''Romance'' is a Fiction of Things which may, but never have happen'd; whereas the Matter of Fables is what never has, nor ever will be perform'd. [p.13]

==== An Ancient Practice: Religions Use Fictions to Create Secret Knowledge ====

The following part of the treatise touches the origin of "romances". The peoples of Asia, especially those of Egypt had, so Huet claims, proven a tendency to decipher all kinds of information. The [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s prove that. Their whole religion and all their histories were deciphered, mostly to exclude the population from further knowledge. Initiations were afforded before one would gain access to the secret cultural knowledge Egypt stored. The Greeks |&lt;p.&amp;nbsp;17&gt; had been extremely eager to learn from Egypt:

:'Twas without doubt from these Priests, that ''[[Pythagoras]]'' and ''[[Plato]],'' in their Voyage to ''Ægypt,'' learned to Transform their Philosophy, and hide it under the Shadow of Mystery and Disguise. [p.17]

The Arabs exploited the same cultural knowledge&amp;mdash;their [[Koran]] is, so Huet says filled with knowledge one cannot understand without interpretation. The Arabs translated Greek fables into their language and via Arabia [p.&amp;nbsp;20] these materials finally reached Europe. This is proven by the fact that only after the occupation of Spain first romances appeared in southern France. Huet discusses Persias culture&amp;mdash;as particularly obscure and full of secret knowledge, he mentions the Indians [p.&amp;nbsp;27] as particularly fond of poesy, before he speaks of the influence the ''Bible'' had on the western civilization and its love of fictions:

:The Holy Scripture is altogether Mysterious, Allegorical, and Ænigmatical. The ''[[Talmud]]ists'' are of Opinion that the ''[[Book of Job]]'' is no other than a [[Parable]] of the ''Hebrews''|&lt;32&gt; Invention; this Book, that of ''[[David]],'' the ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]],'' the ''[[Song of Solomon|Canticles]],'' and all other Holy Songs, are Poetical Works abounding with Figures, which would seem bold and violent in our Writings, and which are frequent in those of that Nation. The Book of Proverbs is otherwise call'd the ''Paraboles,'' because [[Proverb]]s of this sort, according to the Definition of ''[[Quintilian]],'' are only short Figures or Parables express'd in little.

:The Book of ''Canticles'' is a kind of ''[[Drama]]tic'' Poem, where the passionate Sentiments of the Bridegroom and Spouse are expressed after a Manner so tender and touching, that we|&lt;33&gt; should be charmed and affected with it, if the Expression and Figures had a little more Conformity to our Genius; or if we could Divest our selves of Prejudice, which disposes us to dislike every Thing which is the least different from what we are used to; tho' by this Practice we condemn our selves without perceiving it, since our Lightness never permits us to continue long in the Approbation of any Thing.
:Our [[Jesus|Saviour]] himself scarce ever gave any Precepts to the [[Jew]]s but under the Veil of Parables. [...] [p.33]

Huet is extremely interested in changing tastes and in the relativity of judgments&amp;mdash;he is far from any simple theory of cultural progress or decline. His concept is rather one of different functions knowledge and fictions can gain. Fables stood in the centre of his discussion so far. The next passages gain a wider perspective:

:But it is not enough to have discovered ''The Original of Romances;'' we must see by what Streams they have spread and convey'd themselves into ''Greece,'' and ''Italy,'' and whether they have passed from thence to us; or we have received them from any other Nation. [p.35]

==== Novels of Luxury: Persia, Greece and Rome ====

The ancient world developed a high cultural standard. Luxury commodities became important. Persia was the country of highest refinement, producing perfumes and dances before the Milesians imported much of that culture:

:But the ''[[Miletus|Milesians]],'' above all the rest, discover'd the indulging Temper, surpassed them all in the Accuracy of their Pleasures, and shew'd the most singular Taste for Delicacies. They were the first who introduced the Art of Romancing among the ''Persians,'' when they had had such Success in it themselves, that the ''Milesian'' fables, the same with Romances, full of Love Adventures, and Licentious Relations, advanced into the Highest Reputation: 'Tis probable Romances were Innocent 'till they fell into their hands, and before recounted only singular and memorable Adventures.

:But these were the first who corrupted them [...]

One does not have any material artefacts to prove this, yet the ancient historians help us here with their accounts. The [[Ionia]]ns influenced the Greeks. [[Alexander the Great]] did much to widen their cultural concepts. The ''Milesian Fables'' by [[Aristides of Miletus]] were finally translated into Latin. The book was criticized in Rome's Senate as hardly serving the purposes of a Rome involved in wars.

Huet mentions names and develops a canon of texts and reaches Heliodorus who has to be compared with [[Jamblicus]], the author of the Babylonics, which have only survived in fragments:

:''[[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]]'' excell'd him in the Desposition of his Subject, and indeed in every other Particular. Hitherto the World had not seen any thing better designed, and more compleat in Romance, than the Adventures of ''Theagenes'' and ''Chariclia:'' Nothing can be more chaste than their Loves. By this it appears, (beside the Honour of the Christian Reli|&lt;50&gt;gion which he professed) that he had in his own Nature such an Air of Virtue, as shines throughout the Work; in which not only ''Jambicus,'' but almost all the rest, are much his Inferiors. His Merit advanc'd him to the Dignity of an Episcopal See: He was Bishop of Tricca, a City of ''[[Thessaly]]. [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates]]'' reports, that he introduced into that Diocese, the Custom of Deposing such of the Clergy, as did not abstain from the Women they had contracted before their Admission into Orders. This makes me very much suspect what ''[[Saint Nicephorus|Nicephorus]],'' a credulous Writer, of little Judgement or Sincerity relates; That a Provincial Synod, understanding|&lt;51&gt; the Danger which the Reading this Romance (so highly Authorised by the Dignity of its Author) might expose Young People to; proposed, that he should either consent to the Burning of his Book, or the Resignation of his Bishoprick; and that he accepted the latter of the Conditions.[p.51]

[[Achilles Tatius]]' ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon]]'' enters the canon, and Huet is uncertain about the chronology of events:

:However, he is not to be compared to ''Heliodorus,'' either for the Regularity of his Manners, the Variety of Events, or the Artifice of Unraveling his Plots. Indeed his Style is to be preferr'd to that of ''Heliodorus,'' because 'tis more Simple and natural; whereas the other's is more forced. Some say, that he was a Christian, and a Bishop too. 'Tis strange, that the Obscenity of his Book should be so easily forgot; and more so, that the [[Leo VI the Wise|Emperor Leo VI]], sirnamed the ''Philosopher,'' should commend the Modesty of it, in an Epigram which is yet extant; and not only permit but recommend the Reading of it with the clo|&lt;54&gt;sest Application, to all those who profess the Love of Chastity. [p.54]

Then, referring to Longos and his ''Daphnis and Chloe:''

:My Judgement upon the Pastorals of ''Longus'' the Sophist, is the same with that I gave of the Two former Romances. For|&lt;78&gt; tho' the Learned of Late Times have commended them for their Elegance and Agreement, joined to a Simplicity proper to the Nature of the Subjects; yet I can observe nothing in it, but that Simplicity, which sometimes declines to Childishness and Impertinence. There is nothing in it of Invention, or Conduct. He begins grosly in the Birth of his Shepherds, and ends with their Marriage. He never clears up his Adventures, but by Machines improper, and ill contrived. His Expressions are so obscene, that one must be somewhat a ''Cynic,'' to read them without Blushing. His Style does not deserve the Commen|&lt;79&gt;dations it receives. 'Tis the Style of a Sophist, such as he was [...] which partakes of the Orator and Historian, tho' it be proper for neither of them. 'Tis full of ''Metaphors,'' ''Antitheses,'' Figures, which dazzle and surprise the Simple, and tickle the Ear, without satisfying the Mind; instead of Engaging the Reader, by the Novelty of Events, the Arrangement of Variety of Matter, a clear and close Narration, attended by a smooth and regular Cadence, which always advances within the Subject.

:He endeavours (as all Sophists do) to entertain his Reader with Accidental Descripti|&lt;81&gt;ons: He leads him out of the way; and while he admits him so far into a Country he did not look for, he spends and exhausts the Attention and Impatience he had to arrive at the End he proposed. [p.80]

Rome does not play more than a marginal role. Huet mentions "Sybaritian Fables" and the love fiction of Ovid, yet only Petronius wrote something like a "romance" in Latin. Ovid mentions a Roman esteem of romances, Huet's comment:

:Hence appears the Esteem Romances had in Rome; which is more evident, by the Romance which ''Petronius'' (one of their Consuls, and the most polished Man of his Time) composed. He disposed it into the|&lt;93&gt; Form of a ''Satyr,'' of the same Kind which ''Varro'' invented, intermixing Prose with Verse, the Serious with the Jocose, and stiled it ''Menippean;'' because ''Menippus'' had before treated of Serious Matters in a Pleasant Style.

:This Satyr of ''Petronius'' fails not to be a True Romance: It contains nothing but diverting and ingenious Fictions, tho' they are sometimes too licentious and immodest. He hides under a Disguise a fine and poignant Raillery, against the Vices of Nero's Court. What remains of it, are some incoherent Fragments, or rather Collections of some industrious Person; so that one can't exactly discern|&lt;94&gt; the Form and Connexion of the whole Piece; tho' it appears to be conducted with Order. And 'tis probable those incoherent Parts, would compose a very Compleat Body, with the Addition of those which are lost. Tho' ''Petronius'' seems to be a very great Critic, and of an exquisite Taste in Learning; his Style does not always advance to the Delicacy of his Judgement: Something of Affectation may be observed. In some Places he's too Florid and Adorned; and degenerates from that Natural and Majestic Simplicity, which shined in the ''Agustan'' Age. [p.94]

==== The Northern Tradition: Fictions of a Dark Age of Ignorance ====

The ancient authors excelled with satires and texts which are no longer extant&amp;mdash;a history which ended in darkness with the invasion of Germanic tribes causing the fall of the Roman empire:

:Hitherto the Art of Romancing was maintained with some Splendor, but it soon decayed with Learning and the Empire; when the Furious nations of the ''North'' disseminated, with their Bodies, the Ignorance and barbarity of their Minds. Romances were hitherto composed for|&lt;101&gt; Delight. Fabulous Histories were now introduced, because none were acquainted with the Truth. ''Taliessin,'' who lived about the Middle of the Sixth Age, under that King ''Arthur'' so famous in Romances; and ''Melkin,'' who was somewhat younger, writ the History of ''England,'' his Country, of King ''Arthur,'' and the ''Round Table. Balæus,'' who has put them in his Catalogue, speaks of them, as of Authors filled with Fables. The same may be said of ''Hunibaldus Francus,'' who (as some relate) was Contemporary with ''Clovis,'' and whose History is no other but a Mass of Lies grossly conceived. [p.101]

The present age&amp;mdash;the late 17th century&amp;mdash;has learned to live with a differentiation between fiction and fact. The Middle Ages were marked by a completely different frame of mind. Huet reaches the stories written about king Arthur and Merlin:

:[...] those which contained the Atchievements of King Arthur, and the Life of ''Merlin.''|&lt;104&gt;

:These Diverting Histories pleased the Readers, who were more ignorant than those who composed them. They did not, in those Days, trouble themselves with Researches into Antiquity, and after being informed of the Truth of what they wrote. They had the Stuff in their own Head, and went no farther than their own Invention. Thus Historians degenerated into True Romancers.

:In this Age of Ignorance, the Latin Tongue, as well as Truth, was neglected and despised. The Versifiers, Composers, Inventers of tales, Jesters, and in short, all of this Country who studied what they called the Gay Science, began about the Time of Hugh|&lt;105&gt; ''Capet,'' to set upon Romancing with great Fury; and soon over-ran France, by dispersing them. These Fables were composed in the Roman Tongue [...]

The term romance was now invented&amp;mdash;to denote the Spanish and French Language these texts were written in:

:The ''Spaniards'' use the Word ''Romance'' in the same Signification with us, and call their ordinary Language by that Name. The ''Romain'' being then most universally understood, those of ''Provence'' who apply'd themselves to Fictions, made use of it in their Writings, which from thence were called ''Romances.'' [p.106]

The idea of a tradition coming via Spain to Europe is thus balanced by a second option: [p.&amp;nbsp;108-09] Taliessin and Melkin were English heroes, Huet notes. The romances touching them must have been composed originally around 550.

==== Where Traditions Met: Europe and Another Theory of the Anthropology of Fiction ====

The development into the 17th century gives the ''Amadis of Gaul'' a central position [p.&amp;nbsp;114-16] and leads to Cervantes ''Don Quixote''&amp;mdash;which is rather a critic of "romances" than a romance itself.
The following long passage gives Huet's picture of the intellectual network behind the rise of the modern novel&amp;mdash;and of the traditions which now met:

:All ''Europe'' was then overwhelmed with Darkness and Ignorance, but ''France, England,'' and ''Germany'' much less than ''Italy,'' which then produced but a small Number of Writers, and scarce any Authors of Romances. Those of that Country, who had a Mind to distinguish themselves by Learning and Knowledge, came for it to the University of ''Paris,'' which was the Mother of Sciences, and Nurse of the Learning of ''Europe.'' St.&amp;nbsp;''Thomas Aquinas,'' St.&amp;nbsp;''Bonaventure,'' the Poets ''Dante,'' and ''Boccace,'' came thither to study; and the President ''Fauchet'' produces, that the last of them took a great Part of his Novels from ''French'' Ro|&lt;121&gt;mances; and that ''Petrarch,'' and the other ''Italian'' Poets, have rifled for their Richest Fancies, the Songs of ''Thiband'' King of Navarre, ''Gace's Brussez, Chastelain de Corcy,'' and the Old ''French'' Romances. 'Twas then, in my Opinion, that the ''Italians'' learned from us the Science of Romance; which, by their own Confession, is to be ascribed to us, as well as that of Rhyming.

:Thus ''Spain'' and ''Italy'' received from us an Art, which was the Effect of our Ignorance and Barbarity, and which the Politeness of the Persians, Ionians, and Greeks had produced. As Necessity engages us, to sustain our Bodies|&lt;122&gt; with Herbs an Roots; so when the Knowledge of Truth, which is the Proper and Natural Aliment of the Mind, begins to fail, we have Recourse to Falsehood, which is the Imitation of Truth. As in Plenty we refuse Bread, and our ordinary Viands, for Ragousts; so our Minds, when acquainted with the Truth, forsake the Study and Speculation of it, to be entertained with its Image, which is Fiction. This Imitation according to ''Aristotle,'' is often more agreeable than the Original it self; so that two oppositely different Paths, which are Ignorance and Learning, Rudeness and Politeness, do often conduct us to the same End; which is|&lt;123&gt; an Application to Fictions, Fables, and Romances. Hence it is, that the most Barbarous Nations are taken with Romantic Inventions, as well as the most Refined. The Originals of all the Savages of ''America,'' and particularly those of ''Peru,'' are nothing but Fables; no more are those of the Goths, which they wrote in their Ancient ''Runic'' Characters, upon great Stones; the Remains of which I my self have seen in ''Denmark.'' And if any Thing were left us of the Works, which the Bards among the Ancient ''Gauls'' composed, to eternize the Memory of their Nation, I don't question but we should find them enriched with Abundance of Fictions.

:This Inclination to Fables, which is common to all Men, is not the Result of Reason; Imitation, or Custom. 'Tis Natural to them, and has its Seat in the very Frame and Disposition of their Soul. For the Desire of Knowledge is particular to man, and distinguishes him from Beasts no less than his Reason. nay we may observe in other Creatures some Rude Impressions of this; whereas the Desire of Understanding is Peculiar to Us only.

:The Reason of this, according to my Opinion, is; because the Faculties of the Soul are too Vast an Extent, to be supplied by the Present Objects, so that 'tis obliged to|&lt;125&gt; have recourse to what's past, and to come, in Truth and in Fictions, in Imaginary Spaces and Impossibilities, for Objects to exert it self upon. The Objects of Sense fill the Desires of the Soul of Brutes, who have no farther Concern; so that we can't discover in them these restless Emotions, which continually actuate the Mind of Man, and carry it into the Pursuit of a recent Information, to proportion (if possible the Object to the Faculty; and enjoy a Pleasure resembling that which we perceive in the Appeasing a Violent Hunger, and Extinguishing a Corroding Thirst. This is that which ''Plato'' intends, in the Marriage of ''Do-''|&lt;126&gt;''rus'' and ''Penia,'' (in which Terms he would express Riches and Poverty,) which produces exquisite Pleasure. The Object is signified by Riches, which are not so but in Use and Intention; otherwise they are unfruitful and afford no Delight. The Faculty is intended by Inquietude, while 'tis separated from Riches; whereas its Union with them, supplies the Highest Satisfaction. The Case is the same with our Souls: Poverty, the same with Ignorance, is Natural to it; it sighs continually after Science; which is its Riches; and when 'tis possess'd of this Enjoyment, it feels the greatest Pleasure. But|&lt;127&gt; this Pleasure is not always equal; it often is the Purchase of much labour and Difficulty: As when the Soul applies it self to intricate Speculations, and Occult Sciences, the Matter whereof is not present to our Senses; where the Imagination, which acts with Faculity, has a Less Part in the Pursuit than the Understanding, whose Operations are more Vehement and Intense: And because Labour is naturally tedious, the Soul is not carried to Hard and Spinous Learning, unless in Prospect of some Advantage, or Hope of some remote Amusement, or else by Necessity. But the Knowledge which attracts and delights it most, is that which is acquired without|&lt;128&gt; Pain and where the Imagination alone acts on Subjects which fall under our Sense, ravish our Passions, and are great Movers in all the Affairs of Life. Such are Romances, which require no great Intention or Dispense of Mind, to understand them. No long Reasonings are exacted; the Memory is not overburthened: Nothing is demanded, but Fancy and Imagination. They move our Passions; but 'tis on purpose to sooth and calm them again: They excite neither Fear nor Compassion; [u]nless it be to display to us the Pleasure of seeing those we are afraid, or concern'd for, out of Reach of Danger or Distress. In short, all our Emo|&lt;129&gt;tions there find themselves agreeably provoked and appeased.

:'Tis hence, that those who act more by [Passion than Reason], and labour more with their Imagination than Understanding, are affected by them; tho' these other are touched by them too, but after another manner. These are touched by the Beauties of Art, which amuse the Understanding; but the former, Ignorant and Simple, are sensible of no more than what strikes upon the Imagination, and stirs their Passions. They love the Fiction, and enquire no farther. Now Fictions being nothing but Narrations, True in Appearance, and False in Reality; the Minds of the Simple, who discern on|&lt;130&gt;ly the Disguise, are pleased and highly satisfied with this Shew of Truth. But those who penetrate farther, and see into the Solid, are easily disgusted with the Falsity: So that the first love Falsehood, because it is concealed under an Appearance of Truth; the Latter are distasted with the Image of Truth, because of the Real Forgery which is couched under it; unless it be varnished with Ingenuity, Subtility, and Instruction, and recommends it self by the Excellency of Invention and Art. St&amp;nbsp;''Augustin'' makes this Observation somewhere; 'That these Falsities which carry a Signification, and suggest an Hidden Meaning, are not Lies,|&lt;131&gt; but the Figures of Truth; which the most Wise and Holy Persons, and even our ''Saviour'' himself, have used upon Honourable and Pious Occasions.'

:Since then 'tis true, that Lies commonly flow from Ignorance, and the Grossness of our Intellect; and that this Inundation of the Barbarians, who issued from the North, spread over all Europe, and plunged it into such profound Ignorance, as it could not clear it self from, within the Space of Two Ages; is it not then probable, that this Ignorance caused the same Effect in Europe, which it had produced every where besides? And is it not vain to enquire for that in|&lt;132&gt; Chance, which we find in Nature? There is then no Reason to contend, but that the French, German, and English Romances, and all the Fables of the North, are Fruits of those Countries, and not imported from Abroad: That they never had other Originals than the Histories stuffed with Falsities, and made in Obscure Ignorant Times, when there was neither Industry nor Curiosity to discover the Truth of Things, nor Art to describe it, if 'twas found: That these Histories have been well received by the Unpolished and Half-barbarous People; and that the Historians thereupon took upon them the Liberty to pre|&lt;133&gt;sent them with what was purely forged, which were the Romances.

The whole development of fiction is thus not one of continuities&amp;mdash;but one of different traditions and complex reasons why fictions develop. Huet reaches the present age and passes through numerous titles:

==== Fictions and the Modern Period ====

:I shall not undertake to [...] examine whether ''Amadis de Gaul'' were originally from ''Spain, Flanders,'' or ''France;'' and whether the Romance of ''Tiel Ulespiegel'' be a Translation from the ''German;'' or in what Language the Romance of the ''Seven Wise Men of Greece'' was first written; or that of ''Dolopathos,'' which some say was extracted from the Parables of ''Sandaber'' the ''Indian.'' Some say 'tis to be found in ''Greek'' in some Libraries; which has furnished the Matter of an ''Italian'' Book call'd ''Erastus,'' (and of many of Boccace his Novels, as the same ''Fauchet'' has remarked) which was written in ''La-''|&lt;137&gt;''tin'' by ''John Morck,'' or the Abby ''de Hauteselne,'' whereof Ancient Copies are to be seen; and translated into ''French'' by the Clerk ''Hubert,'' about the End of the Twelfth Age, and into ''High Dutch'' about Three Hundred Years afterwards; and an Hundred Years after that, from ''High Dutch'' into ''Latin'' again, by a Learned hand, who changed the Names of it, and was ignorant that the ''Dutch'' had come from the ''Latin.''
:It shall suffice if I tell you, that all these Works which Ignorance has given Birth to, carried along with them the Marks of their Original, and were no other than a Complication of|&lt;138&gt; Fictions, grossly cast together in the greatest Confusion, and infinitely short of the Excellent Degree of Art and Elegance, to which the ''French'' Nation is now arrived in Romances. 'Tis truly a Subject of Admiration, that we, who have yielded to others the Bays for ''Epic'' Poetry, and History, have nevertheless advanced these to so high a Perfection, that the Best of theirs are not Equal to the Meanest of ours.

:We owe (I believe) this Advantage to the Refinement and Politeness of our Gallantry; which proceeds, in my Opinion, from the great Liberty which the Men of ''France'' allow to the|&lt;139&gt; Ladies. They are in a manner Recluses in ''Italy'' and ''Spain;'' and separated from Men by so many Obstacles, that they are scarce to be seen, and not to be spoken with at all. Hence the Men have neglected the Art of Engaging the Tender Sex, because the Occasions of it are so rare. All the Study and Business there, is to surmount the Difficulties of Access; when this is effected, they make Use of the Time, without amusing themselves with Forms. But in ''France,'' the Ladies go at large upon their Parole; and being under no Custody but that of their own Heart, erect it into a Fort, more strong and secure than|&lt;140&gt; all the Keys, Grates, and Vigilance of the ''Douegnas.'' The Men are obliged to make a Regular and Formal Assault against this Fort, to employ so much Industry and Address to reduce it, that they have formed it into an Art scarce known to other Nations.

:'Tis this Art which distinguishes the ''French'' from other Romances, and renders the Reading of them so Delicious, that they cause more Profitable Studies to be neglected.

:The Ladies were first taken with this Lure: They made Romances their Study; and have despised the Ancient Fa|&lt;141&gt;ble and History so far, that they now no longer understand those Works, from which they received their greatest Embellishments: And lest they should blush at this Ignorance, which they find themselves so often guilty of; they perceive they had better disapprove what they don't know, than take the Pains to learn it.

:The Men, in Complaisance, have imitated them; condemned what they disliked, and call that Pedantry, which made an Essential Part of Politeness, even in ''Malherbe'''s Time. The Poets, and other ''French'' Writers who succeeded, have been constrained to submit to this Arbi|&lt;142&gt;tration; and many of them, observing that the Knowledge of Antiquity would be of no Advantage to them, have ceased to study what they durst not practise: Thus a very Good Cause has produced an Ill Effect; and the Beauty of our Romances has drawn upon them the Contempt of Good Letters, and consequently Ignorance.

:I don't, for all this, pretend to condemn the Reading of them. The Best Things in the World are attended with their Inconveniencies; Romances too may have much worse than Ignorance. I know what they are accused for: They exhaust our Devotion, and in|&lt;143&gt;spire us with Irregular Passions, and corrupt our Manner. All this may be, and sometimes does happen. But what can't Evil and Degenerated Minds  make an Ill Use of? Weak Souls are contagious to themselves, and make Poyson of every Thing. Histories must be forbidden, which relate so many Pernicious Examples; and the Fable must undergo the same Fate; for there Crimes are authorised by the Practice of the Gods. [...|&lt;144&gt;]

:Little Regard was had to Sobriety of manners, in most Part of the Greek and Old French Romances, by Reason of the Vice of the Times in which they were composed. [...] But the Modern Romances (I speak of the Good ones) are so far from this Fault, that you'll scarce find an Expression, or Word, which may shock Chaste Ears, or one single Action which may give Offence to Modesty.

:If any one object; That Love is treated of in a Manner so Soft and Insinuating, that the Bait of this Dangerous Passion invades too easily the Tender Hearts; I answer, That it is so far from being Dangerous, that it is in some Respects Necessary, that the Young People of the World should be acquainted with it; that they may stop their Ears to that which is Criminal, and be better fortified against its Artifices; and know their Conduct, in that which has an Honest and Sacred End. This is so true, that Experience lays before us, that such as are least acquainted with Love, are the most unguarded to its As|&lt;145&gt;saults, that the most Ignorant are soonest decoyed. Add to this that Nothing so much refines and polishes Wit; Nothing conduces so much to the Forming and Advancing it to the Approbation of the World, as the Reading of Romances. These are the Dumb Tutors, which succeed those of the College, and teach us how to Live and Speak by a more Persuasive and Instructive method than theirs [...]. [p.145]

Huet has with this survey reached the end of his treatise. D'Urfee and Mademoiselle de Scudery become important here:

:Monsieur ''D'Urfee'' was the first who retrieved them from Barbarity, and reduced them to Rules, in his Incomparable ''Astrea,'' The most Ingenious and Polite Work which has appeared in this Kind, and which Eclipsed the Glory which ''Greece, Italy'' and ''Spain,'' had acquired. [...|&lt;146&gt;]

:None can, without Amazement, read those which a Maid as Illustrious in her Modesty, as her Merit, has published under a Borrowed Name; depriving her self so Generously of that Glory which was her Due, and not seeking for Reward, but in her Virtue; as if while She took so much Trouble for the Honour of our Nation, She would spare that Shame to Our Sex. But Time has done her that Justice, which she had denied her self; and has informed us, that the Illustrious Bassa, Grand ''Cyrus,'' and ''Clælia,'' are the Performances of Madam de ''Scudery'' [...].

The last lines refer to the following "history" ''Zayde''&amp;mdash;which will, so Huet, deserve all praise:

:The Virtues which conduct his Reign are so Noble, and the Fortune which attend them so Surprizing, that Posterity would doubt whether it were a History, or a Romance. [p.149]

...which is the final sentence.
