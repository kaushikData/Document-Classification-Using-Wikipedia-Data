The '''845''' power [[triode]] is a [[radio frequency|radio]] [[transmitter|transmitting]] [[vacuum tube]] which can also be used as an [[valve audio amplifier|audio amplifier]] and [[modulation]] tube. Typically, the [[plate electrode|plate]] is machined from solid [[graphite]] in order to accommodate high [[Electric current|current]] [[dissipation]] (up to 100 [[watt]]s) and [[voltage]]. Some current production 845 tubes have metal plates.

The 845 tube has a [[bayonet mount]] and [[Thorium dioxide|thoriated]] [[Electrical filament|filament]]s which glow like [[lightbulb]]s when powered up. The glass envelope is about 2-5/16" in diameter and 6&amp;nbsp;inches tall, with the a total tube height of about 7-7/8&amp;nbsp;inches. It was first released by [[RCA]] in 1931. It saw extensive use in RCA [[AM radio]] transmitters

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16044">'''AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1''' is an FAA [[Advisory circular|Advisory Circular (AC)]] (Subject: ''System Design and Analysis'') that describes acceptable means for showing compliance with the airworthiness requirements of § 25.1309 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.  The present unreleased but working draft of AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 is the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee recommended revision ''B-Arsenal Draft'' (2002); the present ''released'' version is A (1988).  The FAA and [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]] have accepted proposals by [[type certificate]] applicants to use the Arsenal Draft on recent development programs.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Cary R., ed, [http://shamazkhan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/avionics_design.pdf ''Digital Avionics Handbook''], 2nd ed., Avionics, Development and Implementation, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. 2007,p. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2025-19A.pdf AC 25-19A], Certification Maintenance Requirements, 2011, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 establishes the principle that the more severe the hazard resulting from a system or equipment failure, the less likely that failure must be. Failures that are catastrophic must be extremely improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Software Certification | publisher =Aviation Today | date =October 31, 2005 | url =http://www.aviationtoday.com/regions/usa/Software-Certification_3205.html | accessdate = 2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Airworthiness standards ==
The [[Airworthiness|airworthiness requirements]] for [[transport category]] airplanes are contained in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 25 (commonly referred to as part 25 of the [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] (FAR)). Manufacturers of transport category airplanes must show that each airplane they produce of a given [[Type certificate|type design]] complies with the relevant standards of part 25.

AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 describes acceptable means for showing compliance with those airworthiness requirements.  It recognizes Aerospace Recommended Practices ARP4754 and ARP4761 (or their successors) as such means:&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, p. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[ARP4754]]A, ''Guidelines For Development Of Civil Aircraft and Systems'', is a guideline from [[SAE International]], dealing with the development processes which support [[Type certificate|certification]] of [[Avionics#Aircraft avionics|Aircraft systems]].  This  ARP further recognizes integration of [[DO-297]], [[DO-178C|DO-178]], and [[DO-254]] into the guidelines for development and recognizes ARP5150/5151 as guidelines for in-service operation and maintenance.
*[[ARP4761]], ''Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process On Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment''

== Background ==
AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 provides background for important concepts and issues within airplane system design and analysis.
;Catastrophic failure condition rate
The circular provides a rationale for the upper limit for the Average Probability per Flight Hour for Catastrophic Failure Conditions of 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; or "Extremely Improbable".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/committees/documents/media/TAEsdaT2-5241996.pdf AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1B Arsenal Draft] ({{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413045558/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/committees/documents/media/TAEsdaT2-052496.pdf|date=2014-04-13}}), 2002, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure Conditions having less severe effects could be relatively more likely to occur; that is, an inverse relationship between severity and likelihood.

;Fail-Safe Design Concept
This AC presents the FAA ''Fail-Safe Design Concept'', which applies basic objectives pertaining to failures:
#''Failures of any system should be assumed for any given flight regardless of probability and such failures "should not prevent continued safe flight and landing" or otherwise significantly reduce safety''
#''Subsequent failure during the same flight should also be assumed.''
The AC lists design principles or techniques used to ensure a safe design.  Usually, a combination of at least two safe design techniques are needed to provide a fail-safe design; i.e. to ensure that Major Failure Conditions are Remote, Hazardous Failure Conditions are Extremely Remote, and Catastrophic Failure Conditions are Extremely Improbable.

;Highly integrated systems
With emergence of ''highly integrated systems'' that perform complex and interrelated functions, particularly through the use of electronic technology and software-based techniques [e.g., [[Integrated modular avionics|Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA)]] ], concerns arose that traditionally ''quantitative'' functional-level design and analysis techniques previously applied to simpler systems were no longer adequate.  As such the AC includes expanded, methodical approaches, both qualitative and quantitative, that consider the ''integration'' of the "whole airplane and its systems".&lt;ref name="Arsenal Draft p. 7"&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1B&amp;ndash;Arsenal Draft, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions and Classifications ==
A main task of AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 is to provide standard definitions of terms (including hazard and probability classifications) for consistent use throughout the framework set up for the accomplishment of functional airplane safety.  Where regulations (FAR) and standards (ARP) may use such terms as ''failure condition'', and ''extremely improbable'', AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 defines their specific meanings.&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1B&amp;ndash;Arsenal Draft, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 is comparable to [[ISO 26262|ISO 26262&amp;ndash;1 Vocabulary]], at least in regard to the relative dependent standards.  Key definitions include:

;''Error'', ''Failures'', and ''Failure Conditions''
:The re-introduction of ''Error'' to the AC recognizes the role of human error (in development, manufacture, operation, or maintenance) as a source of system failures, especially in complex and integrated avionics.  The term ''Failure Conditions'' provides for a focus on the effects of a failure separate from the causes.

;Classification of failure conditions by severity of effect
:''Catastrophic'', ''Hazardous'', ''Major'', ''Minor'', or ''No Safety Effect''
:A Catastrophic Failure condition is one which would result in fatalities usually with the loss of the airplane.
;Definition of Probability Terms
:''Extremely Improbable'', ''Extremely Remote'', ''Remote'', or ''Probable'' 
:An Extremely Improbable failure condition is one so unlikely that it is not anticipated to occur during the entire operational life of all airplanes of one type. ''Quantitatively'', these probability terms are define as follows: Extremely Improbable (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; or less), Extremely Remote (10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; or less), Remote (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; or less), Probable (more than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1B&amp;ndash;Arsenal Draft, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety Objectives ==
Classified failure conditions are assigned qualitative and quantitative safety objectives, giving guidance to development and operation.
;Quantitative
The AC defines the acceptable safety level for equipment and systems as installed on the airplane and establishes an inverse relationship between Average Probability per Flight Hour and the severity of Failure Condition effects:
#Failure Conditions with No Safety Effect have no probability requirement.
#Minor Failure Conditions may be Probable.
#Major Failure Conditions must be no more frequent than Remote.
#Hazardous Failure Conditions must be no more frequent than Extremely Remote.
#Catastrophic Failure Conditions must be Extremely Improbable.
The safety objectives associated with Catastrophic Failure Conditions may be satisfied by demonstrating that:
#No single failure will result in a Catastrophic Failure Condition; and
#Each Catastrophic Failure Condition is extremely improbable.
;Qualitative
The failure conditions ''Catastrophic'' through ''No Safety Effect'' are assigned Functional and Item Design Assurance Levels A, B, C, D, E, respectively.&lt;ref name="ARP4754"&gt;[[ARP4754|ARP4754A]], ''Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems, SAE Aerospace'', December, 2010, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First released in 1982, AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 has been revised to embody increasing experience in development of airplanes and to address the increasing integration and computerization of aircraft functions.

=== AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 (original release) ===
==== Function criticality ====
AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1  recommended that top-down analysis should identify each system function and evaluate its criticality, i.e., either non-essential, essential, or critical.  The terms Error, Failure, and Failure Condition were defined. Functions were classified Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential according to the severity of the failure conditions they could contribute to; but the conditions were not expressly classified. Failures of Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential functions were expected to be, respectively, Extremely Improbable (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;9&lt;/sup&gt; or less), Improbable (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;5&lt;/sup&gt; or less), or no worse than Probable (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;5&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2025.1309-1.pdf, AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1], 1982, p. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Qualitative methods ====
Previously, system safety analysis was quantitative; that is, it was dependent on evaluating the probability of system failures from physical faults of components.  But with the increasing use of digital avionics (i.e., software) it was recognized that development error was a significant contributor to system failure.  During system certification in the late 1970s, it became clear that the classical statistical methods of safety assessment for flight critical software based systems were not possible.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Leslie A. (Schad)|title=DO-178B, "Software Considerations in Airborne|publisher=Flight Systems, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group|location=Seattle, Washington|url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/teaching/safety/reports/schad.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing quantitative methods could not predict system failure rates resultant from development errors.  ''Qualitative'' methods were instead recommended for reducing specification, design, and implementation errors in the development of digital avionics.  

The guidance of DO-178 (initial release) was recommended by AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1 for development of essential and critical functions implemented in software.&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1A ===
AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1A introduced the FAA Fail-Safe Design Concept to this Advisory Circular.&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1A, 1988, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This revision also introduced recommended design principles or techniques in order to ensure a safe design.&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1A, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Classification of failure conditions by severity ====
The concept of function criticality was replaced with classification of failure conditions according to severity of effects (cf., [[Probabilistic risk assessment]]).  Failure conditions having Catastrophic, Major, or Minor effects were to have restricted likelihoods, respectively, of Extremely Improbable (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;9&lt;/sup&gt; or less), Improbable (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;5&lt;/sup&gt; or less), or no worse than Probable (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;5&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1A, pp. 4,5,7, 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software was still considered to be assessed and controlled by other means; that is, by RTCA/DO-178A or later revision, via Advisory Circular [[AC 20-115|AC 20-115A]].&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1A, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AC 25&amp;nbsp;1309&amp;ndash;1B ===
In May 1996, the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) was tasked with a review of harmonized FAR/JAR&amp;nbsp;25.1309, AC&amp;nbsp;1309-1A, and related documents, and to consider revision to AC&amp;nbsp;1309-1A incorporating recent practice, increasing complex integration between aircraft functions and the systems that implement them,&lt;ref&gt;ARP4754A, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and the implications of new technology. This task was published in the Federal Register at 61 FR 26246-26247 (1996-05-24). The focus was to be on safety assessment and fault-tolerant critical systems.

In 2002, the FAA provided a [[Notice of proposed rulemaking|Notice of Proposed Rulemaking]] (NPRM) relevant to 14 CFR Part 25. Accompanying this notice is the ''Arsenal draft'' of AC&amp;nbsp;1309&amp;ndash;1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/committees/documents/media/TAEsdaT2-052496.pdf Revised General Function and Installation Requirements for Equipment, Systems, and Installations on Transport Category Airplanes, Notice of proposed rulemaking,  Draft R6X Phase 1 – June 2002, also known as the ''Arsenal Draft'' of AC 25.1309-1B ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413045558/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/committees/documents/media/TAEsdaT2-052496.pdf |date=2014-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing definitions and rules in § 25.1309 and related standards have posed certain problems to the certification of transport category airplanes.  Said problems are discussed at length within the NPRM.  The FAA proposed revisions to several related standards in order to eliminate such problems and to clarify the intent of these standards.  In some proposed changes, definitions or conventions developed in lower level regulations or standards were adopted or revised within the subsequent Advisory Circular.

==== Refinement of failure condition classifications ====
Experience in application of the prior circulars and ARPs witnessed the division of the ''Major'' failure condition into two conditions (for example, Hazardous-severe/Major and Major).&lt;ref name="DO-178B"&gt;RTCA/[[DO-178B]] (subsequently [[DO-178C]], ''Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics'', December 1, 1992, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, this experience recognised the existence of failure conditions that have ''no effect on safety'', which could be so classified and thereby assigned no safety objectives. Catastrophic Failure Condition was previously defined as "any failure condition which would prevent continued safe flight and landing"; but is now defined as "Failure conditions which would result in multiple fatalities, usually with the loss of the airplane.&lt;ref&gt;AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1B&amp;ndash;Arsenal Draft, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;"

==== Extension of qualitative controls to aircraft functions ==== 
The FAA Fail-Safe Design Concept and design principles or techniques for safe design are maintained.  However, owing to the increasing development of Highly Integrated Systems in aircraft, qualitative controls previously considered necessary for safe software development are extended to the aircraft function level.&lt;ref name="Arsenal Draft p. 7"/&gt; (Similar guidance ([[Functional Safety|Functional Safety framework]]) has been provided for highly integrated automotive systems through the 2011, release of [[ISO 26262]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Beeby | first = Martin | title = DO-178C the future of Avionics Certification | publisher = atego HighRely | pages = 6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1601">The '''ARINC 629''' computer bus was introduced in May 1995 and is used on the Boeing 777, and Airbus aircraft. The ARINC 629 bus operates as a multiple-source, multiple-sink system; each terminal can transmit data to, and receive data from, every other terminal on the data bus. This allows much more freedom in the exchange of data between units in the avionics system. ARINC 629 has the ability to accommodate up to a total of 128 terminals on a data bus and supports a data rate of 2 Mbps.

The ARINC 629 data bus was developed by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) to replace the [[ARINC 429]] bus.
The ARINC 629 data bus was based on the Boeing DATAC bus.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Air–fuel ratio''' ('''AFR''') is the mass ratio of [[air]] to a solid, liquid, or gaseous [[fuel]] present in a [[combustion]] process. The combustion may take place in a controlled  manner such as in an [[internal combustion engine]] or industrial furnace, or may result in an explosion (e.g., a [[dust explosion]], [[gas explosion|gas or vapour explosion]] or in a [[Thermobaric_weapon#Fuel-air_explosive|thermobaric weapon]]). 

The air-fuel ratio determines whether a mixture is combustible at all, how much energy is being released, and how much unwanted pollutants are produced in the reaction. Typically a range of fuel to air ratios exists, outside of which ignition will not occur. These are known as the lower and upper explosive limits.

In an [[internal combustion engine]] or industrial furnace, the air-fuel ratio is an important measure for anti-pollution and performance-tuning reasons. If exactly enough air is provided to completely burn all of the fuel, the ratio is known as the  [[stoichiometric]] mixture, often abbreviated to '''stoich'''. Ratios lower than stoichiometric are considered "rich". Rich mixtures are less efficient, but may produce more power and burn cooler. Ratios higher than stoichiometric are considered "lean." Lean mixtures are more efficient but may cause higher temperatures, which can lead to the formation of [[nitrogen oxide]]s. Some engines are designed with features to allow [[lean-burn]]. For precise air-fuel ratio calculations, the [[oxygen]] content of combustion air should be specified because of different [[density of air|air density]] due to different altitude or intake air temperature, possible dilution by ambient [[water vapor]], or enrichment by oxygen additions.

== Internal combustion engines==

In theory a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel. In practice this is never quite achieved, due primarily to the very short time available in an internal combustion engine for each combustion cycle. Most of the combustion process is completed in approximately 2 milliseconds at an engine speed of {{val|fmt=commas|6000|ul=revolutions per minute}}. (100 revolutions per second; 10 milliseconds per revolution) This is the time that elapses from the spark plug firing until 90% of the fuel–air mix is combusted, typically some 80 degrees of crankshaft rotation later. [[Catalytic converter]]s are designed to work best when the [[exhaust gas]]es passing through them are the result of nearly perfect combustion.

A stoichiometric mixture unfortunately burns very hot and can damage engine components if the engine is placed under high load at this fuel–air mixture. Due to the high temperatures at this mixture, detonation of the fuel–air mix while approaching or shortly after maximum cylinder pressure is possible under high load (referred to as [[Engine knocking|knocking]] or pinging), specifically a "pre-detonation" event in the context of a spark-ignition engine model. Such detonation can cause serious engine damage as the uncontrolled burning of the fuel air mix can create very high pressures in the cylinder. As a consequence, stoichiometric mixtures are only used under light to low-moderate load conditions.  For acceleration and high load conditions, a richer mixture (lower air–fuel ratio) is used to produce cooler combustion products and thereby prevent detonation and overheating of the cylinder head.

==Engine management systems==
The [[stoichiometric]] mixture for a gasoline engine is the ideal ratio of air to fuel that burns all fuel with no excess air. For [[gasoline]] fuel, the stoichiometric air–fuel mixture is about 14.7:1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hillier | first = V.A.W. | last2 = Pittuck | first2 = F.W. | year = 1966 | title = Fundamentals of Motor Vehicle Technology | chapter = Sub-section 3.2 | publisher = [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson Educational]] | location = London | isbn = 0 09 110711 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. for every one gram of fuel, 14.7 grams of air are required. The fuel oxidation reaction is:
:25&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; → 16&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 18&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy
Any mixture greater than 14.7:1 is considered a [[lean burn|lean mixture]]; any less than 14.7:1 is a [[Rich burn|rich mixture]] – given perfect (ideal) "test" fuel (gasoline consisting of solely ''n''-[[heptane]] and [[iso-octane]]). In reality, most fuels consist of a combination of heptane, octane, a handful of other [[alkanes]], plus additives including detergents, and possibly oxygenators such as MTBE ([[methyl tert-butyl ether]]) or [[ethanol]]/[[methanol]]. These compounds all alter the stoichiometric ratio, with most of the additives pushing the ratio downward (oxygenators bring extra oxygen to the combustion event in liquid form that is released at time of combustions; for  [[MTBE]]-laden fuel, a stoichiometric ratio can be as low as 14.1:1). Vehicles that use an [[oxygen sensor]] or other feedback loop to control fuel to air ratio (lambda control), compensate automatically for this change in the fuel's stoichiometric rate by measuring the exhaust gas composition and controlling fuel volume. Vehicles without such controls (such as most motorcycles until recently, and cars predating the mid-1980s) may have difficulties running certain fuel blends (especially winter fuels used in some areas) and may require different jets (or otherwise have the fueling ratios altered) to compensate. Vehicles that use [[oxygen sensor]]s can monitor the air–fuel ratio with an [[air–fuel ratio meter]].

== Other types of engines ==
In the typical air to natural gas combustion burner, a double cross limit strategy is employed to ensure ratio control. (This method was used in World War II).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The strategy involves adding the opposite flow feedback into the limiting control of the respective gas (air or fuel). This assures ratio control within an acceptable margin.

== Other terms used ==
There are other terms commonly used when discussing the mixture of air and fuel in internal combustion engines.

===Mixture===
'''Mixture''' is the predominant word that appears in training texts, operation manuals and maintenance manuals in the aviation world.

=== Air–fuel ratio (AFR) {{Anchor|Air-fuel ratio}} ===
The '''air–fuel ratio''' is the most common reference term used for mixtures in internal combustion engines.  The term is also used to define mixtures used for industrial furnace heated by combustion.  The AFR in mass units is employed in [[fuel oil]] fired furnaces, while volume (or [[mole (unit)|mole]]) units are used for [[natural gas]] fired furnaces.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{AFR} = \frac{m_\text{air}}{m_\text{fuel}}&lt;/math&gt;

Air–fuel ratio is the ratio between the ''mass'' of air and the mass of fuel in the fuel–air mix at any given moment. The mass is the mass of all constituents that compose the fuel and air, whether combustible or not. For example, a calculation of the mass of natural gas—which often contains [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}}), [[nitrogen]] ({{chem|N|2}}), and various [[alkanes]]—includes the mass of the carbon dioxide, nitrogen and all alkanes in determining the value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;fuel&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See Example 15.3 in {{cite book| last = Çengel | first = Yunus A. | last2 = Boles | first2 = Michael A. | title = Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach | edition = 5th | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]] | location = Boston | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abebooks.com/Thermodynamics-Engineering-Approach-5th-Cengel-Yunus/1943380167/bd | isbn = 9780072884951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For pure [[octane]] the stoichiometric mixture is approximately 15.1:1, or ''λ'' of 1.00 exactly.

In naturally aspirated engines powered by octane, maximum power is frequently reached at AFRs ranging from 12.5 to 13.3:1 or ''λ'' of 0.850 to 0.901.

Air-fuel ratio of 12:1 is considered as maximum output ratio, where as the air-fuel ratio of 16:1 is considered as maximum fuel economy ratio.

=== Fuel–air ratio (FAR) {{Anchor|Fuel-air ratio}} ===
'''Fuel–air ratio''' is commonly used in the [[gas turbine]] industry as well as in government studies of [[internal combustion engine]], and refers to the ratio of fuel to the air.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FAR} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{AFR}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Air–fuel equivalence ratio (''λ''){{Anchor|Air-fuel equivalence ratio}} ===
Air–fuel equivalence ratio, ''λ'' (lambda), is the ratio of actual AFR to stoichiometry for a given mixture. ''λ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.0 is at stoichiometry, rich mixtures ''λ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.0, and lean mixtures ''λ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.0.

There is a direct relationship between ''λ'' and AFR. To calculate AFR from a given ''λ'', multiply the measured ''λ'' by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. Alternatively, to recover ''λ'' from an AFR, divide AFR by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. This last equation is often used as the definition of ''λ'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\mathrm{AFR}}{\mathrm{AFR}_\text{stoich}}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the composition of common fuels varies seasonally, and because many modern vehicles can handle different fuels, when tuning, it makes more sense to talk about ''λ'' values rather than AFR.

Most practical AFR devices actually measure the amount of residual oxygen (for lean mixes) or unburnt hydrocarbons (for rich mixtures) in the exhaust gas.

===Fuel–air equivalence ratio (''ϕ''){{Anchor|Fuel-air equivalence ratio}}===
The '''fuel–air equivalence ratio''', ''ϕ'' (phi), of a system is defined as the ratio of the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio. Mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt; \phi = \frac{\mbox{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio}}{(\mbox{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio})_\text{st}} = \frac{m_\text{fuel}/m_\text{ox}}{\left(m_\text{fuel}/m_\text{ox}\right)_\text{st}} = \frac{n_\text{fuel}/n_\text{ox}}{\left(n_\text{fuel}/n_\text{ox}\right)_\text{st}}&lt;/math&gt;

where, ''m'' represents the mass, ''n'' represents number of moles, suffix st stands for stoichiometric conditions.

The advantage of using equivalence ratio over fuel–oxidizer ratio is that it takes into account (and is therefore independent of) both mass and molar values for the fuel and the oxidizer. Consider, for example,  a mixture of one mole of [[ethane]] ({{chem|C|2|H|6}}) and one mole of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}). The fuel–oxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the mass of fuel and air is

:&lt;math chem&gt; \frac{m_\ce{C2H6}}{m_\ce{O2}} = \frac{1 \times (2\times12+6\times1)}{1 \times (2\times16)} = \frac{30}{32} = 0.9375&lt;/math&gt;

and the fuel-oxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the number of moles of fuel and air is

:&lt;math chem&gt; \frac{n_\ce{C2H6}}{n_\ce{O2}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the two values are not equal. To compare it with the equivalence ratio, we need to determine the fuel–oxidizer ratio of ethane and oxygen mixture. For this we need to consider the stoichiometric reaction of ethane and oxygen,

:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|7|2}}&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This gives

:&lt;math chem&gt;(\text{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio based on mass})_\text{st} = \left(\frac{m_\ce{C2H6}}{m_\ce{O2}}\right)_\text{st} = \frac{1 \times (2 \times 12 + 6 \times 1)}{3.5 \times (2 \times 16)} = \frac{30}{112} = 0.268 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math chem&gt;(\text{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio based on number of moles})_\text{st} = \left(\frac{n_\ce{C2H6}}{n_\ce{O2}}\right)_\text{st} = \frac{1}{3.5} = 0.286 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can determine the equivalence ratio of the given mixture as

:&lt;math chem&gt; \phi = \frac{m_\ce{C2H6}/m_\ce{O2}}{\left(m_\ce{C2H6}/m_\ce{O2}\right)_\text{st}} = \frac{0.938}{0.268} = 3.5 &lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, as

:&lt;math chem&gt; \phi = \frac{n_\ce{C2H6}/n_\ce{O2}}{\left(n_\ce{C2H6}/n_\ce{O2}\right)_\text{st}} = \frac{1}{0.286} = 3.5 &lt;/math&gt;

Another advantage of using the equivalence ratio is that ratios greater than one always mean there is more fuel in the fuel–oxidizer mixture than required for complete combustion (stoichiometric reaction), irrespective of the fuel and oxidizer being used—while ratios less than one represent a deficiency of fuel or equivalently excess oxidizer in the mixture. This is not the case if one uses fuel–oxidizer ratio, which take different values for different mixtures.

The fuel–air equivalence ratio is related to the air–fuel equivalence ratio (defined previously) as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mixture fraction===
The relative amounts of oxygen enrichment and fuel dilution can be quantified by the mixture fraction, Z, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \left[ \frac{s Y_\mathrm{F} - Y_\mathrm{O} + Y_\mathrm{O,0}}{s Y_\mathrm{F,0} + Y_\mathrm{O,0}} \right]&lt;/math&gt;,
where
:&lt;math&gt;s = \mathrm{AFR}_\mathrm{stoich} = \frac{W_\mathrm{O} \times v_\mathrm{O}}{W_\mathrm{F} \times v_\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;,
''Y''&lt;sub&gt;F,0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;O,0&lt;/sub&gt; represent the fuel and oxidizer mass fractions at the inlet, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''W''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; are the species molecular weights, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; are the fuel and oxygen stoichiometric coefficients, respectively. The stoichiometric mixture fraction is
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{st} = \left[ \frac{1}{1 + \frac{Y_\mathrm{F,0} \times W_\mathrm{O} \times v_\mathrm{O}}{Y_\mathrm{O,0} \times W_\mathrm{F} \times v_\mathrm{F}}} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kumfer | first =  B. | last2 = Skeen | first2 = S. | last3 = Axelbaum | first3 = R. | title = Soot inception limits in laminar diffusion flames with application to oxy-fuel combustion | journal = Combustion and Flame | year = 2008 | volume = 154 | pages = 546–556 | url = http://cccu.wustl.edu/Publications%20list/Soot%20Inception%20limits%20in%20laminar%20diffusion%20flames%20with%20application%20to%20oxyfuel%20combustion.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stoichiometric mixture fraction is related to ''λ'' (lambda) and ''ϕ'' (phi) by the equations
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{st} = \frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda} = \frac{1}{1+\phi}&lt;/math&gt;,
assuming
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AFR} = \frac{Y_\mathrm{O,0}}{Y_\mathrm{F,0}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eyrie.shef.ac.uk/eee/cpe630/comfun1.html ''Introduction to Fuel and Energy: 1) MOLES, MASS, CONCENTRATION AND DEFINITIONS''], accessed 2011-05-25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Percent excess combustion air ===
[[File:Ideal-stoichiometry.jpg|thumb|Ideal stoichiometry]]In industrial [[furnace|fired heaters]], [[power plant]] steam generators, and large [[gas turbine|gas-fired turbines]], the more common terms are percent excess combustion air and percent stoichiometric air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Energy Tips {{ndash}} Process Heating {{ndash}} Check Burner Air to Fuel Ratios | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy | date = November 2007 | url = http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech_assistance/pdfs/42110.pdf | accessdate = 29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stoichiometric combustion and excess of air | publisher = The Engineering ToolBox | url = http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/stoichiometric-combustion-d_399.html | accessdate = 29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, excess combustion air of 15 percent means that 15 percent more than the required stoichiometric air (or 115 percent of stoichiometric air) is being used.

A combustion control point can be defined by specifying the percent excess air (or oxygen) in the [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]], or by specifying the percent oxygen in the combustion product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eckerlin |first=Herbert M. |title=The Importance of Excess Air in the Combustion Process |work=Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 406 - Energy Conservation in Industry |publisher=North Carolina State University |url=http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/eckerlin/courses/mae406/chapter3.pdf |accessdate=29 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327143946/http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/eckerlin/courses/mae406/chapter3.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[air–fuel ratio meter]] may be used to measure the percent oxygen in the combustion gas, from which the percent excess oxygen can be calculated from stoichiometry and a [[mass balance]] for fuel combustion. For example, for propane ({{chem|C|3|H|8}}) combustion between stoichiometric and 30 percent excess air (AFR&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt; between 15.58 and 20.3), the relationship between percent excess air and percent oxygen is: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Mass\% \ O_2 \ in \ propane \ combustion \ gas} = -0.1433(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2})^2 + 0.214(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Volume\% \ O_2 \ in \ propane \ combustion \ gas} = -0.1208(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2})^2 + 0.186(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2}) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Anthony Philip French''' (November 19, 1920 &amp;ndash; February 3, 2017) was a British professor of physics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He was born in [[Brighton, England]].  French was a graduate of [[Cambridge University]], receiving his B.A. in 1942 and Ph.D. in 1948, both in physics.  In 1942, he began working on the British effort to build an atomic bomb (codenamed [[Tube Alloys]]) at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].  By 1944, Tube Alloys had been merged with the American [[Manhattan Project]] and he was sent to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]].

When the war ended, he returned to the United Kingdom, where he spent a couple of years at the newly formed [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]].  He later joined the faculty at Cambridge, where he conducted his research at Cavendish and became a Fellow and Director of Studies in Natural Sciences at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].  In 1955, French arrived at the [[University of South Carolina]], where he was made chairman of the physics department.  He left South Carolina in 1962 to take a faculty position in the [[MIT Physics Department]], where he remained until his death.  French's main interest was undergraduate physics education.  He was chairman of the Commission on Physics Education of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (1975-1981) and president of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]] (1985-1986).  He was also a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2186">The '''Bin Qasim Industrial Zone''' is one of the largest industrial areas in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. It consists of more than 25,000 acres of land in the [[Port Qasim]] (Bin Qasim) town area. Contained within this zone are many industrial units, ranging from medium to large in employment volume.

'''Bluetooth Low Energy''' ('''Bluetooth LE''', colloquially '''BLE''', formerly marketed as '''Bluetooth Smart'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-technology-basics/low-energy|title=Bluetooth Smart or Version 4.0+ of the Bluetooth specification|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[wireless personal area network]] technology designed and marketed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (Bluetooth SIG) aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, [[Physical fitness|fitness]], beacons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/beacons-retail-location.aspx beacons]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; security, and home entertainment industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart.aspx|title=bluetooth.com: Bluetooth Smart|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[Bluetooth|Classic Bluetooth]], Bluetooth Low Energy is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a [[#Radio_interface|similar communication range]].

Mobile operating systems including [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]] and [[BlackBerry 10|BlackBerry]], as well as [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]], natively support Bluetooth Low Energy. The Bluetooth SIG predicts that by 2018 more than 90% of Bluetooth-enabled smartphones will support Bluetooth Low Energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Mobile-Telephony-Market.aspx |title=Mobile Telephony Market |publisher=Bluetooth Special Interest Group |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compatibility ==
Bluetooth Low Energy is not backward-compatible with the previous (often called "classic") Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) protocol. The [[Bluetooth#Bluetooth 4.0 + LE|Bluetooth 4.0 specification]] permits devices to implement either or both of the LE and BR/EDR systems.

Bluetooth Low Energy uses the same [[ISM band|2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz radio frequencies]] as classic Bluetooth, which allows dual-mode devices to share a single [[radio antenna]]. LE does, however, use a simpler [[modulation]] system.

== Branding ==
[[File:Bluetooth Smart Logo.svg|right|thumb|300px|The previously used Bluetooth Smart logo]]
In 2011, the Bluetooth SIG announced the Bluetooth Smart logo so as to clarify compatibility between the new low energy devices and other Bluetooth devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Press-Releases-Detail.aspx?ItemID=138| title=Bluetooth SIG Extends Bluetooth Brand, Introduces Bluetooth Smart Marks| date=24 October 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203053330/http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Press-Releases-Detail.aspx?ItemID=138| publisher=[[Bluetooth SIG]]| archive-date=3 February 2015| accessdate=2016-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Bluetooth Smart Ready indicates a dual-mode device compatible with both classic and low energy [[peripheral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/bluetooth-brand/smart-marks-faqs| title=Bluetooth Smart Marks FAQ| publisher=[[Bluetooth SIG]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724115332/https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/bluetooth-brand/smart-marks-faqs| archive-date=24 July 2015| accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bluetooth Smart indicates a low energy-only device which requires either a Smart Ready or another Smart device in order to function.

With the May 2016 Bluetooth SIG branding information, the Bluetooth SIG began phasing out the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos and word marks and has reverted to using the Bluetooth logo and word mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines|title=Brand Your Product -  Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo uses a new blue color.

== Target market ==
The Bluetooth SIG identifies a number of markets for low energy technology, particularly in the smart home, health, sport and fitness sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/market.aspx|title=Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cited advantages include:
* low power requirements, operating for "months or years" on a [[button cell]]
* small size and low cost
* compatibility with a large [[installed base]] of mobile phones, tablets and computers

== History ==
[[File:Image-Wibree Logo.png|right|thumb|300px|The now-defunct Wibree logo]]
In 2001, researchers at [[Nokia Research Center|Nokia]] determined various scenarios that contemporary wireless technologies did not address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thefutureofthings.com/articles/38/nokias-wibree-and-the-wireless-zoo.html |publisher=The Future of Things |last=Genuth |first=Iddo |date=16 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108120338/http://thefutureofthings.com/articles/38/nokias-wibree-and-the-wireless-zoo.html |archive-date=2012-11-08 |title=Nokia's Wibree and the Wireless Zoo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began developing a wireless technology adapted from the Bluetooth standard which would provide lower power usage and cost while minimizing its differences from Bluetooth technology. The results were published in 2004 using the name Bluetooth Low End Extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Honkanen |first1=M. |last2=Lappetelainen |first2=A. |last3=Kivekas |first3=K. |date=2004 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1389107 |title=Low end extension for Bluetooth |url-access=subscription |conference=2004 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference 19–22 September 2004 |pages= 199–202 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After further development with partners in particular [[Logitech]] and within the European project MIMOSA,{{efn|MIMOSA stands for ''Microsystems platform for mobile services and applications'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mimosa-fp6.com/ |title=Mimosa WebSite: Home |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804035320/http://www.mimosa-fp6.com/ |archive-date=2016-08-04 |access-date=2016-08-18 |publisher=MIMOSA FP6 project}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the name of one of the projects funded by the European [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]]}} actively promoted and supported also by [[STMicroelectronics]] since its early stage,{{efn|STMicroelectronics went on to release a processor to support implementation of the standard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.st.com/bluenrg-ms |title=BlueNRG-MS – Bluetooth Low Energy Network Processor supporting Bluetooth 4.1 core specification – STMicroelectronics |access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the technology was released to the public in October 2006 with the brand name Wibree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5403564.stm |title=Bluetooth rival unveiled by Nokia |publisher=BBC News |date=4 October 2006 |access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After negotiations with Bluetooth SIG members, an agreement was reached in June 2007 to include Wibree in a future Bluetooth specification as a Bluetooth ultra low power technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.wibree.com/press/Wibree_pressrelease_final_1206.pdf |title=Wibree forum merges with Bluetooth SIG |date=12 June 2007 |publisher=Nokia |archive-date=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616082658/http://www.wibree.com/press/Wibree_pressrelease_final_1206.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wibree becomes ULP Bluetooth |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2007/06/12/41582/wibree-becomes-ulp-bluetooth.htm |date=12 June 2007 |last=Reynolds |first=Melanie |website=ElectronicsWeekly.com |publisher=Reed Business Information Limited |accessdate=2008-09-09 |archive-date=2008-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907170808/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2007/06/12/41582/wibree-becomes-ulp-bluetooth.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was marketed as Bluetooth Smart and integration into version 4.0 of the Core Specification was completed in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/25/bluetooth-sig-unveils-smart-marks-explains-v4-0-compatibility-w/ |title=Bluetooth SIG unveils Smart Marks, explains v4.0 compatibility with unnecessary complexity |last=Pollicino |first=Joe |date=25 October 2011 |website=Engadget |publisher=[[Oath Tech Network]] [[AOL Tech]] |accessdate=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first smartphone to implement the 4.0 specification was the [[iPhone 4S]], released in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Terrence |date=12 October 2011 |title=iPhone 4S claims title of first Bluetooth 4.0 smartphone, ready to stream data from your cat |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/12/iphone-4s-claims-title-of-first-bluetooth-4-0-smartphone-ready| publisher=Engadget |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other manufacturers released Bluetooth Low Energy Ready devices in 2012.

The Bluetooth SIG officially unveiled Bluetooth 5 on 16 June 2016 during a media event in London. One change on the marketing side is that they dropped the point number, so it now just called Bluetooth 5 (and not Bluetooth 5.0 or 5.0 LE like for Bluetooth 4.0). This decision was made allegedly to "simplifying marketing, and communicating user benefits more effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnx-software.com/2016/06/10/bluetooth-5-promises-four-times-the-speed-twice-the-range-of-bluetooth-4-0-le-transmissions/|title=Bluetooth 5 Promises Four times the Range, Twice the Speed of Bluetooth 4.0 LE Transmissions|website=www.cnx-software.com|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the technical side, Bluetooth 5 will quadruple the range by using increased transmit power or coded physical layer, double the speed by using optional half of the symbol time compared to Bluetooth 4.x, and provide an eight-fold increase in data broadcasting capacity by increasing the advertising data length{{clarify|date=May 2017}} of low energy Bluetooth transmissions compared to Bluetooth 4.x, which could be important for [[Internet of things|IoT]] applications where nodes are connected throughout a whole house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2016/06/16/-bluetooth-5-quadruples-rangedoubles-speedincreases-data-broadcasting-capacity-by-800|title=Bluetooth® 5 Quadruples Range, Doubles Speed, Increases Data Broadcasting Capacity by 800%  {{!}}  Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.com|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bluetooth SIG released Mesh Profile and Mesh Model specifications officially on 18 July 2017. [[Bluetooth mesh networking|Mesh specification]] enables using Bluetooth Low Energy for many-to-many device communications for home automation, sensor networks and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2017/07/bluetooth-sig-announces-mesh-networking-capability|title=Bluetooth SIG Announces Mesh Networking Capability {{!}}  Bluetooth Technology Website|website=www.bluetooth.com|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Borrowing from the original Bluetooth specification, the Bluetooth SIG defines several [[Bluetooth profile|profiles]] — specifications for how a device works in a particular application — for low energy devices. Manufacturers are expected to implement the appropriate specifications for their device in order to ensure compatibility. A device may contain implementations of multiple profiles.

Majority of current low energy application profiles is based on the generic attribute profile (GATT), a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data known as attributes over a low energy link.&lt;ref&gt;Bluetooth SIG [https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications Adopted specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bluetooth mesh]] profile is the exception to this rule as it is based on General Access Profile (GAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/mesh|title=Bluetooth Mesh and the IOT|first=|last=bluetooth|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mesh profiles ===
Bluetooth mesh profiles use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with other Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the network. Each device can pass the information forward to other Bluetooth Low Energy devices creating a "mesh" effect. For example, switching off an entire building of lights from a single smartphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/markets/smart-building|title=Smart Building -  Bluetooth Technology Website|author=|date=|website=www.bluetooth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* MESH (Mesh Profile) - for base mesh networking.
* MMDL ([[Bluetooth mesh networking#Mesh models|Mesh models]]) - for application layer definitions. Term "model" is used in mesh specifications instead of "profile" to avoid ambiguities.

=== Health care profiles ===
There are many profiles for Bluetooth Low Energy devices in healthcare applications. [[The Continua Health Alliance]] consortium promotes these in cooperation with the Bluetooth SIG.

* BLP (Blood Pressure Profile) — for blood pressure measurement.
* HTP (Health Thermometer Profile) — for medical temperature measurement devices.
* GLP (Glucose Profile) — for [[blood glucose]] monitors.
* CGMP (Continuous Glucose Monitor Profile)

=== Sports and fitness profiles ===
Profiles for sporting and fitness accessories include:
* BCS (Body Composition Service)
* CSCP (Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile) — for sensors attached to a [[bicycle]] or [[exercise bike]] to measure [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]] and wheel speed.
* CPP (Cycling Power Profile)
* HRP (Heart Rate Profile) — for devices which measure [[heart rate]]
* LNP (Location and Navigation Profile)
* RSCP (Running Speed and Cadence Profile) 
* WSP (Weight Scale Profile)

=== Internet connectivity ===
* IPSP (Internet Protocol Support Profile)

=== Generic sensors ===
* ESP (Environmental Sensing Profile)
* UDS (User Data Service)

=== HID connectivity ===
* HOGP ([[Human interface device|HID]] over GATT Profile) allowing Bluetooth LE-enabled Wireless mice, keyboards and other devices offering long-lasting battery life.

=== Proximity sensing ===
"[[Electronic leash]]" applications are well suited to the long battery life possible for 'always-on' devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gsm-modem.de/M2M/m2m-apps/casio-bluetooth-low-energy-watch/|title=Casio Bluetooth Low Energy Watch communicates with smartphones|date=2011-03-07|work=M2M / IoT hints and tips|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers of [[iBeacon]] devices implement the appropriate specifications for their device to make use of proximity sensing capabilities supported by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/19/inside-ios-7-ibeacons-enhance-apps-location-awareness-via-bluetooth-le|title=Inside iOS 7: iBeacons enhance apps' location awareness via Bluetooth LE|website=AppleInsider|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant application profiles include:
* FMP — the "find me" profile — allows one device to issue an alert on a second misplaced device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=239389|title=Find Me Profile specification|author=|date=|website=bluetooth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PXP — the proximity profile — allows a proximity monitor to detect whether a proximity reporter is within a close range. Physical proximity can be estimated using the radio receiver's [[RSSI]] value, although this does not have absolute calibration of distances. Typically, an alarm may be sounded when the distance between the devices exceeds a set threshold.

=== Alerts and time profiles ===
* The phone alert status profile and alert notification profile allow a client device to receive notifications such as incoming call alerts from another device.
* The time profile allows current time and [[time zone]] information on a client device to be set from a server device, such as between a wristwatch and a mobile phone's [[Network Time Protocol|network time]].

=== Battery ===

* The Battery Service exposes the Battery State and Battery Level of a single battery or set of batteries in a device.

== Implementation ==

=== Chip ===
Starting in late 2009, Bluetooth Low Energy [[integrated circuit]] implementations were announced by a number of manufacturers. Implementations commonly use [[software radio]] so updates to the specification can be accommodated through a [[firmware]] upgrade.

=== Hardware ===
Current mobile devices are commonly released with hardware and software support for both classic Bluetooth and the Bluetooth Low Energy.

===Operating systems===

== Technical details ==

=== Radio interface ===
Bluetooth Low Energy technology operates in the same spectrum range (the 2.400–2.4835&amp;nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]) as classic Bluetooth technology, but uses a different set of channels. Instead of the classic Bluetooth 79 1-MHz channels, Bluetooth Low Energy has 40 2-MHz channels. Within a channel, data is transmitted using [[GFSK|Gaussian frequency shift modulation]], similar to classic Bluetooth's Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (with an option of 2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in Bluetooth 5), and the maximum transmit power is 10&amp;nbsp;mW (100&amp;nbsp;mW in Bluetooth 5). Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A (Physical Layer Specification) of the [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=229737 Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0].

Bluetooth Low Energy uses [[frequency hopping]] to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different; as a result, while both FCC and ETSI classify Bluetooth technology as an [[FHSS]] scheme, Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Bluetooth Special Interest Group [https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=237781 "Bluetooth Low Energy Regulatory Aspects"], April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

More technical details may be obtained from official specification as published by the Bluetooth SIG. Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification.

=== Advertising and discovery ===
BLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is periodically repeated every scan interval.

The discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters (viz., the advertising interval, the scan interval and the scan window). The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodic-interval based technique, for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=PI-LatencyComp - Neighbor Discovery in BLE-Like protocols|url=https://codeocean.com/2017/08/08/pi-latencycomp-neighbor-discovery-in-ble-like-protocols|journal=CodeOcean|volume=|pages=|doi=10.24433/co.fec70c60-c265-4eea-9e37-8f7222ec5c92|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for purely periodic interval-based protocols, the random delay added to each advertising interval and the three-channel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions, or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindt|first=P.

=== Software model ===
All Bluetooth Low Energy devices use the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT). The [[application programming interface]] offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Apple's [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CoreBluetooth_Framework/_index.html Core Bluetooth] framework&lt;/ref&gt; GATT has the following terminology:

:A device that initiates GATT commands and requests, and accepts responses, for example, a computer or smartphone.
;Server
:A device that receives GATT commands and requests, and returns responses, for example, a temperature sensor.
;Characteristic
:A data value transferred between client and server, for example, the current battery voltage.
;Service
:A collection of related characteristics, which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance, the ''Health Thermometer'' service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value, and a time interval between measurements.
;Descriptor
:A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance, a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units (e.g. Celsius), and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional – each characteristic can have any number of descriptors.

Some service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes – for instance, the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the ''Generic Access'' service. Services may also include other services as sub-functions; the main functions of the device are so-called ''primary'' services, and the auxiliary functions they refer to are ''secondary'' services.

==== Identifiers ====

Services, characteristics, and descriptors are collectively referred to as ''attributes'', and identified by [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]]s. Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] uses, but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs (of the form ''xxxxxxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB'' &lt;ref&gt;See sec 2.5.1 of the ''Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification''&lt;/ref&gt;) for standard attributes. For efficiency, these identifiers are represented as 16-bit or 32-bit values in the protocol, rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example, the ''Device Information'' service has the short code 0x180A, rather than 0000180A-0000-1000-... . The full list is kept in the [https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers Bluetooth Assigned Numbers] document online.

==== GATT operations ====

The GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include:
* Discover UUIDs for all primary services
* Find a service with a given UUID
* Find secondary services for a given primary service
* Discover all characteristics for a given service
* Find characteristics matching a given UUID
* Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic

Commands are also provided to ''read'' (data transfer from server to client) and ''write'' (from client to server) the values of characteristics:
* A value may be read either by specifying the characteristic's UUID, or by a ''handle'' value (which is returned by the information discovery commands above).
* Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle, but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required.
* 'Long read' and 'Long write' operations can be used when the length of the characteristic's data exceeds the [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] of the radio link.

Finally, GATT offers ''notifications'' and ''indications''. The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance, a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to [[Polling (computer science)|poll]] the server, which would require the server's radio circuitry to be constantly operational.

An ''indication'' is similar to a notification, except that it requires a response from the client, as confirmation that it has received the message.

==== Battery impact ====

[[File:BLE Chipsets Power.png|thumb|upright|300px|Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption profiles with different configuration parameters, as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/|title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices with low power consumption. Several chipmakers including [[Cambridge Silicon Radio]], [[Dialog Semiconductor]], [[Nordic Semiconductor]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Cypress Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Labs]] and [[Texas Instruments]] have introduced their Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets over the last few years. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company, [[Aislelabs]], reported that peripherals, such as proximity beacons, usually function for 1–2 years with a 1,000mAh coin cell battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/11/04/how-to-find-the-best-beacon-hardware-for-everything-from-stores-to-cities/|title=How to find the best beacon hardware for everything from stores to cities|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-10-04|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible because of power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data.

In contrast, a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1,000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/in-terms-of-battery-life-android-devices-are-more-optimized-for-ibeacons-than-iphones/|title=In terms of battery life, Android devices are more optimized for iBeacons than iPhones|publisher= GigaOM|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the newer chipsets and advances in software, both Android and iOS phones now have negligible power consumption in real-life Bluetooth Low Energy use scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/|title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report – Aislelabs|publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RRTrussBridgeEndView.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A box truss structure in a bridge]]
A '''box truss''' is a structure composed of three or more ''chords'' connected by transverse and/or diagonal structural elements.

==Application==
Box trusses are commonly used in certain types of [[aircraft]] [[fuselage]]s, electric power pylons, large [[radio]] [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], and many [[bridge]] structures. (For various truss arrangements used see [[truss bridge]].)

By using what are in effect stiff panels in a cylindrical arrangement the resulting structure can have a high resistance to axial torsion (twisting along its long axis) and a higher resistance to buckling in its highly loaded sides.

When finished as an open structure the truss will be less subject to wind drag and to aeroelastic effects than would a completely enclosed structure.

A '''carabiner''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ær|ə|ˈ|b|iː|n|ər}}) or '''karabiner''' is a specialized type of [[shackle]], a metal loop with a spring-loaded gate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountaindays.net/content/articles/dictionary.php#karabiner |title=Climbing Dictionary &amp; Glossary |website=MountainDays.net |accessdate=2006-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103112848/http://mountaindays.net/content/articles/dictionary.php#karabiner |archivedate=2007-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; used to quickly and reversibly connect components, most notably in safety-critical systems. The word is a shortened form of ''Karabinerhaken'' (or also short ''Karabiner''), a German phrase for a "spring hook"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Karabiner|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; used by a [[carbine]] rifleman, or [[carabinier]], to attach items to a belt or [[bandolier]].

==Use==
Carabiners, often called D-Rings by military professionals, are widely used in rope-intensive activities such as [[climbing]], [[arboriculture]], [[caving]], [[sailing]], [[hot air ballooning]], [[rope rescue]], [[construction]], [[industrial rope access|industrial rope work]], [[window cleaning]], [[whitewater rescue]], and [[acrobatics]]. They are predominantly made from both [[steel]] and [[aluminium]].  Those used in sports tend to be of a lighter weight than those used in commercial applications and rope rescue. 
Often referred to as carabiner-style or as mini-biners, carabiner keyrings and other light-use clips of similar style and design have also become popular. Most are stamped with a “Not For Climbing” or similar warning due to a common lack of load-testing and safety standards in manufacturing. While from an [[etymological]] perspective any metal attaching link with a spring gate is technically a carabiner, the strict usage among the [[climbing]] community specifically refers only to those devices manufactured and tested for load-bearing in safety-critical systems like rock and mountain climbing.

Carabiners on [[hot air balloon]]s are used to connect the envelope to the basket and are rated at 2.5 tonne, 3 tonne or 4 tonne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://cameronballoons.co.uk/support#hot-air-balloon-maintenance-manual-en
| title = Cameron Balloons Maintenance Manual (refer to section 6.6.4)
| accessdate = 2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Load-bearing screw-gate carabiners are used to connect the [[Umbilical cable#Diver|diver's umbilical]] to the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied diver's]] harness. They are usually rated for a safe working load of 5&amp;nbsp;kN or more (equivalent to a weight in excess of approximately 500kg).&lt;ref name="CoP Inshore"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/documents/useful-documents/occupational-health-and-safety/inshorediving2014.pdf |title=Code Of Practice Inshore Diving |last=Diving Advisory Board |publisher=The South African Department of Labour |accessdate=16 September 2016 |location=Pretoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==

===Shape===
Carabiners come in four characteristic shapes:
#Oval: Symmetric. Most basic and utilitarian. Smooth regular curves are gentle on equipment and allow easy repositioning of loads. Their greatest disadvantage is that a load is shared equally on both the strong solid spine and the weaker gated axis.
#D: Asymmetric shape transfers the majority of the load onto the spine, the carabiner's strongest axis.
#Offset-D: Variant of a D with a greater asymmetry, allowing for a wider gate opening.
#Pear/HMS: Wider and rounder shape at the top than offset-D's, and typically larger. Used for belaying with a [[munter hitch]], and with some belay devices. The largest HMS carabiners can also be used for [[rappelling]] with a munter hitch (the size is needed to accommodate the hitch with two strands of rope). These are usually the heaviest carabiners.

===Locking mechanisms===
There are three broad categories of carabiner: auto locking, manual locking, and non-locking.

====Non-locking====
Non-locking carabiners (or ''snap-links'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.climbers-club.co.uk/journal/original/1953%20Journal-p144-150.pdf|title = Climber's Club Journal|date = |accessdate = 24 April 2005|website = Climber's Club|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; have a sprung swinging gate that accepts a rope, webbing sling, or other hardware. Rock climbers frequently connect two non-locking carabiners with a short length of nylon web to create a [[quickdraw]].

Two gate types are common:
#Solid gate: The more traditional carabiner design, incorporating a solid metal gate with separate pin and spring mechanisms. Most modern carabiners feature a 'key-lock nose shape and gate opening, which is less prone to snagging than traditional notch and pin design. Most locking carabiners are based on the solid gate design.

#Wire gate: A single piece of bent spring-steel wire forms the gate, with no separate spring or pins needed (it is a form of '[[living hinge]]'). Wire gate carabiners are significantly lighter than solid gates, with roughly the same strength. Wire gates are less prone to icing up than solid gates, an advantage in Alpine mountaineering and ice climbing. The reduced gate mass makes their wire bales less prone to 'gate flutter,' a dangerous condition created when the carabiner suddenly impacts rock or other hard surfaces during a fall, and the gate opens momentarily due to momentum (and both lowers the breaking strength of the carabiner when open, and potentially allows the rope to escape). Simple wiregate designs feature a notch that can snag objects (similar to original solid gate designs), but newer designs feature a shroud or guide wires around the 'hooked' part of the carabiner nose to prevent snagging.

Both solid and wire gate carabiners can be either 'straight gate' or 'bent gate'. Bent-gate carabiners are easier to clip a rope into using only one hand, and so are often used for the rope-end carabiner of quickdraws and alpine draws used for [[lead climbing]].

====Locking====
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2017}}
Life supporting carabiners such as those used in tree climbing need to be strong (thus strength ratings), but also secure against unintentional opening under use. All carabiners with a spring loaded gate "are self closing" (single action). Several are also "self locking" (double action), some even "self double locking" (triple action).

Locking carabiners have the same general shape as non-locking carabiners but have an additional mechanism securing the gate. These mechanisms may be either threaded sleeves ("screw-lock"), spring-loaded sleeves ("twist-lock"), magnetic levers ("Magnetron"), other spring loaded unlocking levers or opposing double spring loaded gates ("Twin-Gate"),.[[File:Sicherheitskarabiner.jpg|right|thumb|Carabiner with multiple combined auto lock and quick release, useful in [[via ferrata]] and [[arborist]] work.]]

*Screw-lock (or screw gate): Have a threaded sleeve over the gate which must be engaged and disengaged manually. They have fewer moving parts than spring-loaded mechanisms, are less prone to malfunctioning due to contamination or component fatigue, and are easier to employ one-handed. They, however, require more total effort and are more time-consuming than pull-lock, twist-lock or lever-lock.
*Twist-lock, push-lock, twist-and-push-lock: Have a security sleeve over the gate which must be manually rotated and/or pulled to disengage, but which springs automatically to locked position upon release.  They offer the advantage of re-engaging without additional user input, but being spring-loaded are prone to both spring fatigue and their more complex mechanisms becoming balky from dirt, ice, or other contamination. They are also difficult to open one-handed and with gloves on.
* Multiple-levers: Having at least two spring loaded levers that are each operated with one hand action to unlock the next ones movement, the last (third or later) action opening the gate.
* Magnetic: Have two small levers with embedded magnets on either side of the locking gate which must be pushed towards each other or pinched simultaneously to unlock. Upon release the levers pull shut and into the locked position against a small steel insert in the carabiner nose. With the gate open the magnets in the two levers repel each other so they do not lock or stick together, which might prevent the gate from closing properly. Advantages are very easy one-handed operation, re-engaging without additional user input and few mechanical parts that can fail.
*Double-Gate: Have two opposed overlapping gates at the opening which prevent a rope or anchor from inadvertently passing through the gate in either direction. Gates may only be opened by pushing outwards from in between towards either direction. The carabiner can therefore be opened by splitting the gates with a fingertip, allowing easy one hand operation. The likelihood of a rope under tension to split the gates is therefore practically none. The lack of a rotating lock prevents a rolling knot, such as the Munter hitch, from unlocking the gate and passing through, giving a measure of inherent safety in use and reducing mechanical complexity.

==Certification==

===Europe===
*Recreation: Carabiners sold for use in climbing in Europe must conform to standard EN 12275:1998 "Mountaineering equipment – Connectors – Safety requirements and test methods", which governs testing protocols, rated strengths, and markings. A breaking stress of at least 20 [[kilonewton|kN]] (20,000 newtons = approximately 2040 kilograms of force which is significantly more than the weight of a small car) with the gate closed and 7 [[kilonewton|kN]] with the gate open is the standard for most climbing applications, although requirements vary depending on the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EN12275 and UIAA-121 testing protocols|url=http://www.paci.com.au/Downloads/S-EN12275_simplified.pdf|publisher=Professional Association of Climbing Instructors|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carabiners are marked on the side with single letters showing their intended area of use, for example, K ([[via ferrata]]), B (base), and H (for belaying with an Italian or [[Munter hitch]]).

*Industry: Carabiners used for access in commercial and industrial environments within Europe must comply with EN 362:2004 "Personal protective equipment against falls from a height. Connectors." The minimum gate closed breaking strain of a carabiner conforming with EN 362:2004 is nominally the same as that of EN 12275:1998 at around 20 [[kilonewton|kN]]. Carabiners complying with both EN 12275:1998 and EN 362:2004 are available.

===United States===
*Fall protection: Carabiners used for fall protection in US industry are classified as "connectors" and are required to meet [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] standard 1910.66 App C ''Personal Fall Arrest System'' which specifies "drop forged, pressed or formed steel, or made of equivalent materials" and a minimum breaking strength of {{convert|5000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.

[[American National Standards Institute]]/[[American Society of Safety Engineers]] standard ANSI Z359.1-2007 ''Safety Requirement for Personal Fall Arrest Systems, Subsystems and Components'', section 3.2.1.4 (for snap hooks and carabiners) is a voluntary consensus standard. This standard requires that all connectors/ carabiners support a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of {{convert|5000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} and feature an auto-locking gate mechanism which supports a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of {{convert|3600|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.

*Rescue: Minimum [[breaking strength]] requirements and calculations for rescue carabiners are set out in [[National Fire Protection Association]] standard 1983-2012 edition ''Fire Service Life Safety Rope and Equipment''. The standard defines two classes of rescue carabiners. Technical use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking strengths of 27&amp;nbsp;kN gate closed, 7&amp;nbsp;kN gate open and 7&amp;nbsp;kN minor axis. General use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking strengths of 40&amp;nbsp;kN gate closed, 11&amp;nbsp;kN gate open and 11&amp;nbsp;kN minor axis. Testing procedures for rescue carabiners are set out in [[ASTM International]] standard F 1956 ''Standard Specification of Rescue Carabiners''.

'''Cheddite''' is a class of [[explosive material]]s invented in 1897 by E. A. G. Street of the firm of Berges, Corbin et Cie and originally manufactured in the town of Chedde in [[Haute-Savoie]], [[France]] in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Arthur|title=Explosives:Their Manufacture, Properties, Tests and History|publisher=P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co.|place=Philadelphia|year=1915|page=297|via=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOJZAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;ots=h7V9h4sDn8&amp;dq=E%20A%20G%20Street%20Cheddite&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q=E%20A%20G%20Street%20Cheddite&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faber|first=Henry B.|title=Military Pyrotechnics:A Study of the Chemicals Used in the Manufacture of Military Pyrotechnics|publisher=Ordnance Department, U.S. Army|year=1919|volume=3|page=127|via=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GW9KAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=cheddite&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=cheddite&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to [[Sprengel explosive]]s, cheddites consisted of a high proportion of [[inorganic]] [[chlorate]]s mixed with nitroaromatics (e.g. [[nitrobenzene]] or [[dinitrotoluene]]) plus a little paraffin or [[castor oil]] as a moderant for the chlorate. Several different types were made, and they were principally used in [[quarry]]ing. Due to availability of ingredients and easy production process it was also the most common explosive material manufactured by the [[Polish Underground State]] in occupied [[Poland]] during [[World War II]]; it was used for production of the [[R wz. 42]] and [[Filipinka]] hand grenades. 

Since the 1970s, Cheddite is the commercial name for an explosive compound used as an [[explosive primer]] for [[shotgun]] cartridges. It contains 90% [[potassium chlorate]], 7% [[Kerosene|paraffin]], 3% [[petroleum jelly]], and traces of [[carbon black]].

'''Christopher Latham Sholes'''&lt;ref&gt;In his time, Sholes went by the names "C. Latham Sholes", "Latham Sholes", or "C. L. Sholes", but never "Christopher Sholes" or "Christopher L. Sholes".&lt;/ref&gt; (February 14, 1819 – February 17, 1890) was an American [[inventor]] who invented the [[QWERTY]] keyboard,&lt;ref&gt;"Early Typewriter History," http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/Dvorak/history.html.&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[Samuel W.

== Youth and political career ==
Born in [[Mooresburg, Pennsylvania|Mooresburg]], in [[Montour County, Pennsylvania]], Sholes moved to nearby [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]] and worked there as an apprentice to a [[printer (publisher)|printer]]. After completing his [[apprenticeship]], Sholes moved to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] in 1837, and later to Southport, Wisconsin (present-day [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]). He became a [[newspaper]] [[publisher]] and [[politician]], serving in the [[Wisconsin State Senate]] from 1848 to 1849 as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] from 1852 to 1853 as a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soiler]], and again in the Senate as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from 1856 to 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=1741&amp;keyword=sholes |title=Sholes, Christopher Pichon 1819 - 1890 |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209014416/http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in the successful movement to abolish [[capital punishment in Wisconsin]]; his newspaper, ''The Kenosha Telegraph'', reported on the trial of [[John McCaffary]] in 1851, and then in 1853 he led the campaign in the Wisconsin State Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisbar.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=50092&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm |title=A Brief History of Wisconsin's Death Penalty |publisher=Wisbar.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814231610/http://www.wisbar.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=50092 |archivedate=2012-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger brother of [[Charles Sholes (Wisconsin politician)|Charles Sholes]] (1816–1867), who was also a newspaper publisher and politician who served in both houses of the Wisconsin State Legislature and as mayor of Kenosha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=2625&amp;keyword=sholes |title=Sholes, Charles Clark 1816 - 1867 |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "Voree Record" ==
In 1845, Sholes was working as editor of the ''Southport Telegraph'', a small newspaper in Kenosha, Wisconsin. During this time he heard about the alleged discovery of the [[Voree plates|Voree Record]], a set of three minuscule [[brass]] plates unearthed by [[James J. Strang]], a would-be [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|successor]] to [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Voree Plates" at http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strang asserted that this proved that he was a true [[Prophet, seer and revelator|prophet]] of God, and he invited the public to call upon him and see the plates for themselves. Sholes accordingly visited Strang, examined his "Voree Record," and wrote an article about their meeting. He indicated that while he could not accept Strang's plates or his prophetic claims, Strang himself seemed to be "honest and earnest" and his disciples were "among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood." As for the "record" itself, Sholes indicated that he was "content to have no opinion about it."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Doyle, ''The King Strang Story'' (National Heritage, 1970), pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventing the typewriter ==
{{Main|Sholes and Glidden typewriter}}

[[File:Pterotype.jpg|thumb|250px|John Pratt's Pterotype, the inspiration for Sholes in July 1867, a version close to the stock model advocated by fellow inventor [[Frank Haven Hall]].]]
[[File:Invention of the Typewriter.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Wisconsin]] Historical Marker]]
Typewriters with various keyboards had been invented as early as 1714 by [[Henry Mill]] and have been reinvented in various forms throughout the 1800s. It is believed to be Sholes among others, who have invented the first one to be commercially successful, however many contest it and couple his inventions with that of [[Frank Haven Hall]], [[Samuel W. Soule]], [[Carlos Glidden]], [[Giuseppe Ravizza]] and John Pratt.&lt;ref name="iles" /&gt;

Sholes had moved to Milwaukee and became the editor of a newspaper. Following a strike by compositors at his printing press, he tried building a machine for [[typesetting]], but this was a failure and he quickly abandoned the idea. He arrived at the typewriter through a different route. His initial goal was to create a machine to number pages of a book, tickets, and so on. He began work on this at Kleinsteubers machine shop in Milwaukee, together with a fellow printer [[Samuel W. Soule]], and they [[patent]]ed a numbering machine on November 13, 1866.&lt;ref name="iles"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Iles |first = George |year = 1912 |title = Leading American Inventors |place = New York |publisher = Henry Holt and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/leadingamericani00ilesrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sholes and Soule showed their machine to [[Carlos Glidden]], a lawyer and amateur inventor at the machine shop working on a mechanical plow, who wondered if the machine could not be made to produce letters and words as well. Further inspiration came in July 1867, when Sholes came across a short note in ''[[Scientific American]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date = 1867-07-06 |title = Type Writing Machine |journal = [[Scientific American]] |volume = 17 |issue = 1 |page = 3 |url = http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fscia%2Fscia1017%2F&amp;tif=00011.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABF2204-1017-3 |accessdate = 2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the "Pterotype", a prototype typewriter that had been invented by [[John Pratt (inventor)|John Pratt]]. From the description, Sholes decided that the Pterotype was too complex and set out to make his own machine, whose name he got from the article: the ''typewriting machine'', or ''typewriter''.

For this project, Soule was again enlisted, and Glidden joined them as a third partner who provided the funds. The ''Scientific American'' article (unillustrated) had figuratively used the phrase "literary piano"; the first model that the trio built had a keyboard literally resembling a piano. It had black keys and white keys, laid out in two rows. It did not contain keys for the numerals 0 or 1 because the letters O and I were deemed sufficient:
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
  3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M
&lt;/source&gt; The first row was made of [[ivory]] and the second of [[ebony]], the rest of the framework was wooden. It was in this form that Sholes, Glidden and Soule were granted patents for their invention on June 23, 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=t7YAAAAAEBAJ |title=#79265 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and July 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=ErkAAAAAEBAJ |title=#79868 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first document to be produced on a typewriter was a contract that Sholes had written, in his capacity as the Comptroller for the city of Milwaukee. Machines similar to Sholes's had been previously used by the blind for embossing, but by Sholes's time the inked ribbon had been invented, which made typewriting in its current form possible.&lt;ref name="iles"/&gt;

At this stage, the Sholes-Glidden-Soule typewriter was only one among dozens of similar inventions. They wrote hundreds of letters on their machine to various people, one of whom was [[James Densmore]] of [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]]. Densmore foresaw that the typewriter would be highly profitable, and offered to buy a share of the patent, without even having laid eyes on the machine. The trio immediately sold him one-fourth of the patent in return for his paying all their expenses so far. When Densmore eventually examined the machine in March 1867, he declared that it was good for nothing in its current form, and urged them to start improving it. Discouraged, Soule and Glidden left the project, leaving Sholes and Densmore in sole possession of the patent.

Realizing that [[stenographers]] would be among the first and most important users of the machine, and therefore best in a position to judge its suitability, they sent experimental versions to a few stenographers. The most important of them was [[James O. Clephane]], of [[Washington D.C.]], who tried the instruments as no one else had tried them, subjecting them to such unsparing tests that he destroyed them, one after another, as fast as they could be made and sent to him. His judgments were similarly caustic, causing Sholes to lose his patience and temper. But Densmore insisted that this was exactly what they needed:&lt;ref name="iles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{quote|This candid fault-finding is just what we need. We had better have it now than after we begin manufacturing. Where Clephane points out a weak lever or rod let us make it strong. Where a spacer or an inker works stiffly, let us make it work smoothly. Then, depend upon Clephane for all the praise we deserve.}}

[[File:Sholes typewriter.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sholes typewriter, 1873. [[Buffalo History Museum]].]]
Sholes took this advice and set to improve the machine at every iteration, until they were satisfied that Clephane had taught them everything he could. By this time, they had manufactured 50 machines or so, at an average cost of $250. They decided to have the machine examined by an expert mechanic, who directed them to [[E. Remington and Sons]] (which later became the Remington Arms Company), manufacturers of firearms, sewing machines, and farm tools. In early 1873 they approached Remington, who decided to buy the patent from them. Sholes sold his half for $12,000, while Densmore, still a stronger believer in the machine, insisted on a royalty, which would eventually fetch him $1.5 million.&lt;ref name="iles"/&gt;

Sholes returned to Milwaukee and continued to work on new improvements for the typewriter throughout the 1870s, which included the [[QWERTY]] keyboard (1873).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs.ttu.ee/kursused/itv0010/maxmon/1874ad.htm |title=The Sholes (QWERTY) Keyboard |publisher=Cs.ttu.ee |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009091338/http://cs.ttu.ee/kursused/itv0010/maxmon/1874ad.htm |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Densmore]] had suggested splitting up commonly used letter combinations in order to solve a jamming problem caused by the slow method of recovering from a keystroke: weights, not springs, returned all parts to the "rest" position. This concept was later refined by Sholes and the resulting QWERTY layout is still used today on both typewriters and English language computer keyboards, although the jamming problem no longer exists.

Sholes died on February 17, 1890 after battling [[tuberculosis]] for nine years, and is buried at [[Forest Home Cemetery]] in Milwaukee.

A '''Cyclic pump''' is an apparatus which moves a fluid in a periodic uni-directional direction from one containment system to another while overcoming static conditions that would, without intervention, not move.  The intervention predicated by the pump alters pressures, volumes and sometimes temperatures of fluids (gasseous, liquid, colloidal, plasmic, etc.) in such a way that the fluids are transported to other chambers or enclosures (including pipes), thus "flowing" in a consistent direction, usually having characteristics of pulsation (as is the case with the [[Human heart]]) or of uniform motion (as is the case with an [[Automobile]] [[motor oil]] [[pump]]).  Cyclic pumps are generally incorporated into [[machine]]s to deal with all sorts of fluids associated with that machine's functionality.

'''Demeton-S-methyl''' is an [[organic compound]] with the [[molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It was used as an organothiophosphate [[acaricide]] and organothiophosphate [[insecticide]]. It is flammable. With prolonged storage, Demeton-S-methyl becomes more toxic due to formation of a [[sulfonium]] derivative which has greater affinity to the human form of the [[acetylcholinesterase]] enzyme, and this may present a hazard in agricultural use.&lt;ref&gt;Black RM, Harrison JM.

In [[architecture]], '''fabric structures''' are forms of constructed [[fiber]]s that provide end users a variety of aesthetic free-form building designs. Custom-made [[fabric]] structures are [[Engineering|engineered]] and fabricated to meet worldwide structural, [[flame retardant]], weather-resistant, and natural force requirements.
Fabric structures are considered a sub-category of [[tensile structure]].

A '''fabric structure''''s material selection, proper design, engineering, [[Manufacturing|fabrication]], and installation are integral components to ensuring a [[Soundness|sound]] structure.

==Fabric structure basics==

===Membrane materials===
Most fabric [[structures]] are composed of actual [[Textile|fabric]] rather than [[mesh]]es or [[Artificial membrane|films]]. Typically, the fabric is coated and laminated with [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic materials]] for increased [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[:wikt:durability|durability]], and [[Sustainability|environmental resistance]]. Among the most widely used materials are [[polyesters]] laminated or coated with [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), and woven [[fiberglass]] coated with [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifai.com/Lightweight/index.cfm Industrial Fabrics Association International - Lightweight Structures Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cotton canvas===
The traditional fabric for fabric structures is light cotton [[twill]], light canvas, or heavy proofed canvas.

===Polyesters===
Strength, durability, cost, and stretch make polyester material the most widely used in fabric structures. Polyesters that are laminated or coated with [[PVC]] films are usually the least expensive option for longer-term fabrications.
Laminates generally consist of vinyl films over woven or knitted polyester meshes (called [[Scrim (material)|scrims]] or substrates), while vinyl-coated polyesters usually have a high-count, high-tensile base fabric coated with a bondable substance that provides extra strength. Precontraint fabric is made by placing the polyester fabric under tension both before and during the coating process. This results in a weave that has increased [[Structural stability|dimensional stability]].

===Vinyl-laminated polyesters===
A laminated fabric usually is composed of a reinforcing polyester scrim pressed between two layers of unsupported PVC film. For most fabric structure uses, however, it refers to two or more layers of fabric or film joined by heat, pressure, and an [[adhesive]] to form a single ply.

With an open-weave or mesh polyester scrim, the exterior vinyl films bond to themselves through the openings in the fabric. Heavier fabric scrims, however, are too tightly woven to allow the same bonding. In this case, an adhesive is used to bond the exterior films to the base fabric.

A good [[chemical bond]] is critical to both prevention of delamination and development of seam strengths. The seam is created when vinyl-coated fabrics are welded together. The adhesive enables the seam to meet shear forces and load requirements for a structure at all temperatures. The adhesive prevents wicking of moisture into the scrim’s fibers, which also prevents fungal growth or freezing that could affect the exterior coating's adhesion to the scrim. Adhesives are water-based to comply with EPA regulations.

Open-weave scrims generally make the fabric more economical, although this can also depend on the number and type of features that you require in the vinyl. Almost any color, [[Vinyl coated polyester|UV resistance vinyl coated polyester]], and colorfastness may be incorporated into the vinyl. However, the more features added, the higher the cost of the fabric.

===Vinyl-coated polyester===
[[Vinyl coated polyester]] is the most frequently used material for flexible fabric structures. It is made up of a polyester scrim, a bonding or adhesive agent, and exterior PVC coatings. The scrim supports the coating (which is initially applied in liquid form) and provides the [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]], elongation, [[Tear resistance|tear strength]], and dimensional stability of the resulting fabric. Vinyl-coated polyester is manufactured in large panels by heat-sealing an over-lap seam with either a radio-frequency welder or a hot-air sealer. A proper seam will be able to carry the load requirements for the structure. The seam area should be stronger than the original coated fabric when testing for tensile strength.

The base fabric's tensile strength is determined by the size ([[Units of textile measurement#Denier|denier]]) and strength (tenacity) of the yarns and the number of yarns per linear inch or meter. The larger the yarn and the more yarns per inch, the greater the finished product's tensile strength.

The adhesive agent acts as a chemical bond between the polyester fibers and the exterior coating and also prevents wicking, or fibers absorbing water, which could result in freeze-thaw damage in the fabric.

The PVC coating liquid (vinyl Organisol or Plastisol) contains chemicals to achieve the desired properties of color, water and mildew resistance, and flame retardancy. Fabric can also be manufactured that contains high levels of light transmission or can be made completely opaque. After the coating has been applied to the scrim, the fabric is put through a [[Furnace|heating chamber]] that dries the liquid coating. PVC coatings are available in a range of colors, although non-standard colors can be pricey. Colors may be subject to minimum order runs that allow the coating machine to clear out traces of any previous color.

===Fiberglass===
Woven fiberglass coated with PTFE ([[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] or [[silicone]]) is also a widely used base material. Glass fibers are drawn into continuous filaments, which are then bundled into yarns. The yarns are woven to form a substrate. The fiberglass carries a high ultimate tensile strength, behaves elastically, and does not suffer from significant [[stress relaxation]] or creep. The PTFE coating is [[chemically inert]], can withstand temperatures from 100&amp;nbsp;°F upwards to 450&amp;nbsp;°F+. It is also immune to radiation and can be cleaned with water. PTFE fiberglass is additionally [[Energy Star]] and Cool Roof Rating Council certified. During scientific tests of its solar properties, it was discovered that PTFE fiberglass membranes reflect as much as 73 percent of the sun’s energy while holding just seven percent on its exterior surface. Certain grades of PTFE fiberglass can absorb 14 percent of the sun’s energy while allowing 13 percent of natural daylight and seven percent of re-radiated energy (solar heat) to transmit through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taiyo-europe.com/en/tensile-membranes-and-etfe/ptfe-fiberglass/|title=PTFE Fiberglass Membrane|last=|first=|date=|website=www.taiyo-europe.com|dead-url=|access-date=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its energy efficiency, high melting temperature and lack of creep, fiberglass-based fabrics have been the material of choice for stadium domes and other permanent structures, particularly in the United States. However, when properly constructed, polyester structures may be equally durable.

===Olefin / polyolefin===
A number of polymers consisting mainly of polyethylene, polypropylene or combinations of the two are available for fabric structures.

===PVDF woven===
PVDF woven fabric are available for fabric structures.

===ePTFE woven===
ePTFE woven fabric are available for fabric structures..

===Blackout fabric===
[[Blackout (fabric)|Blackout material]], also known as blockout material, is an opaque fabric. Blackout fabric consists of a laminate that sandwiches an opaque layer between two white exterior layers. Heating and lighting of a structure may be controlled because the fabric does not allow light to permeate the top or walls. The opaque quality also prevents stains, dirt, repairs, or slightly mismatched panels on the structure's exterior from being noticed from the inside.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Topcoatings==
Most fabrics used for fabric structures have some form of topcoating applied to the exterior or coating to make cleaning easier. Topcoating provides a hard surface on the outside of the material, forming a barrier that aids in preventing dirt from sticking to the material, while allowing the fabric to be cleaned with water. As the material ages, the topcoating will eventually erode, exposing the fabric to dirt and making it more difficult to clean. The thicker the topcoating, the longer it will last. However, coatings that are too thick will embrittle and crack when folded.

There are several commonly used topcoatings:

* PVF film lamination is made up of [[polyvinyl fluoride]] (commercially known as Tedlar). It consists of a film layer laminated to the PVC fabric during the manufacturing process. The result is a thicker fabric that can resist weather and chemical agents better than competing fabrics. Its self-cleaning ability repels such things as acid rain, graffiti, and bird droppings. Because of these characteristics it can often be found in use in [[Industrial park|industrialized areas]], desert regions, and coastal zones. The thicker coating has a slow erosion rate, resulting in a [[Service life|life expectancy]] of approximately 25 years depending upon environmental conditions. This topcoating is flexible, which creates a strong and consistent bond to the PVC. PVF coated fabrics may be manufactured in a variety of colors, but are also subject to minimum manufacture runs. PVF coating also makes the fabric non-weldable. Seams are not overlapped, but instead are [[Butt welding|butted]] with an extra welded seam, then applied to the underside of the fabric that does not have a topcoating.
* Acrylic topcoating is the most economical and widely available topcoating used. Its spray-on application provides a glossy finish and a resistance to [[UV degradation]]. Because the coating is thin, the material is both easy to fabricate and is reparable by high frequency or hot air welding. Depending on environmental conditions, an acrylic topcoating will give the fabric a life span of 10 years or more. Acrylic topcoats are ideal for fabric structures, and can be found on products used as tradeshow pavilions, temporary [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], and portable warehouses.
* PVDF topcoating is composed of a mix of fluorine, carbon, and hydrogen. The combination of the fluorine and carbon provides superior resistance to UV degradation and chemical damage than that of the acrylic topcoat. PVDF coated fabrics also maintain color longer than do those coated with acrylic. PVDF fabrics resist algae and fungi, and also have self-cleaning properties that make them easy to maintain. These coated fabrics are flexible, resist cracking, are easily handled, and generally have a life span of 15 to 20 years depending upon environmental conditions. PVDF is chemically grafted to the PVC and polymers used, which reduces the color choices. Because white is the only standard color, other color choices are limited and must be specially manufactured. Because of the chemical properties of the coating, it must be [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abraded]] off to expose the PVC before welding. This, too, increases fabrication costs. On site repairs are also difficult, as the membrane must be manually abraded before repair.
* PVDF/PVC topcoating is essentially a dilution of the PVDF topcoat that makes the finished fabric less expensive to manufacture. The finished fabric may be welded without having to abrade the material, which reduces costs. However, because the PVDF is diluted, longevity and the ability to withstand environmental factors are reduced. This results in a general life expectancy of 10 to 15 years. These materials are also available in colors, but are subject to limited manufacturing runs.
* Tio2 (Titanium Dioxide) Top coating "Titan W": TITAN W is a surface finish whose formulation was prepared by Naizil S.p.A. in collaboration with the Chemical Engineering Department of Padua University.
TITAN W exploits the most innovative [[nanotechnology]] methods for the use of particular particles in combination with fluoropolymers (PVDF) mixed with acrylic resin.
The effectiveness of TITAN W compared to coatings based on acrylic lacquering and PVDF has been shown by numerous tests on deterioration by atmospheric agents, both accelerated and outdoors (weathering test).

The result is a coating that gives the fabric the following advantages:
*Less yellowing and colour variation
*Longer lasting physical properties
*Better preservation of flexibility
*Better self-cleaning properties

With these additional advantages, the fabrics coated with TITAN W lacquering will offer better durability compared to the existing coatings used. In addition to the above-mentioned characteristics, fabrics with TITAN W lacquer are high frequency and hot air weldable.

==Fabric properties==
When discussing fabric properties for use on a structure, there are several terms that are commonly used:

* Tensile strength is a basic indicator of relative strength. It is fundamental for architectural fabrics that function primarily in tension.
* Tear Strength is important in that if a fabric ruptures in place, it generally will do so by tearing. This can occur when a local [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] concentration or local damage results in the failure of one yarn, which thereby increases the stress on remaining yarns.
* [[Adhesion]] strength is a measure of the strength of the bond between the base material and coating or film laminate that protects it. It is useful for evaluating the strength of welded joints for connecting strips of fabric into fabricated assembly.
* [[Flame retardant|Flame retardancy]] does not have the same meaning as flameproofing. Fabric that contains a flame-retardant coating can withstand even a very hot point source. However, it can still burn if a large ignition source is present.
*[[Free Form]] Tensile fabric allows one to use free form in building  construction as it is flexible material.

==Structural properties==

When deciding on a fabric it is imperative to keep certain fabric properties in mind. These include stress versus strain (unit load versus unit elongation), expected service life, the mechanisms of joining the material together (welding, gluing, etc.), and the fabric’s behavior in or around fire.

Stress versus strain data should be obtained in both uniaxial and biaxial forms. This information characterizes the fabric in terms of stiffness, elasticity, and plasticity. This is essential information when determining the material's response under load in a load-carrying application. [[Shear strength]], [[Deformation (mechanics)|shear strain]], and [[Poisson's ratio]]s, though difficult to obtain, are fundamental when analyzing a fabric as a structural material.

==Cost savings to fabric buildings==
There can be multiple advantages to fabric structures over traditional buildings in certain scenarios. In some cases, no lighting is required as the fabric used is generally translucent, which makes it an energy efficient solution. Mobility: You can move them, either on wheels or relocate them completely. Savings: They cost about half of what a traditional structure costs.

Tear Strength is important in that if a fabric ruptures in place, it generally will do so by tearing. This can occur when a local stress concentration or local damage results in the failure of one yarn, which thereby increases the stress on remaining yarns.

Adhesion strength is a measure of the strength of the bond between the base material and coating or film laminate that protects it. It is useful for evaluating the strength of [[Welding|welded joints]] for connecting strips of fabric into fabricated assembly.
Flame retardancy does not have the same meaning as flameproofing. Fabric that contains a flame-retardant coating can withstand even a very hot point source. However, it can still burn if a large ignition source is present.

Of course, other properties must be factored in when determining a material's suitability for a structure. To fully understand a fabric's value and usefulness, consider the following:

* [[Shading coefficient]]s
* General solar, optical, and thermal performance data
* Acoustical data
* Dimensional stability
* [[Colour fastness|Colorfastness]]
* Cleanability
* Seam strength and stability
* General handling ability, including abrasion resistance, foldability, etc.

In [[telecommunications]], a '''field strength meter''' is an instrument that measures the [[electric field strength]] emanating from a [[transmitter]].

==The relation between the electric field and the transmitted power==

In ideal free space, the [[field strength in free space|electric field strength]] produced by a [[transmitter]] with an [[isotropic radiator]] is readily calculated.&lt;ref&gt; ''Reference Data for Radio Engineers'', Howard W.Sams Co.Inc.,{{ISBN|0-672-21218-8}}, p 27-7&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{E} = \frac{ \sqrt{30 \cdot P}}{d}&lt;/math&gt; 

where
:'''E''' is the electric field strength in volts per meter
:'''P''' is the [[transmitter power output]] in watts
:'''d''' is the distance from the radiator in meters

The factor &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{30} &lt;/math&gt; is an approximation of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{Z_0}{4\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_0=119.9169832\pi&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[impedance of free space]]. &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol for [[ohm]]s.

It is clear that [[electric field strength]] is inversely proportional to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. However, this relation is impractical for calculating the [[field strength]] produced by terrestrial transmitters, where reflections and [[attenuation]] caused by objects around the transmitter or receiver may affect the electrical field strength considerably.

==Field strength meter== 
Field strength meter is actually a simple receiver. After a [[Tuner (electronics)|tuner]] circuit, the signal is detected and fed to a [[microammeter]], which is scaled in '''dBμ'''. The frequency range of the tuner is usually within the terrestrial broadcasting bands. Some FS meters can also receive satellite ([[TVRO]] and RRO) frequencies. Most modern FS meters have [[audio frequency|AF]] and [[Composite video|VF]] circuits and can be used as standard receivers. Some FS meters are also equipped with printers to record received field strength.

==Antennas==
When measuring with a field strength meter it is important to use a calibrated antenna such as the standard antenna supplied with the meter. For precision measurements the antenna must be at a standard height.  A value of standard height frequently employed for VHF and UHF measurements is {{convert|10|m}}.  Gain correction tables may be provided with the meter, that take into account the change of [[antenna gain]] with [[radio frequency|frequency]].

==Minimum field strength criteria==
The [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] defines the minimum field strength for satisfactory reception. These are shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;K.H.Kaltbeitzer: ''Technical Monograph 3104'', EBU Technical Centre, 1965, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; (Band II is reserved for FM radio broadcasting and the other bands are reserved for [[TV transmitter|TV broadcasting]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3486">'''Colonel Sir Frank Beachim Beauchamp''' [[CBE]] (born [[Mells, Somerset]] 1866, died [[Worthing]], [[West Sussex]], 17 June 1950) was an [[industrialist]] who owned mines in the [[Somerset coalfield]], notably in [[Midsomer Norton]] and [[Radstock]]. He was the first baronet of the [[Beauchamp baronets|Beauchamp Baronetcy]] of Woodborough, in the [[County of Somerset]], created for him in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31013 |date=15 November 1918 |page=13492}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] county councillor for thirty-nine years.

==Early and personal life==

He was born in 1866 in [[Mells, Somerset]] where he was educated privately. He grew up at Norton Hall (formerly Norton Down House), a now-demolished [[mansion]] in [[Midsomer Norton]]. His father, also involved in coalmines, was William Beauchamp, and his sister Rose was the sister-in-law of the composer and music administrator [[Reginald Thatcher|Sir Reginald Thatcher]].&lt;ref name="ancestry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=pjc4ax&amp;id=I01395|title=RootsWeb's WorldConnect Project: Somerset Coalfield Connections|publisher=wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 he married Mabel Constance Bannon whose photographic portrait is part of the [[James Lafayette|Lafayette]] Negative Archive at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lafayette.org.uk/bea8202.html|title=Lady Beauchamp, née Mabel Constance Bannon (d. 1957).|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had four children including Sir Douglas Clifford Beauchamp, the second and last Beauchamp baronet, and Irene Mabel.

==Adult life and career==

He was a [[magistrate]], a Conservative member of [[Somerset County Council]] from 1907 to 1946 and a Parliamentary candidate in 1910. In May 1915 he joined the army and after eighteen months in Britain he went to the US in an advisory capacity to the War Department in [[Washington D.C.]]. He reached the rank of colonel and was created a baronet in 1918 and appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1919. Sir Frank's business interests were centred on [[Radstock]] and [[Midsomer Norton]] where he owned a number of collieries, a coal distribution business, a wagon works and a gasworks. He was a partner with his brother Louis in the Norton Hill colliery in [[Midsomer Norton]], chairman of the East Bristol colliery company and director of the Somerset colliery company.&lt;ref name="dmm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/company/n1019.htm|title=Durham Mining Museum - Norton Hill Colliery Co.|author=Durham Mining Museum|publisher=dmm.org.uk|accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived at Woodborough House, a now-demolished [[mansion]] between [[Peasedown St John]] and [[Radstock]], [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name="dmm"/&gt;

==Later life and death==

Due to ill health he spent his final years in [[Worthing]], [[West Sussex]], where he died on 17 June 1950. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter's Church, [[Camerton, Somerset]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7794">'''Freeflying''' is a [[skydiving]] discipline which began in the late 1980s, involving freefalling in various vertical orientations, as opposed to the traditional "belly-to-earth" orientation. The discipline is known to have originated when [[Olav Zipser]] began experimenting with non-traditional forms of [[bodyflight]]. Zipser founded the FreeFly Clowns as a two-person competitive team with Mike Vail in 1992, and was joined by Omar Alhegelan (1st ever FAI Freestyle World Cup &amp; World Champion), Charles Bryan, and Stefania Martinengo in 1994.  The FreeFly Clowns are also credited with opening the first school to teach freeflying, [[The First School of Modern SkyFlying]].

Freeflying broke into the limelight in 1996 when the SSI Pro Tour added freeflying as a three-person competitive discipline at the second televised event (with Skysurfing), part of ESPN's Destination Extreme series. 150 countries watched the FreeFly Clowns (Olav Zipser, Charles Bryan and Omar Alhegelan) as they took 1st place in all four international competitions along with other teams like, the Flyboyz (Eli Thompson, Mike Ortiz, Knut Krecker, Fritz Pfnür), Team AirTime (Tony Urugallo, Jim O'Reilly, Peter Raymond, Brian Germain), and many other pioneers of freeflying showed off their best moves.  In 1996 and 1997, the SSI Pro Tour staged eight televised events in both North America and Europe with $36,000 in cash prizes awarded to freefly teams. SSI invited the 1997 Pro World Champions, the Flyboyz, to participate in the 1998 ESPN X Games as an unofficial exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The resulting global television exposure made legends out of the FreeFly Clowns, the Flyboyz, and others. A once fledgling offshoot of the mainstream, freeflying now comprises fully one-half of the overall skydiving community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Olav Zipser]]'s [[Space Games]] used the space ball as a research and measuring device to provide a constant speed and direction from which individual athletes could be trained, rated, raced against each other and judged.  The [[Space Games]] took FreeFlying to the next level from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214133219/http://www.bpa.org.uk/skydive/pages/articles/jun00/birthoffreefly.htm   British Parachute Association article], retrieved 10 Sep 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the efforts by Arizona Freeflight llc (Omar Alhegelan &amp; Kama Mountz) who ran test competitions &amp; wrote and submitted the rules for futures competitions; In 2000 FreeFly was accepted as a skydiving discipline by the International Parachute Commission (IPC) and the first official FreeFly National &amp; international Championships were held worldwide.

==Explanation==
Freeflying is an expansion of skydiving which includes the traditional belly-to-earth positions, but extends into vertical flight where the flyer is in an upright position (falling feet first) or in an inverted position (falling head first). These positions increase freefall speeds and make new types of formations and routines possible.

A freeflyer, in order to fully understand the aerodynamic power of his/her body in freefall, needs to first learn to control all of the skydiving forms: box position (belly-to-earth, traditional skydiving position), back flying (back-to-earth), head-up flying, head-down flying, and side flying. These positions are not held for the duration of a skydive. Freeflying can, and usually does, involve constant transitions in position and speeds, with vertical and horizontal orientations. This can involve constantly flowing skydives, with all positions explored, or more static skydives where flyers are concentrating on building a large formation while flying in one of these freefly positions.

Due to the increased freefall speed and potentially faster horizontal speeds, freeflying has dangers beyond that of a normal skydive. Extra care must be taken for freefall skydive groups to stay away from belly-to-earth skydivers to avoid collisions. Since most parachutes are not designed to be opened at speeds higher than that of normal belly flying, freeflyers must transition back to the "belly to earth" position and slow down their descent for several seconds before deploying their parachute.

While freeflying is a younger and more extreme addition to skydiving, it is becoming a popular event in competitions and world records.

===Back flying===
'''Back flying''' is the ability to fly on the back in a stable and controlled fashion. This skill is critical so that when the flyer flips out of some of the more advanced positions they stay in control and do not endanger themselves or other skydivers.

===Sit flying===
[[File:Freefly (Manaus-Brasil) 2.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Freeflyer flying a sit in Manaus, Brasil.]]
'''Sit flying''' is called such because it looks similar to the position taken while sitting in a chair.

For flying a sit, the feet are oriented toward the relative wind and 90-degree bends maintained at the knees, hips, and shoulders. To move around, the flyer redirects the airflow in the opposite direction the jumper wants to go.  [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] mechanics then push the flyer in the desired direction. Fall rate changes (descending faster or slower) can also be made.

=== Head down ===
A person falling in the ''head down'' position has less cross-sectional area exposed to the air while falling, which results in much faster fall rates. Average speeds while flying head down are around {{convert|260|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Due to the increased speed, every movement made can cause the skydiver to become unstable or disoriented; thus increasing the risk involved in skydiving.

== Records ==
The world's largest vertical (head down) formation took place on Friday, 31 July 2015, when a multinational team of 164 skydivers, some traveling at speeds of over 200&amp;nbsp;mph, linked over Skydive Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;http://skydivechicago.com&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ottawa, Illinois]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2015/07/31/164-skydivers-set-head-down-world-record-in-illinois&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the previous record of 138 linked skydivers, set on Saturday, 4 August 2012, also at Skydive Chicago.

[[Marc Hauser (skydiver)|Marc Hauser]] set the world record for the fastest horizontal free fall at 304&amp;nbsp;km/h in Empuriabrava, Spain, without specialized equipment, in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bielertagblatt.ch/nachrichten/unterhaltung/geschwindigkeits-weltrekord-im-fallschirmspringen| publisher=Bieler Tagblatt| date=September 10, 2012| title=Speed record in skydiving | access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GFS Chemicals Inc''', formerly known as '''G. Frederick Smith Chemical Company''',&lt;ref name=tracings/&gt; is a [[private company|privately owned]] specialty chemical company with headquarters in [[Powell, Ohio]] and manufacturing facilities in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was founded by [[G. Frederick Smith]] in [[Urbana, Illinois]] in 1924, and moved to Columbus, Ohio in 1928.&lt;ref name=tracings/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=usi/&gt;

GFS Chemicals currently serves over seventy countries and a variety of industries, including: [[Alternative energy]]; [[energy storage]]; [[pharmaceuticals]]; [[biotechnology]]; [[electronics]]; [[Chemical milling|etching]]; and environmental and research analytics.&lt;ref name=gfs&gt;http://www.gfschemicals.com/technicallibrary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=socma/&gt;&lt;ref name=chemb/&gt;&lt;ref name=fed/&gt;&lt;ref name=prn/&gt;&lt;ref name=psu/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs/&gt;&lt;ref name=nutrition/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt; The company has approximately 100 employees. Its various divisions are managed by three separate units: Organic Specialty Materials, Inorganic Specialty Materials, and Analytical Reagents &amp; Research Chemicals Catalog Division.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt;

== History ==

===1920s===
The Smith Chemical Company was started in G. Frederick Smith’s garage in Urbana, Illinois as a result of his use of [[magnesium perchlorate]] as a super drying agent.&lt;ref name=psu/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs/&gt;&lt;ref name=magy/&gt; Smith enlisted the help of his brothers Allyne (who studied engineering at [[Ohio State]]) and Clarence (who worked for a local newspaper).

Orders quickly outpaced their ability to fill them.&lt;ref name=tracings/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=illinois/&gt;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;&lt;ref name=icis/&gt; In 1928 G. Frederick Smith Chemical Company moved to Columbus, Ohio on McKinley Avenue, and began to sell magnesium perchlorate under the trade name "Dehydrite" for A.H. Thomas Co., later Thomas Scientific.&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thomassci.com/History |title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt; G. Frederick Smith Chemical Company would become one of the leading perchloric acid and perchlorate salt producers in the world.&lt;ref name=tracings/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs/&gt;&lt;ref name=illinois/&gt;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;&lt;ref name=icis/&gt;

===1930s and 1940s===
[[University of Illinois]] graduate student Charles Getz, in an attempt to store milk [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]]ally to prevent spoilage, accidentally invents the world's first aerosol dispensed product, instant [[whipped cream]].&lt;ref name="whipped"&gt;{{cite |url=http://archives.library.illinois.edu/archon/?p=digitallibrary/digitalcontent&amp;id=4128 |title=Charles Getz and the Instant Cream Whip Machine |publisher=University of Illinois Archives |accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and G.F. Smith found [[nitrous oxide]] to be the most suitable gas and  started the Aerated Products Company, later known as Instantwhip.&lt;ref name="whipped"/&gt;&lt;ref name="instantwhip"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instantwhip.com/ |title=Instantwhip |accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was later turned over to G.F. Smith’s son Clifton, although Getz would retain the patent.&lt;ref name=tracings/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=illinois/&gt;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

Smith started producing commercial quantities of [[1,10-phenanthroline]] and its derivatives, producing a range of indicators for use in analytical chemistry.&lt;ref name=tracings/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=illinois/&gt;&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; He  investigated the preparation of [[cerium]] compounds for use as [[titrant]]s in [[Redox|oxidation and reduction reactions]]. Aided by [[phenanthroline]] indicators, he produced hexanitratocerate as a primary standard.&lt;ref name="tracings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="illinois" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hexdefine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/inchi/InChI%3D1S/Ce.2H4N3O6.2NO3/c%3B2*1-8-3(6,7)9-2(4)5%3B2*2-1(3)4/h%3B2*1H4%3B%3B/q%2B4%3B4*-1 |title=Ammonium hexanitratocerate |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[periodic acid]], [[iodic acid]], and their salts prompted a new line of products.

In the 1940s, [[Rare earth mineral|Rare earth]] products, such as [[ceric ammonium nitrate]], and heteroaromatic ligands, are introduced to the product line.&lt;ref name="tracings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="illinois" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acs" /&gt;

===1960s, 70s, and 80s===
In the 1960s, the company developed and produced new high purity redistilled inorganic acids in response.&lt;ref name="tracings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt; 

In the 1960s Allyne Smith retired and turned control of G. Frederick Smith Chemical Company over to Darrell Hutchinson, his son-in-law, to run as President and CEO.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;

In the 70s, the company . collaborated with [[Motorola]] on the first ceric ammonium nitrate-based [[chrome plating|chrome]] [[etching (microfabrication)|etchants]] for use in early [[computer chip]]s.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt; The firm  became the sole US manufacturer of perchloric acid after Hooker [[Occidental Petroleum]]) decides to abandon that field.&lt;ref name="tracings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="journal" /&gt;

G. Frederick Smith died in 1976.

In the 80s, Instantwhip and G. Frederick Chemical Co. parted ways following a stock swap agreement between those with ownership stakes in both of the firms.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=stories/&gt;&lt;ref name=planning/&gt;--&gt;
 
===1990s===
In the 1990s G. Frederick Smith Chemical Co. shortened its name to GFS Chemicals, Inc. and acquired Ericsen Instruments' Karl Fischer reagent business (now the Watermark  brand), and several other specialty organic product lines from Farchan Laboratories and Shawnee Chemical Company.&lt;ref name=pubs/&gt;&lt;ref name=stories/&gt;

In the 90s GFS became ISO 9001:2008 Certified.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;&lt;ref name=prn/&gt; A new plant was built specifically for the production of perchloric acid.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt; In ___, J. Steel Hutchinson became President of GFS Chemicals.&lt;ref name="pubs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="planning" /&gt;

===2000s===
A new organic production facility was built, allowing for the expansion of previously purchased product linesn, including [[Liquid ammonia|liquid ammonia chemistry]], [[silanes]], [[acetylenes]], and other organics.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;&lt;ref name=socma/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs/&gt;

The company acquired APS Analytical Standards, a maker of [[turbidimeter]]s, [[colorimeter (chemistry)|colorimeter]]s, and [[spectrometers]]. This business was moved from California to Columbus.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

Distilled acids demand increased, and GFS expanded its distillation equipment.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt; Inorganic and organic research labs were built for continued research and [[quality control]] testing.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs/&gt;

The company attained [[Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates]] (SOCMA) Chem Steward Tier I Certification.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

The firmGFS partnered with [[Ensign-Bickford Company|Ensign-Bickford Aerospace and Defense]] for the manufacture of [[Ammonia borane|Ammonia Borane]].&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;

===2010s===
A Catalog Order Distribution Center was purchased on Kaderly Drive on the west side of Columbus; it now houses all GFS catalog fulfillment activities, private labeling and analytical laboratory reagents manufacturing.&lt;ref name=gfs/&gt;&lt;ref name="trend"/&gt;

Due to import issues with [[China]], GFS embarked on a research campaign and becomes the only domestically secured chain of supply for [[cerium]].&lt;ref name=prn/&gt;

A new grade of [[ceric ammonium nitrate]] was introduced with tighter [[metal]]s tolerances for use as an electronics-grade etchant component.&lt;ref name=fed/&gt;&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;http://www.usaidsupplier.com/press-release/10757&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=article&gt;http://article.wn.com/view/2013/03/19/GFS_Chemicals_Expands_Product_Line_for_Electronics_Manufactu/#/related_news&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usgn&gt;http://www.usgnn.com/newsGFS20120607.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chemweek&gt;http://www.chemweek.com/home/top_of_the_news/44052.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) expanded accreditation to GFS for ISO/IEC 17025:2005 for [[turbidity]], [[pH buffer]]s, and conductivity standards.&lt;ref name=buyers&gt;http://www.federalbuyersguideinc.com/press-release/10756&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inspec&gt;http://www.in-spec.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a2la&gt;http://www.a2la.org/dirsearchnew/resultscurrent.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions of the Company ==

=== Inorganic Specialty Materials Division ===

Located in Columbus, OH, the Inorganic manufacturing facility is the original cornerstone of GFS Chemicals, as first used by G. Frederick Smith.&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs/&gt;

=== Organic Specialty Materials Division ===

Located on River Street Columbus, OH, the Organic manufacturing facility as a location is a relatively new facility. GFS has always performed organic chemistries, however after the acquisition period more space was needed to further develop the business and to explore the future scientific opportunities which could be advanced. These newer developments have at times crossed over with the Inorganic side with anhydrous [[Lithium perchlorate|Lithium Perchlorate]] in the form of Lithium Perchlorate-Diethyl Ether to promote [[Synthetic organic chemistry|synthetic organic chemical synthesis]] in bulk, as an example. They added a Kilo lab and a Distillation lab as well in the proceeding years.

=== Analytical Reagents and Research Chemicals Catalog Division ===

Located on Kaderly Drive, Columbus, OH, the newest addition to the GFS landscape is also the oldest business. G. Frederick Smith was spurred to create many of the chemical compounds, especially [[perchlorates]] and [[trace metal]] perchloric acid, in response to the needs of his colleagues in [[analytical chemistry]].&lt;ref name=icis/&gt; This tradition is continued here and is the most commonly associated part of the business when a chemist or researcher hears of GFS Chemicals. The [[trace metal]] acids are especially popular among researchers who are looking to digest organics for study without the risk of metal contamination.&lt;ref name=nutrition/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt; Recently the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation expanded the accreditation to meet ISO/IEC 17025:2005 for the standards and buffers produced here as well as EPA approval for the AMCO Clear® line of [[turbidity]] standards.&lt;ref name=buyers/&gt;&lt;ref name=amco&gt;http://www.amcoclear.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harman Becker Automotive Systems GmbH''', commonly known as '''Becker''', is a part of the car division of the American manufacturing company, [[Harman International Industries]], a subsidiary of South Korean company [[Samsung Electronics]].

== History ==
The present company goes back to the German car radio and navigation systems manufacturer, Becker. This firm was founded in 1949 from a repair workshop in the Baden town of [[Pforzheim]]. Its founder was [[Max Egon Becker]]. In 1995, the US concern, Harman International, took over the firm.

The company, with its head office in [[Karlsbad (Baden)|Karlsbad]] near [[Karlsruhe]] and other bases in the USA and Hungary developed and integrated complete infotainment systems worldwide. Its product range runs from navigation systemes, voice control and [[human-machine interface|HMI]]s to audio and entertainment technologies.
From its earliest days, ''Harman Becker Automotive Systems'' was a supplier to [[Mercedes-Benz]],&lt;ref name="wer-zu-wem.de"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harman Becker Hersteller von Consumer Electronics aus Karlsbad in der Firmendatenbank wer-zu-wem.de|trans-title=|periodical=www.wer-zu-wem.de|publisher=|url=http://www.wer-zu-wem.de/firma/becker.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2016-11-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also supplies marques such as [[Audi]], [[Porsche]], [[Peugeot]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], [[Ferrari]], [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]], [[BMW]] and [[Mini (BMW)|Mini]]. Worldwide, ''Harman Becker'' has 28 bases in the following countries: Germany, USA, Great Britain, France, Sweden, Hungary, Canada, Mexico, South Africa (to 2008), Japan, South Korea and China. Since 11&amp;nbsp;January 2010 Harman Becker Automotive Systems has pulled out of the market for mobile navigation. The trademarks Becker Traffic Assist, Becker Traffic Assist Pro etc. were given to [[United Navigation]]. Under the latter's roof, the brands Falk and Becker continue to run.

Since 2008, as part of the strategy of its parent concern, Harman International, the company's divisions have been increasingly based in [[low-wage economies]], so that the number of employees in its German bases has dropped from 3,800&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Augsburger Allgemeine|Periodical=Augsburger Allgemeine|Title=Massiver Stellenabbau bei Harman/Becker|language=German|URL=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/neu-ulm/Massiver-Stellenabbau-bei-Harman-Becker-id5199806.html|AccessDate=2016-11-10

'''Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine''' ('''HMTD''') is a &lt;!-- note to editors: "high explosive", not "highly explosive", is the correct term --&gt; [[high explosive]] [[organic compound]]. HMTD is an [[organic peroxide]], a [[heterocyclic compound]] with a cage-like structure. It is a [[Explosive material|primary explosive]]. It has been considered as an initiating explosive for [[Detonator|blasting caps]] in the early part of 20th century, mostly because of its high initiating power (higher than that of [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]]) and its inexpensive production. As such, it was quickly taken up as a primary explosive in mining applications.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C. A.; Rinkenbach, W. H. ''Army Ordnance'' '''1924'''. ''5'', 463–466{{Verify source|Is 1924 the volume or the year? What is the title of the article? Is Army Ordnance really the magazine/journal title? Or is it just Ordnance?|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has since been superseded by more (chemically) stable compounds such as dextrinated [[Lead(II) azide|lead azide]] and [[DDNP]] (which contains no lead or mercury). HMTD is widely used in amateur made blasting caps.

==Preparation and structure==
First synthesised in 1885 by Legler,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Legler |first=L . |year=1885 |title=Ueber Producte der langsamen Verbrennung des Aethyläthers |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90703s/f1537.chemindefer |journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=3343–3351 |doi=10.1002/cber.188501802306}}&lt;/ref&gt; HMTD may be prepared by the reaction of an aqueous solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[hexamine]] in the presence of [[citric acid]], acetic acid or dilute [[sulfuric acid]] as a [[catalyst]]. The hydrogen peroxide needs to be at least 12% w/w, lower concetrations lead to poor yields. Citric acid is overall superior to other acids. Common synthetic procedure uses 5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide, 2 g of citric acid and 1 g of hexamine with about 50% yields.
[[File:HMTD synthesis mechanism.jpg|thumb|Likely mechanism involved in the formation of HMTD. Excess NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is neutralized by acid, most commonly citric acid.|center|440x440px]]

The molecule adopts a cage-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaefer|first=William P.|author2=Fourkas, John T. |author3=Tiemann, Bruce G. |title=Structure of hexamethylene triperoxide diamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=April 1985|volume=107|issue=8|pages=2461–2463|doi=10.1021/ja00294a043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties as an explosive==
No peroxide has found practical use as an explosive as a consequence of the weak oxygen–oxygen bond, which leads to poor thermal and chemical stability and a high sensitivity to shock (physical impact). Like other organic peroxides such as [[acetone peroxide]] (TATP), HMTD is unstable and detonates upon shock, friction, static electricity discharges, concentrated sulfuric acid, strong UV radiation and heat. Cases of detonation caused by the simple act of screwing a lid on a jar containing HMTD have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Stúpajúci trend podomáckej výroby výbušnin a udalosti s tým spojené, Kriminalistický a expertízny ústav Policajného zboru, p. 8 http://www.unms.sk/swift_data/source/dokumenty/skusobnictvo/upravy_2009/odborne_seminare_2008/KEU_BA_01_10_2008.pdf, written in Slovak&lt;/ref&gt; Common static electricity discharges have been reported to cause detonation.&lt;ref&gt;Explosive Properties of Primary Explosives - Springer, p.21, section 2.33, {{ISBN|978-3-642-28436-6}} , https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783642284359-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1379807-p174306459&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, less unstable than many other peroxides under normal conditions; exposure to ultraviolet light increases its sensitivity. It also reacts with most common metals, which can lead to [[detonation]]. HMTD is chemically very stable when pure (free of acids, bases, and metal ions) and does not quickly sublime like its acetone counterparts. Like all primary explosives, HMTD should be handled without any direct contact with hands or any part of human body in a grounded, static electricity controlled area. Only minimal amounts of HMTD should be handled at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;CODE OF GOOD PRACTICE SAFETY IN PRODUCTION AND OPERATING

HMTD is a more powerful initiating explosive than mercury fulminate, but its poor thermal and chemical stability prevents its use in [[detonator]]s.&lt;ref name="Organic Chemistry of Explosives"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neverthelss, HMTD is one of the three most widely used primary explosives in improvised, amateur made blasting caps. The other being TATP and SA.DS.

HMTD is a common source of injury among amateur chemists, particularly finger amputations. Most of these injuries are caused by small amounts of HMTD that inadvertently detonate in close proximity of fingers, since small amounts (grams) are generally not powerful enough to amputate fingers from distances larger than 5 – 10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Stúpajúci trend podomáckej výroby výbušnin a udalosti s tým spojené, Kriminalistický a expertízny ústav Policajného zboru, p. 8 http://www.unms.sk/swift_data/source/dokumenty/skusobnictvo/upravy_2009/odborne_seminare_2008/KEU_BA_01_10_2008.pdf, written in Slovak&lt;/ref&gt; Experienced amateurs handle HMTD in such a manner as to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIwQXbGQKiY avoid any close contact] between fingers and the explosive itself, from synthesis to final detonation. Such measures, for example, include using multiple filter papers during the filtration step that are exchanged as not to have more than 0.2 g of HMTD on a single filter paper, pre-bent papers with cotton wrapped wooden rods for manipulation and blast mitigation [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Filling_blasting_cap.webm devices for final filling].

Calculated (Explo5) detonation pressure P&lt;sub&gt;cj&lt;/sub&gt; at crystal density 1.597 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is 218 kbar with velocity of detonation VoD = 7777&amp;nbsp;m/s. Explosion temperature is 3141 K, energy of explosion is 5612 kJ/kg (or 3400 - 4000 kJ/kg per various sources) and volume of explosion gases at STP is calculated to be 826 l/kg. Loose powder has density close to 0.4 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, hence the common detonation velocities are closer to 3000&amp;nbsp;m/s and P&lt;sub&gt;cj&lt;/sub&gt; is closer to 15 kbar.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.cz/books?id=hX3mBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA524&amp;lpg=PA524&amp;dq=HMTD+detonation+pressure+pressure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YPuG7GP6Vf&amp;sig=fwKMZ6zUEMfk7lU-GPtoxhGjQBM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC9afQqoLbAhWQaFAKHWUTBfs4ChDoAQhWMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=HMTD%20detonation%20pressure%20pressure&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensitivity==
HMTD is overall slightly more sensitive than fresh TATP and can be considered to be slightly more dangerous than an average primary explosive. It is important to note that the variance of friction force between different surfaces (e.g. different kinds of paper) is often greater than the variance between the friction sensitivity of a given pair of primary explosives. This leads to different values for friction sensitivity measured at different laboratories.

==Terrorism==
Despite no longer being used in any military application, and despite its shock sensitivity, HMTD remains a common [[Improvised explosive device|home-made explosive]] and has been used in a large number of [[suicide bombing]]s and other attacks throughout the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17530">'''Lead user''' is a [[technical term|term]] developed by [[Eric von Hippel]] in 1986({{harvnb|Von Hippel|1986}}). His [[definition]] for lead user is:
#Lead users face [[need]]s that will be general in a [[Market (economics)|market]]place – but face them months or years before the bulk of that marketplace encounters them, and
#Lead users are positioned to benefit significantly by obtaining a solution to their needs.

In other words, lead users are [[user (computing)|user]]s of a [[Product (business)|product]] or service that currently experience needs still unknown to the public and who also benefit greatly if they obtain a solution to these needs. Because lead users innovate, they are considered to be one example or type of the [[creative consumer]] phenomenon, that is, those "customers who adapt, modify, or transform a proprietary offering" ({{harvnb|Berthon|Pitt|McCarthy|Kates|2007}}).

==Lead user method introduction==
The Lead User Method is a market research tool that may be used by companies and / or individuals seeking to develop breakthrough products.  Lead User methodology was originally developed by Dr. Eric von Hippel of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and first described in the July 1986 issue of [[Management Science (journal)|Management Science]]. In contrast to the traditional market research techniques that collect information from the users at the center of the target market, the Lead User method takes a different approach, collecting information about both needs and solutions from the leading edges of the target market and from analogue markets, markets facing similar problems in a more extreme form.

The methodology involves four major steps: 
#Start of the Lead User process
#Identification of Needs and Trends
#Identification of Lead Users and interviews
#Concept Design (Workshop).

The methodology is based upon the idea that breakthrough products may be developed by identifying leading trends in the to-be-developed product’s associated marketplace(s).  Once the trend or broader problem to be solved has been identified, the developers seek out “Lead Users”- people or organizations that are attempting to solve a particularly extreme or demanding version of the stated problem.

For example, a company seeking to create a breakthrough in flashlight design may seek out policemen, home inspectors, or others who require bright, efficient lights as part of their day-to-day business.  Once these “lead users” have been identified, networking is employed and the lead users are interviewed so as to gain their insight into how they solve the problem for themselves.  The lead users are also queried to determine whether they have knowledge of individuals or organizations who are considered to be “outside the market” and have even more extreme portable lighting needs than the policemen or home inspectors; in our example, these users might be photographers, divers, or movie lighting designers.  (See the “Examples of Lead User Method” section of this article for more examples of lead user identification.)  By learning from both the lead users and the outside-the-market users, companies may identify new methods or approaches towards creating innovative products that are true breakthroughs via ideas that may not have surfaced by simply examining existing users with traditional market research techniques.

==Review of existing literature==

Research on lead users emerged from studies on sources of innovation.  It was first found that users (as opposed to manufacturers) are often the first to develop new products that are commercially successful ({{harvnb|Enos|1962}} {{harvnb|Von Hippel|1988}}, {{harvnb|Shah|1999}}).  Additionally, it was found that innovation by users tended to be concentrated among the “lead users” of those products and processes ({{harvnb|Von Hippel|1986}}, {{harvnb|Urban|Von Hippel|1988}}, {{harvnb|Morrison|Roberts|Von Hippel|2000}}, {{harvnb|Shah|1999}}, {{harvnb|Luthje|2000}}).  These “lead users” were individuals or organizations who had experienced needs for a given innovation earlier than the majority of the target market ({{harvnb|Von Hippel|1986}}). Recent research highlights the fact that lead users exist for services also (Skiba and Herstatt 2009, Skiba 2010, Oliveira and Von Hippel 2011).

Various studies have explored the effectiveness of this theory in terms of identifying any user innovations. The effect found in these studies tends to be very large; for example, Urban and Von Hippel (1988) found that 82 percent of a given lead-user cluster had developed their own version of, or had modified a specific type of, the industrial product under study… whereas only 1 percent of the non-lead users had done this.
 
Empirical studies have also found that many of the innovations developed by users have commercial attractiveness.  For example, Urban and Von Hippel (1988) found that lead user theory can be effectively utilized in industrial software product development; Morrison, Roberts, and Von Hippel (2000) found that many IT innovations developed by libraries had broader potential value; and Luthje (2003) found that 48 percent of surgical innovations developed by surgeons in university clinics in Germany could be produced as commercial products.

Based on its widespread success, it has been suggested that the lead user methodology should be integrated into corporate new product development efforts (Urban and Von Hippel, 1988). Companies may benefit (to a large extent) as they try to learn from lead users about the needs and solutions encountered at the leading edge of the market.  Increasingly, this type of customer integration is being discussed among innovation management scholars (Enkel, Javier, and Gassmann, 2005; Luthje and Herstatt, 2004).  The idea is also spreading rapidly in the business world (Coyne, 2000; Dehne, 2003; Intrachooto, 2004); for example, lead-user concepts developed and used at 3M showed product sales potential that was an average of eight times higher than for sales of products using more traditional development concepts / processes (Lilien et al., 2002).

==Potential disadvantages of the lead user method==

While the lead user methodology has proven to be very successful, select literature highlights some product development scenarios in which the Lead User method may be less effective.  For example, the following was pointed out on October 14, 2007 on “TechITEasy.org”:

*"Highly secretive industries where lead users may not feel comfortable or may not be able to disclose information and knowledge are not suited for this [lead user]  process;"
*"The lengthy [nature of the lead user] process can prevent this methodology from being applied effectively in industries with really short term innovation cycles or where quick turnaround from research to market delivery is required;"
*“The [lead user method] LUM is better suited to meet the needs of the industrial goods market rather than consumer goods market as lead users of industrial goods can typically be identified more reliably than lead users of most consumer goods.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techiteasy.org/2007/10/14/connecting-technology-to-market-the-lead-user-methodology/ |title=Generating breakthrough products: the Lead User Methodology |publisher=Tech IT Easy |date=2007-10-14 |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420235107/http://techiteasy.org/2007/10/14/connecting-technology-to-market-the-lead-user-methodology/ |archivedate=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature also suggests that an additional obstacle to the adoption of this kind of process is related to a general resistance to innovation and / or change that can be found in typically bureaucratic organizations; these organizations tend to resist disruptive changes in processes which many force the company to evolve, (although this is exactly the purpose of such an approach). While the lead user methodology can reliably lead to breakthroughs, adopting the approach can be difficult for some organizations and on the whole, the technique itself is useful to the extent that the product and / or service under study is lead user friendly (i.e. if it’s not a top-secret or quick time-to-market idea). [need reference to the mention literature]

==Examples of lead user method==

The lead user method can be utilized in any industry and at any level of product complexity. The following are examples where the Lead User method was utilized to create a new product which satisfied a specific need:

'''3M'''

The lead user method was utilized in 3M’s Medical-Surgical Division to develop a breakthrough surgical drape product. 3M assembled a team of lead users which included a veterinarian surgeon, a makeup artist, doctors from developing countries and military medics.&lt;ref name="leaduser1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaduser.com |title=leaduser.com |publisher=leaduser.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hilti AG'''

Hilti utilized the lead user method to develop a simplified pipe hanger. Hilti put together a lead user group consisting of lead layout engineers, researchers from construction departments of institutes, an engineer from a professional organization in Bonn, and two engineers from municipal building departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/papers/Herstatt-EvH%20Journal%20Product%20Innov%20Management.pdf |title=Developing New Product Concepts Via the Lead User Method: A Case Study in a "Low Tech" Field" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nortel'''

Nortel utilized the lead user method to develop a new class of web applications for voice, video and data. Nortel put together a group of lead users including law enforcement professionals, paramedics, military personnel, animal trackers and professional storm trackers.&lt;ref name="leaduser1"/&gt;

'''Sense Worldwide'''

A '''magnetic anomaly detector''' (MAD) is an instrument used to detect minute variations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The term refers specifically to [[magnetometer]]s used by military forces to detect [[submarine]]s (a mass of [[ferromagnetic]] material creates a detectable disturbance in the [[magnetic field]]); military MAD equipment is a descendent of [[geomagnetic]] [[geological survey|survey]] or [[aeromagnetic survey]] instruments used to search for [[mineral]]s by detecting their disturbance of the normal earth-field.

==History==
Geoexploration by measuring and studying variations in the Earth's magnetic field has been conducted by scientists since 1843.  The first uses of magnetometers were for the location of ore deposits.  Thalen's "The Examination of Iron Ore Deposits by Magnetic Measurements", published in 1879, was the first scientific treatise describing this practical use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050310171755/http://www.geo.ucalgary.ca/~wu/Goph547/CSM_MagNotes.pdf Note Outline: Geophysical Surveying Using Magnetics Methods, January 16, 2004, University of Calgary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic anomaly detectors employed to detect submarines during World War II harnessed the [[fluxgate magnetometer]], an inexpensive and easy to use technology developed in the 1930s by [[Victor Vacquier]] of [[Gulf Oil]] for finding ore deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Dunmore, Spencer, Lost Subs, Chartwell Books, Edison NJ, 2007, p.120 {{ISBN|978-0-7858-2226-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-me-vacquier24-2009jan24,0,3328591.story|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Victor Vacquier Sr., 1907–2009: Geophysicist was a master of magnetics|date=January 24, 2009|page=B24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  MAD gear was used by both Japanese and U.S. anti-submarine forces, either towed by ship or mounted in aircraft to detect shallow submerged enemy submarines. The Japanese called the technology ''jikitanchiki'' (磁気探知機, "Magnetic Detector"). After the war, the U.S. Navy continued to develop MAD gear as a parallel development with sonar detection technologies.

Satellite, near-surface and oceanic data from detectors was used to create the [http://projects.gtk.fi/export/sites/projects/WDMAM/project/perugia/WDMAM_1.02_2007_Edition_low_resolution_reduced1.pdf World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map] published by the Commission for the Geological Map of the World (CGMW)  in July 2007.

==Operation==
To reduce interference from electrical equipment or metal in the [[fuselage]] of the aircraft, the MAD sensor is placed at the end of a boom or on a towed aerodynamic device. Even so, the submarine must be very near the aircraft's position and close to the sea surface for detection of the anomaly, because magnetic fields decrease as the [[Magnet#Fields_of_a_magnet|inverse cube of distance]]. The size of the submarine, its hull composition and orientation determine the detection range. MAD devices are usually mounted on [[aircraft]].

==Other uses==
For [[aeromagnetic survey]] applications the magnetic sensor can be mounted on an aircraft (typically on a long probe in front of or behind the aircraft to reduce the magnetic effects of the aircraft itself) or in a towed device. A chart is produced that [[geologists]] and [[geophysicists]] can study to determine the distribution and concentration of magnetic [[minerals]] which are related to [[geology]] and [[mineral deposits]]..

[[File:Medical alert bracelet 2.jpg|alt=A metal bracelet, engraved with a short list of important medical information, and decorated with a red symbol representing medicine|thumb|400x400px|A medical alert bracelet]]
A '''medical identification tag''' is a small [[emblem]] or tag worn on a [[bracelet]], [[neck chain]], or on the clothing bearing a message that the wearer has an important [[medical condition]] that might require immediate attention. The tag is often made out of [[stainless steel]] or [[sterling silver]]. The intention is to alert a [[paramedic]], physician, [[emergency department]] personnel or other [[certified first responder|first responders]] ([[emergency medical services]], [[community first responder]], [[Emergency medical responder]]) of the condition even if the wearer is not conscious enough, old enough, or too injured to explain. A wallet [[Identity document|card]] with the same information may be used instead of or along with a tag, and a stick-on medical ID tag may be added or used alone.

A type of medic identification alert is the USB medical alert tag, essentially a USB flash drive with capacity to store a great deal of emergency information, including contacts and medical conditions. This information is accessible by any computer with a USB port. However, the practical effectiveness of such a system is limited in many cases by medical computer systems that restrict the use of USB devices which may carry malware. It is also possible that a device carried by an unconscious person may not be their own, or not be up to date, with concomitant risks to health and legal liability of medical personnel.

Another new type of medic identification alert is [[QR code]] based medical alert stickers. The QR code on the sticker links to a [[web service]] that contains the individual's emergency information. The information is accessed by any first responder or emergency personnel by scanning the QR code by using a [[smartphone]]. Since a web service is used to store the information there is normally no limitation of how much information that can be stored.

==Conditions for use==
Typical conditions warranting wearing of such a tag are:

{{div col end}}

==Information provided==
{{Main article|In case of emergency}}
In addition to mention of the relevant medical condition(s), the tag may have a telephone number that medical personnel can call for more information, for example that of physician, care-giver or [[next of kin]]. Where applicable and provided, the wearer's national health service user number can enable access to a more detailed case history. Basically, the medical information tag, engraved with the wearer's personal medical problem or history, speak for the wearer when the wearer can't. Incidentally and where the symptoms can mislead, such a tag may also be useful as evidence of such a condition to law enforcement personnel.

==Types==
[[File:Star of life2.svg|thumb|The emblem for medical emergency services in some countries, the [[Star of Life]], features a [[rod of Asclepius]].]]
There are various types of medical ID&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Medical ID That Comes With a Free Medical Profile|url=https://shop.getmyid.com|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; available. The most common form of medical ID is jewelry which provides a logo or inscription indicating a particular medical condition. These medical identification tags can be made out of stainless steel (usually classified as 316L and known as [[Stainless steel#Stainless steel grades|surgical stainless steel]]), sterling silver or gold. If found by emergency personnel the inscription provides an indication of your special medical needs. Tags are available with pre-engraved conditions or can be custom engraved with your specific medical histories and have the benefit of that all information is self-contained and does not require any form of technology to view in case of an emergency.

Another type of medical ID jewelry indicates membership in a medical information organization such as the [[MedicAlert]] Foundation, and American Medical ID. Such medical ID jewelry includes a member identification number and a toll-free number for medical emergency personnel to contact the organization and obtain full information about the wearer's medical conditions, treatment, and history. These organizations maintain a database of medical information on their members and can provide it to medical personnel when requested.

The newest technology allows the user to carry stickers with an [[NFC Tag]]. A similar technology allows the user to carry stickers with a [[QR code]]. By scanning the NFC Tag or the QR code with a smartphone, you will reach the stored medical alert information. Apple's IOS 8 operating system includes the facility for a mobile phone to contain the owner's medical emergency information.

Silicone bracelets, preprinted with a general medical condition or allergy, are also popular. The lack of personalization may be a deterrent. Recently patients have begun to "tattoo" their medical condition on their wrist or arm. Although a permanent tattoo might be considered, a temporary tattoo works as well. Other items include stick on tags that stick onto a driver's license, wallet, or cell phone which are practical for the person who does not want to carry something extra advertising their medical condition.

Another type of medical jewelry is a pendant or wrist strap containing a wireless alert button, also known as a panic button, worn in the home as part of a wireless medical alert system. This type of medical jewelry sends a signal to a dialing console which contacts a [[medical alarm]] monitoring service or directly dials first responders when an emergency occurs.

===Machine-readable devices===
Devices marked "ICE" which can hold a significant amount of data and are readable by a computer are sold, typically [[USB]] [[USB flash drive|flash drives]] with password-protected data entry providing [[File system permissions|read-only]] access to emergency medical data. However, it has been pointed out by a staff nurse with experience in trauma and critical care that such devices are worse than useless, at least in most situations in the UK, as medical computer systems are designed not to accept USB storage devices due to the risk of [[computer virus]]es. Additionally, there is no guarantee that ICE information even pertains to an unconscious person carrying it; using incorrect information can lead to patient harm and legal liability.

A '''microreactor''' or '''microstructured reactor''' or '''microchannel reactor''' is a device in which [[chemical reaction]]s take place in a confinement with typical lateral dimensions below 1&amp;nbsp;mm;
the most typical form of such confinement are [[Micro heat exchanger|microchannel]]s.&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;''Recent advances in synthetic micro reaction technology'' Paul Watts and Charlotte Wiles [[Chem.

Microreactors offer many advantages over conventional scale reactors, including vast improvements in energy efficiency, reaction speed and yield, safety, reliability, scalability, on-site/on-demand production, and a much finer degree of [[process control]].

==History==
Gas-phase microreactors have a long history but those involving liquids started to appear in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Watts/&gt;  One of the first microreactors with embedded high performance [[heat exchanger]]s were made in the early 1990s by the Central Experimentation Department ([[Institute for Micro Process Engineering|''Hauptabteilung Versuchstechnik'', HVT]]) of [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe]]&lt;ref name=schubi01&gt;{{Cite journal

in Germany, using mechanical micromachining techniques that were a spinoff from the manufacture of [[separation nozzle]]s for [[uranium]] [[Nuclear enrichment|enrichment]].&lt;ref name=schubi01/&gt; As research on nuclear technology was drastically reduced in Germany, microstructured heat exchangers were investigated for their application in handling highly exothermic and dangerous chemical reactions. This new concept, known by names as [[microreaction technology]] or [[micro process engineering]], was further developed by various research institutions. An early example from 1997 involved that of [[azo coupling]]s in a [[pyrex]] reactor with channel dimensions 90 micrometres deep and 190 micrometres wide.&lt;ref name=Watts/&gt;

==Benefits==
Using microreactors is somewhat different from using a glass vessel. These reactors may be a valuable tool in the hands of an experienced chemist or reaction engineer:

* Microreactors typically have [[Heat transfer coefficient|heat exchange coefficients]] of at least 1 megawatt per cubic meter per [[kelvin]], up to 500 MW&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;!-- see talk page re exponents in ChemEng --&gt;vs. a few kilowatts in conventional glassware (1 l flask ~10&amp;nbsp;kW&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, microreactors can remove heat much more efficiently than vessels and even critical reactions such as [[nitration]]s can be performed safely at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;D.Roberge, L.Ducry, N.Bieler, P.Cretton, B.Zimmermann, Chem. Eng. Tech. 28 (2005) No. 3, [http://www.lonza.com/group/en/company/news/publications_of_lonza.-ParSys-0002-ParSysdownloadlist-0001-DownloadFile.pdf/1_050510_Microreactor%20Technology%20A%20Revolution%20for%20the%20Fine%20Chemical%20and%20Pharmaceutical%20Industries.pdf online available]&lt;/ref&gt; Hot spot temperatures as well as the duration of high temperature exposition due to [[exothermic]]ity decreases remarkably. Thus, microreactors may allow better [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] investigations, because local temperature gradients affecting reaction rates are much smaller than in any batch vessel. Heating and cooling a microreactor is also much quicker and [[operating temperature]]s can be as low as −100&amp;nbsp;°C. As a result of the superior heat transfer, reaction temperatures may be much higher than in conventional batch-reactors. Many low temperature reactions as organo-metal chemistry can be performed in microreactors at temperatures of −10&amp;nbsp;°C rather than −50&amp;nbsp;°C to −78&amp;nbsp;°C as in laboratory glassware equipment.
* Microreactors are normally operated continuously. This allows the subsequent processing of unstable intermediates and avoids typical batch [[Work-up (chemistry)|workup]] delays. Especially low temperature chemistry with reaction times in the millisecond to second range are no longer stored for hours until dosing of reagents is finished and the next reaction step may be performed. This rapid work up avoids decay of precious intermediates and often allows better selectivities.&lt;ref&gt;T.Schwalbe, V.Autze, G.Wille: Chimica 2002, 56, p.636, see also [http://www.mrsp.net/MRSP_Chimica_Oggi.pdf Microflow Synthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Continuous operation and mixing causes a very different concentration profile when compared with a batch process. In a batch, [[reagent]] A is filled in and reagent B is slowly added. Thus, B encounters initially a high excess of A. In a microreactor, A and B are mixed nearly instantly and B won't be exposed to a large excess of A. This may be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the [[reaction mechanism]] - it is important to be aware of such different concentration profiles.
* Although a bench-top microreactor can synthesize chemicals only in small quantities, scale-up to industrial volumes is simply a process of multiplying the number of microchannels. In contrast, batch processes too often perform well on R&amp;D bench-top level but fail at batch pilot plant level.&lt;ref&gt;T.Schwalbe, V.Autze, M. Hohmann, W. Stirner: Org.Proc.Res.Dev 8 (2004) p. 440ff, see also [http://www.mrsp.net/MRSP_lo-res.pdf Continuous process research and implementation from laboratory to manufacture]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pressurisation of materials within microreactors (and associated components) is generally easier than with traditional batch reactors.  This allows reactions to be increased in rate by raising the temperature beyond the boiling point of the solvent.  This, although typical Arrhenius behaviour, is more easily facilitated in microreactors and should be considered a key advantage.  Pressurisation may also allow dissolution of reactant gasses within the flow stream.

==Problems==
* Although there have been reactors made for handling particles, microreactors generally do not tolerate particulates well, often clogging.  Clogging has been identified by a number of researchers as the biggest hurdle for microreactors being widely accepted as a beneficial alternative to batch reactors.  So far, the so-called microjetreactor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wille|first=Ch|author2=Gabski, H.-P |author3=Haller, Th |author4=Kim, H |author5=Unverdorben, L |author6= Winter, R |title=Synthesis of pigments in a three-stage microreactor pilot plant—an experimental technical report|journal=Chemical Engineering Journal|year=2003|volume=101|issue=1–3|pages=179–185|doi=10.1016/j.cej.2003.11.007}} and literature cited therein&lt;/ref&gt;  is free of clogging by precipitating products. Gas evolved may also shorten the residence time of reagents as volume is not constant during the reaction. This may be prevented by application of pressure.
* Mechanical pumping may generate a pulsating flow which can be disadvantageous. Much work has been devoted to development of pumps with low pulsation.  A continuous flow solution is [[electroosmotic flow]] (EOF).
*Typically, reactions performing very well in a microreactor encounter many problems in vessels, especially when scaling up. Often, the high area to volume ratio and the uniform residence time cannot easily be scaled.
* [[Corrosion]] imposes a bigger issue in microreactors because area to volume ratio is high. Degradation of few µm may go unnoticed in conventional vessels. As typical inner dimensions of channels are in  the same order of magnitude, characteristics may be altered significantly.

==T reactors==
One of the simplest forms of a microreactor is a 'T' reactor. A 'T' shape is etched into a plate with a depth that may be 40 [[micrometre]]s and a width of 100 micrometres: the etched path is turned into a tube by sealing a flat plate over the top of the etched groove. The cover plate has three holes that align to the top-left, top-right, and bottom of the 'T' so that fluids can be added and removed. A solution of reagent 'A' is pumped into the top left of the 'T' and solution 'B' is pumped into the top right of the 'T'. If the pumping rate is the same, the components meet at the top of the vertical part of the 'T' and begin to mix and react as they go down the trunk of the 'T'. A solution of product is removed at the base of the 'T'.

==Applications==
[[Image:Syrris Chip.jpg|right|frame|Glass Microreactors involve microfabricated structures to allow [[flow chemistry]] to be performed at a microscale. Applications include Compound Library Generation, Process Development and Compound Synthesis]]

===Synthesis===
Microreactors can be used to synthesise material more effectively than current batch techniques allow. The benefits here are primarily enabled by the [[mass transfer]], [[thermodynamics]], and high surface area to volume ratio environment as well as engineering advantages in handling unstable intermediates. Microreactors are applied in combination with [[photochemistry]], [[electrosynthesis]], [[multicomponent reaction]]s and [[polymerization]] (for example that of [[butyl acrylate]]). It can involve liquid-liquid systems but also solid-liquid systems with for example the channel walls coated with a [[heterogeneous catalyst]]. Synthesis is also combined with online purification of the product.&lt;ref name=Watts/&gt; Following [[Green Chemistry]] principles, microreactors can be used to synthesize and purify extremely reactive [[Organometallic]] Compounds for [[Atomic Layer Deposition|ALD]] and [[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]] applications, with improved safety in operations and higher purity products.&lt;ref&gt;''Method of Preparing Organometallic Compounds Using Microchannel Devices'', '''2009''', Francis Joseph Lipiecki, Stephen G.

A novel microreactor design developed by Bhangale et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atul|first=Bhangale|title=Enzyme-Catalyzed Polymerization of End-Functionalized Polymers in a Microreactor|journal=Macromolecules|volume=45|issue=17|pages=7000–7008|doi=10.1021/ma301178k|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhangale|first=Atul|title=Continuous Flow Enzyme-Catalyzed Polymerization in a Microreactor|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=133|issue=15|pages=6006–6011|doi=10.1021/ja111346c|pmid=21438577|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  enabled to perform heterogeneous reactions in continuous mode, in organic media, and at elevated temperatures. Using microreactors, enabled faster polymerization and higher molecular mass compared to using batch reactors. It is evident that similar microreactor based platforms can readily be extended to other enzyme-based systems, for example, high-throughput screening of new enzymes and to precision measurements of new processes where continuous flow mode is preferred. This is the first reported demonstration of a solid supported enzyme-catalyzed polymerization reaction in continuous mode.

===Analysis===
Microreactors can also enable experiments to be performed at a far lower scale and far higher experimental rates than currently possible in batch production, while not collecting the physical experimental output. The benefits here are primarily derived from the low operating scale, and the integration of the required sensor technologies to allow high quality understanding of an experiment. The integration of the required [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]], purification and [[Analytical chemistry|analytical]] capabilities is impractical when operating outside of a microfluidic context.

====NMR====

Researchers at the Radboud University Nijmegen and Twente University, the Netherlands, have developed a microfluidic high-resolution NMR flow probe. They have shown a model reaction being followed in real-time. The combination of the uncompromised (sub-Hz) resolution and a low sample volume can prove to be a valuable tool for flow chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;''A Microfluidic High-Resolution NMR Flow Probe'' Jacob Bart†, Ard J. Kolkman, Anna Jo Oosthoek-de Vries, Kaspar Koch, Pieter J. Nieuwland, Hans (J. W. G.) Janssen, Jan (P. J. M.) van Bentum, Kirsten A. M. Ampt, Floris P. J. T. Rutjes, Sybren S. Wijmenga, Han (J. G.

====Infrared spectroscopy====

Mettler Toledo and [[Bruker Optics]] offer dedicated equipment for monitoring, with [[attenuated total reflectance]] spectrometry (ATR spectrometry) in microreaction setups. The former has been demonstrated for reaction monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Catherine F.|author2=Lange, Heiko |author3=Ley, Steven V. |author4=Baxendale, Ian R. |author5=Wittkamp, Brian |author6=Goode, Jon G. |author7= Gaunt, Nigel L. |title=ReactIR Flow Cell: A New Analytical Tool for Continuous Flow Chemical Processing|journal=Organic Process Research &amp; Development|date=19 March 2010|volume=14|issue=2|pages=393–404|doi=10.1021/op900305v}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter has been successfully used for reaction monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minnich|first=Clemens B.|author2=Küpper, Lukas |author3=Liauw, Marcel A. |author4= Greiner, Lasse |title=Combining reaction calorimetry and ATR-IR spectroscopy for the operando monitoring of ionic liquids synthesis|journal=Catalysis Today|year=2007|volume=126|issue=1–2|pages=191–195|doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2006.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and determining dispersion characteristics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minnich|first=Clemens B.|author2=Sipeer, Frank |author3=Greiner, Lasse |author4= Liauw, Marcel A. |title=Determination of the Dispersion Characteristics of Miniaturized Coiled Reactors with Fiber-Optic Fourier Transform Mid-infrared Spectroscopy|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=16 June 2010|volume=49|issue=12|pages=5530–5535|doi=10.1021/ie901094q}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of a microreactor.

==Academic research==
Microreactors, and more generally, [[micro process engineering]], are the subject of worldwide academic research. A prominent recurring conference is [[IMRET]], the ''International Conference on Microreaction Technology''. Microreactors and micro process engineering have also been featured in dedicated sessions of other conferences, such as the Annual Meeting of the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] ([[AIChE]]), or the [[International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering]] ([[ISCRE]]). Research is now also conducted at various academic institutions around the world, e.g. at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in Cambridge/MA, [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], [[Oregon State University]] in Corvallis/OR, at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in Berkeley/CA in the United States, at the [[EPFL]] in Lausanne, Switzerland, at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] in Eindhoven, at [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] in Nijmegen, Netherlands and at the LIPHT [http://www-lipht.u-strasbg.fr/Interface/index.php] of Université de Strasbourg in Strasbourg and [http://www.lgpc.fr/Objets|LGPC] of the University of Lyon, [[École supérieure de chimie physique électronique de Lyon|CPE Lyon]], France.

==Market structure==

Depending on the application focus, there are various hardware suppliers and commercial development entities to service the evolving market. One view to technically segment market, offering and market clearing stems from the scientific and technological objective of market agents:

&lt;ol type=a&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ready to Run (turnkey) systems are being used where the application environment stands to benefit from new chemical synthesis schemes, enhanced investigational throughput of up to approximately 10 - 100 experiments per day (depends on reaction time) and reaction subsystem, and actual synthesis conduct at scales ranging from 10 [[milligram]]s per experiment to triple digit tons per year (continuous operation of a reactor battery).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modular (open) systems are serving the niche for investigations on continuous process engineering lay-outs, where a measurable process advantage over the use of standardized equipment is anticipated by chemical engineers. Multiple process lay-outs can be rapidly assembled and chemical process results obtained on a scale ranging from several grams per experiment up to approximately 100&amp;nbsp;kg at a moderate number of experiments per day (3-15). A secondary transfer of engineering findings in the context of a plant engineering exercise (scale-out) then provides target capacity of typically single product dedicated plants. This mimics the success of engineering contractors for the petro-chemical process industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dedicated developments. Manufacturer of microstructured components are mostly commercial development partners to scientists in search of novel synthesis technologies. Such development partners typically excel in the set-up of comprehensive investigation and supply schemes, to model a desired contacting pattern or spatial arrangement of matter. To do so they predominantly offer information from proprietary integrated modeling systems that combine computational fluid dynamics with thermokinetic modelling. Moreover, as a rule, such development partners establish the overall application analytics to the point where the critical initial hypothesis can be validated and further confined.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

[[File:Various Media.jpg|thumb|NT cassette compared to various recording media]]
'''NT''' is a digital memo recording system introduced by [[Sony]] in 1992, sometimes marketed under the name '''Scoopman'''. The system stored memos using [[helical scan]]ning on special [[microcassette]]s, which were 30 &amp;times; 21.5 &amp;times; 5&amp;nbsp;mm with a tape width of 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm, with a recording capacity of up to 120 minutes.  The Scoopmen cassettes are offered in three versions: The Sony NTC-60, -90, and -120, each describing the length of time (in minutes) the cassette can record.

NT stands for ''Non-Tracking'', meaning the head does not precisely follow the tracks on the tape.  Instead, the head moves over the tape at approximately the correct angle and speed, but performs more than one pass over each track. The data in each track is stored on the tape in blocks with addressing information that enables reconstruction in memory from several passes. This considerably reduced the required mechanical precision, reducing the complexity, size, and cost of the recorder.

Another feature of NT cassettes is ''Non-Loading'', which means instead of having a mechanism to pull the tape out of the cassette and wrap it around the drum, the drum is pushed inside the cassette to achieve the same effect. This also significantly reduces the complexity, size, and cost of the mechanism.

Audio sampling is in stereo at 32&amp;nbsp;kHz with 12 bit nonlinear quantization, corresponding to 17 bit linear quantization. Data written to the tape is packed into data blocks and encoded with LDM-2 low deviation modulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ecjb.4420760510 | volume=76 | title=High-density magnetic tape recording by a nontracking method | journal=Electronics and Communications in Japan (Part II: Electronics) | pages=83–93 | last1 = Himeno | first1 = Takuji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sony NT-2 Digital Micro Recorder, introduced in 1996 and shown here, features a real-time clock that records a time signal on the digital track along with the sound data, making it useful for journalism, police and legal work.&lt;ref name="techmoan"&gt;{{YouTube | fXo3_wmqtEQ | title=The World's Smallest Cassette Tape}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the machine's buffer memory, it is capable of automatically reversing the tape direction at the end of the reel without an interruption in the sound.&lt;ref name="techmoan" /&gt;  The recorder uses a single "AA"-size cell for primary power, plus a separate CR-1220 lithium cell to provide continuous power to the real-time clock.&lt;ref name="techmoan" /&gt;  The Sony NT-2, an improved successor to the Sony NT-1 Digital Micro Recorder, introduced in 1992, was the final machine in the series.  The NT cassette systems cost more than a DAT recorder in their day, are fragile and relatively unreliable compared to other emerging recording technologies, and being unable to compete soon disappeared from the market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.praktiker.at/download/lepau604.pdf Review of Sony NT-1 Scoopman and technical data (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;  The devices are considered curiosities for collectors.

An '''occupancy sensor''' is an indoor [[motion detector|motion detecting]] devices used to detect the presence of a person to automatically control lights or [[HVAC|temperature or ventilation]] systems. The sensors use [[infrared]], [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], [[microwave]], or other technology. The term encompasses devices as different as [[PIR sensor]]s, hotel room [[keycard lock]]s and [[smart meter]]s. Occupancy sensors are typically used to [[energy conservation|save energy]], provide automatic control, and comply with building codes.&lt;ref name="calif"&gt;{{cite web |title=Guest Room Occupancy Controls—2013 California Building Energy Efficiency Standards |authors=Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison |date=2011 |publisher=[[California Energy Commission]] |url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2013standards/prerulemaking/documents/current/Reports/Nonresidential/Lighting_Controls_Bldg_Power/2013_CASE_NR_Guest_Room_Occupancy_Controls_Oct_2011.pdf |accessdate=May 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vacancy sensor==
A vacancy sensor works like an occupancy sensor, however, lights must be manually turned ON, but will automatically turn OFF when motion is no longer detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Occupancy and Vacancy Sensors |publisher=Leviton Manufacturing Company |url=https://www.leviton.com/en/products/commercial/lighting-controls/occupancy-sensors-and-vacancy |accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensor types==
Occupancy sensor types include:
#[[PIR sensor]]s, which work on heat difference detection, measuring infrared radiation. Inside the device is a pyroelectric sensor which can detect the sudden presence of objects (such as humans) who radiate a temperature different from the temperature of the background, such as the room temperature of a wall.

#[[Ultrasonic sensor]]s, similar to [[radar]]. they work on the [[doppler effect|doppler shift principle]]. An ultrasonic sensor will send high frequency sound waves in area and will check for their reflected patterns. If the reflected pattern is changing continuously then it assumes that there is occupancy and the lighting load connected is turned on. If the reflected pattern is the same for a preset time then the sensor assumes there is no occupancy and the load is switched off.
#Microwave sensors. Similar to the ultrasonic sensor, a microwave sensor also works on the doppler shift principle. A microwave sensor will send high frequency microwaves in an area and will check for their reflected patterns. If the reflected pattern is changing continuously then it assumes that there is occupancy and the lighting load connected is turned on. If the reflected pattern is the same for a preset time then the sensor assumes there is no occupancy and the load is switched off. A microwave sensor has high sensitivity as well as detection range compared to other types of sensors.

==Occupancy sensors for lighting control==
Motion sensors are often used in indoor spaces to control electric lighting.  If no motion is detected, it is assumed that the space is empty, and thus does not need to be lit.  Turning off the lights in such circumstances can save substantial amounts of energy.  In lighting practice occupancy sensors are sometime also called "presence sensors" or "vacancy sensors".  Some occupancy sensors (e.g. LSG's Pixelview, Philips Lumimotion, Ecoamicatechs Sirius etc.) also classify the number of occupants, their direction of motion, etc., through image processing.  Pixelview is a camera-based occupancy sensor, using a camera that is built into each light fixture.

===System design and components===
Occupancy sensors for [[lighting control system|lighting control]] typically use infrared (IR), ultrasonic, tomographic motion detection, microwave sensors, or camera-based sensors (image processing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology comparison of Occupancy sensors|url=http://www.ecosirius.com/technology%20-%20page%201.html|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of view of the sensor must be carefully selected/adjusted so that it responds only to motion in the space served by the controlled lighting.  For example, an occupancy sensor controlling lights in an office should not detect motion in the corridor outside the office. Tomographic motion detection systems have the unique benefit of detecting motion through walls and obstructions, yet do not trigger as easily from motion on the outside of the detection area like traditional microwave sensors.

Sensors and their placement are never perfect, therefore most systems incorporate a delay time before switching.  This delay time is often user-selectable, but a typical default value is 15 minutes.  This means that the sensor must detect no motion for the entire delay time before the lights are switched.  Most systems switch lights off at the end of the delay time, but more sophisticated systems with dimming technology reduce lighting slowly to a minimum level (or zero) over several minutes, to minimize the potential disruption in adjacent spaces.  If lights are off and an occupant re-enters a space, most current systems switch lights back on when motion is detected.  However, systems designed to switch lights off automatically with no occupancy, and that require the occupant to switch lights on when they re-enter are gaining in popularity due to their potential for increased energy savings.  These savings accrue because in a spaces with access to daylight the occupant may decide on their return that they no longer require supplemental electric light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bildr.org/2011/06/pir_arduino/ Did It Move? Detecting Motion with PIR + Arduino]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Photographic film}}

A '''positive''' is a film or paper record of a scene that represents the color and luminance of objects in that scene with the same colors and luminances (as near as the medium will allow). Color transparencies are an example of positive photography: the range of colors presented in the medium is limited by the tonal range of the original image (dark and light areas correspond). It is opposed to a '''[[negative (photography)|negative]]''' where colors and luminances are reversed: this is due to the chemical or electrical processes involved in recording the scene. Positives can be turned into negatives by appropriate chemical or electronic processes. Often, with the use of [[digital imaging]], computers can automatically complete this process.

'''Quarterhill Inc.''' (formerly '''WiLan Inc.''') is a Canadian public technology holding company, based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].  It was founded in 1992 as a wireless technology company.  In the mid-2000s, it gradually transitioned into a patent licensing company.  In 2017, it renamed itself Quarterhill, and is attempting to become a holding company specializing in the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/wi-lans-acquisition-of-viziya-marks-move-into-the-industrial-internet-of-things|title=Wi-Lan’s acquisition of VIZIYA marks move into the industrial Internet of Things|date=2017-05-10|work=Financial Post|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]].

== History ==
WiLan was founded in 1992 by [[Hatim Zaghloul]] and Michel Fattouche to commercialize their Wideband [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing]] (WOFDM) technology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/wi-lan-caught-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place/article1194297/|title=Wi-LAN caught between a rock and a hard place|last=|first=|date=2000-11-21|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-02-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally based in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], and the name was an acronym for "Wireless Local Area Network".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/wi-lan-chief-keeps-cool-whether-shares-are-hot-or-cold/article770792/|title=Wi-LAN chief keeps cool whether shares are hot or cold|last=|first=|date=2000-11-07|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-02-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1998, WiLAN had its initial public offering on the [[Alberta Stock Exchange]] at $2.50 per share (it later listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  WiLAN enjoyed significant success in the context of the tech bubble at the time, but its fortunes changed when the bubble collapsed. From October 1999 to March 2000, WiLan's share price increased from $10 to $94, but it fell back down to $12 by November 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  By February 2006, the price had fallen to 66 cents.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wi-lan-co-founder-resigns-over-conflict-with-company-1.609905|title=Wi-Lan co-founder resigns over conflict with company|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, WiLAN reached a significant patent liscensing deal with Cisco Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wi-lan-shares-jump-on-cisco-deal-1.553752|title=Wi-Lan shares jump on Cisco deal|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 WiLAN divested its various technology product lines to refocus its business on licensing intellectual property and patent rights.  As part of this change of strategy, it replaced it CEO, Bill Dunbar, by its current CEO Jim Skippen.   Founder Hatim Zaghloul, who disagreed with the company's change of strategy, resigned from the board.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  At the same time, the company moved its headquarters from Calgary to Ottawa.&lt;ref name="move"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20070112/282686157746474|title=Wi-LAN finds new life in Ottawa|last=Bagnall|first=James|date=January 12, 2007|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's change in strategy was initially successful, and it managed to sign a $50 million license deal with Nokia, allowing Nokia to use WiLAN's wireless patents.&lt;ref name="Nokia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/nokia-licenses-wi-lan-patents-for-49-2m-1.615172|title=Nokia licenses Wi-LAN patents for $49.2M|date=December 4, 2006|newspaper=CBC News|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2006 to 2011, WiLAN expanded its portfolio of patents from 20 to 3,000.&lt;ref name="left"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://albertaventure.com/2012/03/the-one-that-got-away/|title=Wi-Lan left Alberta to make it big in Ottawa. Will other tech start-ups stay?|last=Czarnecka|first=Marzena|date=March 1, 2012|newspaper=Alberta Venture|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WiLAN in turn licensed out this patented technology to companies such as Nokia, LG Electronics, Samsung, Fujitsu, RIM, Intel, Broadcom and Panasonic.  From 2011 to 2015, WiLAN experienced significant tailwinds, as a less favorable legal climate led to licencees less willing to pay for patents.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/patent-licensing-company-wi-lan-continues-to-underwhelm-investors/article25009709/|title=Patent-licensing company Wi-LAN continues to underwhelm investors|last=|first=|date=2015-06-17|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-02-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of particular note was WiLAN's 2013 loss of a patent lawsuit against [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wi-lan-shares-plunge-after-it-loses-apple-patent-suit-1.2223954|title=Wi-LAN shares plunge after it loses Apple patent suit|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in June 2015, WiLAN announced it had signed a multi-year licensing agreement with Samsung, allowing Samsung to use technology in WiLAN's new Qimonda portfolio.&lt;ref name="qimonda"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wi-lan-licenses-qimonda-patent-portfolio-to-samsung-1433263874|title=Wi-LAN Licenses Qimonda Patent Portfolio to Samsung|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|last=King|first=Carolyn|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 2015, WiLAN announced that, beginning in October 2015, it would undergo a significant company restructuring.&lt;ref name="restructure"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/wi-lan-to-restructure-spin-off-rd-slash-dividend/article27095432/|title=Wi-LAN to restructure, spin off R&amp;D, slash dividend|date=November 4, 2015|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this restructuring, WiLAN announced that it would spin off its research and development unit and cut its dividend to shareholders.  The restructuring would affect 30 per cent of WiLAN's workforce. The company would also focus on licensing patent portfolios owned by other companies and helping companies monetize their patents.

In April 2017, WiLAN acquired International Road Dynamics, a [[Saskatoon]]-based road traffic management system engineering company, for $63.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thestarphoenix.com/business/local-business/international-road-dynamics-acquired-for-63-5-million|title=International Road Dynamics acquired for $63.5 million|date=2017-04-18|work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2017, it acquired VIZIYA, a software services provider, for $40 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These acquisitions were part of a broader restructuring at WiLAN from a patent licensing company to a more diversified technology holding company, specializing in the industrial [[Internet of Things]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wi-LAN undertakes major transformation to spur growth|url=https://www.bnn.ca/video/wi-lan-undertakes-major-transformation-to-spur-growth~1103517|publisher=[[Business News Network|BNN]]|date=18 April 2017|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the restructuring, WiLan was renamed Quarterhill, although the Will Inc., was created, which contains WiLan Inc., International Road Dynamics, and VIZIYA as subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ottawa’s Quarterhill fails to impress investors with record Q3 revenues|url=http://www.obj.ca/article/ottawas-quarterhill-fails-impress-investors-record-q3-revenues|first=Craig|last=Lord|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=31 January 2018|newspaper=Ottawa Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
Quarterhill's principal business is [[patent licensing]], through its WiLAN subsidiary.  Its business model is to acquire technology patents, and then license them to companies who use them.  The model relies on the threat of legal action against companies who use its patents without permission.  It has thus sometimes been described as a [[patent troll]], because it profits from patents, but does not commercialize or develop technologies itself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As of 2015, WiLAN had more than 250 licencees.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Caxton-Margaret-of-York-Histoires de Troie.jpg|thumb|[[Presentation miniature|Presentation engraving]] showing [[William Caxton]] presenting a copy of ''Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye'' to [[Margaret of York]]]]
'''''Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye''''' or '''''Recueil des Histoires de Troye''''' (1464) is a translation by [[William Caxton]] of a French [[courtly romance]] written by [[Raoul Lefèvre]], chaplain to [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]]. It was the first book printed in the [[English language]].

''Recuyell'' (''recueil'' in Modern French) simply means "collection" in English. Hence, the work in Modern English would read "A Collection of the Histories of Troy". Caxton's translations and sometimes his titles incorporated words from other European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00138389108598759 | volume=72 | title=Aspects of vocabulary building in Caxton'sRecuyell of the Historyes of troy | journal=English Studies | pages=328–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caxton, probably with the assistance of [[Colard Mansion]] and [[Johann Veldener]], printed his translation in 1473 or 1474&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?rn=24&amp;ti=recuyell+troye&amp;sort-order=rank|title=Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye|publisher=Copac|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (traditionally "ca. 1475") in [[Bruges]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Gordon Duff, ''The Printers, Stationers, and Bookbinders of Westminster and London from 1476 to 1535'', New York: Arno Press, 1977, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Just 18 copies still exist, and when the [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] sold one in 2014, it fetched more than £1 million.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-28344300 "First printed book in English sold for over £1m"], 17 July 2014, BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

A presentation copy of the first edition with a specially made engraving showing Caxton presenting the book to [[Margaret of York]] is now in the [[Huntington Library]], California, having previously been in the collections of the [[Duke of Roxburghe]] and the [[Duke of Devonshire]]. This royal "patronage" may have been more a form of advertising than a representation of traditional medieval patronage relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See Rutter | first1 = Russell | year = 1987 | title = William Caxton and Literary Patronage | url = | journal = Studies in Philology | volume = 84 | issue = 4| pages = 440–470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English translation forms the source for the late [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[morality play]] ''[[Horestes]]'' (1567).&lt;ref&gt;Farnham (1936), p. 259 and Bevington (1962), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red Pitaya''' is an [[open-source hardware]] project intended to be alternative for many expensive laboratory measurement and control instruments.

==Description==
The core selling point is inclusion of 2x 125MS/s [[RF]] input and 2x 125MS/s RF outputs, with 50&amp;nbsp;MHz analogue bandwidth and 14 bit [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s. The software includes oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, signal generator, LCR meter (the LCR add on costs an additional 400 euros), and 50&amp;nbsp;MHz 2x2 MIMO PID controller. It can be re-programmed to become other devices, as all the IO ports are connected to a common [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA). There are also auxiliary ADC (250kS/s) and digital IO.&lt;ref name="IBRAHIM"&gt;{{cite book |title=Explore, experiment, program Red Pitaya for test &amp; measurement |last=Ibrahim |first=Dogan |date=2016 |publisher=Elektor International Media BV |location=London, UK |isbn=978-1-907920-53-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Radio User |last=Richards |first=Mike |date=July 2016 |title=Pi Updates and Red Pitaya |pages=17 |issn=1748-8117 |publisher=PW Publishing Ltd |location= Bournemouth, UK |volume=11 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has three [[USB 2.0]] ports, [[Wifi]], [[Ethernet]] connector. Internally, it uses [[Linux]] as operating system. The mass storage device for the operating system is a [[micro-SD]] card.

Due to the wide bandwidth of the ADC and DAC, the Red Pitaya can be used as a [[software defined radio]] receiver and transmitter and in other radio frequency applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Radio User |last=Richards |first=Mike |date=August 2016 |title=Red Pitaya as a VNA (vector network analyser) |pages=18–21 |issn=1748-8117 |publisher=PW Publishing Ltd |location= Bournemouth, UK |volume=11 |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HAMLAB, a fully featured SDR HF [[tranceiver]] with an output power of 10 W based on the Red Pitaya board is expected to be released in the [[amateur radio]] market in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamlab.redpitaya.com HAMLAB web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the software (including [[hardware description language|HDL]] source code) for this project is made freely available, the device is not a fully [[Open-source hardware|Open Source Hardware]] project, because the device's electrical schematics are not made openly available.

Meinrath was born in [[New Haven]], Connecticut. He received his Bachelor of Arts in [[Psychology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1997, and a   Masters of Arts in Social-Ecological Psychology from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

In 2004 Meinrath worked as a policy analyst for [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], a national media reform organization. In 2007 he moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], to become the Research Director of the Wireless Futures Program at the [[New America Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newamerica.net/pressroom/2007/sascha_meinrath_named_research_director_new_america_foundations_wireless_future_program "Sascha Meinrath Named Research Director of New America Foundation's Wireless Future Program,"] ''New America Foundation'' (August 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Open Technology Institute==
Meinrath launched the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation in 2008 to "serve as a hub of impartial research, open discourse, innovative fieldwork, and new tech development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New America Foundation Launches Open Technology Institute|url=http://newamerica.net/pressroom/2012/new_america_foundation_launches_open_technology_institute|publisher=New America Foundation|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although  based in Washington, DC, staff extend to both coast of the United States as well as advisors and fellows in Europe.  Major projects include Measurement Lab and Commotion Wireless. In naming Meinrath to the Digital Power Index Top 100 Influencers Newsweek highlighted the Open Technology Institute's efforts to develop open-source, low-cost community wireless networks, particularly in underserved areas.&lt;ref name="Digital Power Index"/&gt;

===Measurement Lab===
Together with [[Google]] and a wide range of academics, researchers and institutions, Meinrath launched Measurement Lab (M-Lab), an open, distributed server platform for researchers to deploy Internet measurement tools founded in 2009.  The project has grown to have 99 servers at two-dozen locations around the globe supporting a range of broadband and [[computer networking]] measurement tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measurement Lab About|url=http://www.measurementlab.net/content/about-measurement-lab|accessdate=2 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622112312/http://www.measurementlab.net/content/about-measurement-lab|archivedate=22 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest measurement platform of its kind in the world, Measurement Lab currently collects 500 [[Gigabyte]]s of data daily.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} All the data collected by M-Lab is made available to the research community.

===Commotion Wireless===
Commotion, is an open source “device-as-infrastructure” communication platform that integrates users’ existing cell phones, Wi-Fi enabled computers, and other wireless-capable devices to create community- and metro-scale, peer-to-peer communications networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commotion Wireless|url=http://commotionwireless.net/|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project builds on existing mesh wireless technologies and gained widespread attention when, in 2011, the State Department announced funding for Commotion to lower barriers for building distributed communications networks. The project has been described as the "Internet in a Suitcase" by the New York Times."[[Internet in a Suitcase]]".&lt;ref name="GlanzMarkoff"/&gt; Community wireless networks have been deployed with local community organizations in communities such as Philadelphia, Detroit and Brooklyn in the United States as well as Dahanu and Dharamshala, India, and Somaliland, Ethiopia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Technology Initiative: How Geeks, Wonks, &amp; Field Operatives are Fighting to Transform Inside-the-Beltway Policy-Making|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2011/07/meinrath|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Commotion was deployed with Occupy DC as well in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singel|first=Ryan|title=U.S.-Funded Internet Liberation Project Finds Perfect Test Site: Occupy D.C.|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/internet-suitcase-dc/all/|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=12/15/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zandt|first=Deanna|title=What Sandy Has Taught Us About Technology, Relief and Resilience|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2012/11/10/what-sandy-has-taught-us-about-technology-relief-and-resilience/|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=11/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to SOPA and PIPA==
[[File:Sascha D. Meinrath with California Congressman (R) Darrell Issa.jpg|thumbnail|Meinrath and Issa at Internet Defense League DC Launch]]Meinrath was a leading voice against the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA) and the [[Protect IP Act]] (PIPA). He highlighted the human rights concerns raised by legislation including the likely collective punishment resulting from empowering law enforcement to take down an entire domain due to something posted on a single blog, as well as the implications for Internet freedom policies.&lt;ref name="The Internet's Intolerable Acts"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technocracy/2011/12/stop_online_piracy_act_and_protect_ip_act_a_pair_of_bills_that_threaten_internet_freedom_.html |title=The Internet's Intolerable Acts |author=James Losey &amp; Sascha Meinrath |publisher=Slate Magazine |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In naming Meinrath to their Digital Power Index Top 100 Influencers, Newsweek noted his role as “one of the more prominent Internet culture leaders” to fight against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT IP Act.&lt;ref name="Digital Power Index"/&gt; Following the defeat of SOPA and PIPA, Meinrath hosted the Washington, DC launch party for the [[Internet Defense League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Maxxum|title=Sascha D.

[[Image:Sheraton chair.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A '''Sheraton style''' chair with rectangular back]]
'''Sheraton '''is a late 18th-century [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[English furniture]] style, in vogue ''ca'' 1785 - 1820, that was coined by 19th century collectors and dealers to credit furniture designer [[Thomas Sheraton]], born in [[Stockton-on-Tees]], [[England]] in 1751 and whose books, "The Cabinet Dictionary" (1803) of engraved designs and the "Cabinet Maker's &amp; Upholsterer's Drawing Book" (1791) of furniture patterns exemplify this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9UQDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;dq=sheraton+furniture+style&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVufKntb7dAhVJON8KHWUgCAMQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=sheraton%20furniture%20style&amp;f=false|title=The Furniture of the Georgian Period - From 1715 through Chippendale, Hepplewhite, Sheraton and the Regency With Notes on the French Epoch|last=Anon|date=2016-08-26|publisher=Read Books Ltd|isbn=9781473357600|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oH3WBSHc628C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=sheraton+furniture+style&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVufKntb7dAhVJON8KHWUgCAMQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=sheraton%20furniture%20style&amp;f=false|title=Thomas Sheraton's Classical Revival Furniture Designs|last=Sheraton|first=Thomas|date=2013-04-02|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486142685|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Sheraton style was inspired by the [[Louis XVI style]] and features round tapered legs, fluting and most notably contrasting veneer inlays. Sheraton style furniture takes lightweight rectilinear forms, using [[satinwood]], [[mahogany]] and tulipwood, sycamore and rosewood for inlaid decorations, though painted finishes and brass fittings are also to be found. Swags, husks, flutings, festoons, and rams' heads are amongst the common motifs applied to pieces of this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6dW-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=sheraton+furniture+style&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF2MLNt77dAhWwnuAKHVKcAN04FBDoAQhDMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=sheraton%20furniture%20style&amp;f=false|title=Early American Decorative Arts, 1620-1860: A Handbook for Interpreters|last=Krill|first=Rosemary Troy|date=2010-08-16|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=9780759119468|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without pedantic archaeology,{{huh|date=August 2017}} it brought the Neoclassical taste of architects like [[Robert Adam]] within reach of the middle class. In many respects Sheraton style corresponds with the contemporary [[Directoire (style)|Directoire]] style of France. The Sheraton style was the most reproduced style in the United States during the Federal period.

[[File:Solonoid valves.jpg|thumb|Solenoid valves.]]
A '''solenoid valve''' is an [[electromechanical]] device in which the [[solenoid]] uses an [[electric current]] to generate a [[magnetic field]] and thereby operate a [[Mechanism_(engineering)|mechanism]] which regulates the opening of fluid flow in a [[valve]].

Solenoid valves differ in the characteristics of the electric current they use, the strength of the magnetic field they generate, the mechanism they use to regulate the fluid, and the type and characteristics of fluid they control. The mechanism varies from linear action, plunger-type [[actuator|actuators]] to pivoted-armature actuators and rocker actuators. The valve can use a two-port design to regulate a flow or use a three or more port design to switch flows between ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a [[Hydraulic manifold|manifold]].

Solenoid valves are the most frequently used control elements in [[fluidics]]. Their tasks are to shut off, release, dose, distribute or mix fluids. They are found in many application areas. Solenoids offer fast and safe switching, high reliability, long service life, good medium compatibility of the materials used, low control power and compact design.

== Operation ==
There are many valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A 2-way valve, for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is '''open''', then the two ports are connected and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is '''closed''', then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally open''' (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally closed'''.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201311/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also 3-way and more complicated designs.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225122854/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to either of the two other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).

Solenoid valves are also characterized by how they operate. A small solenoid can generate a limited force. If that force is sufficient to open and close the valve, then a '''direct acting''' solenoid valve is possible. An approximate relationship between the required solenoid force ''F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the fluid pressure ''P'', and the orifice area ''A'' for a direct acting solenoid valve is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asconumatics.eu/images/site/upload/_en/pdf1/00022gb.pdf |format=PDF|page=V030-1|title=The relation ignores the dynamic head|website=Asconumatics.eu|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_s = P A = P \pi d^2 / 4&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''d'' is the orifice diameter. A typical solenoid force might be {{convert|15|N|abbr=on}}. An application might be a low pressure (e.g., {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}}) gas with a small orifice diameter (e.g., {{convert|3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} for an orifice area of {{convert|0.11|in2|m2|abbr=on}} and approximate force of {{convert|1.1|lbf|N|abbr=on}}).

[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|The solenoid valve (small black box at the top of the photo) with input air line (small green tube) used to actuate a larger [[rack and pinion]] [[actuator]] (gray box) which controls the water pipe valve.]]
When high pressures and large orifices are encountered, then high forces are required. To generate those forces, an '''internally piloted''' solenoid valve design may be possible.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt; In such a design, the line pressure is used to generate the high valve forces; a small solenoid controls how the line pressure is used. Internally piloted valves are used in dishwashers and irrigation systems where the fluid is water, the pressure might be {{convert|80|psi|abbr=on}} and the orifice diameter might be {{convert|3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

In some solenoid valves the solenoid acts directly on the main valve. Others use a small, complete solenoid valve, known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve. While the second type is actually a solenoid valve combined with a pneumatically actuated valve, they are sold and packaged as a single unit referred to as a solenoid valve. Piloted valves require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power for a short period of time to open it, and only low power to hold it.

A direct acting solenoid valve typically operates in 5 to 10 milliseconds. The operation time of a piloted valve depends on its size; typical values are 15 to 150 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"/&gt;

Power consumption and supply requirements of the solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4" 150 psi sprinkler valve, intended for 24 VAC (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/d6/d6964dee-5165-4616-b043-0eb0e7a765c6.pdf|title = Orbit 3/4 150 PSI Sprinkler|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = homedepot|publisher = Home Depot|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, an industrial 1/2" 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in high pressure fluid and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.omega.com/green/pdf/SVH-110.pdf|title = Omega High Pressure Solenoid Valve SVH-111/SVH-112 Series|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = omega|publisher = Omega|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither valve lists a minimum pressure required to remain closed in the un-powered state.

===Internally piloted===
While there are multiple design variants, the following is a detailed breakdown of a typical solenoid valve design.

A solenoid valve has two main parts: the solenoid and the valve.  The solenoid converts electrical energy into mechanical energy which, in turn, opens or closes the valve mechanically. A direct acting valve has only a small flow circuit, shown within section '''E''' of this diagram (this section is mentioned below as a pilot valve).  In this example, a diaphragm piloted valve multiplies this small pilot flow, by using it to control the flow through a much larger orifice.  

Solenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and may also have electrical interfaces to allow for easy control.  A [[Spring (device)|spring]] may be used to hold the valve opened (normally open) or closed (normally closed) while the valve is not activated.
[[Image:Solenoid Valve.svg|thumbnail|right|360px| A- Input side&lt;BR&gt;
B- Diaphragm&lt;BR&gt;
C- Pressure chamber&lt;BR&gt;
D- Pressure relief passage&lt;BR&gt;
E- Electro Mechanical Solenoid&lt;BR&gt;
F- Output side]]

The diagram to the right shows the design of a basic valve, controlling the flow of water in this example. At the top figure is the valve in its closed state.  The water under pressure enters at '''A'''. '''B''' is an elastic diaphragm and above it is a weak spring pushing it down.  The diaphragm has a pinhole through its center which allows a very small amount of water to flow through it. This water fills the cavity '''C''' on the other side of the diaphragm so that pressure is equal on both sides of the diaphragm, however the compressed spring supplies a net downward force. The spring is weak and is only able to close the inlet because water pressure is equalized on both sides of the diaphragm.

Once the diaphragm closes the valve, the pressure on the outlet side of its bottom is reduced, and the greater pressure above holds it even more firmly closed.  Thus, the spring is irrelevant to holding the valve closed.

The above all works because the small drain passage '''D''' was blocked by a pin which is the armature of the [[solenoid]] '''E''' and which is pushed down by a spring.  If current is passed through the solenoid, the pin is withdrawn via magnetic force, and the water in chamber ''C'' drains out the passage ''D'' faster than the pinhole can refill it.  The pressure in chamber '''C''' drops and the incoming pressure lifts the diaphragm, thus opening the main valve. Water now flows directly from '''A''' to '''F'''.  

When the solenoid is again deactivated and the passage '''D''' is closed again, the spring needs very little force to push the diaphragm down again and the main valve closes. In practice there is often no separate spring; the elastomer diaphragm is molded so that it functions as its own spring, preferring to be in the closed shape.

From this explanation it can be seen that this type of valve relies on a differential of pressure between input and output as the pressure at the input must always be greater than the pressure at the output for it to work.  Should the pressure at the output, for any reason, rise above that of the input then the valve would open regardless of the state of the solenoid and pilot valve.

==Components==

The core tube encloses the plugnut, the core spring, and the core.

Solenoid valve designs have many variations and challenges.

*Solenoid subassembly

The core or plunger is the magnetic component that moves when the solenoid is energized. The core is coaxial with the solenoid. The core's movement will make or break the seals that control the movement of the fluid. When the coil is not energized, springs will hold the core in its normal position.

The plugnut is also coaxial.&lt;!-- explain reason for plugnut; why not just one longer core. --&gt;

The core tube contains and guides the core. It also retains the plugnut and may seal the fluid. To optimize the movement of the core, the core tube needs to be nonmagnetic.  If the core tube were magnetic, then it would offer a shunt path for the field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skinner Valve|1997|p=128}}, stating "The tube is made of non-magnetic material to make certain that the flux is directed through the plunger rather than around it."&lt;/ref&gt; In some designs, the core tube is an enclosed metal shell produced by [[deep drawing]]. Such a design simplifies the sealing problems because the fluid cannot escape from the enclosure, but the design also increases the magnetic path resistance because the magnetic path must traverse the thickness of the core tube twice: once near the plugnut and once near the core. In some other designs, the core tube is not closed but rather an open tube that slips over one end of the plugnut. To retain the plugnut, the tube might be crimped to the plugnut. An O-ring seal between the tube and the plugnut will prevent the fluid from escaping.

The solenoid coil consists of many turns of copper wire that surround the core tube and induce the movement of the core. The coil is often encapsulated in epoxy.  The coil also has an iron frame that provides a low magnetic path resistance.&lt;!-- explain this more. Force related to size of the gap. --&gt;
&lt;!-- AC/DC issues --&gt;

===Materials===
The valve body must be compatible with the fluid; common materials are brass, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Skinner Valve |title=Two-Way, Three-Way and Four-Way Solenoid Valves |id=Catalog CFL00897 |publisher=[[Parker Hannifin]] |year=1997 |url=http://www.surmaq.com/html/cata/parker/contr/skinner.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p.&amp;nbsp;128&lt;/ref&gt;

The seals must be compatible with the fluid.

To simplify the sealing issues, the plugnut, core, springs, shading ring, and other components are often exposed to the fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The core tube needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. [[Stainless steel]]s can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf|format=PDF|page=450f|title=States, "Internal parts in contact with fluids are of non-magnetic 300 and magnetic 400 series stainless steel."|website=Controlandpower.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the core tube, 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheettext.aspx?matguid=d1fcb0f0cca340a4aa9068d6af5e6606|title=Crucible Steel 430F Stainless Steel|website=Matweb.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for the core and plugnut.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt;

== Types ==
Many variations are possible on the basic, one-way, one-solenoid valve described above:
* one- or two-solenoid valves;
* [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]] powered;
* different number of ways and positions;

==Common uses==
Solenoid valves are used in [[fluid power]] pneumatic and hydraulic systems, to control cylinders, fluid power motors or larger industrial valves. Automatic [[irrigation sprinkler]] systems also use solenoid valves with an automatic [[Controller (irrigation)|controller]]. Domestic [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwasher]]s use solenoid valves to control water entry into the machine. They are also often used in paintball gun triggers to actuate the CO2 hammer valve. Solenoid valves are usually referred to simply as "solenoids." 

Solenoid valves can be used for a wide array of industrial applications, including general on-off control, calibration and test stands, pilot plant control loops, process control systems, and various original equipment manufacturer applications. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcor.com/scientific-and-industrial/general-purpose-solenoid-valves/|title=General Purpose Solenoid Valves - Valcor Engineering|website=Valcor.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and commercial development==
In 1910, [[ASCO Numatics]] became the first company to develop and manufacture the solenoid valve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.digitalwavepublishing.com/pubs/NWM/maritimereporter/20060202/?pgno=26 | title=Propelling W&amp;O Supply to New Heights | author=Trauthwein, Greg | journal=Maritime Reporter |date=February 2006 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://valveproducts.net/asco/a-history-of-asco | title=A History of ASCO |website=Valveproducts.net  |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5670">'''Solving the E-waste Problem''' ('''StEP''') is an international initiative, created to develop solutions to address issues associated with Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment [[Electronic waste|(WEEE)]]. 
Some of the most eminent players in the fields of Production, Reuse and Recycling of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE), government agencies and NGOs as well as UN Organisations count themselves among its members. StEP encourages the collaboration of all stakeholders connected with e-waste, emphasising a holistic, scientific yet applicable approach to the problem.

==History==
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is increasing every day. The volume of WEEE is becoming a serious environmental problem that has yet to become recognised by the greater public. To guarantee the neutrality required to give analysis and recommendations the necessary credibility, StEP has been started.
After a starting period of three years, initiated by the United Nations University [[United Nations University|UNU]], promotion team wetzlar and [[Hewlett-Packard]], the StEP Initiative had its official launch in March 2007.

==Aims and means==
“One of the most important aims of the StEP Initiative is to elaborate a set of global guidelines for the treatment of e-waste and the promotion of sustainable material recycling” [https://web.archive.org/web/20070714152403/http://www.step-initiative.org/getfile.php?id=63&amp;file_id=1 Press communiqué of the initiative] 

The initiative comprises five cooperating task forces, each addressing specific aspects of e-waste, while covering the entire life-cycle of electric and electronic equipment. In all its activities, the initiative places emphasis on working with policy-making bodies to allow results from its research to impact current practices. StEP is being coordinated by the science and research body of the UN System, the United Nations University (UNU).
The long-term goal of StEP “is to develop – based on scientific analysis – a globally accepted standard for the refurbishment, recycling of e-waste. Herewith, StEP’s aim is to reduce dangers to humans and the environment, which result from inadequate and irresponsible treatment practices, and advance resource efficiency.” (Ruediger Kuehr, Executive Secretary of the StEP Initiative). To achieve this, StEP conceives and implements projects based on the results of multidisciplinary dialogues. The projects seek to develop sustainable solutions that reduce environmental risk and enhance development.

==Organization of the initiative==

The supreme body of the StEP Initiative is its general assembly, which decides its general direction and development. This general assembly is based on a memorandum of understanding, which is signed by all members and states the guiding principles of StEP. A Secretariat, hosted by the UNU in Bonn, is mandated with the accomplishment of the day-to-day managerial work of the initiative. A steering committee, composed of representatives from key stakeholders, monitors the progress of the initiative.
The core work is accomplished by the five task forces (TF): “Policy”, “ReDesign”, “ReUse”, “ReCycle” and “Capacity Building”.  These task forces conduct research and analysis in their respective domains and seek to implement innovative projects.

TF 1 – Policy: The aim of this task force is to assess and analyse current governmental approaches and regulations related to WEEE. Starting from this analysis, recommendations for future regulating activities shall be formulated.

TF2 – ReDesign: This task force works on the design of EEE, focusing on the reduction of negative consequences of electrical and electronic appliances throughout their entire life cycle. The task force especially takes heed of the situation in developing countries.

TF3 – ReUse: The focus of this task force lies in the development of sustainable, transmissible principles and standards for the reuse of EEE.

TF4 – ReCycle: The objective of this task force is to improve infrastructures, systems and technologies to realize a sustainable recycling on a global level.

TF5 – Capacity Building: The aim of this task force is to draw attention to the problems connected to WEEE. This aim shall be achieved by making the results of the research of the task forces and other stakeholders publicly available. In doing so, the task force relies on personal networks, the internet, collaborative working tools etc. 



'''''Guiding Principles'''''

"''1. StEP’s work is founded on scientific assessments and incorporates a comprehensive view of the social, environmental and economic aspects of e-waste.

''2. StEP conducts research on the entire life-cycle of electronic and electrical equipment and their corresponding global supply, process and material flows.''

''3. StEP’s research and pilot projects are meant to contribute to the solution of e-waste problems.''

''4. StEP condemns all illegal activities related to e-waste including illegal shipments and reuse/ recycling practices that are harmful to the environment and human health.''

''5. StEP seeks to foster safe and eco/energy-efficient reuse and recycling practices around the globe in a socially responsible manner.''"

{{primary sources|date=May 2014}}
The '''Standard Industrial Classification''' (SIC) is a system for classifying [[industry|industries]] by a four-digit code. Established in the [[United States]] in 1937, it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. The SIC system is also used by agencies in other countries, e.g., by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Companies House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/sic/sic2007.shtml|title=SIC 2007|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the SIC code is being supplanted by the six-digit [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS code), which was released in 1997; however certain government departments and agencies, such as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), still use the SIC codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/|title=North American Industry Classification System|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIC codes can be grouped into progressively broader industry classifications: industry group, major group, and division. The first 3 digits of the SIC code indicate the industry group, and the first two digits indicate the major group. Each division encompasses a range of SIC codes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html|title=SIC Division Structure|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehso.com/siccodes.php|title=The Entire SIC Code Listing - Free from EHSO|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To look at a particular example of the hierarchy, SIC code 2024 (ice cream and frozen desserts) belongs to industry group 202 (dairy products), which is part of major group 20 (food and kindred products), which belongs to the division of manufacturing.

==Purpose==
In the early 1900s, each branch of a United States government agency would conduct business analysis using its own methods and metrics, unknown and meaningless to other branches. In the 1930s, the government needed standardized and meaningful ways in which to measure, analyze and share data across its various agencies. Thus, the Standard Industrial Classification system was born. SIC codes are four-digit numerical representations of major businesses and industries. SIC codes are assigned based on common characteristics shared in the products, services, production and delivery system of a business.

==Structure== 
SIC codes have a hierarchical, top-down structure that begins with general characteristics and narrows down to the specifics. The first two digits of the code represent the major industry sector to which a business belongs. The third and fourth digits describe the sub-classification of the business group and specialization, respectively. For example, "36" refers to a business that deals in "Electronic and Other Equipment." Adding "7" as a third digit to get "367" indicates that the business operates in "Electronic, Component and Accessories." The fourth digit distinguishes the specific industry sector, so a code of "3672" indicates that the business is concerned with "Printed Circuit Boards."

==Uses==
The [[U.S. Census Bureau]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], [[Internal Revenue Service]] and [[Social Security Administration]] utilize SIC codes in their reporting, although SIC codes are also used in academic and business sectors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics updates the codes every three years and uses SIC to report on work force, wages and pricing issues. The Social Security Administration assigns SIC codes to businesses based on the descriptions provided by employers under the primary business activity entry on employer ID applications.

==Limitations==
Over the years, the U.S. Census has identified three major limitations to using the SIC system. The first limitation surrounds its definition and mistaken classification of employee groups. For example, administrative assistants in the automotive industry support all levels of the business, yet the SIC defines these employees as part of the "Basic Sector" of manufacturing jobs when they should be reported as "Non-Basic." Secondly, SIC codes were developed for traditional industries prior to 1970. Business has changed considerably since then from manufacturing-based to mostly service-based. As a result, and thirdly the SIC has been slow to recognize new and emerging industries, such as those in the technology sector.

==History of the change to NAICS==
The [[Office of Management and Budget]], or OMB, was tasked with revising the SIC system to reflect changing economic conditions. The OMB established the [[Economic Classification Policy Committee]] in 1992 to develop a new system representative of the current industrial climate. The result was the [[North American Industrial Classification System]], or NAICS, a collaborative effort between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. NAICS expanded the four-digit SIC code to a six-digit code, and it provided more flexibility in handling emerging industries. The new code was implemented in Canada and the United States in 1997 and in Mexico one year later.

==List of codes==
The following table is from the SEC's website, which allows searching for companies by SIC code in its database of filings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/siccodes.htm|title=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SIC Code List|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym NEC stands for "not elsewhere classified".

'''Standard components''' is a [[food technology]] term, when manufacturers buy in a standard component they would use a pre-made product in the production of their food.
They help products to be the same in consistency, they are quick and easy to use in batch production of food products.
Some examples are pre-made [[stock]] cubes, [[marzipan]], icing, ready made pastry.

==Usage==
Manufacturers use standard components as they save time and sometimes cost a lot less and it also helps with consistency in products.
If a manufacturer is to use a standard component from another supplier it is essential that a precise and accurate specification is produced by the manufacturer so that the component meets the standards set by the manufacturer.

===Advantages===

*Saves preparation time.
*Fewer steps in the production process
*Less effort and skill required by staff
*Less machinery and equipment needed
*Good quality
*Saves money from all aspects
*Can be bought in bulk
*High-quality consistency 
*Food preparation is hygienic

===Disadvantages===
*Can be expensive
*Have to rely on other manufacturers to supply products
*Fresh ingredients may taste better
*May require special storage conditions
*Less reliable than doing it yourself
*Cost more to make 
*Can't control the nutritional value of the product 
*There is a larger risk of cross contamination.

'''[[Steelcase]]''' is a [[United States]]-based furniture company founded in 1912 in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. The company produces office furniture, architectural and technology products for [[office]] environments and the [[Higher education|education]], [[Health care industry|health care]] and [[retail]] industries.

==History==
[[Image:Steelcase Pyramid 2008.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The Steelcase Corporate Development Center near Grand Rapids, Michigan: opened in 1989 at a cost of $111 million, vacated by Steelcase in 2010, sold for $7.5 million in 2014 &amp;mdash; and as of 2016, sold to [[Switch (company)|Switch]] as a datacenter. &lt;br&gt;{{Coord|42.8523|N|85.5603|W|}}]]
Steelcase was founded as the Metal Office Furniture Company in 1912 by Peter M. Wege in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wege was a veteran of the [[sheet metal]] and [[fireproofing]] industry and had filed approximately 25 [[patent]]s prior to starting the company. The Metal Office Furniture Company's first products included fireproof metal [[safe]]s and four-drawer [[filing cabinet]]s, which Wege invented and manufactured for the Macey Company.&lt;ref name=Lovell03&gt;{{cite book |title=Peter Martin Wege: A Biography |author=Susan Lovell |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Generations Publishing |location=Pontiac, Michigan |isbn= |page= |pages=21–29 |url= |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Victor-Wastebasket.png|thumb|left|Victor wastebasket]]
In 1914, the company received its first product patent for "The Victor," a fireproof steel wastebasket. The Victor gained popularity due to its light weight—achieved through a patented process of bending flat steel at right angles to create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when [[smoking]] was common indoors, particularly in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Architecture12&gt;{{cite news |title=Steelcase Turns 100 |author= |url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/furniture/steelcase-anniversary.aspx |work=[[Architecture (magazine)|Architecture]] |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dybis12&gt;{{cite news |title=100 Years &amp; Building:Steelcase CEO Guides Vision for Future |author=Karen Dybis |url=http://www.corpmagazine.com/features/cover-stories/100-years-buildingsteelcase-ceo-guides-vision-for-future/ |work=Corp!

[[File:Super Bit Mapping (SBM) logo.gif|frame|right|Super Bit Mapping (SBM) logo.]]
'''Super Bit Mapping''' ('''SBM''') is a [[noise shaping]] process, developed by [[Sony]] for [[Compact Disc|CD]] [[Audio mastering|mastering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Digital audio technology: a guide to CD, MiniDisc, SACD, DVD(A), MP3 and DAT. |last1= Maes |first1= Jan |last2= Vercammen |first2= Marc |last3= Baert |first3= Luc |edition= 4th |year= 2001 |publisher= Focal Press |isbn= 978-0-240-51654-7 |pages= 60–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony claims that the Super Bit Mapping process converts a 20-[[bit]] signal from [[audio mastering|master recording]] into a 16-bit signal nearly without sound quality loss, using noise shaping to improve [[signal to noise ratio]] over the frequency bands most acutely perceived by human hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Super Bit Mapping Technical Overview |url=http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/STARINMANUALS/Sony%20Audio/Manuals/White%20Paper%20-%20Super%20Bit%20Mapping.pdf |publisher=Sony |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audible quantization error is reduced by [[noise shaping]] the error according to an [[equal-loudness contour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |title=Quantizing error reducer for audio signal |country-code=US |patent-number=5204677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This processing takes place in dedicated hardware inside the recording device. A similar process is used in Sony's [[Direct Stream Digital|DSD]] to PCM conversion and is called SBM Direct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5660">'''System programming''' (or '''systems programming''') is the activity of programming&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[computer]] [[system software]]. The primary distinguishing characteristic of systems programming when compared to [[application programming]] is that application programming aims to produce software which provides services to the user directly (e.g. [[word processor]]), whereas systems programming aims to produce software and [[software platform]]s which provide services to other software, are performance constrained, or both (e.g. [[operating system]]s, [[computational science]] applications, [[game engine]]s and [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA video game]]s, [[Automation#Industrial automation|industrial automation]], and [[software as a service]] applications).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Panel: Systems Programming in 2014 and Beyond|url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Panel-Systems-Programming-Languages-in-2014-and-Beyond|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

System programming requires a great degree of hardware awareness. Its goal is to achieve efficient use of available resources, either because the software itself is performance critical (AAA video games) or because even small efficiency improvements directly transform into significant monetary savings for the service provider (cloud based word processors).

== Overview ==

The following attributes characterize systems programming:
* The [[programmer]] can make assumptions about the hardware and other properties of the system that the program runs on, and will often exploit those properties, for example by using an [[algorithm]] that is known to be efficient when used with specific hardware.
* Usually a [[low-level programming language]] or programming language dialect is used so that:
** Programs can operate in resource-constrained environments
** Programs written to be efficient with little [[Run-time system|runtime]] overhead, they may have a small [[runtime library]], or none at all
** Programs may use direct and "raw" control over memory access and [[control flow]]
** The programmer may write parts of the program directly in [[assembly language]]
* Often systems programs cannot be run in a [[debugger]]. Running the program in a [[computer simulation|simulated environment]] can sometimes be used to reduce this problem.

Systems programming is sufficiently different from application programming that programmers tend to specialize in one or the other.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In system programming, often limited programming facilities are available. The use of [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]] is not common and [[debugging]] is sometimes hard to do. The [[runtime library]], if available at all, is usually far less powerful, and does less error checking. Because of those limitations, [[System monitoring|monitoring]] and [[data logging|logging]] are often used; [[operating system]]s may have extremely elaborate logging subsystems.

Implementing certain parts in operating systems and networking requires systems programming, for example implementing paging ([[virtual memory]]) or a [[device driver]] for an operating system.

== History ==
Originally systems programmers invariably wrote in [[assembly language]]. Experiments with hardware support in [[high level languages]] in the late 1960s led to such languages as [[IBM PL/S|PL/S]], [[BLISS]], [[BCPL]], and extended [[ALGOL]] for [[Burroughs large systems]]. [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] also has applications as a systems language. 
In the 1980s, [[C (programming language)|C]] became ubiquitous, aided by the growth of [[Unix]].
More recently a subset of [[C++]] called [[Embedded C++]] has seen some use, for instance it is used in the [[I/O Kit]] drivers of [[macOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Apple Inc|title=I/O Kit Device Driver Design Guidelines|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/WritingDeviceDriver/CPluPlusRuntime/CPlusPlusRuntime.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000695-BAJIBFDE|website=developer.apple.com|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=16 September 2014|date=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternate usage ==
For historical reasons, some organizations use the term ''systems programmer'' to describe a job function which would be more accurately termed [[systems administrator]].  This is particularly true in organizations whose computer resources have historically been dominated by [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s, although the term is even used to describe job functions which do not involve mainframes. This usage arose because administration of [[IBM mainframes]] often involved the writing of custom [[assembler code]] ([[IBM Basic assembly language and successors|IBM's Basic Assembly Language]]  (BAL)), which integrated with the [[operating system]] such as [[OS/MVS]], [[DOS/VSE]] or [[VM/CMS]].  Indeed, some [[IBM]] software products had substantial code contributions from customer programming staff. This type of programming is progressively less common, but the term ''systems programmer'' is still the de facto job title for staff directly administering IBM mainframes.

{{Nihongo|'''Takaaki Kidani'''|木谷 高明|Kidani Takaaki|born June 6, 1960}} is a Japanese businessman born in [[Kanazawa]], [[Japan]]. He is the founder and president of the [[Bushiroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = 木谷高明 初の著書「煽動者 ～徹底プロモーション 仕掛人の哲学～」| accessdate = 2014-08-01| url = http://hobbyjapan.co.jp/kidani/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidani has also served as the chairman of [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW). He continues to be involved with NJPW through Bushiroad, which owns the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = 新日本プロレス木谷高明取締役会長が辞意を表明。「これからはブシロードグループとして外側からサポートして行く」| accessdate = 2017-01-19| url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/45498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Early life===
After Kidani graduated from [[Musashi University]] with a degree in economics, he worked at [[Yamaichi Securities]]. He handled American duties.

===After the Establishment of Broccoli===
Kidani retired from [[Yamaichi Securities]] in 1994. In March 25 of the same year, he founded [[Broccoli (company)|Broccoli]] as a [[startup company]]. At first, his business focused on event management, but from 1994 to 1998, he started Comic Castle for [[dōjinshi]]. In 1996, he established his first chain of retail stores {{ill|Gamers Ltd.|lt=Gamers|ja|ゲーマーズ}}. His company has its center focus on anime and video games. Their company performance increased after producing the anime series [[Di Gi Charat]] and his company was then listed on the [[JASDAQ Securities Exchange]].

===After the Establishment of Bushiroad===
He founded Bushiroad in May 2007 as a company that produces card games and assumed the position of president. The origin of the name Bushiroad comes from the failure to make ''[[Neppu Kairiku Bushi Road]]'' into a film due to various reasons when he led the project in the days of Broccoli. The film was restarted in March 2013 with Kidani as the executive producer.

On October 2, 2017, Bushiroad announced that Kidani would be stepping down as the company's [[Representative Director (Japan)|Representative Director]] on October 20 and joining its [[board of directors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://bushiroad.co.jp/information/3 | title = 代表木谷の代表取締役退任について | date=2017-10-02 | accessdate=2017-10-04 | work=[[Bushiroad]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Capitalism}}
'''Technocapitalism''' (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "[[technology]]" and "[[capitalism]]") refers to changes in capitalism associated with the emergence of new technology sectors, the power of [[corporation]]s, and new forms of organization.

==Corporate power and organization==
Luis Suarez-Villa, in his 2009 book ''Technocapitalism: A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism'' argues that it is a new version of capitalism that generates new forms of [[corporation|corporate organization]] designed to exploit ''intangibles'' such as [[creativity]] and new [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Luis Suarez-Villa, ''Technocapitalism: A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The new organizations, which he refers to as ''experimentalist organizations'' are deeply grounded in technological research, as opposed to manufacturing and services production.  They are also heavily dependent on the corporate appropriation of research outcomes as [[intellectual property]].

This approach is further developed by Suarez-Villa in his 2012 book ''Globalization and Technocapitalism: The Political Economy of Corporate Power and Technological Domination'', in which he relates the emergence of technocapitalism to [[globalization]] and to the growing power of technocapitalist [[corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Luis Suarez-Villa, ''Globalization and Technocapitalism: The Political Economy of Corporate Power and Technological Domination'' (London: Ashgate, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking into account the new relations of power introduced by the corporations that control technocapitalism, he considers new forms of accumulation involving intangibles—such as [[creativity]] and new [[knowledge]]—along with [[intellectual property]] and technological infrastructure.  This perspective on [[globalization]]—and the effect of technocapitalism and its corporations—also takes into account the growing global importance of intangibles, the inequalities created between nations at the vanguard of technocapitalism and those that are not, the increasing importance of [[brain-drain]] flows between nations, and the rise of what he refers to as a ''techno-military-corporate'' complex that is rapidly replacing the old [[military-industrial complex]] of the second half of the 20th century.  

The concept behind technocapitalism is part of a line of thought that relates [[science]] and [[technology]] to the evolution of [[capitalism]].  At the core of this idea of the evolution of capitalism is that science and technology are not divorced from society—or that they exist in a vacuum, or in a separate reality of their own—out of reach of social action and human decision.  Science and technology are part of society, and they are subject to the priorities of capitalism as much as any other human endeavor, if not more so.  Prominent scientists in the early 20th century, such as [[John Desmond Bernal|John Bernal]], posited that science has a social function, and cannot be seen as something apart from society.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Bernal, ''The Social Function of Science'' (New York: Macmillan, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scientists at that time, such as [[J. B. S. Haldane|John Haldane]], related science to social philosophy, and showed how critical approaches to social analysis are very relevant to science, and to our understanding of the need for science.&lt;ref&gt;John B. S. Haldane, ''Dialectical Materialism and Modern Science'' (London: Labour Monthly, 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;  In our time, this line of thought has encouraged philosophers such as [[Andrew Feenberg]] to adopt and apply a [[critical theory]] approach to technology and science, providing many important insights on how scientific and technological decisions—and their outcomes—are shaped by society, and by capitalism and its institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Feenberg, ''Critical Theory of Technology'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''technocapitalism'' has been used by one author to denote aspects and ideas that diverge sharply from those explained above. [[Dinesh D'Souza]], writing about [[Silicon Valley]] in an article, used the term to describe the corporate environment and [[venture capital]] relationships in a high tech-oriented local economy.  His approach to the topic was consonant with that of business journals and the corporate management literature.  Some newspaper articles have also used the term occasionally and in a very general sense, to denote the importance of advanced technologies in the economy.

The '''turn indicator stalk''' or '''turn signal lever''' is the control lever which operates the [[automotive lighting#Turn signals|turn signal or indicator lights]] on the front, sides and rear of the vehicle. It is usually operated by lifting or lowering the lever, the direction being commensurate with the clockwise or anticlockwise direction in which the steering wheel is about to be turned.

In [[right- and left-hand traffic|left hand drive]] (LHD) vehicles, the turn indicator stalks are usually located on the left of the steering column.

In right-hand-drive (RHD) [[motor vehicle]]s, the indicator stalk is located on either the left or right of the steering column, depending on the manufacturer. European RHD cars generally have the stalk on the left (often using the same component as LHD cars), while Asia-Pacific RHD cars generally have the stalk on the right (mirroring the configuration of a LHD vehicle). Some manufacturers such as [[Subaru]] still have variations in the model lineup as to where the turn indicator stalk is located.

==Innovations==
Many other functions have been added to the turn signal stalk. Frequently headlamps and high beam controls are integrated into the turn signal control, the former requiring either a twisting motion or the use of a small switch, and the latter requiring movement of the control fore and aft.

Many modern cars have a "one-touch" feature on their stalks. This is primarily based on (motorway) lane-switching, where a single flick of the indicator will cause it to flash between two and six times.

Some cars have forgone the traditional stalk-mounted indicators for either a switch (as used on a [[motorcycle]]) or a button. Examples are the [[Caterham 7]] and the [[Ferrari 458]].

Its tenants include departments from five academic institutions—[[Wake Forest School of Medicine]], [[Wake Forest University]], [[Forsyth Technical Community College]], [[Winston-Salem State University]], [[University of North Carolina School of the Arts|UNC School of the Arts]]— as well as private businesses and other organizations. One tenant is the [[Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine]] (WFIRM), which is working to engineer more than 30 different replacement tissues and organs and to develop healing cell therapies.&lt;ref name="WFIRM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.WakeHealth.edu/WFIRM |title=Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science and research conducted at WFIRM is behind two start-up companies at Innovation Quarter. The ability of researchers and scientists to work alongside entrepreneurs furthers a goal of Innovation Quarter to develop new treatments and cures for disease and advances in technology.

==History and Growth==

[[File:Wake Forest Innovations Lab Image.jpg|thumb]]The idea of a research park in Winston-Salem was a community-wide effort that began in the early 1990s in the wake of [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] closing many of its former downtown warehouse and manufacturing buildings. Wake Forest School of Medicine's Department of Physiology and Pharmacology moved into one former Reynolds warehouse in 1993, along with eight researchers from [[Winston-Salem State University]]. Civic committees and discussion led to a master plan being announced in 2002 for what was then called Piedmont Triad Research Park.

The first new building, One Technology Place, opened in 2000, occupied by Targacept Inc., a biopharmaceutical company that was spun out of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. The company developed drugs to treat nervous system diseases and disorders.

Biotech Place opened in February 2012. The 242,000-square-foot structure is composed of two former Reynolds warehouses that have been renovated into a modern biotech research facility, with custom-designed wet and labs as well as Class A office space. The $100 million project was Winston-Salem's most expensive ever downtown project;&lt;ref name=Downtown&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/article_3efcc9f2-d3f7-52be-a565-e51fad10222d.html |title=Wake Forest Biotech Place debuts in downtown Winston-Salem}}&lt;/ref&gt; it houses [[Wake Forest School of Medicine]]'s departments of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biomedical Engineering, and Immunology and Microbiology, as well as the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma. Private businesses—Carolina Liquid Chemistries, Allegacy Federal Credit Union, Brioche Doree cafe—also are tenants at Biotech Place.&lt;ref name=Tenants&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.WakeForestInnovationQuarter.com/ |title=Wake Forest Innovation Quarter website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Piedmont Triad Research Park was renamed in March 2013 as Wake Forest Innovation Quarter in recognition of the shift from biotechnology to a mix of biomedical and material sciences, information technology, and other health and communications fields.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/news/2013/03/11/now-wake-forest-innovation-quarter.html |title=As Wake Forest Innovation Quarter, research park hopes to raise profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 2014 saw [https://www.inmar.com Inmar Inc., an information technology company], move into another renovated former R.J. Reynolds building in the Innovation Quarter. [https://www.inmar.com Inmar] relocated 900 employees from other sites in Winston-Salem to its new, state-of-the-art headquarters. The company also announced a partnership with the Division of Public Health Sciences of Wake Forest School of Medicine in which Inmar's digital analytics will be used to help locate and enroll patients for clinical trials conducted by the school. The Division of Public Health Sciences in early 2015 completed a move into the Innovation Quarter, in a building called 525@vine. The 525@vine building is adjacent to Inmar's headquarters. The 525@vine building, a five-story R.J. Reynolds factory built in 1926 and renovated in 2012-13, also houses the School of Medicine's Physician Assistant program, as well as Forsyth Technical Community College’s Emerging Technologies Center, which trains more than 1,200 students annually.&lt;ref name=Inmar&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_beat/inmar-marks-downtown-move-with-parade-celebration/article_b8a205a0-b906-11e3-9e89-001a4bcf6878.html?mode=story/html |title=Inmar marks downtown move with parade, celebration|work=Winston-Salem Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news-record.com/business/article_88a41839-33cf-5914-8b29-6294ab57f48b.html|title=525@vine officially opens in downtown research park|last=Daniel|first=Fran|work=Winston-Salem Journal|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public-Private Collaboration==

With state and federal funding, and the cooperation of neighboring communities, Innovation Quarter's expansion plan includes private businesses, retail and residential units. Among the work is relocating [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern Railroad]] lines, construction of a new rail bridge and burying [[Duke Energy]] transmission lines. More than $17 million from the City of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County, have helped leverage $350 million in state, federal and private investment at Innovation Quarter.&lt;ref name=Innovation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/local/article_41064d7e-8a6a-11e2-8655-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Research park renamed Wake Forest Innovation Quarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wake Forest Innovations==

The renaming of Piedmont Triad Research Park to Wake Forest Innovation Quarter came shortly after Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center created a new operating division, Wake Forest Innovations, to establish and manage new business, partnerships, licenses and start-up companies based on the discoveries, intellectual property and research assets of the medical center and [[Wake Forest University]].

Wake Forest Innovations has separate units that market its scientific business assets-core laboratories, preclinical translational services, for example-to outside partners, while also promoting discovery and innovation and the licensing of technologies.&lt;ref name="Profile" /&gt; Wake Forest Innovation Quarter is another unit within Wake Forest Innovations.
