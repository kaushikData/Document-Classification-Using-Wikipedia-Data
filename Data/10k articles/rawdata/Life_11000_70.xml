'''Adult stem cells''' are [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]] [[cell (biology)|cells]], found throughout the body after development, that multiply by [[cell division]] to replenish dying cells and regenerate damaged [[biological tissue|tissues]]. Also known as '''[[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[stem cells]] ''' (from Greek Σωματικóς, meaning ''of the body''), they can be found in juvenile as well as adult animals and humans, unlike [[embryonic stem cells]]. &lt;!-- Stop changing this paragraph to nonsense. --&gt;

Scientific interest in adult stem cells is centered on their ability to divide or ''self-renew'' indefinitely, and generate all the [[cell type]]s of the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] from which they originate, potentially regenerating the entire organ from a few cells.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |authors=Mahla RS| title = Stem cells application in regenerative medicine and disease threpeutics | journal = International Journal of Cell Biology  | volume = 2016 | issue = 7 | pages = 19 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27516776 | doi = 10.1155/2016/6940283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike for embryonic stem cells, the use of human adult stem cells in research and therapy is not considered to be [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]], as they are derived from adult tissue samples rather than human embryos designated for scientific research.  They have mainly been studied in humans and [[model organism]]s such as [[Laboratory mice|mice]] and [[Laboratory rat|rats]].

==Structure==
===Defining properties===

A [[stem cell]] possesses two properties:
* '''''Self-renewal''''', which is the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell division]] while still maintaining its undifferentiated state.
* '''''[[Multipotency]]''''' or '''''multidifferentiative potential''''', which is the ability to generate [[Offspring|progeny]] of several distinct [[cell type]]s, (for example [[glial cell]]s and [[neuron]]s) as opposed to [[unipotent cell|unipotency]], which is the term for cells that are restricted to producing a single-cell type. However, some researchers do not consider multipotency to be essential, and believe that [[unipotent]] self-renewing stem cells can exist.&lt;ref name="Mlsna"&gt;

However, it is known that ''in vitro'' [[cell culture]] conditions can alter the behavior of cells, proving that a particular [[subpopulation]] of cells possesses stem cell properties ''[[in vivo]]'' is challenging, and so considerable debate exists as to whether some proposed stem cell populations in the adult are indeed stem cells.

==Types==

===Hematopoietic stem cells===
{{main|Hematopoietic stem cell}}
Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the [[bone marrow]] and [[umbilical cord blood]] and give rise to all the blood cell types.&lt;ref&gt;http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/scireport/pages/chapter5.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammary stem cells===
Mammary stem cells provide the source of cells for growth of the [[mammary gland]] during puberty and [[gestation]] and play an important role in [[carcinogenesis]] of the breast.&lt;ref name=pmid15987436&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu S, Dontu G, Wicha MS |title=Mammary stem cells, self-renewal pathways, and carcinogenesis |journal=Breast Cancer Research |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=86–95 |year=2005 |pmid=15987436 |pmc=1143566 |doi=10.1186/bcr1021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammary stem cells have been isolated from human and mouse tissue as well as from [[Cell culture|cell lines]] derived from the mammary gland. Single such cells can give rise to both the [[Lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] and [[myoepithelial cell]] types of the gland, and have been shown to have the ability to regenerate the entire organ in mice.&lt;ref name=pmid15987436/&gt;

===Intestinal stem cells===
Intestinal stem cells divide continuously throughout life and use a complex [[Intestinal epithelial differentiation genes|genetic program]] to produce the cells lining the surface of the small and large intestines.&lt;ref name="PMID 18808327"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Mesenchymal stem cells===
{{main|Mesenchymal stem cell}}

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of [[Stroma of bone marrow#Stroma|stromal]] origin and may differentiate into a variety of tissues. MSCs have been isolated from [[placenta]], [[adipose tissue]], [[lung]], [[bone marrow]] and blood, [[Wharton's jelly]] from the [[umbilical cord]],&lt;ref name=crev/&gt; and teeth (perivascular niche of [[dental pulp]] and [[periodontal ligament]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shi S, Bartold PM, Miura M, Seo BM, Robey PG, Gronthos S |title=The efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate and repair dental structures |journal=Orthod Craniofac Res |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=191–199 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16022721 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-6343.2005.00331.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSCs are attractive for clinical therapy due to their ability to differentiate, provide [[Trophic hormone|trophic]] support, and modulate [[innate immune response]].&lt;ref name=crev&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phinney DG, Prockop DJ |title=Concise review: mesenchymal stem/multipotent stromal cells: the state of transdifferentiation and modes of tissue repair – current views |journal=Stem Cells |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=2896–2902 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17901396 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2007-0637}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells have the ability to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types such as [[osteoblast]]s, [[chondroblast]]s, [[adipocyte]]s, [[neuroectoderm]]al cells, and [[hepatocyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bai|first=Xiaowen|last2=Alt|first2=Eckhard|date=2010-10-22|title=Myocardial regeneration potential of adipose tissue-derived stem cells|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X10016876|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|volume=401|issue=3|pages=321–326|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioactive mediators that favor local cell growth are also secreted by MSCs. Anti-inflammatory effects on the local microenvironment, which promote tissue healing, are also observed. The inflammatory response can be modulated by adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) including mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory [[T-lymphocytes]]. The mesenchymal stem cells thus alter the outcome of the immune response by changing the [[Cytokine Secretion Assay|cytokine secretion]] of dendritic and T-cell subsets. This results in a shift from a pro-inflammatory environment to an anti-inflammatory or tolerant cell environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=Sudeepta|last2=Pittenger|first2=Mark F.|date=2005-02-15|title=Human mesenchymal stem cells modulate allogeneic immune cell responses|journal=Blood|volume=105|issue=4|pages=1815–1822|doi=10.1182/blood-2004-04-1559|issn=0006-4971|pmid=15494428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Augello|first=Andrea|last2=Tasso|first2=Roberta|last3=Negrini|first3=Simone Maria|last4=Cancedda|first4=Ranieri|last5=Pennesi|first5=Giuseppina|date=2007-04-01|title=Cell therapy using allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells prevents tissue damage in collagen-induced arthritis|journal=Arthritis and Rheumatism|volume=56|issue=4|pages=1175–1186|doi=10.1002/art.22511|issn=0004-3591|pmid=17393437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endothelial stem cells===
{{main|Endothelial stem cell}}
Endothelial stem cells are one of the three types of multipotent stem cells found in the bone marrow. They are a rare and controversial group with the ability to differentiate into endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels.

===Neural stem cells===
{{main|Neural stem cell}}
The existence of stem cells in the adult brain has been postulated following the discovery that the process of [[neurogenesis]], the birth of new [[neuron]]s, continues into adulthood in rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altman J, Das GD |title=Autoradiographic and histological evidence of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in rats |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=319–35 |date=June 1965 |pmid=5861717 |doi=10.1002/cne.901240303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of stem cells in the mature primate brain was first reported in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis PD |title=Mitotic activity in the primate subependymal layer and the genesis of gliomas |journal=Nature |volume=217 |issue=5132 |pages=974–5 |date=March 1968 |pmid=4966809 |doi=10.1038/217974a0|bibcode = 1968Natur.217..974L }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been shown that new neurons are generated in adult mice, songbirds and primates, including humans. Normally, adult neurogenesis is restricted to two areas of the brain – the [[subventricular zone]], which lines the [[lateral ventricles]], and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the [[hippocampal formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarez-Buylla A, Seri B, Doetsch F |title=Identification of neural stem cells in the adult vertebrate brain |journal=Brain Research Bulletin |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=751–8 |date=April 2002 |pmid=12031271 |doi=10.1016/S0361-9230(01)00770-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the generation of new neurons in the [[hippocampus]] is well established, the presence of true self-renewing stem cells there has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bull ND, Bartlett PF |title=The adult mouse hippocampal progenitor is neurogenic but not a stem cell |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=25 |issue=47 |pages=10815–21 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16306394 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3249-05.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain circumstances, such as following tissue damage in [[ischemia]], neurogenesis can be induced in other brain regions, including the [[neocortex]].

Neural stem cells are commonly cultured ''in vitro'' as so called [[neurospheres]] – floating [[heterogeneous]] aggregates of cells, containing a large proportion of stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reynolds BA, Weiss S |title=Generation of neurons and astrocytes from isolated cells of the adult mammalian central nervous system |journal=Science |volume=255 |issue=5052 |pages=1707–10 |date=March 1992 |pmid=1553558 |doi=10.1126/science.1553558 |bibcode=1992Sci...255.1707R}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be propagated for extended periods of time and differentiated into both [[neuron]]al and [[glial|glia]] cells, and therefore behave as stem cells. However, some recent studies suggest that this behaviour is induced by the culture conditions in [[progenitor cell]]s, the progeny of stem cell division that normally undergo a strictly limited number of replication cycles ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doetsch F, Petreanu L, Caille I, Garcia-Verdugo JM, Alvarez-Buylla A |title=EGF converts transit-amplifying neurogenic precursors in the adult brain into multipotent stem cells |journal=Neuron |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1021–34 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12495619 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)01133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, neurosphere-derived cells do not behave as stem cells when transplanted back into the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall GP, Laywell ED, Zheng T, Steindler DA, Scott EW |title=In vitro-derived "neural stem cells" function as neural progenitors without the capacity for self-renewal |journal=Stem Cells |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=731–8 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16339644 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2005-0245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neural stem cells share many properties with [[haematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs). Remarkably, when injected into the blood, neurosphere-derived cells differentiate into various cell types of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bjornson CR, Rietze RL, Reynolds BA, Magli MC, Vescovi AL |title=Turning brain into blood: a hematopoietic fate adopted by adult neural stem cells in vivo |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5401 |pages=534–7 |date=January 1999 |pmid=9915700 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5401.534|bibcode = 1999Sci...283..534B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olfactory adult stem cells===
Olfactory adult stem cells have been successfully harvested from the human olfactory mucosa cells, which are found in the lining of the nose and are involved in the sense of smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Murrell W |title=Multipotent stem cells from adult olfactory mucosa |journal=Developmental Dynamics |volume=233 |issue=2 |pages=496–515 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15782416 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20360 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Féron F |author3=Wetzig A |display-authors=3 |last4=Cameron |first4=Nick |last5=Splatt |first5=Karisha |last6=Bellette |first6=Bernadette |last7=Bianco |first7=John |last8=Perry |first8=Chris |last9=Lee |first9=Gabriel}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they are given the right chemical environment these cells have the same ability as embryonic stem cells to develop into many different cell types. Olfactory stem cells hold the potential for therapeutic applications and, in contrast to neural stem cells, can be harvested with ease without harm to the patient. This means they can be easily obtained from all individuals, including older patients who might be most in need of stem cell therapies.

===Neural crest stem cells===
[[Hair follicle]]s contain two types of stem cells, one of which appears to represent a remnant of the stem cells of the embryonic [[neural crest]]. Similar cells have been found in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], [[sciatic nerve]], cardiac outflow tract and [[Dorsal root ganglion|spinal]] and [[sympathetic ganglia]]. These cells can generate  [[neuron]]s, [[Schwann cell]]s, [[myofibroblast]], [[chondrocyte]]s and [[melanocyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sieber-Blum M, Hu Y |title=Epidermal neural crest stem cells (EPI-NCSC) and pluripotency |journal=Stem Cell Rev |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=256–60 |date=December 2008 |pmid=18712509 |doi=10.1007/s12015-008-9042-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruger GM, Mosher JT, Bixby S, Joseph N, Iwashita T, Morrison SJ |title=Neural Crest Stem Cells Persist in the Adult Gut but Undergo Changes in Self-Renewal, Neuronal Subtype Potential, and Factor Responsiveness |journal=Neuron |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=657–69 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12194866 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00827-9 |pmc=2728576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testicular cells===
Multipotent stem cells with a claimed equivalency to embryonic stem cells have been derived from spermatogonial progenitor cells found in the  [[testicles]] of laboratory mice by scientists in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4841786.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Testicle cells may aid research|date=25 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/24/tech/main1439514.shtml|title=Study: Mice Testes Act Like Stem Cells|date=24 March 2006|publisher=[[CBS]]|author=[[CBS]]/[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/24/AR2006032401721.html|work=Washington Post|date=25 March 2006|title=Embryonic Stem Cell Success|author=Rick Weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070919131804.htm|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|title=Promising New Source Of Stem Cells: Mouse Testes Produce Wide Range Of Tissue Types|date=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testicles yield stem cells in science breakthrough|url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/20/2039030.htm?section=world|author=Barbara Miller|date=20 September 2007|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=1F52615A-E7F2-99DF-3EB290B3C5A45982|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|title=Testes May Prove Fertile Source of Stem Cells|author=J.R.

Multipotent stem cells have also been derived from [[germ cell]]s found in human testicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/01/AR2006040101145.html|title=U.S. Firm Says It Made Stem Cells From Human Testes|author=Maggie Fox ([[Reuters]])|work=Washington Post|date=2 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells, both endowed with stem cell properties, whereas asymmetric division produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before finally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is believed that the [[molecular]] distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.

===Plasticity===
Discoveries in recent years have suggested that adult stem cells might have the ability to differentiate into cell types from different germ layers.

===Aging===
Stem cell function becomes impaired with age, and this contributes to progressive deterioration of tissue maintenance and repair.&lt;ref name=Behrens&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behrens A, van Deursen JM, Rudolph KL, Schumacher B |title=Impact of genomic damage and ageing on stem cell function |journal=Nat.

Adult stem cells can, however, be artificially reverted to a state where they behave like embryonic stem cells (including the associated DNA repair mechanisms). This was done with mice as early as 2006&lt;ref&gt;Ertelt, Steven. 4 July 2006. "Researcher Turns Adult Mouse Skin Cells Into Embryonic Stem Cells." ''Bioethics''.

Adult stem cells express [[Membrane transport protein|transporters]] of the [[ABC-Transporter Genes|ATP-binding cassette family]] that [[Active transport|actively pump]] a diversity of organic molecules out of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaudhary PM, Roninson IB |title=Expression and activity of P-glycoprotein, a multidrug efflux pump, in human hematopoietic stem cells |journal=Cell |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=85–94 |date=July 1991 |pmid=1712673 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90141-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pharmaceuticals are exported by these transporters conferring [[multidrug resistance]] onto the cell. This complicates the design of drugs, for instance [[Adult stem cell#Neural stem cells|neural stem cell]] targeted therapies for the treatment of clinical depression.

'''An Lingshou''' ({{zh|c=安令首}}) was a Chinese [[Buddhist nun]] who lived in the first half of the 4th century [[Common Era]]. Her father initially refused her permission to become a nun, wanting her to follow the traditional roles of a woman as a wife and mother. He ultimately relented when his spiritual advisor, the [[monk]] [[Fotudeng]], pointed out that allowing her to become a nun would bring glory and salvation to the family, a role that fit within the family-oriented values that emphasized an person's duty to the family over individual desires. Her success paved the way for other women to choose a religious life, one that was not focused on the traditional role of a woman in society. 

==Life==
An Lingshou (flourished in the first half of the fourth century), of [[Dongguan]], or Donghuan, in present-day [[Shandong]]. She was the daughter (her given name has been lost) of the government official Xu Chong during the [[Later Zhao]] dynasty in North China. Her father wanted her to marry, but An had no interest in doing so, preferring the contemplative life. He said that she was selfish and placing her desires over her duties to her parents and family. She replied that her Buddhist faith would help her parents find salvation. Xu Chong then took the issue to Fotudeng who said that allowing An to become a nun would bring the family honor and glory and guide them to salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

An became a disciple of Fotudeng and [[Zhu Jingiang]] and founded the Jinshu Monastery. She is said to have converted over 200 people and built five monasteries and a retreat. The [[Emperor]] [[Shi Hu]] promoted her father to the governorship of [[Qinghe County, Hebei|Qinghe in Hebei Province]] in recognition of her merits.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angelo Infanti''' (16 February 1939 &amp;ndash; 12 October 2010) was an Italian film actor. He appeared in more than 90 films between 1961 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Angelo Infanti|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/34431/Angelo-Infanti}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born on 16 February 1939 in [[Zagarolo]], [[Italy]]. He died on 12 October 2010 in [[Tivoli, Italy]] due to cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/spettacolo/2010/10/12/visualizza_new.html_1733543572.html | title=Morto Angelo Infanti volto di Manuel Fantoni | date=12 October 2010 | publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] | language=Italian | first=Alessandra | last=Magliaro | accessdate=12 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infanti is best known to non-Italian audiences as Fabrizio in ''[[The Godfather]]''.  Fabrizio was a bodyguard to Michael Corleone who was hiding in Sicily.  Fabrizio betrays Michael by setting up explosives in his car, but kills his new bride instead.  In the novel, Fabrizio is later shot dead in revenge for the killing.  This scene was filmed but cut from the motion picture before its theatrical release.  It appears in the 1977 ''The Godfather:  A Novel for Television'', which combined the first two films - ''The Godfather'' and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', adding back scenes that had been previously cut and telling the story chronologically beginning with Vito Andolini's childhood in Sicily.

'''[[Baron]] Arthur Haulot''' (15 November 1913 – 24 May 2005) was a Belgian journalist, [[humanism|humanist]] and poet who served, during [[World War II]] as an active member of the [[Belgian resistance]]. As president of the ''Jeunes Socialistes'' (young [[socialism|socialist]]s), he was made prisoner and taken to the [[Dachau concentration camp]].

After his liberation from the camp, he spoke about the atrocities of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime and its efforts to impose a regime that precludes free speech and many forms of freedom and liberties, this leading to [[genocide|extermination]] of any opponents to the regime, and many people considered as ''passively opposed'' to the Regime, like the [[Jew]]s, the [[Romani people|Romani]] and many others.

He died in [[Brussels]] as a result of a [[thrombosis]].

'''CVac''', short for ‘Cancer Vaccine’, is a potential [[Immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] agent that  developed in [[Australia]].

CVac was developed by the [[biotechnology]] company [[Prima BioMed]] ([[Nasdaq]]: PBMD) through to Phase II clinical studies between 2001 and 2015. After inconclusive clinical data in [[ovarian cancer]] 2013 and 2014, Prima announced in February 2015 that it had ceased recruiting into CVAc clinical studies and was seeking commercial partners for the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prima BioMed Prioritising IMP321|url=http://www.primabiomed.com.au/investor/pdf/2015/27_02_2015_announcement.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2015|publisher=Prima BioMed market release|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment method ==
CVac is an ''[[ex vivo]]'' dendritic cell priming technology involving MFP, or mannan [[fusion protein]], where a fusion protein of MUC1 and [[Glutathione S-transferase]] is coupled to oxidized polymannose. The dendritic cells are the orchestrators of the immune system. ‘Priming’ dendritic cells involves exposing those cells to disease antigens in order to get the immune system to properly recognise the antigen and mount an appropriate response.  With CVac this takes place outside the body of the patient (''ex vivo''), with dendritic cells obtained by [[leukapheresis]]. The antigen in this case is MUC1,   known to be overexpressed on a variety of cancer cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in CVac MUC1 is conjugated to the carbohydrate mannan to facilitate uptake by the dendritic cells. CVAc can be administered subcutaneously, whereas Provenge is intravenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schröder|first1=L.|title=Autologous immunotherapy for ovarian carcinoma – A new chance?|journal=Ärzteblatt Sachsen|date=May 1, 2013|url=http://www.primabiomed.com.au/investor/pdf/2013/2013_05_AEBSInnenteil_eng.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early development in Melbourne ==
CVac originated in the mid-1990s at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's [[Austin Hospital, Melbourne|Austin Hospital]] (and that merged with the [[Burnet Institute]] in 2006). The original version of the product was developed in the laboratory of the Austin  Professor Ian McKenzie in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CVac therapy was originally intended to be ''in vivo'' but the Austin researchers started getting better results in ''ex vivo'' therapy.

== Development by Prima BioMed ==
Prima BioMed was formed around 2001 to commercialise a number of Austin Research Institute projects including CVac. The company was taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a [[reverse takeover]] of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prima BioMed Ltd (formerly Prima Resources Ltd) - Reinstatement of securities to Official Quotation|url=https://www.asxonline.com/intradoc-cgi/groups/participant_services/documents/communications/asx004875.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2015|publisher=Australian Stock Exchange Participant Circular|date=6 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; CVac ultimately ended up as Prima BioMed's core project until Prima's acquisition of the French biotechnology company Immutep SA in 2014.

== Dubai Approval ==
CVac was approved for use by the [[Dubai Health Authority|Dubai Health City Authority]] in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferris-Lay|first1=Claire|title=New ovarian cancer treatment approved in Dubai|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/new-ovarian-cancer-treatment-approved-in-dubai-403287.html|accessdate=1 June 2015|publisher=arabianbusiness.com|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing ==
CVac was manufactured in [[Germany]] by Fraunhofer IZI (Das Fraunhofer-Institut für Zelltherapie und Immunologie), an institute of the [[Fraunhofer Society]] in [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fraunhofer IZI received manufacturing authorization for tumor vaccine CVac |url=http://www.izi.fraunhofer.de/presseinformationen-lang.html?&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=97&amp;cHash=89d4773718ceaf5bcb60e558eab54930 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |publisher=Fraunhofer IZI press release |date=28 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101551/http://www.izi.fraunhofer.de/presseinformationen-lang.html?&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=97&amp;cHash=89d4773718ceaf5bcb60e558eab54930 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fraunhofer IZI was authorized to manufacture the treatment in Europe in late 2011 after meeting criteria laid down by the German ''Arzneimittelgesetz'' (Drug Law). Prima intended that its product would be manufactured at this one central location, with patient blood being flown to Leipzig and primed dendritic cells being shipped back to the relevant trial site.

'''Charles Henry Bond''' was an American businessman who was president and general manager of [[Waitt &amp; Bond]], one of [[Boston]]'s largest real estate holders, and a [[patron of the arts]].

==Early life==
Bond was born on July 13, 1846, in the Cliftondale neighborhood of [[Saugus, Massachusetts]], to Charles Milton Bond Jr. and Mary (Amerige) Bond. During his youth, Bond developed a love for music which would last throughout his life.&lt;ref name=Eliot&gt;{{cite book| last=Eliot| first=Samuel Atkins| title=Biographical History of Massachusetts| year=1911| publisher=Massachusetts Biographical Society| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AS4EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BostonObituary&gt;{{cite news| title=Bond Drowns in Bathtub| newspaper=[[The Boston Globe|The Boston Daily Globe]] |date=July 5, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cigars==
In 1863, at the age of seventeen, Bond entered the cigar business.&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt;&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt; In 1870, he and [[Henry Waitt]] established Waitt &amp; Bond in a small shop in Saugus.&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Waitt &amp; Bond, Inc.| journal=Standard Corporation Records| year=1944| volume=23| url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=AN3eUr6kLuqjsQSm8oDIDA&amp;id=LV1LAAAAYAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Charles+H.+Bond%22| publisher=Standard Statistics Co., Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business grew rapidly, and it was relocated to a large factory in Boston. Waitt &amp; Bond eventually became the largest cigar manufacturer in [[New England]] and one of the largest in the United States.&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt;

==Real estate==
With a fortune accumulated from his cigar business, Bond became involved in [[real estate]]. He was one of the most active dealers and largest holders of real estate in Boston. He became especially involved in real estate during the final year of his life. Among the properties Bond owned were the Oceanside Hotel in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]]'s [[Magnolia, Massachusetts|Magnolia]] village, the Hotel Netherlands on [[Boylston Street]] in Boston, and Brandon Hall in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]]. In 1908, Bond began work on the construction of a theater on [[Tremont Street]] in Boston, which was to be known as the Lyric Theatre.&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt; The project struggled as a result of the financial hit Bond took in the [[Panic of 1907]] and remained unfinished at the time of Bond's death. In the spring of 1909 the project was taken over by [[The Shubert Organization]], and the theater was renamed the [[Shubert Theatre (Boston)|Shubert Theatre]].&lt;ref name=SalemState&gt;{{cite web| title=Residence of C. H. Bond, Cliftondale, Mass.| url=http://digitalcommons.salemstate.edu/essex_lithographs/43/| publisher=Salem State University| accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Beautiful New Theatre to be Named the Shubert| newspaper=The Boston Daily Globe| date=December 12, 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bond also owned a number of properties in [[Washington, D.C.]], including the [[Bond Building]].&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt;

==Personal life==
Bond was twice married. In 1872 he married Martha A. Morrison of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. The couple had two children. His second wife was Isabelle "Belle" Bacon of Washington, D.C. She and Bond had five children.&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt;

He maintained a residence in Cliftondale until 1899, when he moved to a home on [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]] in Boston. He also owned Peacehaven, a summer estate in [[Swampscott, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt;

A [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], Bond and was a member of the [[Second Church, Boston|Second Church of Boston]]. For many years he was a member of the church's standing committee as well as its music committee. During his later years, Bond became interested in [[Christian Science]].&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt;

Bond was a staunch member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He was occasionally involved in politics, but never held elected office.&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt; He was also a member of numerous clubs and fraternal organizations, including the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[Knights Templar]], the Tedesco Country Club, and the Sons of Colonial Wars.&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt;&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 1885, Bond founded the Cliftondale Public Library. He served as the Library Association president and was a member of Saugus' first Water Board and a trustee of the Saugus Public Library as well.&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt; Bond also gave Saugus land to construct the Cliftondale School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gaffney| first=Mike| title=A tale of two cigar-smoking ghosts| url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/saugus/news/x1738026990/A-tale-of-two-cigar-smoking-ghosts| accessdate=January 20, 2014| newspaper=[[Saugus Advertiser]] |date=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His donations to the Saugus camp of the [[Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War]] were credited for its success, and the camp was named in Bond's honor.&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt;

A patron of the arts, he provided funding for the training of many vocal artists, including [[Geraldine Farrar]].&lt;ref name=WashingtonObituary /&gt; He was a member of the [[Boston Art Club]] and served on its entertainment committee. Bond was also a trustee of the [[New England Conservatory of Music]].&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt;&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt;

Bond offered an award known as the Bond Speaking Prize to the most proficient students at [[Saugus High School (Massachusetts)|Saugus High School]], [[Wesleyan University]], and [[New Orleans University]]. He also aided students at [[St. Lawrence University]].&lt;ref name=Eliot /&gt;

==Death==
On July 3, 1908, Bond was found dead in a bathtub in his summer residence. Medical Examiner Joseph G. Pinkham ruled the cause of death as [[drowning]] and that the death was accidental.&lt;ref name=BostonObituary /&gt; However, it was reported that Bond left a note in his bedroom which read, "I have been killed by my friends and enemies. It is more than I can bear. I can stand it no longer. My heart is broken. I leave everything to my wife."&lt;ref name=SalemState /&gt;&lt;ref name= WashingtonObituary&gt;{{cite news| title=Geraldine Farrar Protege of Bond| url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1908-07-06/ed-1/seq-7.pdf| accessdate=January 21, 2014| newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |date=July 6, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WashingtonObituary2&gt;{{cite news| title= C.H. Bond Known Here| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 7, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, it was believed that Bond's real estate ventures threatened his fortune. One month before his death, all of Bond's properties were placed in the hands of trustees. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Bond's dissatisfaction with the trustees' actions may have caused him to take his life.&lt;ref name=WashingtonObituary2 /&gt;

After his death, Bond's wife donated money for Bond Hall to be built in his honor at the [[MacDowell Colony]] in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Charles H. and Isabella Bacon Bond| url=http://library.plymouth.edu/finding-aid-the-rogers-family-collection#341816_charles-h-and-isabel_1| work=Lamson Library| publisher=[[Plymouth State University]] |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Childbirth in [[Haiti]]''' follows a system of behavior determined by local beliefs, traditions and attitudes, and is also affected by economic conditions and limitations of available  health care facilities.

==Pregnancy==
In Haiti, [[infertility]] carries a negative social stigma; women are expected to bear children. The period of pregnancy and birth is viewed as a happy, celebratory time for a family, not a medical health problem.

Pregnant women are expected to fulfill their work obligations up until their delivery. It is normal for pregnant women to experience an increase in salivation and to spit frequently, since they do not believe in swallowing their excess saliva. Women may sometimes carry a spit cup with them and feel no embarrassment in using it in public. Pregnant women are restricted from eating spices, which they believe  may irritate the fetus. However, they are encouraged to eat vegetables and red fruits, which are believed to build up the blood of the fetus. Pregnant women are also encouraged to eat large portions as they are eating for two.&lt;ref name="Cultural Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colin|first=J|title=Cultural and Clinical Care for Haitians|url=http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/Haiti_Cultural_and_Clinical_Care_Presentation_Read-Only.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prenatal care==
Many pregnant women in Haiti receive little health care because of poverty, lack of access, scarcity of healthcare professionals, and views on prenatal care.&lt;ref name="Physical Accessibility"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melhado|first=L.|title=The Physical Accessibility of Health Facilities Strongly Affects Haitian Women's Use of Prenatal, Delivery Care|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are more pronounced for women in rural areas, since most of the health care professionals are concentrated in the capitol. The doctor-patient ratio in Haiti is 1 to 67,000, and a percentage of health care workers leave the country each year to work in the United States and Canada, where the pay is better. The available health infrastructure is significantly decreased in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, which destroyed vital health facilities.

Many pregnant women see no need for prenatal care, and some fear and actively avoid modern medicine and hospitals, viewing pregnancy, labor and delivery as normal parts of a woman's life cycle.&lt;ref name="Neonatal Care"&gt;{{cite web|last=McHale|first=Caitlin|title=Pregnancy, Birth, and Neonatal Care Practices in the Dominican Republic &amp; Haiti|url=http://delivery-child-birth.knoji.com/pregnancy-birth-and-neonatal-care-practices-in-the-dominican-republic-haiti/|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor==
In Haiti, many women work until the delivery of the baby. Thus, many of them do not labor in a hospital. Either they labor in the home or their work location.&lt;ref name="Pregnancy and Childbearing Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelps|first=Lisl|title=Cultural Competency and Haitian Immigrants|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/nursing/haitiancultcomp/preg_and_childbear_prac.htm|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women are very active during the laboring process. They will [[Squatting position|squat]], stand, pace, or sit to create more comfortable positions for themselves. They will express their emotions by yelling, screaming, cursing, grunting, or moaning.&lt;ref name="Pregnancy and Childbearing Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelps|first=Lisl|title=Cultural Competency and Haitian Immigrants|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/nursing/haitiancultcomp/preg_and_childbear_prac.htm|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pain medications are not commonly available in Haitian birth culture.  Most women labor and birth their babies away from the hospital, and do not ask for pain medications.&lt;ref name="Pregnancy and Childbearing Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelps|first=Lisl|title=Cultural Competency and Haitian Immigrants|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/nursing/haitiancultcomp/preg_and_childbear_prac.htm|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the labor process, the father of the baby is absent, and the mother may be alone, with a midwife, or female family member and friends may surround her. Much of the decision-making relies on the woman in labor, and coaching from the support people is kept at a minimum.&lt;ref name="Pregnancy and Childbearing Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelps|first=Lisl|title=Cultural Competency and Haitian Immigrants|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/nursing/haitiancultcomp/preg_and_childbear_prac.htm|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth==
Traditionally, most women in Haiti have births attended by [[midwife|midwives]] who are not always formally educated. Midwives are generally taught by older midwives with experience.&lt;ref name="Pregnancy and Childbearing Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelps|first=Lisl|title=Cultural Competency and Haitian Immigrants|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/nursing/haitiancultcomp/preg_and_childbear_prac.htm|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth typically takes place in the home.&lt;ref name="Physical Accessibility"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melhado|first=L.|title=The Physical Accessibility of Health Facilities Strongly Affects Haitian Women's Use of Prenatal, Delivery Care|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Geographically, many roads are still destroyed from the earthquake in 2010, and in any case women do not have cars to get themselves to a hospital or a birth center.

==Complications and abnormalities==
[[Pre-eclampsia]] and [[eclampsia]] complications are some of the leading causes in Haiti's high maternal mortality rate. These complications account for seventeen percent of all maternal deaths. (Small, 2005). Because of the lack of prenatal care, many women do not realize the signs of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia until the delivery of the baby. By then, it is often too late to intervene. Medical facilities are often not available nearby in any case.&lt;ref name="Preeclampsia in Haiti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=M.|title=Characteristics of preeclampsia- and eclampsia-related maternal death in rural Haiti|journal=Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp; Neonatal  Medicine|date=2005|volume=18|issue=5|pages=343–348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in need of emergency C-sections often never receive them because many women do not have the money for them.&lt;ref name="Neonatal Care"&gt;{{cite web|last=McHale|first=Caitlin|title=Pregnancy, Birth, and Neonatal Care Practices in the Dominican Republic &amp; Haiti|url=http://delivery-child-birth.knoji.com/pregnancy-birth-and-neonatal-care-practices-in-the-dominican-republic-haiti/|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pregnancy and Childbearing Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelps|first=Lisl|title=Cultural Competency and Haitian Immigrants|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/nursing/haitiancultcomp/preg_and_childbear_prac.htm|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpartum==
In Haiti, the postpartum period begins immediately after birth and lasts about 40 days. The mother remains in the home, focusing on rest and recuperation. She takes an active role in her own care, dressing warmly, taking daily sitz baths and drinking tea to rejuvenate.&lt;ref name="Birth/Children"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamarda|title=Cultural, Ethnic and Religious Reference Manual for Health Care Providers: Haiti|url=http://www.jamardaresources.com/cersample/subpages/haitians/haitians_reproductive_child.htm|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural beliefs and behaviors==
In the first three days, strict bed rest is encouraged as well as the avoidance of anything "cold," such as drafts, going outside, and certain foods. Along with "cold" foods mothers are also taught to avoid "white" foods, such as white Lima beans, lobster, and milk. "White" and "cold" foods are believed to increase vaginal discharge and/or risk for hemorrhage. Foods acceptable for the mother to eat during this period include porridge, rice, beans, and plantain. Haitians believe that women are more susceptible to gas entering the body, during this period. To prevent this, mothers are encouraged to wear a tight belt or piece of linen around the waist to tighten bones loosened during childbirth.

A common practice during the postpartum period is the "three baths." In the first three days, the mother bathes in fortified water prepared from boiling special herbs in the water, including papaya, sour orange, sour soup (corossol), mint (ti baume), anise, bugleweed and eucalyptus. These herbs relax the mother and cause her muscles to tighten. This is known as the first bath. Mothers are also encouraged to drink a special tea made from the same mixture. The second bath occurs after the three-day mark for another three days where the mother bathes in herb-fortified water that is warmed by the sun, not boiled. The third bath occurs at the one-month mark and is a cold bath, the first one the mother takes since delivery. A cold bath is done to promote healing and tightening of the muscles and bones loosened during delivery.&lt;ref name="Birth/Children"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamarda|title=Cultural, Ethnic and Religious Reference Manual for Health Care Providers: Haiti|url=http://www.jamardaresources.com/cersample/subpages/haitians/haitians_reproductive_child.htm|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breastfeeding practices==
[[Breastfeeding]] is widely practiced in Haiti for cultural and socioeconomic reasons; 97% of infants are breastfed. Breastfeeding is encouraged for up to nine months with mothers in rural areas continuing for longer because it is economical and practical.  A misconception held in Haiti is that breastmilk is the cause of infant illnesses such as diarrhea, tetanus, or intestinal parasites. Haitian mothers are also particular about the form of milk given to infants, as it is believed that milk that is too thick or thin can be detrimental to both mother and child. If the milk is too thick, it is believed to cause impetigo in the infant.&lt;ref name="Cultural Practices"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colin|first=J|title=Cultural and Clinical Care for Haitians|url=http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/Haiti_Cultural_and_Clinical_Care_Presentation_Read-Only.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the milk is too thin, believed to be caused by maternal fright or worry, the milk has "turned" and may cause diarrhea and failure to thrive in the infant, and headache and possibly postpartum depression in the mother. In alternatives to breast milk the "hot" and "cold" diet that many Haitians believe in is followed here as well. The postpartum period is considered a "hot" period and requires "cold" foods. Whole milk is acceptable. However, formula is considered a "hot" food and is avoided.

==Rites and rituals==
There are many rites of passage and birth rituals practiced in Haiti.&lt;ref name="Birth/Children"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamarda|title=Cultural, Ethnic and Religious Reference Manual for Health Care Providers: Haiti|url=http://www.jamardaresources.com/cersample/subpages/haitians/haitians_reproductive_child.htm|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naming of the newborn baby occurs one month after birth. The nose of newborn is gently pinched several times a day in an effort to narrow the nostrils, which is considered more attractive in Haiti. The hair of the infant is not cut prior to one year of age. Male circumcision is not encouraged, as it is believed to reduce sexual satisfaction. Purgatives (lok) are often given to newborns to cleanse their insides of first stools. A common purgative is made with a base of red oil from a plant known as ''[[Ricinus|maskreti]]'' in Creole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeA1-Of-LscC&amp;pg=PA347#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Guide to Afro-Cuban Herbalism |editor=Quiros-Moran, Dalia |page=347 |year=2009 |isbn=9781438980973 |accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FelsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=maskreti+newborn+haiti&amp;dq=maskreti+newborn+haiti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtopu1mcHVAhUr74MKHfMDBWYQ6AEIKzAB |title=Comprehensive Maternity Nursing: Perinatal and Women's Health |editor1=Auvenshine, Martha Ann|editor2=Enriquez, Martha Gunther |page=122 |year=1990 |isbn=9780867204216 |accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other main ingredients include castor oil, sugar, garlic, boiled water, salt, and nutmeg. Mothers are cautioned that rapid dehydration may result from this practice.  *Nutmeg, castor oil, and a spider web are among some of the substances placed on umbilical stump to speed healing and prevent newborn from "catching umbilical cold". In rural areas, the placenta is buried to prevent harm to the child.

==Role of caregivers==
In traditional families, mothers occupy the caregiver role. In single-parent families where the mother is the provider, the role of caregiver is extended to the maternal grandmother. For the first three months, caregivers avoid taking the newborn outside after late afternoon because it is a "cold " environment. The air is dangerous at this time and can cause the infant to become sick and agitated, with darker bowel movements as another symptom. If baby must be outside, the caregiver covers their body and head well. At one month, the caregiver can begin bathing the infant in cold water to build up their resistance. Caregivers massage the limbs and buttocks of the newborn after bathing. They pull and push on the most exterior parts of limbs, as if locking them into place, to shape the child's body and give it tone.

Caregivers are also discouraged from holding the infant for long periods of times. It is believed that if the caregiver holds the baby too much, the baby will be slower in hitting milestones, such as learning to sit up, crawl, and walk. Caregivers are encouraged to leave baby on the ground and any bumps or falls that occur are seen as necessary milestones in their learning process. Mothers reluctant to follow this practice are often criticized. The caregiver is also responsible for extracting milk from the infant's body to prevent the infant from having body odor when they reach adolescence. Squeezing the infant's nipples does this. This milk is present in newborns due to the high level of the mother's hormones from the womb and breastfeeding, causing them to lactate for a period of time. There are no visible negative side effects caused by the act of squeezing the nipples of the infant.&lt;ref name="Neonatal Care"&gt;{{cite web|last=McHale|first=Caitlin|title=Pregnancy, Birth, and Neonatal Care Practices in the Dominican Republic &amp; Haiti|url=http://delivery-child-birth.knoji.com/pregnancy-birth-and-neonatal-care-practices-in-the-dominican-republic-haiti/|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chook raffle''' is an the Australian tradition of "raffling off" chooks, i.e. whole (dressed) chickens, often in clubs or pubs. "Chook" is an Australian term for a chicken. Most often the chicken is prepared by a butcher, but live chickens are sometimes raffled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/manly-daily|title=Boatie on mend|date=4 November 2006|website=dailytelegraph.com.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041223/http://www.manlydaily.com.au/article/2006/11/04/1393_sports.html|archivedate=28 September 2007|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chook raffle is a special case of a [[meat raffle]], but is more often used as a fund-raising activity by an amateur club or organisation. Perhaps because of this association, the expression tends to be used disparagingly about someone who claims to have, or should have, superior organisational skills, that they "couldn't run a chook raffle".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com.au/blogs/fullduplex/soa/How_to_run_a_chook_raffle_Telstra_style/0,139033349,139257614,00.htm{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used to describe any random process. An example is selecting the winner of an election by drawing a name from a hat, said to be turning the process into a "chook raffle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/second-poll-decided-by-raffle/story-e6freoof-1111115950006 |title=Cloncurry mayor chosen by 'chook raffle' |date=1 April 2008 |website=www.couriermail.com.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902090151/http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/second-poll-decided-by-raffle/story-e6freoof-1111115950006 |archivedate=2 September 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Χρύσιππος ὁ Σολεύς}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|Chrysippos ho Soleus}}; {{nowrap|{{circa}} 279 –}} {{nowrap|c. 206 BC&lt;ref name="dorandi1"&gt;He died according to [[Apollodorus of Athens]] (ap. [[Diogenes Laërtius]], vii. 184) at the age of 73 during the 143rd [[Olympiad]] (208–204 BC). Thus his date of birth is placed between 281 and 277. The statements in [[Pseudo-Lucian]] (''Macr.'' 20) that he died aged 81, and [[Valerius Maximus]] that he was still writing at the age of 80 (Val. Max. viii. 7) are considered less credible. Cf. {{harvnb|Dorandi|1999|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. He was a native of [[Soli, Cilicia]], but moved to [[Athens]] as a young man, where he became a pupil of [[Cleanthes]] in the Stoic school. When Cleanthes died, around 230 BC, Chrysippus became the third head of the school. A prolific writer, Chrysippus expanded the fundamental doctrines of [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of the school, which earned him the title of Second Founder of Stoicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dorandi|1999|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysippus excelled in [[logic]], the [[theory of knowledge]], [[ethics]], and [[Stoic physics|physics]]. He created an original system of [[propositional logic]] in order to better understand the workings of the universe and role of humanity within it. He adhered to a [[deterministic]] view of [[Destiny|fate]], but nevertheless sought a role for personal freedom in thought and action. Ethics, he thought, depended on understanding the nature of the universe, and he taught a therapy of [[wikt:extirpate|extirpating]] the [[Stoic passions|unruly passions]] which depress and crush the soul. He initiated the success of Stoicism as one of the most influential philosophical movements for centuries in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world.

Of his written works, none have survived except as fragments quoted in the works of later authors. Recently, segments of some of his works were discovered among the [[Herculaneum papyri]].&lt;ref name="fitzgerald"&gt;"The first of Chrysippus' partially preserved two or three works is his ''Logical Questions'', contained in PHerc. 307 ... The second work is his ''On Providence'', preserved in PHerc 1038 and 1421 ... A third work, most likely by Chrysippus is preserved in PHerc. 1020," {{Harvnb|Fitzgerald|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Chrysippus, the son of Apollonius of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], was born at [[Soli, Cilicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=7}}, citing Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 179; Galen, ''Protreptic'', 7; ''de Differentia Pulsuum'', 10&lt;/ref&gt; He was slight in stature,&lt;ref name="laertius182"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 182&lt;/ref&gt; and is reputed to have trained as a long-distance runner.&lt;ref name="laertius179"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 179&lt;/ref&gt; While still young, he lost his substantial inherited property when it was confiscated to the king's treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 181. The king is not named, but [[Cilicia]] was contested between [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] and [[Antiochus I Soter]] during this period, cf. {{Harvnb|Green|1993|p=639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus moved to [[Athens]], where he became the disciple of [[Cleanthes]], who was then the head (''[[scholarch]]'') of the Stoic school.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 179. The claim that he studied under Zeno is less likely because Zeno died in 262/1. Cf. {{Harvnb|Dorandi|1999|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have attended the courses of [[Arcesilaus]] and his successor [[Lacydes of Cyrene|Lacydes]], in the [[Platonic Academy]].&lt;ref name="laertius184"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysippus threw himself eagerly into the study of the Stoic system. His reputation for learning among his contemporaries was considerable.&lt;ref name="laertius179"/&gt; He was noted for intellectual audacity and self-confidence and his reliance on his own ability was shown, among other things, in the request he is supposed to have made to Cleanthes: "Give me the principles, and I will find the proofs myself."&lt;ref name="laertius179"/&gt; He succeeded Cleanthes as head of the Stoic school when Cleanthes died, in around 230 BC.

Chrysippus was a prolific writer. He is said to rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day&lt;ref name="laertius181"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 181&lt;/ref&gt; and he composed more than 705 works.&lt;ref name="laertius180"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 180&lt;/ref&gt; His desire to be comprehensive meant that he would take both sides of an argument&lt;ref name="laertius184"/&gt; and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 181, x. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came to be seen as a preeminent authority for the school.&lt;ref name="davidson614"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|1908|p=614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chrysippus of Soli - Delle Vite de Filosofi di Diogene Laertio 1606.png|thumb|right|Final moments in the life of Chrysippus. Engraving from 1606.]]
He died during the 143rd [[Olympiad]] (208–204 BC) at the age of 73.&lt;ref name="dorandi1"/&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] gives two different accounts of his death.&lt;ref name="laertius185"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 185&lt;/ref&gt; In the first account, Chrysippus was seized with dizziness having drunk undiluted [[Ancient Greece and wine|wine]] at a feast, and died soon after. In the second account, he was watching a donkey eat some [[Common fig|figs]] and cried out: "Now give the donkey a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs", whereupon he [[Death from laughter|died in a fit of laughter]]. His nephew [[Aristocreon]] erected a statue in his honour in the [[Kerameikos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis''; Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by his pupil [[Zeno of Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'', 15. 18; Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his written works, none have survived except as fragments quoted in the works of later authors like [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Galen]], [[Plutarch]], and others. Recently, segments from ''Logical Questions'' and ''On Providence'' were discovered among the [[Herculaneum papyri]].&lt;ref name="fitzgerald"/&gt; A third work by Chrysippus may also be among them.&lt;ref name="fitzgerald"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Chrysippus had a long and successful career of resisting the attacks of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]&lt;ref name="ConEWP"&gt;"Chrysippus", [[J. O. Urmson]], [[Jonathan Rée]], ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy'', 2005, pages 73–74 of 398 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; and hoped not simply to defend Stoicism against the assaults of the past, but also against all possible attack in the future. He took the doctrines of Zeno and Cleanthes and crystallized them into what became the definitive system of [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name=ConEWP/&gt; He elaborated the [[Stoic physics|physical doctrines]] of the Stoics and their [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]&lt;ref name="davidson614"/&gt; and he created much of their formal logic.&lt;ref name="barnes65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnes|1999|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Chrysippus made the Stoic system what it was. It was said that "without Chrysippus, there would have been no Stoa".&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 183. {{lang-el|εἰ μὴ γὰρ ἦν Χρύσιππος, οὐκ ἂν ἦν στοά}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic ==
{{See also|Stoic logic}}
Chrysippus wrote much on the subject of logic and created a system of [[propositional logic]]. [[Aristotle]]'s [[term logic]] had been concerned with the interrelations of [[Syllogism#Terms in syllogism|terms]] such as "Socrates" or "man" ("all men are mortal, Socrates is a man, so Socrates is mortal"). Stoic logic, on the other hand, was concerned with the interrelations of [[proposition]]s such as "it is day" ("if it is day, it is light: but it is day: so it is light").&lt;ref name="sharples24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the earlier [[Megarian school|Megarian dialecticians]] –&amp;nbsp;[[Diodorus Cronus]] and [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]]&amp;nbsp;– had worked in this field and the pupils of [[Aristotle]] –&amp;nbsp;[[Theophrastus]] and [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]]&amp;nbsp;– had investigated [[hypothetical syllogism]]s,&lt;ref name="johansen466"&gt;{{harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was Chrysippus who developed these principles into a coherent system of propositional logic.&lt;ref name="johansen466"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sharples2425"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharples|2014|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propositions===
Chrysippus defined a proposition as "that which is capable of being denied or affirmed as it is in itself" and gave examples of propositions such as "it is day" and "Dion is walking."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished between simple and non-simple propositions, which in modern terminology are known as [[Atomic sentence|atomic]] and [[Molecular sentence|molecular]] propositions.&lt;ref name="johansen466"/&gt; A simple proposition is an elementary statement such as "it is day."&lt;ref name="gould71"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1970|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple propositions are linked together to form non-simple propositions by the use of [[logical connective]]s. Chrysippus enumerated five kinds of molecular propositions according to the connective used:&lt;ref name="gould71"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.0em auto;border:1px;background:white;"
!colspan=2 style="background:white;text-align:center;"| Logical connectives
|- style="background:white"
! Type                !! Example
|-
| if            || '''if''' it is day, it is light
|-
| and           || it is day '''and''' light
|-
| either ... or || '''either''' it is day '''or''' night
|-
| because       || '''because''' it is day, it is light
|-
| | more/less likely ... than || '''more likely''' it is day '''than''' night
|}

Thus several types of molecular propositions, familiar to modern logic, were listed by Chrysippus, including the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], the [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]], and the [[Material conditional|conditional]],&lt;ref name="johansen467"&gt;{{harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chrysippus studied their criteria of [[Logical truth|truth]] closely.&lt;ref name="johansen467"/&gt;

===Conditional propositions===
The first logicians to debate conditional statements were [[Diodorus Cronus]] and his pupil [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]]. Writing five-hundred years later, [[Sextus Empiricus]] refers to a debate between Diodorus and Philo.&lt;ref name="sextus1"&gt;[[Sextus Empiricus]], ''Pyr. Hyp.'' ii. 110–112; ''Adv. Math.'' viii. 112–117&lt;/ref&gt; Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] had an incorrect [[consequent]], and this meant a proposition such as "if it is day, then I am talking," is true unless it is day and I fall silent.&lt;ref name="sextus2"&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Pyr. Hyp.'', ii. 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; But Diodorus argued that a true conditional is one in which the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion – thus, because the proposition "if it is day, then I am talking" can be false, it is invalid.&lt;ref name="sextus1"/&gt; However, [[Paradoxes of material implication|paradoxical propositions]] were still possible such as "if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists."&lt;ref name="sextus2"/&gt; Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible:&lt;ref&gt;When Sextus Empiricus reports the different criteria offered by ancient philosophers for the truth of conditional propositions, he does not mention Chrysippus by name, but modern scholars believe that Chrysippus authored, or, at least, held this view. See {{Harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=72–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent.&lt;ref name="johansen468"&gt;{{Harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to the modern-day [[strict conditional]].&lt;ref name="johansen468"/&gt;

===Syllogistic===
Chrysippus developed a syllogistic or system of deduction in which he made use of five types of basic arguments or [[argument form]]s called indemonstrable syllogisms, which played the role of axioms, and four [[Rule of inference|inference rules]], called ''themata'' by means of which complex syllogisms could be reduced to these axioms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]], Stoic Syllogistic, ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 14, 1996, pp. 133–192&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of the five indemonstrables were:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, vii. 79; Sextus Empiricus, ''Hyp. Pyr.'' ii. 156–9; cf. ''Adv. Math.'' viii. 223ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Of the four inference rules, only two survived. One, the so-called first ''thema'', was a rule of antilogism. The other, the third ''thema'', was a cut rule by which chain syllogisms could be reduced to simple syllogisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=logic-ancient/#StoSyl |title=Ancient Logic: Stoic Syllogistic |last=Bobzien |first=Susanne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of Stoic syllogistic was not merely to create a formal system. It was also understood as the study of the operations of reason, the divine reason (''[[logos]]'') which governs the [[universe]], of which human beings are a part.&lt;ref name="sharples26"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to find valid rules of inference and forms of proof to help people find their way in life.&lt;ref name="johansen466"/&gt;

===Other logical work===
Chrysippus analyzed speech and the handling of names and terms.&lt;ref name="davidson614"/&gt; He also devoted much effort in refuting fallacies and paradoxes.&lt;ref name="davidson614"/&gt; According to Diogenes Laërtius, Chrysippus wrote twelve works in 23 books on the [[Liar paradox]]; seven works in 17 books on [[amphiboly]]; and another nine works in 26 books on other conundrums.&lt;ref name="barnes71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnes|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 28 works or 66 books were given over to puzzles or paradoxes.&lt;ref name="barnes71"/&gt; 
Chrysippus is the first Stoic for whom the third of the four [[Stoic categories]], i.e. the category ''somehow disposed'' is attested.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Menn, The Stoic Theory of Categories, in ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy: Volume XVII: 1999, 215–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of ''substance'' and ''quality'', but makes little use of the other two Stoic categories (''somehow disposed'' and ''somehow disposed in relation to something'').&lt;ref name="gould107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.&lt;ref name="gould107"/&gt;

===Later reception===
Chrysippus came to be renowned as one of the foremost logicians of ancient Greece. When [[Clement of Alexandria]] wanted to mention one who was master among logicians, as [[Homer]] was master among [[poet]]s, it was Chrysippus, not Aristotle, he chose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Stromata'', vii. 16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] wrote: "If the gods use [[dialectic]], they would use none other than that of Chrysippus."&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The logical work by Chrysippus came to be neglected and forgotten. Aristotle's logic prevailed, partly because it was seen as more practical, and partly because it was taken up by the [[Neoplatonists]].&lt;ref name="sharples26"/&gt; As recently as the 19th century, Stoic logic was treated with contempt, a barren formulaic system, which was merely clothing the logic of Aristotle with new terminology.&lt;ref name="otoole403"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 20th century, with the advances in logic, and the modern [[propositional calculus]], that it became clear that Stoic logic constituted a significant achievement.&lt;ref name="johansen466"/&gt;

== Epistemology ==
For the Stoics, truth is distinguished from error by the [[Sage (sophos)|sage]] who possesses right reason.&lt;ref name="hicks70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1910|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus's theory of knowledge was [[Empiricism|empirical]].&lt;ref name="gould90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense]]s transmit messages from the external world, and their reports are controlled not by referring them to innate ideas, but by comparing them to previous reports stored in the mind.&lt;ref name="gould90"/&gt; Zeno had defined impressions of sense as "an impression in the soul"&lt;ref name="stock22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stock|1908|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was interpreted literally by Cleanthes, who compared the impression on the soul to the impression made by a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] on wax.&lt;ref name="zeller77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus preferred to regard it as an alteration or change in the soul;&lt;ref name="stock22"/&gt; that is, the soul receives a modification from every external object that acts upon it, just as the air receives countless strokes when many people are speaking at once.&lt;ref name="stock22"/&gt;

In the receipt of an impression, the soul is purely passive and the impression reveals not only its own existence, but that also of its cause—just as light displays itself and the elements that are in it.&lt;ref name="stock22"/&gt; The power to name the object resides in the understanding. First must come the impression, and the understanding—having the power of utterance—expresses in speech the affection it receives from the object.&lt;ref name="stock23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stock|1908|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; True presentations are distinguished from those that are false by the use of memory, classification and comparison.&lt;ref name="gould90"/&gt; If the sense organ and the mind are healthy—and provided that an external object can be really seen or heard—the presentation, due to its clearness and distinctness, has the power to [[wikt:extort|extort]] the [[wikt:assent|assent]] that always lies in our power, to give or to withhold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1911|p=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a context in which people are understood to be [[wikt:rational|rational]] beings, reason is developed out of these notions.&lt;ref name="hicks66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1910|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics ==
[[File:Chrysippus of Soli.jpg|right|thumb|A partial marble [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Chrysippus that is a Roman copy of a [[Hellenistic]] original ([[Louvre Museum]]).]]
Chrysippus insisted on the organic unity of the [[universe]], as well as the [[wikt:correlation|correlation]] and mutual interdependence of all of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De Natura Deorum'', ii, 19&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "the universe is its own soul and its own controlling mind."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Zeno, Chrysippus determined fiery breath or [[aether (classical element)|aether]] to be the primitive substance of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1911|p=944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects are made up of inert formless matter and an informing soul, "''[[pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]''", provides form to the undifferentiated matter.&lt;ref name="otoole431"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pneuma'' [[wikt:pervade|pervades]] all of substance and maintains the unity of the universe and constitutes the [[soul]] of the human being.&lt;ref name="otoole431"/&gt;

The [[classical elements]] change into one another by a process of [[condensation]] and [[rarefaction]].&lt;ref name="stock79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stock|1908|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] first becomes solidified into [[Air (classical element)|air]]; then air into [[Water (classical element)|water]]; and lastly, water into [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]. The process of dissolution takes place in the reverse order: earth being rarefied into water, water into air and air into fire.&lt;ref name="stock79"/&gt;

The human soul was divided by Chrysippus into eight faculties: the five senses, the power of [[reproduction]], the power of [[speech]], and the "ruling part" that is located in the chest rather than the head.&lt;ref name="sharples67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual souls are perishable; but, according to the view originated by Chrysippus, the souls of wise people survive longer after their death.&lt;ref name="sharples67"/&gt; No individual soul can, however, survive beyond the [[ekpyrosis|periodic conflagration]], when the universe is [[palingenesis|renewed]].&lt;ref name="sharples67"/&gt;&lt;!--It is not clear on page 67 whether this last idea originated with Chrysippus or Heraclitus or...?--&gt;

===Fate===
For Chrysippus, all things happen according to [[destiny|fate]]: what seems to be accidental has always some hidden cause.&lt;ref name="zeller178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unity of the world consists in the chain-like dependence of cause upon cause.&lt;ref name="zeller176"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing can take place without a sufficient cause.&lt;ref name="zeller175"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chrysippus, every proposition is either true or false, and this must apply to future events as well:&lt;ref name="zeller174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If any motion exists without a cause, then not every proposition will be either true or false. For that which has not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''On Fate'', 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Stoic view of fate is entirely based on a view of the universe as a whole. Individual things and persons only come into consideration as dependent parts of this whole.&lt;ref name="zeller177"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everything is, in every respect, determined by this relation, and is consequently subject to the general order of the world.&lt;ref name="zeller176"/&gt;

If his opponents objected that, if everything is determined by destiny, there is no individual responsibility, since what has been once foreordained must happen, come what may, Chrysippus replied that there is a distinction to be made between simple and complex predestination.&lt;ref name="zeller181"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming ill may be fated whatever happens but, if a person's recovery is linked to consulting a doctor, then consulting the doctor is fated to occur together with that person's recovery, and this becomes a complex fact.&lt;ref name="kenny195"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenny|2006|p=195}} referencing [[Cicero]], ''On Fate'', 28–9&lt;/ref&gt; All human actions – in fact, our destiny – are decided by our relation to things,&lt;ref name="zeller182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as Chrysippus put it, events are "co-fated" to occur:&lt;ref name="kenny195"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The non-destruction of one's coat, he says, is not fated simply, but co-fated with its being taken care of, and someone's being saved from his enemies is co-fated with his fleeing those enemies; and having children is co-fated with being willing to lie with a woman. ... For many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things, since, he says, it was fated for these things to occur in conjunction with this personal effort. ... But it will be in our power, he says, with what is in our power being included in fate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenianus]] in [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'', vi. 8, quoted in {{harvnb|Inwood|Gerson|1997|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus our actions are predetermined, and are causally related to the overarching network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brunschwig|Sedley|2003|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects.&lt;ref name="zeller179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every action is brought about by the co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent.&lt;ref name="zeller179"/&gt; Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes.&lt;ref name="zeller179"/&gt; Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible.&lt;ref name="zeller180"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not.&lt;ref name="zeller180"/&gt; This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or [[compatibilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=152, note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divination===
[[File:Kleromanteia.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cleromancy]] in ancient Greece. Chrysippus accepted [[divination]] as part of the [[causal chain]] of [[Destiny|fate]].]]
Chrysippus also argued for the existence of fate based on [[divination]], which he thought there was good evidence for.&lt;ref name="gould144-5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental.&lt;ref name="zeller175"/&gt; Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences.&lt;ref name="hicks947"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|1911|p=947}}&lt;/ref&gt; There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity.&lt;ref name="hicks947"/&gt; To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.&lt;ref name="hicks947"/&gt;

===God===
The Stoics believed that the universe is [[God]], and Chrysippus affirmed that "the universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul."&lt;ref name="cicerodenati15"&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 15&lt;/ref&gt; It is the guiding principle of the universe, "operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality which embraces all existence."&lt;ref name="cicerodenati15"/&gt; Based on these beliefs, physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] identified Chrysippus as a [[Pandeist]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 233: "Dieser Pandeismus, der von Chrysippos (aus Soloi 280-208 v. Chr.) herrühren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und Abkühlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet."&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysippus sought to prove the [[existence of God]], making use of a [[teleological argument]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If there is anything that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce the things that are in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', iii. 10. Cf. ii. 6 for the fuller version of this argument&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chrysippus spoke of God and gods interchangeably. He interpreted the [[Greek gods|gods]] of traditional Greek religion by viewing them as different aspects of the one reality. [[Cicero]] tells us that "he further maintained that aether is that which people call [[Zeus]], and that the air which permeates the seas is [[Poseidon]], and that the earth is what is known by the name of [[Demeter]], and he treated in similar style the names of the other gods."&lt;ref name="cicerodenati15"/&gt; In addition, the universe exists for the benefit of the universal god:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We should infer in the case of a beautiful dwelling-place that it was built for its owners and not for [[mice]]; we ought, therefore, in the same way to regard the universe as the dwelling-place of the gods.&lt;ref name="cicerodenatiii10"&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', iii. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theodicy===
In response to the question of how [[evil]] could exist in a good universe, Chrysippus replied "evil cannot be removed, nor is it well that it should be removed."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 1051 B&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, he argued, following [[Plato]], that it was impossible for good to exist without evil, for justice could not be known without injustice, courage without cowardice, temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness.&lt;ref name="gelliusvii1"&gt;Aulus Gellius, vii. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, apparent evils exist as a consequent of nature's goodness, thus it was necessary for the human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility, but this superior utility meant that the skull is vulnerable to blows.&lt;ref name="gelliusvii1"/&gt; Thirdly, evils are distributed according to the rational will of Zeus, either to punish the wicked or because they are important to the world-order as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 1050 E; ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1065 B&lt;/ref&gt; Thus evil is good under disguise, and is ultimately conducive to the best. Chrysippus compared evil to the coarse jest in the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]]; for, just as the jest, though offensive in itself, improves the piece as a whole, "so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself, yet allow that, taken with all else, it has its use."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1065 D&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics ==
[[File:Kegelstumpf.png|thumb|right|The puzzle of Democritus. If a cone is sliced horizontally, are the surfaces produced equal or unequal?]]

Chrysippus regarded [[Physical body|bodies]], surfaces, [[Line (geometry)|lines]], [[Location (geography)|places]], the [[Vacuum|void]] and [[time]] as all being [[Infinite divisibility|infinitely divisible]].&lt;ref name="gould116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; He determined one of the principal features of the [[infinite set]]: since a man and a finger have an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.&lt;ref name="gould117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysippus also responded to a problem first posed by [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1079F&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is divided by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] parallel to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]; if they are unequal, then the surface of the cone must be [[Step function|stepped]].&lt;ref name="gould117"/&gt; The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal.&lt;ref name="gould118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the [[law of excluded middle]] with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern [[infinitesimal calculus]], namely, the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the process of [[Convergent series|convergence towards a limit]].&lt;ref name="gould118"/&gt;

Chrysippus was notable for claiming that "[[1 (number)|one]]" is a [[number]]. One was not always considered a number by the ancient Greeks since they viewed one as that by which things are measured. [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' wrote, "... a measure is not the things measured, but the measure or the One is the beginning of number."&lt;ref name="heath69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Heath|1921|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus asserted that one had "magnitude one" ({{lang-el|πλῆθος ἕν}}),&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''in Nicom.'', ii. 8f; [[Syrianus]], ''in Arist. Metaph.'', Kroll 140. 9f.&lt;/ref&gt; although this was not generally accepted by the Greeks, and [[Iamblichus]] wrote that "magnitude one" was a contradiction in terms.&lt;ref name="heath69"/&gt;

== Ethics ==
[[File:Medeia child Louvre K300.jpg|right|thumb|Greek [[amphora]] depicting [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''. Chrysippus regarded [[Medea]] as a prime example of how bad judgments could give rise to irrational passions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galen]], ''On The Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', iii.3.13–22, iv.2.27, iv.6.19–27. See also [[Epictetus]], ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', i.28.6–10; ii.17.19–23, for an example of this play being discussed in the setting of a Stoic school&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Chrysippus taught that [[ethics]] depended on physics. In his ''Physical Theses'', he stated: "for there is no other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe."&lt;ref name="stock13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stock|1908|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person's individual nature is part of the nature of the whole universe,&lt;ref name="laertius87"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 87&lt;/ref&gt; and thus life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature as well as that of the universe.&lt;ref name="laertius88"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Human nature is ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly.&lt;ref name="davidson615"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davidson|1908|p=615}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason.&lt;ref name="davidson615"/&gt; Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.&lt;ref name="davidson615"/&gt;

The Stoics admitted between the good and the bad a third class of things – the indifferent (''[[adiaphora]]'').&lt;ref name="kenny282"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenny|2006|pp=282–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of things morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and the worst includes sickness and poverty.&lt;ref name="zeller284"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent things as "good",&lt;ref name="kenny282"/&gt; but the wise person, said Chrysippus, uses such things without requiring them.&lt;ref name="zeller284"/&gt; Practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in the individual – in other words, there is such a thing as moral progress, and character has to be built up.&lt;ref name="davidson615"/&gt;

===''On Passions''===
{{Main|On Passions}}
The Stoics sought to be free of the [[Stoic passions|unruly emotions]], which they regarded as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (''pathe'') are the disturbing element in right judgment.&lt;ref name="davidson615"/&gt; Chrysippus wrote a whole book, ''On Passions'' ({{lang-el|Περὶ παθῶν}}), concerning the therapy of the emotions.&lt;ref name="gould186"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (''[[apatheia]]'').&lt;ref name="gould186"/&gt; Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop.&lt;ref name="sharples68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm.&lt;ref name="gould187"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present.&lt;ref name="gould188"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.&lt;ref name="gould188"/&gt;

In [[astronomy]] and [[astrobiology]], the '''circumstellar habitable zone''' ('''CHZ'''), or simply the '''habitable zone''', is the range of [[orbit]]s around a [[star]] within which a [[planetary surface]] can support [[liquid water]] given sufficient [[atmospheric pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;Su-Shu Huang, American Scientist 47, 3, pp. 397–402 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dole-1964&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB179-1.html |title=Habitable Planets for Man |publisher=Blaisdell Publishing Company |last=Dole |first=Stephen H. |date=1964 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F.

Due to the importance of liquid water to Earth's [[biosphere]], the [[planetary habitability|nature of the CHZ]] and the objects within it may be instrumental in determining the scope and distribution of Earth-like [[extraterrestrial life]] and [[extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligence]].

The habitable zone is also called the '''Goldilocks zone''', a metaphor of the children's [[fairy tale]] of "[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]", in which a little girl chooses from sets of three items, ignoring the ones that are too extreme (large or small, hot or cold, etc.), and settling on the one in the middle, which is "just right".

In subsequent decades, the CHZ concept began to be challenged as a primary criterion for life, so the concept is still evolving.&lt;ref name="Review 2009"/&gt;  Since the discovery of evidence for [[extraterrestrial liquid water]], substantial quantities of it are now thought to occur outside the circumstellar habitable zone.

==History==
An estimate of the range of distances from the Sun allowing the existence of liquid water appears in [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (Book III, Section 1, corol. 4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/newton/book3s1.pdf 3rd Edition (1728), trans Bruce, I]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a circumstellar habitable zone was first introduced in 1953 by [[Hubertus Strughold]], who in his treatise ''The Green and the Red Planet: A Physiological Study of the Possibility of Life on Mars'', coined the term "ecosphere" and referred to various "zones" in which life could emerge.&lt;ref name=huggett-1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=strughold-1953&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_green_and_red_planet.html?id=zNbPAAAAMAAJ |title=The Green and Red Planet: A Physiological Study of the Possibility of Life on Mars |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |author=Strughold, Hubertus |date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Harlow Shapley]] wrote "Liquid Water Belt", which described the same theory in further scientific detail. Both works stressed the importance of liquid water to life.&lt;ref name="Kasting2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kasting, James|title=How to Find a Habitable Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPqEeB-SRvUC|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13805-3|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Su-Shu Huang]], an American astrophysicist, first introduced the term "habitable zone" in 1959 to refer to the area around a star where liquid water could exist on a sufficiently large body, and was the first to introduce it in the context of planetary habitability and extraterrestrial life.&lt;ref name=kasting-1993&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103583710109 |title=Habitable Zones around Main Sequence Stars |author1=Kasting, James F. |author2=Whitmire, Daniel P. |author3=Reynolds, Ray T. |journal=Icarus |date=January 1993 |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=108–118 |doi=10.1006/icar.1993.1010 |bibcode=1993Icar..101..108K |pmid=11536936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huang-1966&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0UrAAAAYAAJ |title=Extraterrestrial life: An Anthology and Bibliography |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |author=Huang, Su-Shu |date=1966 |location=Washington, D. C. |pages=87–93 |others=National Research Council (U.S.). Study Group on Biology and the Exploration of Mars}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major early contributor to habitable zone theory, Huang argued in 1960 that circumstellar habitable zones, and by extension extraterrestrial life, would be uncommon in [[multiple star system]]s, given the gravitational instabilities of those systems.&lt;ref name=huang-1960&gt;{{cite journal |title=Life-Supporting Regions in the Vicinity of Binary Systems |author=Huang, Su-Shu |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |date=April 1960 |volume=72 |issue=425 |pages=106–114 |bibcode=1960PASP...72..106H |doi=10.1086/127489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of habitable zones was further developed in 1964 by [[Stephen H. Dole]] in his book ''Habitable Planets for Man'', in which he discussed the concept of circumstellar habitable zone as well as various other determinants of planetary habitability, eventually guestimating the number of habitable planets in the Milky Way to be about 600 million.&lt;ref name="dole-1964"/&gt; At the same time, science-fiction author [[Isaac Asimov]] introduced the concept of a circumstellar habitable zone to the general public through his various explorations of [[space colonization]].&lt;ref name=gilster-2004&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Centauri_Dreams.html?id=L4fffd3SivkC |title=Centauri Dreams: Imagining and Planning Interstellar Exploration |publisher=Springer |author=Gilster, Paul |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-00436-5 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[Goldilocks principle|Goldilocks zone]]" emerged in the 1970s, referencing specifically a region around a star whose temperature is "just right" for water to be present in the liquid phase.&lt;ref name=nasa-2003&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/02oct_goldilocks/ |title=The Goldilocks Zone |publisher=NASA |date=October 2, 2003 |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, astronomer [[James Kasting]] introduced the term "circumstellar habitable zone" to refer more precisely to the region then (and still) known as the habitable zone.&lt;ref name=kasting-1993 /&gt; Kasting was the first to present a detailed model for the habitable zone for exoplanets.&lt;ref name="F. Kasting, D. P 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seager 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exoplanet Habitability |journal=Science |year=2013 |last=Seager |first=Sara |volume=340 |issue=577 |pages=577–581 |doi=10.1126/science.1232226 |pmid=23641111 |bibcode=2013Sci...340..577S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An update to habitable zone theory came in 2000, when astronomers [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Donald Brownlee]] introduced the idea of the "[[galactic habitable zone]]", which they later developed with [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]].&lt;ref name="Rare Earth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gonzalez-2001&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Galactic Habitable Zone I. Galactic Chemical Evolution |author1=Gonzalez, Guillermo |author2=Brownlee, Donald |author3=Ward, Peter |journal=Icarus |date=July 2001 |volume=152 |issue=1 |pages=185–200 |doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6617 |arxiv=astro-ph/0103165|bibcode = 2001Icar..152..185G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The galactic habitable zone, defined as the region where life is most likely to emerge in a galaxy, encompasses those regions close enough to a [[galactic center]] that stars there are enriched with [[metallicity|heavier elements]], but not so close that star systems, planetary orbits, and the emergence of life would be frequently disrupted by the intense radiation and enormous gravitational forces commonly found at galactic centers.&lt;ref name="Rare Earth"/&gt;

Subsequently, some astrobiologists propose that the concept be extended to other solvents, including dihydrogen, sulfuric acid, dinitrogen, formamide, and methane, among others, which would support hypothetical life forms that use an [[alternative biochemistry]].&lt;ref name=villard-2011 /&gt; In 2013, further developments in habitable zone theory were made with the proposal of a circum''planetary'' habitable zone, also known as the "habitable edge", to encompass the region around a planet where the orbits of natural satellites would not be disrupted, and at the same time tidal heating from the planet would not cause liquid water to boil away.&lt;ref name=hadhazy-2013&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/5364/the-habitable-edge-of-exomoons |title=The 'Habitable Edge' of Exomoons |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=April 3, 2013 |agency=NASA |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |author=Hadhazy, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a body is in the circumstellar habitable zone of its host star is dependent on the radius of the planet's orbit (for natural satellites, the host planet's orbit), the mass of the body itself, and the radiative flux of the host star. Given the large spread in the masses of planets within a circumstellar habitable zone, coupled with the discovery of super-Earth planets which can sustain thicker atmospheres and stronger magnetic fields than Earth, circumstellar habitable zones are now split into two separate regions—a "conservative habitable zone" in which lower-mass planets like Earth or Venus can remain habitable, complemented by a larger "extended habitable zone" in which super-Earth planets, with stronger [[greenhouse effect]]s, can have the right temperature for liquid water to exist at the surface.&lt;ref name=redd-2011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/4174/greenhouse-effect-could-extend-habitable-zone |title=Greenhouse Effect Could Extend Habitable Zone |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=25 August 2011 |agency=NASA |accessdate=25 June 2013 |author=Redd, Nola Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar System estimates===
Estimates for the habitable zone within the Solar System range from 0.38 to 10.0 [[astronomical units]],&lt;ref name=zsom-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name= rayeric-2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name= rk-2017 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/naivpl/sites/default/files/hz.shtml| title=Stellar habitable zone calculator| publisher=[[University of Washington]]| accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though arriving at these estimates has been challenging for a variety of reasons. Numerous planetary mass objects orbit within, or close to, this range and as such receive sufficient sunlight to raise temperatures above the freezing point of water. However their atmospheric conditions vary substantially. The aphelion of Venus, for example, touches the inner edge of the zone and while atmospheric pressure at the surface is sufficient for liquid water, a strong greenhouse effect raises surface temperatures to {{convert|462|C|F}} at which water can only exist as vapour.&lt;ref name=venus-2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burro.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/venus.html |title=Venus |publisher=Case Western Reserve University |date=13 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426064658/http://burro.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/venus.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire orbits of the [[Moon]],&lt;ref name=sharp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/18067-moon-atmosphere.html |title=Atmosphere of the Moon |publisher=TechMediaNetwork |work=Space.com |accessdate=April 23, 2013 |author=Sharp, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mars]],&lt;ref name="bolonkin09"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Alexander A.|last=Bolonkin|date=2009|title=Artificial Environments on Mars|publisher=Springer |place=Berlin Heidelberg|pages=599–625|isbn=978-3-642-03629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous asteroids also lie within various estimates of the habitable zone.

Since sustainable liquid water is thought to be essential to support complex life, most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus as their surface gravity allows sufficient atmosphere to be retained for several billion years.

According to extended habitable zone theory, planetary mass objects with atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther out from the Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth ([[super-Earth]] class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough is known about the nature of atmospheres of these kinds of extrasolar objects, and the net temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced albedo, anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources cannot be determined by their position in the habitable zone.

For reference, the average distance from the Sun of some major bodies within the various estimates of the habitable zone are: Mercury, 0.39 AU; Venus, 0.72 AU; Earth, 1.00 AU; Mars, 1.52 AU; Vesta, 2.36 AU; Ceres, 2.77 AU; Jupiter, 5.20 AU; Saturn, 9.58 AU.

===Extrasolar extrapolation===
{{see also|Habitability of red dwarf systems|Habitability of orange dwarf systems}}
Astronomers use stellar flux and the [[inverse-square law]] to extrapolate circumstellar habitable zone models created for the Solar System to other stars. For example, although the Solar System has a circumstellar habitable zone centered at 1.34 AU from the Sun,&lt;ref name="kopparapu-2013" /&gt; a star with 0.25 times the luminosity of the Sun would have a habitable zone centered at &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{0.25}&lt;/math&gt;, or 0.5, the distance from the star, corresponding to a distance of 0.67 AU. Various complicating factors, though, including the individual characteristics of stars themselves, mean that extrasolar extrapolation of the CHZ concept is more complex.

====Spectral types and star-system characteristics====
[[File:Circling Two Suns.ogv|thumb|300px|A video explaining the significance of the 2011 discovery of a planet in the circumbinary habitable zone of Kepler-47.]]
Some scientists argue that the concept of a circumstellar habitable zone is actually limited to stars in certain types of systems or of certain [[spectral type]]s.

With regard to spectral types, [[Zoltán Balog (astronomer)|Zoltán Balog]] proposes that [[O-type stars]] cannot form planets due to the [[photoevaporation]] caused by their strong [[ultraviolet]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/news/863-feature06-31-Planets-Prefer-Safe-Neighborhoods |title=Planets Prefer Safe Neighborhoods |publisher=Spitzer.caltech.edu |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |author=Vu, Linda |agency=NASA/Caltech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying ultraviolet emissions, Andrea Buccino found that only 40% of stars studied (including the Sun) had overlapping liquid water and ultraviolet habitable zones.&lt;ref name="BuccinoLemarchand2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Buccino|first1=Andrea P.|last2=Lemarchand|first2=Guillermo A.|last3=Mauas|first3=Pablo J.D.| title=Ultraviolet radiation constraints around the circumstellar habitable zones| journal=Icarus| volume=183| issue=2|date=2006|pages=491–503|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.03.007|arxiv = astro-ph/0512291 |bibcode = 2006Icar..183..491B |citeseerx=10.1.1.337.8642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stars smaller than the Sun, on the other hand, have distinct impediments to habitability. For example, Michael Hart proposed that only main-sequence stars of [[spectral class]] [[K-type main-sequence star|K0]] or brighter could offer habitable zones, an idea which has evolved in modern times into the concept of a [[tidal locking]] radius for [[red dwarf]]s. Within this radius, which is coincidental with the red-dwarf habitable zone, it has been suggested that the volcanism caused by tidal heating could cause a "tidal Venus" planet with high temperatures and no hospitable environment to life.&lt;ref name=barnes-2013&gt;{{cite journal |title=Habitable Planets Around White and Brown Dwarfs: The Perils of a Cooling Primary |journal=Astrobiology |date=March 2013 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=279–291 |doi=10.1089/ast.2012.0867 |arxiv=1203.5104 |last1=Barnes |first1=Rory |last2=Heller |first2=René |pmid=23537137 |pmc=3612282|bibcode = 2013AsBio..13..279B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others maintain that circumstellar habitable zones are more common, and that it is indeed possible for water to exist on planets orbiting cooler stars. Climate modelling from 2013 supports the idea that red dwarf stars can support planets with relatively constant temperatures over their surfaces in spite of tidal locking.&lt;ref name=yang-2013 /&gt; Astronomy professor {{ill|Eric Agol|de}} argues that even [[white dwarf]]s may support a relatively brief habitable zone through planetary migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/731/2/L31/ |title=Transit Surveys for Earths in the Habitable Zones of White Dwarfs |author=Agol, Eric |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |date=April 2011 |volume=731 |issue=2 |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/731/2/L31 |arxiv=1103.2791|bibcode = 2011ApJ...731L..31A }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, others have written in similar support of semi-stable, temporary habitable zones around [[brown dwarf]]s.&lt;ref name=barnes-2013 /&gt; Also, a habitable zone in the outer parts of stellar systems may exist during the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution, especially around M-dwarfs, potentially lasting for billion-year timescales.&lt;ref name=rk-2014&gt;{{cite journal |title=Habitable Zones of Pre-Main-Sequence Stars |last=Ramirez |first=Ramses |date=2014 |arxiv=1412.1764|last2=Kaltenegger |first2=Lisa |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/797/2/L25 |volume=797 |issue=2 |pages=L25 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|bibcode=2014ApJ...797L..25R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Desert planets====
A planet's atmospheric conditions influence its ability to retain heat, so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: [[desert planet]]s (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced [[greenhouse effect]], meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/4188/alien-life-more-likely-on-%E2%80%98dune%E2%80%99-planets Alien Life More Likely on 'Dune' Planets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223111/http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/4188/alien-life-more-likely-on-%E2%80%98dune%E2%80%99-planets |date=December 2, 2013 }}, 09/01/11, Charles Q.

Although traditional definitions of the habitable zone assume that carbon dioxide and water vapor are the most important greenhouse gases (as they are on the Earth),&lt;ref name=kasting-1993 /&gt; a study&lt;ref name="rk-2017"/&gt; led by Ramses Ramirez and co-author Lisa Kaltenegger has shown that the size of the habitable zone is greatly increased if prodigious volcanic outgassing of hydrogen is also included along with the carbon dioxide and water vapor. The outer edge in our solar system would extend out as far as 2.4 AU in that case. Similar increases in the size of the habitable zone were computed for other stellar systems. An earlier study by Ray Pierrehumbert and Eric Gaidos &lt;ref name=rayeric-2011&gt;{{cite journal |title=

In this case, though, the hydrogen is not continuously replenished by volcanism, and is lost within millions to tens-of-millions of years.

In the case of planets orbiting in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause [[tidal locking]], an important factor in habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the [[sidereal day]] is as long as the [[orbital period]], causing one side to permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its [[bond albedo]] and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.&lt;ref name=yang-2013&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = J. | last2 = Cowan | first2 = N.

Planetary-mass [[exomoon|natural satellites]] have the potential to be habitable as well. However, these bodies need to fulfill additional parameters, in particular being located within the circumplanetary habitable zones of their host planets.&lt;ref name=hadhazy-2013 /&gt; More specifically, moons need to be far enough from their host giant planets that they are not transformed by tidal heating into volcanic worlds like [[Io (moon)|Io]],&lt;ref name=hadhazy-2013 /&gt; but must still remain within the [[Hill radius]] of the planet so that they are not pulled out of orbit of their host planet.&lt;ref name="HamiltonBurns92"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.P.

[[File:Eccentric Habitable Zones.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of a planet on an eccentric orbit that passes through the CHZ for only part of its orbit]]
A planetary object that orbits a star with high [[orbital eccentricity]] may spend only some of its year in the CHZ and experience a large variation in temperature and atmospheric pressure. This would result in dramatic seasonal phase shifts where liquid water may exist only intermittently. It is possible that subsurface habitats could be insulated from such changes and that extremophiles on or near the surface might survive through adaptions such as hibernation ([[cryptobiosis]]) and/or [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermostability]].

Studies that have attempted to estimate the number of terrestrial planets within the circumstellar habitable zone tend to reflect the availability of scientific data. A 2013 study by Ravi Kumar Kopparapu put ''η&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', the fraction of stars with planets in the CHZ, at 0.48,&lt;ref name="kopparapu-2013" /&gt; meaning that there may be roughly 95–180 billion habitable planets in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=wethington-2008&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/22380/how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way/ |title=How Many Stars are in the Milky Way? |work=Universe Today |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2013 |author=Wethington, Nicholos}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is merely a statistical prediction; only a small fraction of these possible planets have yet been discovered.&lt;ref name=torres-2013-2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/press-releases/tenpotentiallyhabitableexoplanetsnow |title=Ten potentially habitable exoplanets now |publisher=University of Puerto Rico |work=Habitable Exoplanets Catalog |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |author=Torres, Abel Mendez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous studies have been more conservative.

===Early findings===
{{Category see also|Giant planets in the habitable zone}}
The first discoveries of extrasolar planets in the CHZ occurred just a few years after the first extrasolar planets were discovered. However these early detections were all gas giant sized, and many in eccentric orbits. Despite this, studies indicate the possibility of large, Earth-like moons around these planets supporting liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=105145|author1=Williams, D. |author2=Pollard, D. | title=Earth-like worlds on eccentric orbits: excursions beyond the habitable zone| journal=International Journal of Astrobiology| volume=1|issue=1|pages=61–69|date=2002| doi=10.1017/S1473550402001064|bibcode = 2002IJAsB...1...61W }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the first discoveries was [[70 Virginis b]], a gas giant initially nicknamed "Goldilocks" due to it being neither "too hot" nor "too cold." Later study revealed temperatures analogous to Venus, ruling out any potential for liquid water.&lt;ref name="Extrasolar.net"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.extrasolar.net/planettour.asp?PlanetID=22 |title = 70 Virginis b |work = Extrasolar Planet Guide |publisher = Extrasolar.net |accessdate = 2009-04-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619015814/http://www.extrasolar.net/planettour.asp?PlanetID=22 |archivedate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[16 Cygni Bb]], also discovered in 1996, has an extremely eccentric orbit that spends only part of its time in the CHZ, such an orbit would causes extreme [[season]]al effects. In spite of this, simulations have suggested that a sufficiently large companion could support surface water year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=105145 |author1=Williams, D. |author2=Pollard, D. | title=Earth-like worlds on eccentric orbits: excursions beyond the habitable zone| journal=International Journal of Astrobiology| volume=1|issue=1|pages=61–69|date=2002|doi=10.1017/S1473550402001064|bibcode = 2002IJAsB...1...61W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gliese 876 b]], discovered in 1998, and [[Gliese 876 c]], discovered in 2001, are both gas giants discovered in the habitable zone around [[Gliese 876]] that may also have large moons.&lt;ref name="Sudarsky2003"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/588/2/1121/fulltext |last1=Sudarsky |first1=David |last2=Burrows |first2=Adam |last3=Hubeny |first3=Ivan |display-authors=1 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=588 |issue=2 |pages=1121–1148 |date=2003 |doi=10.1086/374331 |bibcode=2003ApJ...588.1121S |arxiv=astro-ph/0210216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another gas giant, [[Upsilon Andromedae d]] was discovered in 1999 orbiting Upsilon Andromidae's habitable zone.

Though in theory such giant planets could possess moons, the technology did not exist to detect moons around them, and no extrasolar moons had been detected. Planets within the zone with the potential for solid surfaces were therefore of much greater interest.

===Near Earth-sized planets and Solar analogs===

[[File:Kepler-452b System.jpg|thumb|right|While larger than Kepler 186f, Kepler-452b's orbit and star are more similar to Earth's.]]
Recent discoveries have uncovered planets that are thought to be similar in size or mass to Earth. While there is no universal definition of "Earth-sized", ranges are typically defined by mass. The lower range used in many definitions of the super-Earth class is 1.9 Earth masses; likewise, sub-Earths range up to the size of Venus (~0.815 Earth masses). An upper limit of 1.5 Earth radii is also considered, given that above {{Earth radius|1.5|link=y}} the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren M. Weiss, and Geoffrey W. Marcy. "[https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0936 The mass-radius relation for 65 exoplanets smaller than 4 Earth radii]"&lt;/ref&gt; A truly Earth-like planet, an [[Earth analog]] or "Earth twin", would need to meet many conditions beyond size and mass; such properties are not observable using current technology.

A [[solar analog]] (or "solar twin") is a star that resembles the Sun. To date no solar twin with an exact match as that of the Sun has been found, however, there are some stars that are nearly identical to the Sun, and are such considered solar twins. An exact solar twin would be a G2V star with a 5,778 K temperature, be 4.6 billion years old, with the correct metallicity and a 0.1% [[solar luminosity]] variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08jan_sunclimate/|title=Solar Variability and Terrestrial Climate  |date=2013-01-08|publisher=NASA Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stars with an age of 4.6 billion years are at the most stable state. Proper metallicity and size are also very important to low luminosity variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/stellarprops/stellarlum.html|title=Stellar Luminosity Calculator|publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln astronomy education group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13519/the-effects-of-solar-variability-on-earths-climate-a-workshop|title=The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate: A Workshop Report|first=National Research|last=Council|date=18 September 2012|publisher=|doi=10.17226/13519|isbn=978-0-309-26564-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/05/most-of-earths-twins-arent-identical-or-even-close/ Most of Earth's twins aren't identical, or even close!], By Ethan.

==Habitability outside the CHZ==
[[Image:Liquid lakes on titan.jpg|thumb|upright|The discovery of hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn's moon Titan has begun to call into question the [[carbon chauvinism]] that underpins CHZ theory.]]
Liquid-water environments have been found to exist in the absence of atmospheric pressure, and at temperatures outside the CHZ temperature range. For example, [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Enceladus]] and [[Jupiter]]'s moons [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], all of which are outside the habitable zone, may hold large volumes of liquid water in [[subsurface ocean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://phl.upr.edu/library/media/liquidwaterinthesolarsystem |title = Liquid Water in the Solar System |accessdate = 2013-12-15 |last = Torres |first = Abel |date = 2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the CHZ, [[tidal heating]] and [[radioactive decay]] are two possible heat sources that could contribute to the existence of liquid water.&lt;ref name="Cowen2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryner, Jeanna"/&gt; Abbot and Switzer (2011) put forward the possibility that subsurface water could exist on [[rogue planet]]s as a result of radioactive decay-based heating and insulation by a thick surface layer of ice.&lt;ref name="physcisarxivlab-2011"/&gt;

Another possibility is that outside the CHZ organisms may use [[alternative biochemistry|alternative biochemistries]] that do not require water at all. Astrobiologist [[Christopher McKay]], has suggested that [[methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) may be a solvent conducive to the development of "cryolife", with the Sun's "methane habitable zone" being centered on {{convert|1610000000|km|mi AU|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} from the star.&lt;ref name=villard-2011 /&gt; This distance is coincident with the location of Titan, whose lakes and rain of methane make it an ideal location to find McKay's proposed cryolife.&lt;ref name=villard-2011 /&gt; In addition, [[list of microorganisms tested in outer space|testing of a number of organisms]] has found some are capable of surviving in extra-CHZ conditions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Significance for complex and intelligent life==
The [[Rare Earth hypothesis]] argues that complex and intelligent life is uncommon and that the CHZ is one of many critical factors. According to Ward &amp; Brownlee (2004) and others, not only is a CHZ orbit and surface water a primary requirement to sustain life but a requirement to support the secondary conditions required for [[multicellular life]] to emerge and evolve. The secondary habitability factors are both geological (the role of surface water in sustaining necessary plate tectonics)&lt;ref name="Rare Earth"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Brownlee, Donald |author2=Ward, Peter |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |location=New York |date=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-387-95289-5|oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biochemical (the role of radiant energy in supporting photosynthesis for necessary atmospheric oxygenation).&lt;ref name="DeckerHolde2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Decker |first1=Heinz |last2=Holde |first2=Kensal E. |chapter=Oxygen and the Exploration of the Universe |title=Oxygen and the Evolution of Life |date=2011 |pages=157–168 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13179-0_9 |isbn=978-3-642-13178-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; But others, such as [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] in their 2002 book ''[[Evolving the Alien]]'' argue that complex intelligent life may arise outside the CHZ.&lt;ref name=cohen-2002&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolving the Alien |publisher=Ebury Press |author1=Stewart, Ian |author2=Cohen, Jack |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-09-187927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent life outside the CHZ may have evolved in subsurface environments, from alternative biochemistries&lt;ref name=cohen-2002 /&gt; or even from nuclear reactions.&lt;ref name="GO247"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45844">'''Civil resistance''' is political action that relies on the use of [[nonviolent resistance]] by civil groups to challenge a particular power, force, policy or [[regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the use of the term "civil resistance" include [[Erica Chenoweth]] and Maria J. Stephan, [http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-15682-0/why-civil-resistance-works ''Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict''], Columbia University Press, New York, 2011; Howard Clark, [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Civil+Resistance+in+Kosovo ''Civil Resistance in Kosovo''], Pluto Press, London, 2000; Sharon Erickson Nepstad, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Sociology/SocialMovementSocialChange/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199778218 ''Nonviolent Revolution: Civil Resistance in the Late 20th Century''], Oxford University Press, New York, 2011; [[Michael Randle]], [http://www.civilresistance.info/randle1994 ''Civil Resistance''], Fontana, London, 1994; [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], [http://www.aeinstein.org/english/ ''Civil Resistance in the East European and Soviet Revolutions''], Albert Einstein Institution, Massachusetts, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil resistance operates through appeals to the adversary, pressure and coercion: it can involve systematic attempts to undermine the adversary's sources of power, both domestic and international. Forms of action have included demonstrations, vigils and petitions; strikes, go-slows, boycotts and emigration movements; and sit-ins, occupations, and the creation of parallel institutions of government. Civil resistance movements' motivations for avoiding violence are generally related to context, including a society's values and its experience of war and violence, rather than to any absolute ethical principle. Cases of civil resistance can be found throughout history and in many modern struggles, against both tyrannical rulers and democratically elected governments.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;This is abstracted from the longer definition of "civil resistance" in Adam Roberts, Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 2–3. See also the short definition in Gene Sharp, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Reference/Subjectareareference/SocialSciences/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199829897 ''Sharp's Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Language of Civil Resistance in Conflicts''], Oxford University Press, New York, 2011, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of civil resistance is often associated with the advancement of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the report by Peter Ackerman, Adrian Karatnycky and others, ''How Freedom is Won. From Civil Resistance to Durable Democracy'', Freedom House, New York, 2005 [http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/29.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil resistance is a long-standing and widespread phenomenon in human history. Several works on civil resistance adopt a historical approach to the analysis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009. Include chapters by specialists on nineteen movements between 1917 and 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of civil resistance, both successful and unsuccessful, include:
* [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s role in the [[Indian independence movement]] in 1917–47
* [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1955–68
* Aspects of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in 1967–72
* the [[Carnation Revolution|Revolution of the Carnations]] in [[Portugal]] in 1974–5, supporting the military coup of 25 April 1974
* the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1977–79, before [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini's]] advent to power in February 1979
* the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] in the 1980s that ousted President [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]]
* the campaigns against [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid in South Africa]], especially before 1961, and during the period of 1983–94.
* the mass mobilization against authoritarian rule in Pinochet's [[Chile]], 1983–88
* the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in [[China]] 
* the various movements contributing to the [[revolutions of 1989]] in central and eastern Europe, and to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 
* the campaign against Serbian domination in [[Kosovo]], 1990–98, that was followed by war
* the revolutions in [[Bulldozer Revolution|Serbia]] in 2000, [[Rose Revolution|Georgia]] in 2003, and [[Orange Revolution|Ukraine]] in 2004, all of which involved successful resistance against an incumbent government that had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election and had sought to falsify the election results
* the [[Cedar Revolution]] in [[Lebanon]] in 2005, following the assassination of former prime minister [[Rafic Hariri]] on 14 February 2005, and calling for Syrian military withdrawal from Lebanon
* the demonstrations, mainly led by students and monks, in the [[Saffron Revolution]] in [[Myanmar|Burma]] in 2007
* the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests]] following evidence of electoral manipulation in the elections of June 2009

* the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, starting in [[Tunisia]] in December 2010, and resulting, in 2011, in the fall of rulers in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. In some countries the movements were followed by war (e.g. [[Syrian Civil War]] and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015)|War in Yemen]]) or by a return to military rule, as in [[Egypt]] in 2013 following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]] 
* the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M or ''Indignados'' movement]], which included the peaceful occupation of squares all over Spain in May-June 2011, and a mosaic of other forms of civil disobedience by many of the groups that were created, or strengthened, after the squares occupations. In particular the [[Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca|Platform for People Affected by Mortgages, or PAH]]. 
* the [[Gezi Park protests]] in [[Turkey]] in 2013, in opposition to urban development plans, and also to government encroachments on freedom of expression and on Turkey's secularist traditions
* the early phases of the [[Euromaidan]] protests in [[Ukraine]] in 2013–14, demanding closer integration with European Union countries, and the resignation of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]
* the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], also known as "Occupy Central" and the "Umbrella movement", opposing the [[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform]] in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
* Women's marches in USA from January [[2017 Women's March]] onwards to resist President Donald Trump's allegedly sexist policies. 

Numerous other campaigns, both successful and unsuccessful, could be included in a longer listing. In 1967 [[Gene Sharp]] produced a list of 84 cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Sharp]], "The Technique of Non-violent Action", in Adam Roberts (ed.), ''The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression'', Faber, London, 1967, at pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with further surveys.&lt;ref&gt;See for example his discussion of "Illustrations from the Past" in Gene Sharp, ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'' (see [[The Politics of Nonviolent Action|article]]), Porter Sargent, Boston, 1973, pp. 75–97; and his short accounts of numerous cases in Gene Sharp and others, ''Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 2005, pp. 69–356.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Maciej Bartkowski authored a long list of cases in the past 200 years, arranged alphabetically by country.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix: Conflict Summaries", in Maciej J. Bartkowski (ed.), ''Recovering Nonviolent History: Civil Resistance in Liberation Struggles'', Lynne Rienner, Boulder, Colorado, 2013, pp. 355–405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
It is not easy to devise a method of proving the relative success of different methods of struggle. Often there are problems in identifying a given campaign as successful or otherwise. In 2008 Maria J. Stephan and [[Erica Chenoweth]] produced a widely-noted article on "Why Civil Resistance Works", the most thorough and detailed analysis (to that date) of the rate of success of civil resistance campaigns, as compared to violent resistance campaigns. After looking at over 300 cases of both types of campaign, from 1900 to 2006, they concluded that "nonviolent resistance methods are likely to be more successful than violent methods in achieving strategic objectives". Their article (later developed into a book) noted particularly that "resistance campaigns that compel loyalty shifts among security forces and civilian bureaucrats are likely to succeed".&lt;ref&gt;Maria J. Stephan and Erica Chenoweth, "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", ''International Security'', vol. 33, no. 1 (Summer 2008), p. 42. {{ISSN|0162-2889}}[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18407/why_civil_resistance_works.html]. (See also their 2011 book, ''Why Civil Resistance Works'', listed below in the bibliography.)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the evidence of several of the 2011 uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa appears to provide contrasting pathways by which this logic may fail to materialise, with splits in the armed forces contributing towards civil war in Libya and Syria, and a shift in armed forces loyalty in Egypt failing to contribute towards enduring democratic reform.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Davies, "The failure of strategic nonviolent action in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya and Syria: ‘political ju-jitsu’ in reverse", ''Global Change, Peace and Security'', vol. 26, no. 3 (2014), pp. 299–313. {{ISSN|1478-1158}} {{DOI|10.1080/14781158.2014.924916}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of the central thesis of the book on ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' have included: 
# Forming judgements about whether a campaign is a success or failure is inherently difficult: the answer may depend on the time-frame used, and on necessarily subjective judgments about what constitutes success. Some of the authors' decisions on this are debatable. Similar difficulties arise in deciding whether a campaign is violent or non-violent, when on the ground both strategies may co-exist in several ways.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Masullo Jimenez, review of ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' on ''Global Policy'' website, 29 November 2013.

# Perhaps, more generally, sufficient account is not taken of the possibility that violence often takes place in circumstances that were already violent and chaotic, stacking the odds against any successful outcome for violence.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, "Terrorism Research: Past, Present and Future", ''Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism'', vol. 38, no. 1, January 2015, pp. 62–74. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2014.976011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for choosing to use civil resistance==
[[File:Aung San Suu Kyi greeting supporters from Bago State.jpg|thumb|[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burmese pro-democracy leader, greeting supporters from Bago State, Burma, 14 August 2011. She has stated that she was attracted to non-violent civil resistance, not on moral grounds, but "on practical political grounds". ''Photo: Htoo Tay Zar'']]Some leaders of civil resistance struggles have urged the use of non-violent methods for primarily ethical reasons, while others have emphasized practical considerations. Some have indicated that both of these types of factor have to be taken into account – and that they necessarily overlap.

In his chapter on "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence" [[Martin Luther King]] gave a notably multi-faceted account of the various considerations, experiences and influences that constituted his "intellectual odyssey to nonviolence". By 1954 this had led to the intellectual conviction that "nonviolent resistance was one of the most potent weapons available to oppressed people in their quest for social justice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Luther King]], ''Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story'', Ballantine Books, New York, 1960, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have opted for civil resistance when they were in opposition to the government, but then have later, when in government, adopted or accepted very different policies and methods of action. For example, in one of her [[BBC]] [[Reith Lectures]], first broadcast in July 2011, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the pro-democracy campaigner in [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma), stated: "Gandhi's teachings on non-violent civil resistance and the way in which he had put his theories into practice have become part of the working manual of those who would change authoritarian administrations through peaceful means. I was attracted to the way of non-violence, but not on moral grounds, as some believe. Only on practical political grounds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], second BBC Reith Lecture, "Dissent", first broadcast 5 July 2011, transcript available at  [http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/2011_reith2.pdf BBC website].&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, as State Counsellor of Myanmar from 2016 onwards, she incurred much criticism, especially in connection with the failure to prevent, and to condemn, the killings and expulsions of the [[Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]].

==Relationship to other forms of power==
The experience of civil resistance suggests that it can at least partially replace other forms of power. Some have seen civil resistance as offering, potentially, a complete alternative to power politics. The core vision is of non-violent methods replacing armed force in many or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Sharp]], ''Social Power and Political Freedom'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 1980, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers, while sharing the vision of civil resistance as progressively overcoming the use of force, have warned against a narrowly instrumental view of non-violent action. For example, [[Joan Bondurant|Joan V. Bondurant]], a specialist on the Gandhian philosophy of conflict, indicated concern about "the symbolic violence of those who engage in conflict with techniques which they, at least, perceive to be nonviolent." She saw Gandhian satyagraha as a form of "creative conflict" and as "contrasted both to violence and to methods not violent or just short of violence".&lt;ref&gt;Joan V. Bondurant, "Creative Conflict and the Limits of Symbolic Violence" in Bondurant (ed.), ''Conflict: Violence and Nonviolence'', Aldine, Chicago, 1971, pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally difficult in practice to separate out entirely the use of civil resistance and power-political considerations of various kinds. One frequently-encountered aspect of this problem is that regimes facing opposition taking the form of civil resistance often launch verbal attacks on the opposition in terms designed to suggest that civil resistance is simply a front for more sinister forces. It has sometimes been attacked as being planned and directed from abroad, and as intimately connected to terrorism, imperialism, communism etc. A classic case was the Soviet accusation that the 1968 Prague Spring, and the civil resistance after the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968, were the result of Western machinations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 21–23 (chapter by Roberts), 93 (Kramer) and 386n. (Garton Ash).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, President [[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria, in March 2011, accused "enemies" of using "very sophisticated tools" to undermine Syria's stability; and President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia, in speeches in 2014, described events in Ukraine and the Arab countries as foreign-influenced.&lt;ref&gt;These accusations by Presidents Assad and Putin are cited and discussed in Adam Roberts, Michael J. Willis, Rory McCarthy and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oqXTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105 ''Civil Resistance in the Arab Spring: Triumphs and Disasters''], Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2016, pp. 277–80, 314–17 (chapter by Roberts).&lt;/ref&gt; Such accusations of sinister power-political involvement are often presented without convincing evidence.

There can be some more plausible connections between civil resistance and other forms of power. Although civil resistance can sometimes be a substitute for other forms of power, it can also operate in conjunction with them. Such conjunction is never problem-free. Michael Randle has identified a core difficulty regarding strategies that seek to combine the use of violent and non-violent methods in the same campaign: "The obvious problem about employing a mixed strategy ''in the course of an actual struggle'' is that the dynamics of military and civil resistance are at some levels diametrically opposed to each other."&lt;ref&gt;Randle, ''Civil Resistance'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the connections between civil resistance and other forms of power are not limited to the idea of a "mixed strategy". They can assume many forms.&lt;ref&gt;A pioneering exploration of certain examples of connections between non-violent resistance and other forms of power is in Kurt Schock, [https://www.amazon.com/Unarmed-Insurrections-Movements-Nondemocracies-Contention/dp/0816641935 ''Unarmed Insurrections: People Power Movements in Nondemocracies''], Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005, especially at pp. 153–62. A more general discussion of this question is in Adam Roberts, "Introduction", in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], especially at pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight ways in which civil resistance can in practice relate to other forms of power are identified here, with examples in each case:
#Civil resistance is often a response to changes in constellations of power. Leaders of civil resistance campaigns have often been acutely aware of power-political developments, both domestic and international.&lt;ref&gt;Schock, ''Unarmed Insurrections'', pp. 154–56.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries there has been a growth of civil opposition after, and perhaps in part because of, an occupying or colonial state's internal political turmoil or setbacks in war: for example, this was a key factor in the Finnish struggle of 1898–1905 against Russian control.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Duncan Huxley, ''Constitutional Insurgency in Finland: Finnish "Passive Resistance" against Russification as a Case of Nonmilitary Struggle in the European Resistance Tradition'', SHS, Helsinki, 1990, p. 225, where Jonas Castrén, a key figure in the constitutional insurgency, is cited as emphasizing the central importance of understanding current events in Russia and their importance for the Finnish struggle. "He exclaimed that now was the time for Finns to rise up in mass struggle."&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries the problems faced by their own armed forces, whether against conventional armies or guerrillas, played some part in the development of civil resistance: for example, in the [[People Power Revolution]] in the Philippines in 1983–86.&lt;ref&gt;Amado Mendoza, "‘People Power'" in the Philippines, 1983–86’ in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 179–96, where he discusses at pp. 186–89 the competitive relationship between the violent and non-violent anti-dictatorship movements.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Civil resistance campaigns frequently lead to a situation of partial stalemate, in which negotiation between civil resisters and those in positions of governmental power is perceived as essential. Hence, "round table talks" were critically important in the Indian independence struggle up to 1947, in [[Polish Round Table Talks|Solidarity's campaign in Poland up to 1989]], and in Ukraine in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;These three cases of round table talks are outlined by Judith Brown, Alexander Smolar and Andrew Wilson respectively in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 47, 55 (India), 136–43 (Poland), and 350–53 (Ukraine).&lt;/ref&gt;
#The relation between civil resistance and the military [[coup d'état]] can be especially multi-faceted. In some cases a civil resistance campaign has been an effective response to a military coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Adam Roberts (scholar) |first=Adam |last=Roberts |title=Civil Resistance to Military Coups |journal=Journal of Peace Research |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=1975 |pages=19–36 |doi= 10.1177/002234337501200102|jstor=422898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases a campaign could succeed in its final objective—e.g. the removal of a hated regime—only when there was the reality or the threat of a military coup to bring about the desired change. Thus, the 1963 [[Buddhist crisis]] in South Vietnam a long civil resistance campaign against the government resulted in change only when the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|South Vietnamese army coup]] of 1–2 November 1963 toppled President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Shaplen |title=The Lost Revolution: Vietnam 1945–1965 |publisher=Andre Deutsch |location=London |year=1966 |pages=188–212 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt in June–July 2013, a civil resistance movement in effect called for a military coup: peaceful demonstrators and a petition supported by millions of signatures demanded the replacement of the elected Muslim Brotherhood government, and provided a degree of revolutionary legitimacy for the army take-over of 3 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Cherif Bassiouni]], [http://www.mcherifbassiouni.com/wp-content/uploads/Egypt-Update-27.pdf Egypt Update no. 27], 19 February 2014, paragraphs 8–9, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one non-violent campaign, the [[Carnation Revolution|Revolution of the Carnations]] in Portugal in 1974–75, was in support of a military coup that had already occurred: this campaign helped to steer Portugal in a democratic direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ‘Portugal: "The Revolution of the Carnations", 1974–75’, in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 144–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some non-violent campaigns can be seen as reluctant or unwitting harbingers of violence. They may be followed by the emergence of groups using armed force and/or by military intervention from outside the territory concerned. This can happen if, for example, they (a) are perceived as failures, or (b) are repressed with extreme violence, or (c) succeed in removing a regime but then leave a power vacuum in its place. Processes of the first two of these kinds happened, for example, in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1967–72 and in [[Kosovo]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Cases of perceived failure of civil resistance being followed by armed campaigns and military intervention are outlined by Richard English and Howard Clark in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 75–90 (Northern Ireland) and 277–94 (Kosovo).&lt;/ref&gt; Processes of the third kind, involving some forms of power vacuum, included [[Libya]] from 2011 onwards, and [[Yemen]] from 2012 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Cases of armed interventions in areas where there had been an absence of governance in at least parts of a country are outlined by George Joffé and Helen Lackner in Roberts, Willis, McCarthy and Garton Ash, ''Civil Resistance in the Arab Spring: Triumphs and Disasters'', pp. 134–40 (Libya) and 160–68 (Yemen).&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of such developments can be an inducement to a government to bargain with a non-violent movement before things get out of hand. However, in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 and after, campaigns by civil resistance movements were followed by violent internal conflict and civil war, often with the involvement of external forces: Syria is the most tragic case.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], ''Strategic Survey 2013'', London, 2013, pp. 179–84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Vaclav Havel IMF.jpg|thumb|[[Václav Havel]], impresario of civil resistance in the years leading up to the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]]. In April 1991, as President of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, he praised the NATO military alliance; and on 12 March 1999 the Czech Republic (with Havel still as President) joined the alliance. He is seen here on 26 September 2000. ''Photo: IMF'']]
#There have also been some cases of certain uses of force by civil resistance movements, whether against their adversaries, or to maintain internal discipline. For example, on 2 February 2011, in the generally peaceful [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|Egyptian struggle against President Mubarak]], some groups among the crowds in [[Tahrir Square]] in Cairo did use certain forms of force for a defensive purpose when they were attacked by pro-regime thugs, some of whom were riding on horses and camels.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Khalili, ‘The two sets of protesters were left to fight it out,’ ''The Guardian'', London, 3 February 2011, provides an eye-witness account of the events of 2 February. Also available at [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/02/cairo-clashes].&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent days the crowds in Tahrir Square reverted to using non-violent methods.
#Some civil resistance movements have sought, or welcomed, a measure of armed protection for their activities. Thus in the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, the [[Freedom Rides|Freedom Ride]] of May 1961, having been opposed violently, received armed protection for part of its hazardous journey;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Peck (pacifist)|James Peck]], ''Freedom Ride'', Grove Press, New York, 1962, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Selma to Montgomery March]] of March 1965 only succeeded in reaching Montgomery, Alabama, at the third attempt, when it was protected by troops and federal agents.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Williams, ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954–1965'', Viking Press, New York, 1987, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some campaigns of civil resistance may depend up the existence of militarily defended space. A life-saving example of an effective civil resistance enabling threatened people to reach a defended space occurred with the [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]] in 1943 when thousands of Jews were spirited out of German-occupied Denmark and across a narrow stretch of sea (the Sound) to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Semelin, ''Unarmed Against Hitler: Civilian Resistance in Europe, 1939–1943'', Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, 1993, pp. 151–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
#When leaders of even the most determinedly non-violent movements have come to power in their countries, they have generally accepted the continued existence of armed forces and other more or less conventional security arrangements. For example, in 1991 [[Václav Havel]] who had been a leading figure in civil resistance in communist Czechoslovakia from the founding of [[Charter 77]] to the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, in his new capacity as President of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic paid tribute to the [[NATO]] alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Václav Havel]], address to NATO Council, 21 March 1991, ''NATO Review'', Brussels, April 1991, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1999 the Czech Republic, along with Poland and Hungary, became a member of NATO.

==Proposals for defence by civil resistance==
The promise of civil resistance as a means of opposing oppressive rule has led to many proposals that countries might rely, in whole or in part, on civil resistance as a means of defence against external attack (for example, invasion) and internal usurpation (for example, [[coup d'état]]). Preparations for such resistance are sometimes seen as potentially helping to deter such threats in the first place. Various terms have been used to describe either the policy of relying on such non-military action by a society or social group, or the general phenomenon of sustained country-wide campaigns against outside attack or dictatorial rule. These terms - all near-synonyms - include "defence by civil resistance", "non-violent defence", "civilian defence", "civilian-based defence", and "[[social defence]]". For further information and references to some relevant literature, see [[social defence]].

==The term "civil resistance": merits and concerns==
[[File:Gandhi suit.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]] in South Africa in about 1906–1909. Referring to his years there, he later wrote: "... I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance."]]The term is not new. [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]] used it in many of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], "The Momentous Issue", ''Young India'', 10 November 1921; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 25, pp. 76–78. [http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL025.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he wrote: "... I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], letter to P. Kodanda Rao, 10 September 1935; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 67, p. 400.[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL067.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a near-synonym for [[nonviolent resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], [[People Power Revolution|people power]] and [[satyagraha]]. While each of these terms has its uses and connotations, "civil resistance" is one appropriate term to use in cases where the resistance has a civic quality, relating to a society as a whole; where the action involved is not necessarily disobedience, but instead involves supporting the norms of a society against usurpers; where the decision not to use violent methods is not based on a general philosophy of [[nonviolence]], but on a wide range of prudential, ethical and legal considerations; and where the technical and communications infrastructure of modern civil societies provides a means of organizing resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Fabien Miard, ''Mobile Phones as a Tool for Civil Resistance: Case Studies from Serbia and Belarus'', DigiActive Research Series, June 2009. 
[http://www.digiactive.org/wp-content/uploads/research3_miard.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of such considerations, the term has been used in this century in many analyses in academic journals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, by {{cite journal |first=Maria J. |last=Stephan |first2=Erica |last2=Chenoweth |title=Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict |journal=International Security |volume=33 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=7–44 |issn=0162-2889 |url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18407/why_civil_resistance_works.html |doi=10.1162/isec.2008.33.1.7}} And {{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Ackerman |first2=Berel |last2=Rodal |title=The Strategic Dimensions of Civil Resistance |journal=Survival |volume=50 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=111–25 |url=http://www.david-kilgour.com/2008/pdf/misc/50-3%2010%20Ackerman%20Author%20Proof.pdf |doi=10.1080/00396330802173131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What exactly are the advantages of the term "civil resistance", as distinct from its near-synonyms "non-violent action" and "[[non-violent resistance]]"? All these terms have merits, and refer to largely the same phenomena. Indeed, there is a long history, in many languages, of using a wide variety of terms to describe these phenomena. The term "civil resistance" has been used increasingly for two main reasons:
#It emphasises the positive (civic goals; widespread civil society involvement; and civil as distinct from uncivil conduct) rather than the negative (avoidance of the use of violence).
#It conveys, more effectively perhaps than such terms as "[[nonviolent resistance]]", that a movement's avoidance of violence in pursuit of a particular cause is not necessarily tied to a general belief in "[[nonviolence]]" in all circumstances, nor to a philosophy of "[[Gandhism]]", but rather arises from the particular values and circumstances of the society concerned.

There have been concerns that the term "civil resistance" might on occasion be misused, or at least stretched in a highly controversial way, to encompass acts of violence. Thus, arising from experience within the [[anti-globalization movement]], one participant-observer has seen "new forms of civil resistance" as being associated with a problematic departure from a previously more widely shared commitment to maintaining non-violent discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Janet |last=Conway |title=Civil Resistance and the 'Diversity of Tactics' in the Anti-Globalization Movement: Problems of Violence, Silence, and Solidarity in Activist Politics |journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal |volume=41 |issue=2 &amp; 3 |year=2003 |pages=505–17 |url=http://www.ohlj.ca/archive/articles/41_23_conway.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these concerns, those who have used the term "civil resistance" have tended to emphasise its non-violent character, and to use it in addition to – and not in substitution of – such terms as "non-violent resistance".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Collingridge dilemma''' is a methodological quandary in which efforts to influence&lt;!--/contribute to--&gt; or control the further development&lt;!--/impact/..--&gt; of technology face a [[double bind|double-bind problem]]:
* An information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.
* A [[Power (philosophy)|power]] problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.
The idea was coined by David Collingridge, The [[University of Aston]], Technology Policy Unit, in his 1980 book ''The Social Control of Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Control of Technology'' (New York: St. Martin's Press; London: Pinter) {{ISBN|0-312-73168-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dilemma is a basic point of reference in [[technology assessment]] debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itas.fzk.de/tatup/092/boeh09a.htm Article] by K. Böhle in TATuP, September 2009, pp. 121-125 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In "This Explains Everything," edited by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]], technology critic [[Evgeny Morozov]] explains Collingridge's idea by quoting Collingridge himself: "When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult, and time-consuming." &lt;ref&gt;"This Explains Everything" (Harper Perennial, 2013, p.255, {{ISBN|0062230174}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; [[Technological Determinism]]" by [[Adam Thierer]], a senior research fellow at the [[Mercatus Center]] at [[George Mason University]], the Collingridge dilemma is related to the "pacing problem" in technology regulation. The "pacing problem" refers to the notion that technological innovation is increasingly outpacing the ability of laws and regulations to keep up, first explained in [[Larry Downes]]' 2009 book ''[[The Laws of Disruption]]'', in which he famously states that "technology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally". In Thierer's essay, he tries to correlate these two concepts by saying that "the 'Collingridge dilemma' is simply a restatement of the pacing problem but with greater stress on the social drivers behind the pacing problem and an implicit solution to 'the problem' in the form of preemptive control of new technologies while they are still young and more manageable."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techliberation.com/2018/08/16/the-pacing-problem-the-collingridge-dilemma-technological-determinism/|title=The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; Technological Determinism|date=2018-08-16|work=Technology Liberation Front|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely-adopted solution to Collingridge dilemma is the "[[Precautionary principle|Precautionary Principle]]", the belief that new innovations should not be embraced "until their developers can prove that they will not cause any harm to individuals, groups, specific entities, cultural norms, or various existing laws, norms, or traditions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If they fail to do so, this innovation should be "prohibited, curtailed, modified, junked, or ignored". &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What technology wants|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|publisher=Viking Press|year=2010|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach received criticisms from technology critics like [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] who believe the contour of such principle is ill-defined&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and such principle is biased against anything new because it drastically elevates threshold for anything innovative. According to American philosopher [[Max More]], the Precautionary Principle "is very good for one thing—stopping technological progress...not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Charles Dawson Butler''' (November 16, 1916 – May 18, 1988) was an American [[Voice acting|voice actor]]. He worked mostly for the [[Hanna-Barbera]] animation production company where he originated the voices of many familiar characters, including [[Loopy De Loop]], [[Wally Gator]], [[Yogi Bear]], [[Hokey Wolf]], [[Elroy Jetson]], [[Quick Draw McGraw]], [[Snagglepuss]], [[Spike and Tyke (characters)|Spike the Bulldog]], and [[Huckleberry Hound]].

==Early life and career==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2017}}
Butler was born on November 16, 1916 in [[Toledo, Ohio]], the only child of Charles Allen Butler and Ruth Butler. The family later moved from Ohio to Oak Park, Illinois, where Butler got interested in impersonating people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawsbutler.com/bio-daws.htm|title=The Official Website of Daws Butler- BIOGRAPHY- June 2003|publisher=Dawsbutler.com|date=1978-11-21|accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the future voice master started as an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]], entering multiple amateur contests and winning most of them. He had entered them, not with the intention of showing his talent, but as a personal challenge to overcome his shyness, with success. Nonetheless, Butler won professional engagements at vaudeville theaters.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Later, he teamed up with fellow performers Jack Lavin and Willard Ovitz to form the comedy trio The Three Short Waves. The team played in theaters, on radio, and in nightclubs, generating positive reviews from regional critics and audiences. They dissolved their act in 1941, when Daws Butler joined the U.S. Navy as America entered World War II. Some time after, he met his wife Myrtis during a wartime function near Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ohmert | first1 = Ben  | author-link1 = Ben Ohmert | first2 = Joe| last2 = Bevilacqua | author-link2 = Joe Bevilacqua | title = Daws Butler Characters Actor | publisher = BearManor Media | date = 2005 | location = Albany, GA | pages = 31 | isbn = 978-1-59393-015-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first voice work for an animated character came in 1948 in the animated short ''Short Snorts on Sports'', which was produced by [[Screen Gems]]. That same year at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], [[Tex Avery]] hired Butler to provide the voice of a British wolf on ''[[Little Rural Riding Hood]]'' and also to narrate several of his cartoons.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Throughout the late 1940s and mid-1950s, he had roles in many Avery-directed cartoons; the Fox in ''Out-Foxed'', the narrator in ''The Cuckoo Clock'', the Cobbler in ''The Peachy Cobbler'', Mr. Theeves in ''[[Droopy's "Double Trouble"]]'', Mysto the Magician in ''[[Magical Maestro]]'', John the Cab and John the B-29 Bomber in ''[[One Cab's Family]]'' and ''[[Little Johnny Jet]]'', and Maxie in ''[[The Legend of Rockabye Point]]''.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Starting with ''The Three Little Pups'', Butler provided the voice for a nameless wolf that spoke in a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] and whistled all the time (the tune was [[Henry C. Work]]'s "[[Kingdom Coming]]"). This character also appeared in ''Sheep Wrecked'', ''Billy Boy'' and many more cartoons. While at MGM, Avery wanted Butler to try to do the voice of [[Droopy]], at a time when [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] had been unavailable due to radio engagements. Instead, Butler recommended [[Don Messick]], another actor and Butler's lifelong friend, who could imitate Thompson. Thus, Messick voiced Droopy in several shorts.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Bevilesqua {{cite web|url=http://www.dawsbutler.com/Daws-article.htm|title=A Personal Portrait of My Mentor|publisher=Dawsbutler.com|accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Butler landed a role in a televised puppet show created by former [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon director [[Bob Clampett]] called ''[[Time for Beany]]''. Butler was teamed with [[Stan Freberg]], and together they did all the voices of the puppets. Butler voiced Beany Boy and Captain Huffenpuff. Freberg voiced Cecil and Dishonest John. An entire stable of recurring characters were seen. The show's writers were Charles Shows and [[Lloyd Turner]], whose dependably funny dialog was still always at the mercy of Butler's and Freberg's [[ad lib]]s. ''Time for Beany'' ran from 1949-54, and won several [[Emmy Award]]s.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Butler briefly turned his attention to writing and voicing several TV commercials. In the 1950s, Stan Freberg asked him to help him write comedy skits for his [[Capitol Records]] albums. Their first collaboration, "[[St. George and the Dragonet]]" (based on ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]''), was the first comedy record to sell over one million copies. Freberg was more of a satirist who did song parodies, but the bulk of his dialogue routines were co-written by and co-starred Butler.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Butler teamed again with Freberg and actress [[June Foray]] in a CBS radio series, ''[[The Stan Freberg Show]]'', which ran from July to October 1957 as a summer replacement for Jack Benny's program. Freberg's box-set, ''Tip of the Freberg'' ([[Rhino Entertainment]], 1999) chronicles every aspect of Freberg's career except the cartoon voice-over work, and it showcases his career with Daws Butler. In ''[[Mr. Magoo]]'', the [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] theatrical animated short series for [[Columbia Pictures]], Butler played Magoo's nephew Waldo (also voiced by [[Jerry Hausner]] at various times).{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Butler provided the voices of many nameless [[Walter Lantz]] characters for theatrical shorts later seen on the ''[[Woody Woodpecker]]'' program. His characters included the penguin [[Chilly Willy]] and his rival Smedley, a southern-speaking dog (the same voice used for Tex Avery's laid-back wolf character and for [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[Huckleberry Hound]]).{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In 1957, after MGM had closed their animation unit, producers [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] quickly formed [[Hanna-Barbera|their own company]], and Daws Butler and Don Messick were on hand to provide voices. The first, ''[[The Ruff and Reddy Show]]'', with Butler voicing Reddy, set the formula for the rest of the series of cartoons that the two helmed until the mid-1960s. He played the title roles in ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'', and ''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'', as well as a variety of other characters.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Butler would voice most of these characters for decades, in both TV shows and in some commercials. The breakfast cereal mascot [[Cap'n Crunch]] became an icon of sorts on [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning TV]] through many commercials produced by [[Jay Ward]]. Butler played Cap'n from the 1960s to the 1980s. He based the voice on that of character actor [[Charles Butterworth (actor)|Charles Butterworth]]. In 1961, while [[Mel Blanc]] was recovering from a road accident, Daws Butler substituted for him to voice [[Barney Rubble]] in five episodes of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (''The Hit Songwriter'', ''Droop-Along Flintstone'', ''Fred Flintstone Woos Again'', ''The Rock Quarry Story'', ''The Little White Lie'').

In 1964, Butler was featured as [[Huckleberry Hound]] on a 45rpm record, "Bingo, Ringo," a comedic story combining [[the Beatles]]' drummer [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Lorne Greene]]'s hit record "Ringo."

In ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]'', Butler provided the voices for a number of the racers, Rock Slag, Big Gruesome, the Red Max, Sgt. Blast, Peter Perfect, and Rufus Ruffcut. He voiced a penguin and a turtle in the movie ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', his only known work for Disney. Along with [[Mel Blanc]], [[Stan Freberg]], [[Paul Frees]] and [[June Foray]], Butler also provided voices for countless children's records featuring recreations of several successful Disney cartoons and films.

==Inspirations==
Butler based some of his voices on popular celebrities of the day. Yogi Bear began as an [[Art Carney]] impression; Butler had done a similar voice in several of [[Robert McKimson]]'s films at Warner Brothers and Stan Freberg's comedy record "The Honey-Earthers." However, Butler soon changed Yogi's voice, making it much deeper and more sing-songy, thus making it a more original voice.

Hokey Wolf began as an impression of [[Phil Silvers]], and Snagglepuss as [[Bert Lahr]]. In fact, when Snagglepuss began appearing in commercials for [[Kellogg's]] [[Cocoa Krispies]] in 1961, Lahr threatened to sue Butler for "stealing" his voice.  As part of the settlement, the disclaimer "Snagglepuss voice by Daws Butler" was required to appear on each commercial, making him the only voice actor ever to receive one in an animated TV commercial. Butler redesigned these voices, making them his own inventions.  Huckleberry Hound was inspired many years earlier, in 1945, by a North Carolina neighbor of Daws' wife's family, and he had in fact been using that voice for a long time, for Avery's laid-back wolf and Lantz' Smedley.

==Later life==
In the 1970s, he was the voice of "Hair Bear" on ''[[Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!]]'' and a few characters in minor cartoons such as ''C.B. Bears''. On ''[[Laff-a-Lympics]]'', Butler was virtually the entire "Yogi Yahooey" team. He also played the title character in ''[[The Funky Phantom]]'', as well as Louie and Pug on ''[[The Pink Panther Show]]''. In 1977, he guest starred as Captain Numo and his lackey Schultz on the ''[[What's New, Mr. Magoo?]]'' episode "Secret Agent Magoo".

Butler remained somewhat low-key in the 1970s and 1980s until a revival of ''[[The Jetsons]]'' and Hanna-Barbera's crossover series ''[[Yogi's Treasure Hunt]]'', both in 1985. Also in 1983, he voiced the title character, Wacky WallWalker in ''[[Wacky WallWalker|Deck the Halls with Wacky Walls]]''.

In 1975, Butler began an acting workshop which spawned such talents as [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Corey Burton]], [[Joe Bevilacqua]], [[Bill Farmer]], [[Pat Parris]], [[Tony Pope]], [[Linda Gary]], [[Bob Bergen]], [[Mona Marshall]], [[Sherry Lynn]], [[Joey Camen]], writer Earl Kress and many more.

In the year of his death, ''[[The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound]]'' was released, a tour-de-force featuring most of his classic early characters.

==Personal life==
Daws met and married Myrtis Martin in 1943 while he was in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s9.com/Biography/Daws-Butler|title=Daws Butler biography|publisher=S9.com|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://yowpyowp.blogspot.com/2016/11/daws-at-100.html&lt;/ref&gt; They had four sons, David, Don, Paul and Charles, and remained married until his death in 1988.

==Death==
Daws Butler died from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on May 18, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-05-20/news/0040180262_1_yogi-bear-barbera-huckleberry-hound "Charles 'Daws' Butler, Voice Of Yogi Bear, Many Others"], ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', May 20, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laobit&gt;Folkart, Burt A.

==Legacy==
Daws Butler trained many voice actors including [[Nancy Cartwright]] (the voice of [[Bart Simpson]]), [[Corey Burton]] (the voice of Dale in ''[[Chip 'n' Dale]]''), [[Bill Farmer]] (the current voice of [[Goofy]], [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], and [[Horace Horsecollar]]), [[Bob Bergen]] (voice of Porky Pig), [[Joe Bevilacqua]] (whom Butler personally taught how to do all of his characters), [[Greg Burson]] (voice of Yogi Bear and Bugs Bunny), [[Mona Marshall]] (voices in South Park), [[Sherry Lynn]] and [[Joey Camen]]. Butler's voice and scripts were a frequent part of Bevilacqua's now-defunct XM show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comedyorama.com|title=The Comedy-O-Rama Hour|publisher=Comedyorama.com|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bevilacqua also wrote Butler's official biography, published by Bear Manor Media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bearmanormedia.bizland.com/id20.html Daws Butler - Characters Actor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403054032/http://bearmanormedia.bizland.com/id20.html |date=2009-04-03 }}, BearManor Media&lt;/ref&gt; A new book of cartoon scripts written by Daws Butler and Joe Bevilacqua, ''Uncle Dunkle and Donnie: Fractured Fables'', was scheduled for publication in the fall of 2009. A four-volume, 4½-hour audio set of ''Uncle Dunkle and Donnie'' was to be released simultaneously with Bevilacqua performing all 97 characters in 35 stories. Butler also trained [[Hal Rayle]], who ultimately determined that his best-known character of Doyle Cleverlobe from ''[[Galaxy High School]]'' should sound like Elroy Jetson after he finished [[puberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galaxyhigh86.tripod.com/halrayle.html|title=The Galaxy High Website!|publisher=Galaxyhigh86.tripod.com|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The video ''Daws Butler: Voice Magician'' is a 1987 documentary of Butler's career from his pre-MGM days on up through his teaming with Freberg in 1949 and the teaming with [[Don Messick]] in 1957. It was originally seen as a PBS pledge-drive special.
*Former Butler protege [[Joe Bevilacqua]] used to host a radio series on XM Satellite Radio's Sonic Theater Channel called ''The Comedy-O-Rama Hour'' which features a regular segment called ''What the Butler Wrote: Scenes from the Daws Butler Workshop'' with rare scripts of Daws performed by his students, including [[Nancy Cartwright]], and rare recordings of Daws himself. Bevilacqua has also co-authored (with Ben Ohmart) the authorized biography book ''Daws Butler, Characters Actor'', and edited the book ''Scenes for Actors and Voices'' written by Daws Butler, both published by Bear Manor Media.
*Butler once appeared as a contestant on [[Groucho Marx]]' ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''.  The studio audience did not recognize him until he began doing Huckleberry Hound's voice.  Butler and his partner split the top prize of [[$]]10,000.
*In 1985, Daws Butler was interviewed about his career on [[Dr. Demento]]'s radio show.

'''''Eastminster''''' was an iron [[full-rigged ship]] built in [[Port Glasgow]], Scotland, in 1876. She operated as an [[emigrant vessel]].

''Eastminster'' was last seen departing [[Maryborough, Queensland]], [[Australia]], after ignoring a warning from the [[Maritime pilot|harbor pilot]], heading out to sea in a rising [[gale]] on 17 February 1888, bound for [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. ''Eastminster'' was presumed lost during a [[tropical cyclone]] that passed through the area immediately afterward. Her wreckage was reported on a [[coral reef]] in the [[Capricorn and Bunker Group]] in the [[Coral Sea]] approximately 100 [[nautical mile]]s (185 km) east of [[Rockhampton]], Queensland.&lt;ref name = "loney" &gt;Australian shipwrecks Vol. 3 1871-1900 By Loney, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27149">The '''efficient coding hypothesis''' was proposed by [[Horace Barlow]] in 1961 as a theoretical model of [[sensory neuroscience|sensory coding]] in the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, H. (1961) "Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages" in ''Sensory Communication'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the brain, [[neurons]] often communicate with one another by sending electrical impulses referred to as [[action potentials]] or spikes.  One goal of [[sensory neuroscience]] is to decipher the meaning of these spikes in order to understand how the brain represents and processes information about the outside world.  Barlow hypothesized that the spikes in the sensory system formed a [[neural code]] for efficiently representing sensory information.  By efficient Barlow meant that the code minimized the number of spikes needed to transmit a given signal. This is somewhat analogous to transmitting information across the internet, where different file formats can be used to transmit a given image.  Different file formats require different number of bits for representing the same image at given distortion level, and some are better suited for representing certain classes of images than others.  According to this model, the brain is thought to use a code which is suited for representing visual and audio information representative of an organism's natural environment.

[[File:Neuron1.jpg|thumb|350px|Labeled Neuron|right]]

== Efficient coding and information theory ==

The development of the Barlow's hypothesis was influenced by [[information theory]] introduced by [[Claude Shannon]] only a decade before.  Information theory provides the mathematical framework for analyzing communication systems.  It formally defines concepts such as [[information]], [[channel capacity]], and [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]].  Barlow's model treats the sensory pathway as a communication channel where neuronal spiking is an efficient code for representing sensory signals.  The spiking code aims to maximize available channel capacity by minimizing the redundancy between representational units. H. Barlow was not the very first one to introduce the idea: it already appears in an 1954 article written by F. Attneave.&lt;ref&gt;Attneave, Fred. "Some informational aspects of visual perception." ''Psychological review'' '''61'''.3 (1954): 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key prediction of the efficient coding hypothesis is that sensory processing in the brain should be adapted to natural stimuli. Neurons in the visual (or auditory) system should be optimized for coding images (or sounds) representative of those found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewicki | first1 = M.S. | year = 2002 | title = Efficient coding of natural sounds | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 356–363 | doi=10.1038/nn831}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have shown that filters optimized for coding natural images lead to filters which resemble the receptive fields of simple-cells in [[visual cortex|V1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Olshausen | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Field | first2 = D.J. | year = 1997 | title = Sparse coding with an overcomplete basis set: A strategy employed by V1? | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 37 | issue = 23| pages = 3311–3325 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the auditory domain, optimizing a network for coding natural sounds leads to filters which resemble the impulse response of cochlear filters found in the [[inner ear]].

== Constraints on the visual system ==

Due to constraints on the visual system such as the number of neurons and the metabolic energy required for "neural activities", the visual processing system must have an efficient strategy for transmitting as much information as possible.&lt;ref name=Zhaoping&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhaoping|first=L|title=Theoretical understanding of the early visual processes by data compression and data selection|journal=Network|date=Dec 2006|volume=17|issue=4|pages=301–334|pmid=17283516|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/09548980600931995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information must be compressed as it travels from the [[retina]] back to the [[visual cortex]]. While the retinal receptors can receive information at 10^9 bit/s, the [[optic nerve]], which is composed of 1 million [[Retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cell]]s transmitting at 1 bit/sec, only has a transmission capacity of 10^6 bit/s.&lt;ref name=Zhaoping /&gt;  Further reduction occurs that limits the overall transmission to 40 bit/s which results in [[inattentional blindness]].&lt;ref name=Zhaoping /&gt;  Thus, the hypothesis states that neurons should encode information as efficiently as possible in order to maximize neural resources.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simoncelli|first=Eero P.|title=Vision and the statistics of the visual environment|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|year=2003|volume=13|issue=2|pages=144–149| doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(03)00047-3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been shown that visual data can be compressed up to 20 fold without noticeable information loss.&lt;ref name="Zhaoping"/&gt;

Evidence suggests that our visual processing system engages in bottom-up selection. For example, inattentional blindness suggests that there must be data deletion early on in the visual pathway.&lt;ref name=Zhaoping /&gt;  This bottom-up approach allows us to respond to unexpected and salient events more quickly and is often directed by attentional selection. This also gives our visual system the property of being goal-directed.&lt;ref name=Zhaoping /&gt; Many have suggested that the visual system is able to work efficiently by breaking images down into distinct components.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; Additionally, it has been argued that the visual system takes advantage of redundancies in inputs in order to transmit as much information as possible while using the fewest resources.&lt;ref name="Zhaoping"/&gt;

== Evolution-based neural system ==

[[Eero Simoncelli|Simoncelli]] and Olshausen outline the three major concepts that are assumed to be involved in the development of  systems neuroscience:
# an organism has specific tasks to perform
# neurons have capabilities and limitations
# an organism is in a particular environment.&lt;ref name="Simoncelli and Olshausen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simoncelli|first=E.P.|author2=Olshausen, B.A.|title=Natural image statistics and neural representation|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|year=2001|volume=24|pages=1193–1216|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.1193|pmid=11520932|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One assumption used in testing the Efficient Coding Hypothesis is that neurons must be evolutionarily and developmentally adapted to the natural signals in their environment.&lt;ref name="Simoncelli and Olshausen" /&gt; The idea is that perceptual systems will be the quickest when responding to "environmental stimuli". The visual system should cut out any redundancies in the sensory input.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ma|first=L.B.|author2=Wu, S.|title=Efficient coding of natural images|journal=Sheng li xue bao : [Acta Physiologica Sinica]|date=Oct 25, 2011|volume=63|issue=5|pages=463–471|pmid=22002237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural images and statistics ==
Central to Barlow's hypothesis is [[information theory]], which when applied to [[neuroscience]], argues that an efficiently coding neural system "should match the statistics of the signals they represent".&lt;ref name="Ming and Holt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ming|first=Vivienne L|author2=Holt, Lori L.|title=Efficient Coding in Human Auditory Perception|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|year=2009|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1312–1320|doi=10.1121/1.3158939|accessdate=|pmc=2809690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important to be able to determine the [[Scene statistics|statistics of the natural images]] that are producing these signals. Researchers have looked at various components of natural images including luminance contrast, [[color]], and how images are registered over time.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo" /&gt; They can analyze the properties of natural scenes via digital cameras, [[spectrophotometers]], and range finders.&lt;ref name=Geisler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geisler|first=W.S.|title=Visual perception and the statistical properties of natural scenes|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2008|volume=59|pages=167–192|pmid=17705683|accessdate=|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers look at how luminance contrasts are spatially distributed in an image: the luminance contrasts are highly correlated the closer they are in measurable distance and less correlated the farther apart the pixels are.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo"/&gt; [[Independent component analysis]] (ICA) is an [[algorithm]] system that attempts to "linearly transform given (sensory) inputs into independent outputs (synaptic currents) ".&lt;ref name=Blättler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blättler|first=F|author2=Hahnloser, R.H.|title=An efficient coding hypothesis links sparsity and selectivity of neural responses|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2011|volume=6|issue=10|pmid=22022405|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0025506|pmc=3192758|page=e25506}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICA eliminates the redundancy by decorrelating the [[pixel]]s in a natural image.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo" /&gt; Thus the individual components that make up the natural image are rendered [[Statistical independence|statistically independent]].&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo" /&gt; However, researchers have thought that ICA is limited because it assumes that the neural response is linear, and therefore insufficiently describes the complexity of natural images. They argue that, despite what is assumed under ICA, the components of the natural image have a "higher-order structure" that involves correlations among components.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo" /&gt; Instead, researchers have now developed [[temporal independent component analysis]] (TICA), which better represents the complex correlations that occur between components in a natural image.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo" /&gt; Additionally, a "hierarchical covariance model" developed by Karklin and Lewicki expands on [[sparse coding]] methods and can represent additional components of natural images such as "object location, scale, and texture".&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo" /&gt;

The chromatic spectra as it comes from natural light, but also as it is reflected off of "natural materials" can be easily characterized with [[principal components analysis]] (PCA).&lt;ref name=Geisler /&gt;  Because the cones are absorbing a specific amount of [[photons]] from the natural image, researchers can use cone responses as a way of describing the natural image. Researchers have found that the three classes of cone receptors in the retina can accurately code natural images and that [[color]] is decorrelated already in the [[LGN]].&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Geisler /&gt; Time has also been modeled: natural images transform over time, and we can use these transformations to see how the visual input changes over time.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo"/&gt;

== Hypotheses for testing the efficient coding hypothesis ==

If [[neuron]]s are encoding according to the efficient coding hypothesis then individual neurons must be expressing their full output capacity.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; Before testing this hypothesis it is necessary to define what is considered to be a neural response.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; [[Eero Simoncelli|Simoncelli]] and Olshausen suggest that an efficient neuron needs to be given a maximal response value so that we can measure if a neuron is efficiently meeting the maximum level.&lt;ref name="Simoncelli and Olshausen" /&gt; Secondly, a population of neurons must not be redundant in transmitting signals and must be statistically independent.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; If the efficient coding hypothesis is accurate, researchers should observe is that there is sparsity in the neuron responses: that is, only a few neurons at a time should fire for an input.&lt;ref name="Ma Li Bo"/&gt;

== Methodological approaches for testing the hypotheses ==

One approach is to design a model for early sensory processing based on the statistics of a natural image and then compare this predicted model to how real neurons actually respond to the natural image.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; 
The second approach is to measure a neural system responding to a natural environment, and analyze the results to see if there are any statistical properties to this response.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

===Examples of these approaches===

1. '''Predicted model approach'''

A study by van Hateren and Ruderman in 1998 used ICA to analyze video-sequences and compared how a computer analyzed the independent components of the image to data for visual processing obtained from a cat in DeAngelis et al. 1993.

2. '''Analyzing actual neural system in response to natural images'''

In a report in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' from 2000, William E. Vinje and Jack Gallant outlined a series of experiments used to test elements of the efficient coding hypothesis, including a theory that the non-classical receptive field (nCRF) decorrelates projections from the [[primary visual cortex]]. To test this, they took recordings from the V1 neurons in awake [[macaque]]s during "free viewing of natural images and conditions" that simulated natural vision conditions.&lt;ref name=Vinje /&gt;  The researchers hypothesized that the V1 uses [[sparse code]], which is minimally redundant and "metabolically more efficient".&lt;ref name=Vinje /&gt;  They also hypothesized that interactions between the classical receptive field (CRF) and the nCRF produced this pattern of sparse coding during the viewing of these natural scenes. In order to test this, they created eye-scan paths and also extracted patches that ranged in size from 1-4 times the diameter of the CRF. They found that the sparseness of the coding increased with the size of the patch. Larger patches encompassed more of the nCRF—indicating that the interactions between these two regions created sparse code. Additionally as stimulus size increased, so did the sparseness. This suggests that the V1 uses sparse code when natural images span the entire [[visual field]]. The CRF was defined as the circular area surrounding the locations where stimuli evoked [[action potential]]s. They also tested to see if the stimulation of the nCRF increased the independence of the responses from the V1 neurons by randomly selecting pairs of neurons. They found that indeed, the neurons were more greatly decoupled upon stimulation of the nCRF. In conclusion, the experiments of Vinje and Gallant showed that the V1 uses sparse code by employing both the CRF and nCRF when viewing natural images, with the nCRF showing a definitive decorrelating effect on neurons which may increase their efficiency by increasing the amount of independent information they carry. They propose that the cells may represent the individual components of a given natural scene, which may contribute to [[pattern recognition]]&lt;ref name=Vinje&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vinje|first=W.E.|author2=Gallant, J.L.|title=Sparse coding and decorrelation in primary visual cortex during natural vision|journal=Science|date=Feb 18, 2000|volume=287|issue=5456|pages=1273–1276|pmid=10678835|accessdate=|doi=10.1126/science.287.5456.1273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study done by Baddeley et al. had shown that firing-rate distributions of cat visual area V1 neurons and monkey inferotemporal (IT) neurons were exponential under naturalistic conditions, which implies optimal information transmission for a fixed average rate of firing. A subsequent study of monkey IT neurons found that only a minority were well described by an exponential firing distribution. De Polavieja later argued that this discrepancy was due to the fact that the exponential solution is correct only for the noise-free case, and showed that by taking noise into consideration, one could account for the observed results.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

A study by Dan, Attick, and Reid in 1996 used natural images to test the hypothesis that early on in the visual pathway, incoming visual signals will be decorrelated to optimize efficiency. This decorrelation can be observed as the '"whitening" of the temporal and spatial power spectra of the neuronal signals".&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt;  The researchers played natural image movies in front of cats and used a [[multielectrode array]] to record neural signals. This was achieved by refracting the eyes of the cats and then contact lenses being fitted into them. They found that in the [[LGN]], the natural images were decorrelated and concluded, "the early visual pathway has specifically adapted for efficient coding of natural visual information during evolution and/or development".&lt;ref name=Dan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Y|author2=Atick, J.J. |author3=Reid, R.C. |title=Efficient coding of natural scenes in the lateral geniculate nucleus: experimental test of a computational theory|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience 	|date=May 15, 1996|volume=16|issue=10|pages=3351–3362|pmid=8627371|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions==

One of the implications of the efficient coding hypothesis is that the [[neural coding]] depends upon the statistics of the sensory signals. These statistics are a function of not only the environment (e.g., the statistics of the natural environment), but also the organism's behavior (e.g., how it moves within that environment). However, perception and behavior are closely intertwined in the perception-action cycle.  For example, the process of vision involves various kinds of [[eye movements]]. An extension to the efficient coding hypothesis called '''active efficient coding''' (AEC) extends efficient coding to [[active perception]]. It hypothesizes that biological agents optimize not only their neural coding, but also their behavior to contribute to an efficient sensory representation of the environment. Along these lines, models for the development of active binocular vision and active visual tracking have been proposed.

== Criticisms ==

'''Researchers should consider how the visual information is used''': 
The hypothesis does not explain how the information from a visual scene is used—which is the main purpose of the visual system. It seems necessary to understand why we are processing image statistics from the environment because this may be relevant to how this information is ultimately processed. However, some researchers may see the irrelevance of the purpose of vision in Barlow's theory as an advantage for designing experiments.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

'''Some experiments show correlations between neurons''':
When considering multiple neurons at a time, recordings "show correlation, synchronization, or other forms of [[Statistical dependence|statistical dependency]] between neurons".&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;  However, it is relevant to note that most of these experiments did not use natural stimuli to provoke these responses: this may not fit in directly to the efficient coding hypothesis because this hypothesis is concerned with natural image statistics.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; In his review article [[Eero Simoncelli|Simoncelli]] notes that perhaps we can interpret redundancy in the Efficient Coding Hypothesis a bit differently: he argues that statistical dependency could be reduced over "successive stages of processing", and not just in one area of the sensory pathway &lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

'''Observed redundancy''':
A comparison of the number of retinal ganglion cells to the number of neurons in the primary [[visual cortex]] shows an increase in the number of [[sensory neurons]] in the cortex as compared to the retina. [[Eero Simoncelli|Simoncelli]] notes that one major argument of critics in that higher up in the sensory pathway there are greater numbers of neurons that handle the processing of sensory information so this should seem to produce redundancy.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; However, this observation may not be fully relevant because neurons have different [[neural coding]]. In his review, Simoncelli notes "cortical neurons tend to have lower firing rates and may use a different form of code as compared to retinal neurons".&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;  Cortical Neurons may also have the ability to encode information over longer periods of time than their retinal counterparts. Experiments done in the [[auditory system]] have confirmed that redundancy is decreased.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

'''Difficult to test''':
Estimation of information-theoretic quantities requires enormous amounts of data, and is thus impractical for experimental verification. Additionally, informational estimators are known to be biased. However, some experimental success has occurred.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

'''Need well-defined criteria for what to measure''':
This criticism illustrates one of the most fundamental issues of the hypothesis. Here, assumptions are made about the definitions of both the inputs and the outputs of the system.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; The inputs into the visual system are not completely defined, but they are assumed to be encompassed in a collection of natural images. The output must be defined to test the hypothesis, but variability can occur here too based on the choice of which type of neurons to measure, where they are located and what type of responses, such as firing rate or spike times are chosen to be measured.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

'''How to take noise into account''':
Some argue that experiments that ignore noise, or other physical constraints on the system are too simplistic.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt; However, some researchers have been able to incorporate these elements into their analyses, thus creating more sophisticated systems.&lt;ref name=Simoncelli /&gt;

== Biomedical applications ==
[[File:Blausen 0244 CochlearImplant 01.png|thumb|200px|Cochlear Implant|right]]
Possible applications of the efficient coding hypothesis include [[cochlear implant]] design. These [[Neuroprosthetics|neuroprosthetic]] devices stimulate the [[auditory nerve]] by an electrical impulses which allows some of the hearing to return to people who have [[hearing impairment]]s or are even [[deaf]]. The implants are considered to be successful and efficient and the only ones in use currently. Using frequency-place mappings in the efficient coding algorithm may benefit in the use of cochlear implants in the future.&lt;ref name="Ming and Holt" /&gt; Changes in design based on this hypothesis could increase speech intelligibility in hearing impaired patients. Research using [[Vocoder|vocoded speech]] processed by different filters showed that humans had greater accuracy in deciphering the speech when it was processed using an efficient-code filter as opposed to a cochleotropic filter or a linear filter.&lt;ref name="Ming and Holt" /&gt; This shows that efficient coding of noise data offered perceptual benefits and provided the listeners with more information.&lt;ref name="Ming and Holt" /&gt; More research is needed to apply current findings into medically relevant changes to cochlear implant design.&lt;ref name="Ming and Holt" /&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:The transcriptome of pluripotent cells..jpg|thumb|The transcriptome of embryonic stem cells]]
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the blastocyst stage of early mammalian embryos, are distinguished by their ability to differentiate into any cell type and by their ability to propagate. It is these traits that makes them valuable in the scientific and medical fields. ESCs are also described as having a normal [[karyotype]], maintaining high [[telomerase]] activity, and exhibiting remarkable long-term [[cell growth|proliferative]] potential.&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5391.1145|pmid=9804556|title=Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Derived from Human Blastocysts|journal=Science|volume=282|issue=5391|pages=1145–7|year=1998|last1=Thomson|first1=J.

M.|bibcode=1998Sci...282.1145T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pluripotent ===

Embryonic stem cells of the inner cell mass are [[Cell potency#Pluripotency|pluripotent]], meaning they are able to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to generate primitive ectoderm, which ultimately differentiates during [[gastrulation]] into all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[endoderm]], and [[mesoderm]]. These include each of the more than 220 [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|cell types]] in the adult human body. Pluripotency distinguishes embryonic stem cells from [[adult stem cell]]s, which are [[multipotent]] and can only produce a limited number of cell types.

=== Propagation ===

Under defined conditions, embryonic stem cells are capable of propagating indefinitely in an undifferentiated state. Conditions must either prevent the cells from clumping, or maintain an environment that supports an unspecialized state.&lt;ref name="stemcells.nih.gov"/&gt; While being able to remain undifferentiated, ESCs also have the capacity, when provided with the appropriate signals, to differentiate (presumably via the initial formation of [[precursor cells]]) into nearly all mature cell [[phenotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ying |title=BMP Induction of Id Proteins Suppresses Differentiation and Sustains Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal in Collaboration with STAT3 |journal=Cell |volume=115 |issue= 3|pages= 281–292 |year=2003 |pmid= 14636556|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00847-X |last2=Nichols |first2=J |last3=Chambers |first3=I |last4=Smith |first4=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uses ===

Due to their plasticity and potentially unlimited capacity for self-renewal, embryonic [[Stem-cell therapy|stem cell therapies]] have been proposed for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease. Pluripotent stem cells have shown potential in treating a number of varying conditions, including but not limited to: [[spinal cord injuries]], [[age related macular degeneration]], [[diabetes]], [[neurodegenerative disorders]] (such as [[Parkinson's disease]]), [[AIDS]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mahla |first1=Ranjeet |title=Stem Cell Applications in Regenerative Medicine and Disease Therapeutics |journal=International Journal of Cell Biology |date=July 19, 2016 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1155/2016/6940283 |pmid=27516776}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their potential in regenerative medicine, embryonic stem cells provide an alternative source of tissue/organs which serves as a possible solution to the donor shortage dilemma. Not only that, but tissue/organs derived from ESCs can be made immunocompatible with the recipient. Aside from these uses, embryonic stem cells can also serve as tools for the investigation of early human development, study of genetic disease and as in vitro systems for [[toxicology]] testing.&lt;ref name=sc/&gt;

==Utilizations==

According to a 2002 article in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]'', "Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, and, thus, may be useful as a source of cells for transplantation or tissue engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Levenberg | first1 = S. | title = Endothelial cells derived from human embryonic stem cells | doi = 10.1073/pnas.032074999 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 4391–4396 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = 123658| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.4391L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MESC EBs.jpg|thumb|Embryoid bodies 24 hours after formation.]]

However, embryonic stem cells are not limited to cell/tissue engineering.

===Cell replacement therapies===

Current research focuses on differentiating ESCs into a variety of cell types for eventual use as cell replacement therapies (CRTs). Some of the cell types that have or are currently being developed include [[cardiomyocytes]] (CM), [[neurons]], [[hepatocytes]], [[bone marrow]] cells, [[Pancreatic islets|islet]] cells and [[endothelial]] cells.&lt;ref name="davila"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15014205|year=2004|last1=Davila|first1=JC|last2=Cezar|first2=GG|last3=Thiede|first3=M|last4=Strom|first4=S|last5=Miki|first5=T|last6=Trosko|first6=J|title=Use and application of stem cells in toxicology|volume=79|issue=2|pages=214–23|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfh100|journal=Toxicological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the derivation of such cell types from ESCs is not without obstacles, therefore current research is focused on overcoming these barriers. For example, studies are underway to differentiate ESCs in to tissue specific CMs and to eradicate their immature properties that distinguish them from adult CMs.&lt;ref name="pmid17584049"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|last1=Siu|first1=CW|last2=Moore|first2=JC|last3=Li|first3=RA|title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for heart therapies|journal=Cardiovascular &amp; Hematological Disorders Drug Targets|volume=7|issue=2|pages=145–52|pmid=17584049|doi=10.2174/187152907780830851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug discovery===

Besides becoming an important alternative to organ transplants, ESCs are also being used in field of toxicology and as cellular screens to uncover new chemical entities (NCEs) that can be developed as small molecule drugs.  Studies have shown that cardiomyocytes derived from ESCs are validated in vitro models to test drug responses and predict toxicity profiles.&lt;ref name="davila" /&gt;  ES derived cardiomyocytes have been shown to respond to pharmacological stimuli and hence can be used to assess cardiotoxicity like ''Torsades de Pointes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19277978|year=2009|last1=Jensen|first1=J|last2=Hyllner|first2=J|last3=Björquist|first3=P|title=Human embryonic stem cell technologies and drug discovery|volume=219|issue=3|pages=513–9|doi=10.1002/jcp.21732|journal=Journal of Cellular Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESC-derived hepatocytes are also useful models that could be used in the preclinical stages of drug discovery. However, the development of hepatocytes from ESCs has proven to be challenging and this hinders the ability to test drug metabolism. Therefore, current research is focusing on establishing fully functional ESC-derived hepatocytes with stable phase I and II enzyme activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17346923|year=2007|last1=Söderdahl|first1=T|last2=Küppers-Munther|first2=B|last3=Heins|first3=N|last4=Edsbagge|first4=J|last5=Björquist|first5=P|last6=Cotgreave|first6=I|last7=Jernström|first7=B|title=Glutathione transferases in hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells|volume=21|issue=5|pages=929–37|doi=10.1016/j.tiv.2007.01.021|journal=Toxicology in Vitro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models of genetic disorder===
Several new studies have started to address the concept of modeling genetic disorders with embryonic stem cells. Either by genetically manipulating the cells, or more recently, by deriving diseased cell lines identified by prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD), modeling genetic disorders is something that has been accomplished with stem cells. This approach may very well prove invaluable at studying disorders such as [[Fragile-X syndrome]], [[Cystic fibrosis]], and other genetic maladies that have no reliable model system.

[[Yury Verlinsky]], a Russian-American [[medical researcher]] who specialized in [[embryonic|embryo]] and cellular [[genetics]] (genetic [[cell biology|cytology]]), developed [[prenatal diagnosis]] testing methods to determine genetic and [[chromosomal disorders]] a month and a half earlier than standard [[amniocentesis]]. The techniques are now used by many pregnant women and prospective parents, especially couples who have a history of genetic abnormalities or where the woman is over the age of 35 (when the risk of genetically related disorders is higher). In addition, by allowing parents to select an embryo without genetic disorders, they have the potential of saving the lives of siblings that already had similar disorders and diseases using cells from the disease free offspring.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-hed-verlinsky-20-jul20,0,1789019.story "Dr. Yury Verlinsky, 1943–2009: Expert in reproductive technology"] ''Chicago Tribune'', July 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repair of DNA damage===
Differentiated somatic cells and ES cells use different strategies for dealing with DNA damage.  For instance, human foreskin fibroblasts, one type of somatic cell, use [[Non-homologous end joining|non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)]], an error prone DNA repair process, as the primary pathway for repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) during all cell cycle stages.&lt;ref name="pmid18769152"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mao Z, Bozzella M, Seluanov A, Gorbunova V |title=DNA repair by nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination during cell cycle in human cells |journal=Cell Cycle |volume=7 |issue=18 |pages=2902–6 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18769152 |pmc=2754209 |doi=10.4161/cc.7.18.6679}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because of its error-prone nature, NHEJ tends to produce mutations in a cell’s clonal descendants.

ES cells use a different strategy to deal with DSBs.&lt;ref name=Tichy&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tichy ED, Pillai R, Deng L |title=Mouse embryonic stem cells, but not somatic cells, predominantly use homologous recombination to repair double-strand DNA breaks |journal=Stem Cells Dev. |volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=1699–711 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20446816 |pmc=3128311 |doi=10.1089/scd.2010.0058 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because ES cells give rise to all of the cell types of an organism including the cells of the germ line, mutations arising in ES cells due to faulty DNA repair are a more serious problem than in differentiated somatic cells. Consequently, robust mechanisms are needed in ES cells to repair DNA damages accurately, and if repair fails, to remove those cells with un-repaired DNA damages.  Thus, mouse ES cells predominantly use high fidelity [[Homology directed repair|homologous recombinational repair (HRR)]] to repair DSBs.&lt;ref name=Tichy /&gt;  This type of repair depends on the interaction of the two sister chromosomes formed during S phase and present together during the G2 phase of the cell cycle.  HRR can accurately repair DSBs in one sister chromosome by using intact information from the other sister chromosome.  Cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (i.e. after metaphase/cell division but prior the next round of replication) have only one copy of each chromosome (i.e. sister chromosomes aren’t present).  Mouse ES cells lack a G1 checkpoint and do not undergo cell cycle arrest upon acquiring DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hong Y, Stambrook PJ |title=Restoration of an absent G1 arrest and protection from apoptosis in embryonic stem cells after ionizing radiation |journal=Proc.

===Clinical trial===
{{Main|Human embryonic stem cells clinical trials}}
On January 23, 2009, Phase I clinical trials for transplantation of [[oligodendrocyte]]s (a cell type of the brain and spinal cord) derived from human ES cells into [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord-injured]] individuals received approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), marking it the world's first human ES cell human trial.&lt;ref name="urlFDA approves human embryonic stem cell study - CNN.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/23/stem.cell/ |title=FDA approves human embryonic stem cell study - CNN.com |format= |work= |accessdate= May 1, 2010| date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study leading to this scientific advancement was conducted by Hans Keirstead and colleagues at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and supported by [[Geron Corporation]] of [[Menlo Park, CA]], founded by [[Michael D. West]], PhD. A previous experiment had shown an improvement in locomotor recovery in spinal cord-injured rats after a 7-day delayed transplantation of human ES cells that had been pushed into an oligodendrocytic lineage.&lt;ref name="pmid15888645"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keirstead HS, Nistor G, Bernal G |title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell transplants remyelinate and restore locomotion after spinal cord injury |journal=J.

The researchers emphasized that the injections were not expected to fully cure the patients and restore all mobility.  Based on the results of the rodent trials, researchers speculated that restoration of myelin sheathes and an increase in mobility might occur.  This first trial was primarily designed to test the safety of these procedures and if everything went well, it was hoped that it would lead to future studies that involve people with more severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Reinberg, Steven (2009-01-23) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/23/AR2009012302168.html FDA OKs 1st Embryonic Stem Cell Trial]. ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was put on hold in August 2009 due to FDA concerns regarding a small number of microscopic cysts found in several treated rat models but the hold was lifted on July 30, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110212042712/http://www.geron.com/media/pressview.aspx?id=1188 Geron comments on FDA hold on spinal cord injury trial]. geron.com (August 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 researchers enrolled and administered ESTs to the first patient at [[Shepherd Center]] in [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref name="UST20101011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2010-10-12-stemcells12_ST_N.htm|title=Embryonic stem cells used on patient for first time|date=11 October 2010|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=12 October 2010 | first=Dan | last=Vergano}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The makers of the stem cell therapy, [[Geron Corporation]], estimated that it would take several months for the stem cells to replicate and for the [[Geron Corporation#GRNOPC1|GRNOPC1]] therapy to be evaluated for success or failure.

In November 2011 Geron announced it was halting the trial and dropping out of stem cell research for financial reasons, but would continue to monitor existing patients, and was attempting to find a partner that could continue their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Eryn|title=Geron exits stem cell research|url=http://www.latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-geron-stem-cells-20111115,0,7471215.story?track=rss|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2011-11-15|date=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[BioTime]] ({{NYSE MKT|BTX}}), led by CEO Dr. [[Michael D. West]], acquired all of Geron's stem cell assets, with the stated intention of restarting Geron's embryonic stem cell-based clinical trial for [[spinal cord injury research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Great news: BioTime Subsidiary Asterias Acquires Geron Embryonic Stem Cell Program|url=http://www.ipscell.com/2013/10/great-news-biotime-subsidiary-asterias-acquires-geron-embryonic-stem-cell-program/|work=iPScell.com|date= October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BioTime company Asterias Biotherapeutics (NYSE MKT: AST) was granted a $14.3 million Strategic Partnership Award by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to re-initiate the world’s first embryonic stem cell-based human clinical trial, for spinal cord injury.  Supported by California public funds, CIRM is the largest funder of stem cell-related research and development in the world.&lt;ref name=cal&gt;[http://www.biotimeinc.com/california-institute-of-regenerative-medicine/ California Institute of Regenerative Medicine]. BioTime, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The award provides funding for Asterias to reinitiate clinical development of AST-OPC1 in subjects with spinal cord injury and to expand clinical testing of escalating doses in the target population intended for future pivotal trials.&lt;ref name=cal/&gt;

AST-OPC1 is a population of cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that contains oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). OPCs and their mature derivatives called oligodendrocytes provide critical functional support for nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain. Asterias recently presented the results from phase 1 clinical trial testing of a low dose of AST-OPC1 in patients with neurologically-complete thoracic spinal cord injury. The results showed that AST-OPC1 was successfully delivered to the injured spinal cord site. Patients followed 2–3 years after AST-OPC1 administration showed no evidence of serious adverse events associated with the cells in detailed follow-up assessments including frequent neurological exams and MRIs. Immune monitoring of subjects through one year post-transplantation showed no evidence of antibody-based or cellular immune responses to AST-OPC1. In four of the five subjects, serial MRI scans performed throughout the 2–3 year follow-up period indicate that reduced spinal cord cavitation may have occurred and that AST-OPC1 may have had some positive effects in reducing spinal cord tissue deterioration. There was no unexpected neurological degeneration or improvement in the five subjects in the trial as evaluated by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) exam.&lt;ref name=cal/&gt;

The Strategic Partnership III grant from CIRM will provide funding to Asterias to support the next clinical trial of AST-OPC1 in subjects with spinal cord injury, and for Asterias’ product development efforts to refine and scale manufacturing methods to support later-stage trials and eventually commercialization. CIRM funding will be conditional on FDA approval for the trial, completion of a definitive agreement between Asterias and CIRM, and Asterias’ continued progress toward the achievement of certain pre-defined project milestones.&lt;ref name=cal/&gt;

==Concern and controversy==
===Adverse effects===
The major concern with the possible transplantation of ESC into patients as therapies is their ability to form tumors including teratoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/stem.37|pmid=19415771|title=Deconstructing Stem Cell Tumorigenicity: A Roadmap to Safe Regenerative Medicine|year=2009|last1=Knoepfler|first1=Paul S.|journal=Stem Cells|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1050–6|pmc=2733374}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Safety issues prompted the FDA to place a hold on the first ESC clinical trial, however no tumors were observed.

The main strategy to enhance the safety of ESC for potential clinical use is to differentiate the ESC into specific cell types (e.g. neurons, muscle, liver cells) that have reduced or eliminated ability to cause tumors. Following differentiation, the cells are subjected to sorting by [[flow cytometry]] for further purification. ESC are predicted to be inherently safer than [[IPS cells]] created with genetically-integrating [[viral vectors]] because they are not genetically modified with genes such as c-Myc that are linked to cancer. Nonetheless, ESC express very high levels of the iPS inducing genes and these genes including Myc are essential for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diff.2010.05.001|title=Myc maintains embryonic stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal|year=2010|last1=Varlakhanova|first1=Natalia V.|last2=Cotterman|first2=Rebecca F.|last3=Devries|first3=Wilhelmine N.|last4=Morgan|first4=Judy|last5=Donahue|first5=Leah Rae|last6=Murray|first6=Stephen|last7=Knowles|first7=Barbara B.|last8=Knoepfler|first8=Paul S.|journal=Differentiation|volume=80|pages=9–19|pmid=20537458|issue=1|pmc=2916696}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potential strategies to improve safety by eliminating c-Myc expression are unlikely to preserve the cells' "stemness". However, N-myc and L-myc have been identified to induce iPS cells instead of c-myc with similar efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.stem.2007.12.001|pmid= 18371415|title= C-Myc is Dispensable for Direct Reprogramming of Mouse Fibroblasts|journal= Cell Stem Cell|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 10–2|year= 2008|last1= Wernig|first1= Marius|last2= Meissner|first2= Alexander|last3= Cassady|first3= John P|last4= Jaenisch|first4= Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent protocols to induce pluripotency bypass these problems completely by using non-integrating RNA viral vectors such as [[sendai virus]] or [[mRNA]] transfection.

===Ethical debate===
{{Main|Stem cell controversy}}
Due to the nature of embryonic stem cell research, there are a lot of controversial opinions on the topic. Since harvesting embryonic stem cells necessitates destroying the embryo from which those cells are obtained, the moral status of the embryo comes into question. Scientists argue that the 5-day old mass of cells is too young to achieve personhood or that the embryo, if donated from an IVF clinic (which is where labs typically acquire embryos from), would otherwise go to medical waste anyway. Opponents of ESC research counter that any embryo has the potential to become a human, therefore destroying it is murder and the embryo must be protected under the same ethical view as a developed human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Nancy |last2=Perrin |first2=Jacob |title=Ethical issues in stem cell research and therapy |journal=Stem Cell Research and Therapy |date=July 7, 2014 |doi=10.1186/scrt474 |url=https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/scrt474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

==Techniques and conditions for derivation and culture==

===Derivation from humans===
In vitro fertilization generates multiple embryos. The surplus of embryos is not clinically used or is unsuitable for implantation into the patient, and therefore may be donated by the donor with consent. Human embryonic stem cells can be derived from these donated embryos or additionally they can also be extracted from cloned embryos using a cell from a patient and a donated egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mountford|first=JC|title=Human embryonic stem cells: origins, characteristics and potential for regenerative therapy|journal=Transfus Med|year=2008|volume=18|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.2007.00807.x|pmid=18279188|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner cell mass (cells of interest), from the blastocyst stage of the embryo, is separated from the trophectoderm, the cells that would differentiate into extra-embryonic tissue. Immunosurgery, the process in which antibodies are bound to the trophectoderm and removed by another solution, and mechanical dissection are performed to achieve separation. The resulting inner cell mass cells are plated onto cells that will supply support. The inner cell mass cells attach and expand further to form a human embryonic cell line, which are undifferentiated. These cells are fed daily and are enzymatically or mechanically separated every four to seven days. For differentiation to occur, the human embryonic stem cell line is removed from the supporting cells to form embryoid bodies, is co-cultured with a serum containing necessary signals, or is grafted in a three-dimensional scaffold to result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, Waknitz MA, Swiergiel JJ, Marshall VS, Jones JM |title=Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts|journal=Science|year=1998|volume=282|pages=1145–1147|doi= 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145|pmid=9804556|issue=5391|bibcode=1998Sci...282.1145T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivation from other animals===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ES cell derivation.jpeg|thumb|ES cells are derived from the [[inner cell mass]] of the early embryo.  This schematic shows one method of derivation. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
Embryonic stem cells are derived from the [[inner cell mass]] of the early [[embryo]], which are harvested from the donor mother animal.  [[Martin Evans]] and [[Matthew Kaufman]] reported a technique that delays embryo implantation, allowing the inner cell mass to increase.  This process includes removing the donor mother's [[ovaries]] and dosing her with [[progesterone]], changing the hormone environment, which causes the embryos to remain free in the uterus.  After 4–6 days of this intrauterine culture, the embryos are harvested and grown in ''in vitro'' culture until the inner cell mass forms “egg cylinder-like structures,” which are dissociated into single cells, and plated on [[fibroblasts]] treated with [[Mitomycin|mitomycin-c]] (to prevent fibroblast [[mitosis]]).  Clonal [[cell lines]] are created by growing up a single cell.  Evans and Kaufman showed that the cells grown out from these cultures could form [[teratoma]]s and [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]], and differentiate ''in vitro,'' all of which indicating that the cells are [[pluripotent]].&lt;ref name="Evans M, Kaufman M 1981 154–6"/&gt;

[[Gail R. Martin|Gail Martin]] derived and cultured her ES cells differently.  She removed the embryos from the donor mother at approximately 76 hours after copulation and cultured them overnight in a medium containing serum.  The following day, she removed the [[inner cell mass]] from the late [[blastocyst]] using [[microsurgery]].  The extracted [[inner cell mass]] was cultured on [[fibroblasts]] treated with [[Mitomycin|mitomycin-c]] in a medium containing serum and conditioned by ES cells.  After approximately one week, colonies of cells grew out.  These cells grew in culture and demonstrated [[pluripotent]] characteristics, as demonstrated by the ability to form [[teratoma]]s, differentiate ''in vitro,'' and form [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]].  Martin referred to these cells as ES cells.&lt;ref name="Martin G 1981 7634–8"/&gt;

It is now known that the [[Fibroblast|feeder cells]] provide [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF) and serum provides [[bone morphogenetic proteins]] (BMPs) that are necessary to prevent ES cells from differentiating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith AG, Heath JK, Donaldson DD, Wong GG, Moreau J, Stahl M, Rogers D| title = Inhibition of pluripotential embryonic stem cell differentiation by purified polypeptides| journal = Nature | volume = 336 | issue = 6200 | pages = 688–690 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3143917 | doi = 10.1038/336688a0| bibcode = 1988Natur.336..688S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RL, Hilton DJ, Pease S, Willson TA, Stewart CL, Gearing DP, Wagner EF, Metcalf D, Nicola NA, Gough NM | title = Myeloid leukaemia inhibitory factor maintains the developmental potential of embryonic stem cells | journal = Nature | volume = 336 | issue = 6200 | pages = 684–687 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3143916| doi = 10.1038/336684a0| bibcode = 1988Natur.336..684W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors are extremely important for the efficiency of deriving ES cells.  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that different mouse strains have different efficiencies for isolating ES cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledermann B, Bürki K | title = Establishment of a germ-line competent C57BL/6 embryonic stem cell line | journal = Exp Cell Res | volume = 197 | issue = 2 | pages = 254–258 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1959560 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current uses for mouse ES cells include the generation of [[transgenic]] mice, including [[knockout mice]].  For human treatment, there is a need for patient specific pluripotent cells.  Generation of human ES cells is more difficult and faces ethical issues.  So, in addition to human ES cell research, many groups are focused on the generation of [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] (iPS cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Tanabe K, Ohnuki M, Narita M, Ichisaka T, Tomoda K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors | journal = Cell| volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 861–872 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18035408| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential method for new cell line derivation===
On August 23, 2006, the online edition of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' scientific journal published a letter by Dr. [[Robert Lanza]] (medical director of [[Advanced Cell Technology]] in Worcester, MA) stating that his team had found a way to extract embryonic stem cells without destroying the actual embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klimanskaya I, Chung Y, Becker S, Lu SJ, Lanza R | title = Human embryonic stem cell lines derived from single blastomeres| journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7118 | pages = 481–5 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16929302 | doi = 10.1038/nature05142| bibcode = 2006Natur.444..481K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technical achievement would potentially enable scientists to work with new lines of embryonic stem cells derived using public funding in the USA, where federal funding was at the time limited to research using embryonic stem cell lines derived prior to August 2001.  In March, 2009, the limitation was lifted.&lt;ref name="restriction_lifted"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/10/obama-stem-cell-research US scientists relieved as Obama lifts ban on stem cell research], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induced pluripotent stem cells===
{{main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

The iPSC technology was pioneered by [[Shinya Yamanaka]]’s lab in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], who showed in 2006 that the introduction of four specific genes encoding [[transcription factors]] could convert adult cells into pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = K | last2 = Yamanaka | first2 = S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize along with Sir [[John Gurdon]] "for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/press.html|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=8 October 2012|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – 2012 Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 it was shown that [[pluripotency|pluripotent]] [[stem cell]]s highly similar to embryonic stem cells can be generated by the delivery of three genes (''Oct4'', ''Sox2'', and ''Klf4'') to differentiated cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature05944| issn = 1476-4687| volume = 448| issue = 7151| pages = 318–324| last1 = Wernig| first1 = Marius| last2 = Meissner| first2 = Alexander| last3 = Foreman| first3 = Ruth| last4 = Brambrink| first4 = Tobias| last5 = Ku| first5 = Manching| last6 = Hochedlinger| first6 = Konrad| last7 = Bernstein| first7 = Bradley E.| last8 = Jaenisch| first8 = Rudolf| title = In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state| journal = Nature| date = 2007-07-19| pmid = 17554336| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7151/full/nature05944.html| bibcode = 2007Natur.448..318W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delivery of these genes "reprograms" differentiated cells into pluripotent stem cells, allowing for the generation of pluripotent stem cells without the embryo. Because ethical concerns regarding embryonic stem cells typically are about their derivation from terminated embryos, it is believed that reprogramming to these "induced pluripotent stem cells" (iPS cells) may be less controversial. Both human and mouse cells can be reprogrammed by this methodology, generating both human pluripotent stem cells and mouse pluripotent stem cells without an embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Embryonic stem cells made without embryos | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2058175020071121 | date=2007-11-21 | publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may enable the generation of patient specific ES cell lines that could potentially be used for cell replacement therapies.  In addition, this will allow the generation of ES cell lines from patients with a variety of genetic diseases and will provide invaluable models to study those diseases.

However, as a first indication that the [[induced pluripotent stem cell]] (iPS) cell technology can in rapid succession lead to new cures, it was used by a research team headed by [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] of the [[Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], to cure mice of [[sickle cell anemia]], as reported by [[Science (journal)|''Science'' journal's]] online edition on December 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/06/AR2007120602444.html | title=Scientists Cure Mice Of Sickle Cell Using Stem Cell Technique: New Approach Is From Skin, Not Embryos | author=Weiss, Rick | publisher=[[The Washington Post]]  | date=2007-12-07 | pages=A02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1152092|pmid=18063756|title=Treatment of Sickle Cell Anemia Mouse Model with iPS Cells Generated from Autologous Skin|journal=Science|volume=318|issue=5858|pages=1920|year=2007|last1=Hanna|first1=J.|last2=Wernig|first2=M.|last3=Markoulaki|first3=S.|last4=Sun|first4=C.-W.|last5=Meissner|first5=A.|last6=Cassady|first6=J.

On January 16, 2008, a California-based company, Stemagen, announced that they had created the first mature cloned human embryos from single skin cells taken from adults. These embryos can be harvested for patient matching embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7194161.stm | title=US team makes embryo clone of men | author=Helen Briggs | publisher=[[BBC]]  | date=2008-01-17 | pages=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contamination by reagents used in cell culture===
The online edition of ''Nature Medicine'' published a study on January 24, 2005, which stated that the human embryonic stem cells available for federally funded research are contaminated with non-human molecules from the culture medium used to grow the cells.&lt;ref name=ebert&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ebert |first=Jessica |date=24 January 2005 |title=Human stem cells trigger immune attack |journal=Nature News |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |location=London |url=http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/news/0501/124.htm |doi=10.1038/news050124-1 |accessdate=2009-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924071349/http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/news/0501/124.htm |archivedate=2010-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common technique to use mouse cells and other animal cells to maintain the pluripotency of actively dividing stem cells. The problem was discovered when non-human [[sialic acid]] in the growth medium was found to compromise the potential uses of the embryonic stem cells in humans, according to scientists at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin MJ, Muotri A, Gage F, Varki A |title=Human embryonic stem cells express an immunogenic nonhuman sialic acid |journal=Nat. Med. |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=228–32 |year=2005 |pmid=15685172 |doi=10.1038/nm1181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study published in the online edition of ''Lancet Medical Journal'' on March 8, 2005 detailed information about a new stem cell line that was derived from human embryos under completely cell- and serum-free conditions. After more than 6 months of undifferentiated proliferation, these cells demonstrated the potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers both ''in vitro'' and in [[teratoma]]s. These properties were also successfully maintained (for more than 30 passages) with the established stem cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klimanskaya I, Chung Y, Meisner L, Johnson J, West MD, Lanza R |title=Human embryonic stem cells derived without feeder cells |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9471 |pages=1636–41 |year=2005 |pmid=15885296 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66473-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2878">An '''employee relationship management''' ('''ERM''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles IT pro e-Business Employee Relationship Management (ERM)|url=http://en.kioskea.net/contents/211-employee-relationship-management-erm|website=Kioskea.net|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; system is an [[information system]] that supports the relationship between a [[company]] and its [[employee]]s.

Employee relationship management has focused on enabling employees to collaborate on typical managerial tasks with their employers. By engaging inputs from both sides of the employment relationship, ERM platforms aim to align the interests of both parties, worker and employer, and inform day-to-day business functions under a streamlined workflow.

==Components and functions==
The components of an employee relationship management platform are multiple, and, as in [[customer relationship management]], achieve the goal of assisting the employee in the whole [[:wikt:life cycle|life cycle]] of her/his activity in and for the company.

Employee relationship management platforms include but are not limited to the following functions: 
* Job search and recruitment
* Job application and hiring
* Schedule generation
* Shift management (e.g. inter-employee shift trades and cancellations)
* Training
* Employee evaluations 
* Workplace and manager evaluations
* Rewards and recognition
* Messaging and communication&lt;ref&gt;http://en.kioskea.net/contents/211-employee-relationship-management-erm&lt;/ref&gt;
and some other component may differ as the application changes.

==Classification==
The employee relationship management classification differentiates from other [[Human resource management system|human resource information systems]] and workforce management systems]] by considering the whole employee, taking steps to ensure that the employee's work-life needs are well balanced and accounted for in the computation of work assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Leigh|title=What Is Employee Relationship Management?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-relationship-management-709.html|publisher=|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, current platforms on the market, such as WorkJam, allow workers to find jobs based on their availability, and once they are hired, employees can view schedules and choose when they work in accordance with employer and regulatory staffing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilodeau|first1=Kelly|title=Lives in Limbo: The Challenge of On-Call Work Shifts |url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/social-business/lives-in-limbo-the-challenge-of-oncall-work-shifts-029182.php|accessdate=21 May 2015|publisher= |website=CMSWire|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Existentialism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|g|z|ɪ|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|n|ʃ|əl|ɪ|z|əm}})&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/existentialism "Oxford Dictionary: 'existentialism'"], ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Retrieved 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tradition of philosophical inquiry associated mainly with certain 19th and 20th-century [[Europe]]an philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/ |title=Existentialism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Crowell, Steven |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philosophy 1995 p. 259"&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarie, ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; While the predominant value of existentialist thought is commonly acknowledged to be freedom, its primary virtue is [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Existentialism - A Very Short Introduction|last = Flynn|first = Thomas|publisher = Oxford University Press Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = 0-19-280428-6|location = New York|page = xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or [[Existential dread|dread]] in the face of an apparently meaningless or [[Absurdism|absurd]] world.&lt;ref name="Robert C. Solomon 1974, pp. 1"&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''Existentialism'' (McGraw-Hill, 1974, pp. 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Existentialism: From Dostoyevesky to Sartre'', New York (1956) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] is generally considered to have been the first existentialist philosopher,&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marino, Gordon. ''Basic Writings of Existentialism'' (Modern Library, 2004, p. ix, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald2009Stanford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McDonald |first=William |title=Søren Kierkegaard |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (Summer 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N.

''Kierkegaard'' (Oneworld, 2003, pp. 4–6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Walter. ''Kierkegaard's attack upon "Christendom"'' (Princeton, 1969, pp. 37–40).&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism became popular in the years following [[World War II]], and strongly influenced many disciplines besides [[philosophy]], including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NSvRzPye-gEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=psychoanalysis |last=Guignon and Pereboom, Derk |first=Charles B. |title=Existentialism: basic writings |publisher=Hackett Publishing |year=2001 |page=xiii |isbn=9780872205956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term "existentialism" (French: ''L'existentialisme'') was coined by the [[Roman Catholicism in France|French Catholic]] philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Cooper ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1990, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas R. Flynn 2006, page 89"&gt;Thomas R. Flynn, ''Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford University Press), 2006, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christine Daigle 2006, page 5"&gt;Christine Daigle, ''Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics'' (McGill-Queen's press, 2006, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; At first, when Marcel applied the term to him at a colloquium in 1945, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;
Ann Fulton, Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963 (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre subsequently changed his mind and, on October 29, 1945, publicly adopted the existentialist label in a lecture to the ''Club Maintenant'' in [[Paris]]. The lecture was published as ''[[L'existentialisme est un humanisme]]'' (''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]''), a short book that did much to popularize existentialist thought.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Existentialisme est un Humanisme'' (Editions Nagel, 1946); ''English'' Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Existentialism and Humanism'' (Eyre Methuen, 1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of the term Neo-Socratic, in honor of Kierkegaard's essay "On The Concept of Irony".

Some scholars argue that the term should be used only to refer to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Albert Camus]].&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt; Other scholars extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Steven. ''The Cambridge Companion to Existentialism'', Cambridge, 2011, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is often identified with the philosophical views of Jean-Paul Sartre.&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt;

==Definitional issues and background==
The labels ''existentialism'' and ''existentialist'' are often seen as historical conveniences in as far as they were first applied to many philosophers in hindsight, long after they had died. In fact, while existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre posits the idea that "what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]]", as scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] explains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Existentialism | journal = Philosophy | first = F.C. | last = Copleston | volume = 23 | issue = 84 | pages = 19–37 | jstor = 4544850 | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100065955 | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to philosopher [[Steven Crowell]], defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better [[understanding|understood]] as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself.&lt;ref name="Crowell-SEoP"/&gt; Sartre himself, in a lecture delivered in 1945, described existentialism as "the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent [[atheism]]".&lt;ref&gt;See [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]]'s introduction to {{Cite book |last = Sartre |first = Jean-Paul |year = 2000 |title = Nausea |location = London |publisher = [[Penguin Classics]] |isbn = 978-0-141-18549-1 }} Quote on p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CGbBbtDOZbwC&amp;pg=PT5 vii].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many outside [[Scandinavia]] consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard himself{{who|date=May 2018}}, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term "existential" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic [[Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Tidsskrift for Norsk Psykologforening, Vol 45, nummer 10, 2008, side 1298–1304, [http://www.psykologtidsskriftet.no/index.php?seks_id=61613&amp;a=2 Welhaven og psykologien: Del 2. Welhaven peker fremover] (in Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion comes from two sources. The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard. It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with "a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential".&lt;ref&gt;Lundestad, 1998, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; This was then brought to Kierkegaard by Sibbern.

The second claim comes from the Norwegian historian [[Rune Slagstad]], who claims to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term "existential" was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that "[[Hegelianism|Hegelians]] do not study philosophy 'existentially'; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Slagstad, 2001, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Existence precedes essence ===
{{Main|Existence precedes essence}}

Sartre claimed that a central proposition of Existentialism is that ''existence precedes [[essence]]'', which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individuals—independently acting and responsible, conscious beings ("existence")—rather than what labels, roles, stereotypes, definitions, or other preconceived categories the individuals fit ("essence"). The actual life of the individuals is what constitutes what could be called their "true essence" instead of there being an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Thus, human beings, through their own [[consciousness]], create their own values and determine a meaning to their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} (Dictionary) "L'existencialisme" – see "l'identité de la personne"&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as [[Heidegger]], and [[Kierkegaard]]:

{{Quotation|"The subjective ''thinker’s form'', the form of his communication, is his ''style''. His form must be just as manifold as are the opposites that he holds together. The systematic ''eins, zwei, drei'' is an abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever it is to be applied to the concrete. To the same degree as the subjective thinker is concrete, to the same degree his form must also be concretely dialectical. But just as he himself is not a poet, not an ethicist, not a dialectician, so also his form is none of these directly. His form must first and last be related to existence, and in this regard he must have at his disposal the poetic, the ethical, the dialectical, the religious. Subordinate character, setting, etc., which belong to the well-balanced character of the esthetic production, are in themselves breadth; the subjective thinker has only one setting—existence—and has nothing to do with localities and such things. The setting is not the fairyland of the imagination, where poetry produces consummation, nor is the setting laid in England, and historical accuracy is not a concern. The setting is inwardness in existing as a human being; the concretion is the relation of the existence-categories to one another. Historical accuracy and historical actuality are breadth." Søren Kierkegaard (Concluding Postscript, Hong pp. 357–58)}}

Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence - what Sartre would call '[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]'. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are (1) defined only insofar as they act and (2) that they are responsible for their actions. For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Furthermore, by this action of cruelty, such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is as opposed to their genes, or ''human nature'', bearing the blame.

As Sartre says in his lecture ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'': "... man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards". The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: A person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |authorlink= |author2=Walter Kaufmann |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages= |url= |doi= |isbn=0-13-158591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus ''[[Being and Time]]''. In the correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]] later published as the ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'', Heidegger implies that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26355951|title=Basic Writings: From Being and Time (1927) to The Task of Thinking (1964)|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=Harper San Francisco|others=Edited by David Farrell Krell|year=1993|isbn=0060637633|edition=Revised and expanded|location=San Francisco, California|pages=|oclc=26355951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger commented that "the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement", meaning that he thought Sartre had simply switched the roles traditionally attributed to essence and existence without interrogating these concepts and their history in the way that Heidegger claimed to have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26355951|title=Basic Writings: From Being and Time (1927) to The Task of thinking (1964)|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=Harper San Francisco|others=Edited by David Farrell Krell|year=1993|isbn=0060637633|edition=Revised and expanded|location=San Francisco, California|pages=243|oclc=26355951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Absurd ===
{{Main|Absurdism}}

The notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]] contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or "unfairness" of the world. This conceptualization can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional [[Abrahamic religions|Judeo-Christian-Islamic]] perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is about the fulfillment of God's commandments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Existentialism: A Beginner's Guide|last=Wartenberg|first=Thomas|publisher=One World|year=2008|isbn=9781780740201|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a purpose is what gives meaning to people's lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the [[juxtaposition]] of the two, where life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, which was first elaborated by  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of Existentialism|last=Michelman|first=Stephen|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780810875890|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the absurd in existentialism  contrasts with the claim that "bad things don't happen to good people"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a "good" person as to a "bad" person.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#AnxNotAbs 3.1 Anxiety, Nothingness, the Absurd]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the world's absurdity, at any point in time, anything can happen to anyone, and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the Absurd. The notion of the Absurd has been prominent in literature throughout history. Many of the literary works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Luigi Pirandello]],&lt;ref name=luigitheatre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassnett|first1=Susan|last2=Lorch|first2=Jennifer|title=Luigi Pirandello in the Theatre|date=March 18, 2014|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpwiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=luigi+pirandello+existentialism#v=onepage&amp;q=existentialist|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=understandex&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Mel|last2=Rodgers|first2=Nigel|title=Understanding Existentialism: Teach Yourself|date=2010|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfczAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105&amp;dq=pirandello+existentialism#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crisisconsciousness&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caputi|first1=Anthony Francis|title=Pirandello and the Crisis of Modern Consciousness|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Qv2nuJF7yYC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=pirandello+existential+absurd#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existentialist%20absurdity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=masks&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mariani|first1=Umberto|title=Living Masks: The Achievement of Pirandello|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBviYn43H34C&amp;pg=PT178&amp;dq=pirandello+existential+absurd#v=onepage&amp;q=pirandello%20existential%20absurd|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Joseph Heller]] and [[Albert Camus]] contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world.

It is in relation to the concept of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Albert Camus claimed that "there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide" in his ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Although "prescriptions" against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious "stage" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of [[Quietism (philosophy)|quietism]], which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm |title=Existentialism is a Humanism, Jean-Paul Sartre 1946 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that the possibility of [[suicide]] makes all humans existentialists. The ultimate hero of absurdism lives without meaning and faces suicide without succumbing to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Suicide and Self-Deception|author=E Keen|publisher=Psychoanalytic Review|year=1973|url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=PSAR.060.0575A|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facticity ===
{{main|Facticity}}

Facticity is a concept defined by Sartre in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' as the ''[[being-in-itself|in-itself]]'', which delineates for humans the modalities of being and not being. This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, in the sense that it co-constitutes oneself. However, to say that one is only one's past would be to ignore a significant part of reality (the present and the future), while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from oneself now. A denial of one's own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity (having a human body — e.g., one that doesn't allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound — identity, values, etc.).&lt;ref name="2.1 Facticity and Transcendence"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FacTra 2.1 Facticity and Transcendence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one couldn't have chosen (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it. However, even though one's facticity is "set in stone" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: The value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. They both have committed many crimes, but the first man, knowing nothing about this, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for "trapping" him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.

However, to disregard one's facticity when, in the continual process of self-making, one projects oneself into the future, that would be to put oneself in denial of oneself, and thus would be inauthentic. In other words, the origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially). An example of one focusing solely on one's possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity:&lt;ref name="2.1 Facticity and Transcendence"/&gt; if one continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without considering the facticity of ''not currently having the financial means to do so''. In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a ''future-facticity'' of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.

Another aspect of facticity is that it entails [[angst]], both in the sense that freedom "produces" angst when limited by facticity, and in the sense that the lack of the possibility of having facticity to "step in" for one to take responsibility for something one has done, also produces angst.

Another aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values.  Thus, one is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values.  The focus on [[freedom]] in existentialism is related to the limits of the responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom: the relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency, and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FreVal 3. Freedom and Value]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#IdeVal 3.2 The Ideality of Values]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity ===
{{main|Authenticity (philosophy)|l1=Authenticity}}

Many noted existentialist writers consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authentic existence involves the idea that one has to "create oneself" and then live in accordance with this self. What is meant by [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is that in acting, one should act as oneself, not as "one's acts" or as "one's genes" or any other essence requires. The authentic act is one that is in accordance with one's freedom. As a condition of freedom is facticity, this includes one's facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one's transcendent choices (in the sense that one could then blame one's background [facticity] for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one's transcendence]). The role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one's actual values come into play when one makes a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, "choosing" randomly), so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Aut 2.3 Authenticity]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this, the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, through convincing oneself that some form of [[determinism]] is true, to a sort of "mimicry" where one acts as "one should".

How "one should" act is often determined by an image one has, of how one such as oneself (say, a bank manager, lion tamer, prostitute, etc.) acts. In [[Being and Nothingness]], Sartre relates an example of a "[[waiter]]" in ''bad faith'': he merely takes part in the "act" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly.&lt;ref name="Jean-Paul Sartre 2003"&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Being and Nothingness'', Routledge Classics (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This image usually corresponds to some sort of social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic: The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility, and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom.

=== The Other and the Look ===
{{main|Other (philosophy)}}

The Other (when written with a capital "O") is a concept more properly belonging to [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and its account of [[intersubjectivity]]. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The experience of the Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)—only from "over there"—the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is "there" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes [[the Gaze]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Ali 2.2 Alienation]&lt;/ref&gt;

While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective, and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. As such, when one experiences oneself in the Look, one doesn't experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something. Sartre's own example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole can help clarify this: at first, this man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in; he is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him, and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is thus filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing, as a [[Peeping Tom]]. The Look is then co-constitutive of one's facticity.

Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house; the Look isn't some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one (there may also have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that the person was there). It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him.

=== Angst and dread ===
{{main|Angst}}
{{See also|Living educational theory}}

"Existential [[angst]]", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or [[anguish]], is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypical example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that "nothing is holding me back", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom. Angst, according to the modern existentialist, [[Adam Fong]], is the sudden realization of a lack of meaning, often while one completes a task that initially seems to have intrinsic meaning.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

It can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While in the case of fear, one can take definitive measures to remove the object of fear, in the case of angst, no such "constructive" measures are possible. The use of the word "nothing" in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions, and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their stead—that they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this doesn't change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action.

=== Despair ===
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Despair|l1=Despair}}
{{See also|Existential crisis}}

Despair, in existentialism, is generally defined as a loss of hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/despair |title=despair - definition of despair by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Tfd.com |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it is a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being-thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despair—a hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on—nothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being.

What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they aren't overtly in despair. So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despair—and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in ''[[Either/Or]]'': "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy."&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part II p. 188 Hong&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Works of Love]]'', he said: {{Quotation|When the God-forsaken worldliness of earthly life shuts itself in complacency, the confined air develops poison, the moment gets stuck and stands still, the prospect is lost, a need is felt for a refreshing, enlivening breeze to cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors lest we suffocate in worldliness. ... Lovingly to hope all things is the opposite of despairingly to hope [[nothing]] at all. Love hopes all things—yet is never put to shame. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision. pp. 246–50}}

==Opposition to positivism and rationalism==
{{See also|Positivism|Rationalism}}

Existentialists oppose definitions of human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose [[positivism]] and [[rationalism]]. Existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the feelings of [[anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]] that we feel in the face of our own radical [[free will|freedom]] and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: "Human reason has boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;''Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'' Vol 5, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of "bad faith", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena—"the Other"—that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress their feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserts, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by "the Look" of "the Other" (i.e., possessed by another person—or at least one's idea of that other person).

== Religion ==
{{See also|Atheistic existentialism|Christian existentialism|Jewish existentialism}}

An existentialist reading of the [[Bible]] would demand that the reader recognize that (s)he is an existing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of "truths" that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life - or the learner who should put it to use?"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Soren. ''Works of Love''. Harper &amp; Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confusion with nihilism ==
{{See also|Existential nihilism}}

Although [[nihilism]] and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another as both are rooted in the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the apparent meaninglessness of a world in which humans are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary cause of confusion is that [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is an important philosopher in both fields. Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of [[Angst]] as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to a [[Moral nihilism|moral]] or an [[existential nihilism]]. A pervasive theme in the works of existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in [[Albert Camus|Camus]]' ''The Myth of Sisyphus'' ("One must imagine Sisyphus happy"),&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Albert. "The Myth of Sisyphus". [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html NYU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self-created meaning: Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he wouldn't himself agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'s final words in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' are "All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work."&lt;ref name="Jean-Paul Sartre 2003"/&gt;

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

==== Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ====
{{Main|Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term "existentialism" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from [[boredom]]. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser.&lt;ref&gt;Luper, Steven. "Existing". Mayfield Publishing, 2000, pp. 4–5 and 11&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's [[knight of faith]] and Nietzsche's [[Übermensch]] are representative of people who exhibit [[Free will|Freedom]], in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to [[Christianity]] as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a [[leap of faith]] is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including [[postmodernism]], and various strands of [[psychology|psychotherapy.]] However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking.

====Dostoyevsky====

The first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubben, William. ''Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Kafka, Jabber-wacky'', Scribner, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Dostoyevsky's ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in his book on existentialism ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'', quoted Dostoyevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' as an example of [[existential crisis]]. Sartre attributes Ivan Karamazov's claim, "If God did not exist, everything would be permitted"&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. ''Existentialism is a Humanism'' http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm ; Retrieved 2012-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; to Dostoyevsky himself, though this quote does not appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|author=Zizek, Slavoj|title=If there is a God, then everything is permitted|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417192350/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|archivedate=2015-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar sentiment is explicitly stated when Alyosha visits Dimitri in prison. Dimitri mentions his conversations with Rakitin in which the idea that "Then, if He doesn't exist, man is king of the earth, of the universe" allowing the inference contained in Sartre's attribution to remain a valid idea contested within the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dostoyevsky Fyodor. "[[The Brothers Karamazov]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself.&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911266433|title=Existentialism and its relevance to the contemporary system of education in India : existentialism and present educational scenario|last=Rukhsana.|first=Akhter,|isbn=3954892774|location=Hamburg|oclc=911266433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 20th century ===
{{See also|Martin Heidegger}}

In the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher [[Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo]], in his 1913 book ''The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations'', emphasized the life of "flesh and bone" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in [[Cervantes]]' fictional character [[Don Quixote]]. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith, ''[[San Manuel Bueno, Mártir|Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr]]'', which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, [[Ortega y Gasset]], writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: "''Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia''" ("I am myself and my circumstances"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated ("''en situation''").

Although [[Martin Buber]] wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and [[Frankfurt]], he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in [[Zionism]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. In 1938, he moved permanently to [[Jerusalem]]. His best-known philosophical work was the short book ''[[I and Thou]]'', published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is "man with man", a dialogue that takes place in the so-called "sphere of between" (''"das Zwischenmenschliche"'').&lt;ref&gt;Maurice S. Friedman, ''Martin Buber. The Life of Dialogue'' (University of Chicago press, 1955, p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Russian thinkers, [[Lev Shestov]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov, born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in Kiev, had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms ''All Things Are Possible''.

Berdyaev, also from Kiev but with a background in the Eastern Orthodox Church, drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. "Man" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God's image, an originator of free, creative acts.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), pp. 173–76&lt;/ref&gt; He published a major work on these themes, ''The Destiny of Man'', in 1931.

[[Gabriel Marcel]], long before coining the term "existentialism", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay "Existence and Objectivity" (1925) and in his ''Metaphysical Journal'' (1927).&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"&gt;Samuel M. Keen, "Gabriel Marcel" in Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan Publishing Co, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through "secondary reflection", a "dialogical" rather than "dialectical" approach to the world, characterized by "wonder and astonishment" and open to the "presence" of other people and of God rather than merely to "information" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted "extravagant" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 110)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel contrasted ''secondary reflection'' with abstract, scientific-technical ''primary reflection'', which he associated with the activity of the abstract [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate—embodied—in a concrete world.&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] adopted the term "existentialism" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel's thought has been described as "almost diametrically opposed" to that of Sartre.&lt;ref name="Samuel M. Keen 1967"/&gt; Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.

In Germany, the psychologist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]]—who later described existentialism as a "phantom" created by the public&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/11)&lt;/ref&gt;—called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, ''Existenzphilosophie''. For Jaspers, "''Existenz''-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers, a professor at the University of [[Heidelberg]], was acquainted with [[Martin Heidegger]], who held a professorship at [[Marburg]] before acceding to Husserl's chair at [[Freiburg]] in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] (Nazism). They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/2 and following)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1930s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In ''[[Being and Time]]'' he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (''Dasein'') to be analysed in terms of existential categories (''existentiale''); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.

=== After the Second World War ===

Following the [[Second World War]], existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Baert, ''The Existentialist Moment; The Rise of Sartre as a Public Intellectual'' (Polity Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; These years also saw the growing reputation of Heidegger's book ''[[Being and Time]]'' outside Germany.
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]]]

Sartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' and the short stories in his 1939 collection ''[[The Wall (book)|The Wall]]'', and had published his treatise on existentialism, ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates—Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others—became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism.&lt;ref name="Ronald Aronson 2004"&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, chapter 3 ''passim'')&lt;/ref&gt; In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 "a fame that reached across all audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt; Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former [[French Resistance]]) newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]'', and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and [[secular humanism]] to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that "not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us";&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''Force of Circumstance'', quoted in Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt; existentialism became "the first media craze of the postwar era."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1947, Camus' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'' had been performed and his novel ''[[The Plague]]'' published; the first two novels of Sartre's ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir's novel ''[[The Blood of Others]]''. Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris-based existentialists had become famous.&lt;ref name="Ronald Aronson 2004"/&gt;

Sartre had traveled to Germany in 1930 to study the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]],&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidgger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''. Heidegger's thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by [[Alexandre Kojève]] in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on Kojève in Martin Cohen (editor), ''The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics''(Hodder Arnold, 2006, p. 158); see also Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit'' (Cornell University Press, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[André Breton]], and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Entry on Kojève in Martin Cohen (editor), ''The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics''(Hodder Arnold, 2006, p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt; A selection from Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'' was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals.

Heidegger read Sartre's work and was initially impressed, commenting: "Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think. Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Hediegger, letter, quoted in Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidgger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 349)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower [[Jean Beaufret]],&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger – Between Good and Evil'' (Harvard University Press, 1998, p. 356)&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre's position and existentialism in general in his ''[[Letter on Humanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Richardson, ''Martin Heidegger: From Phenomenology to Thought'' (Martjinus Nijhoff,1967, p. 351)&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger's reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and [[Marxism]] in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''. A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility.

Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', ''Summer in Algiers'', ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', and ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', the latter being "considered—to what would have been Camus's irritation—the exemplary existentialist novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Messud |first = Claire |authorlink = Claire Messud |year = 2014 |title = A New 'L'Étranger' |url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jun/05/camus-new-letranger/ |journal = [[The New York Review of Books]] |volume = 61 |number = 10 |accessdate = 1 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works concerned with facing the absurd. In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of [[Sisyphus]] to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers.

[[Simone de Beauvoir]], an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre's partner, wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works, including ''[[The Second Sex]]'' and ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]''. Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre,&lt;ref name = Bergoffen-SEoP&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/|title=Simone de Beauvoir|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Bergoffen, Debra|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"/&gt;

[[Paul Tillich]], an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and [[Karl Barth]], applied existentialist concepts to [[Christian theology]], and helped introduce [[neo-orthodoxy|existential theology]] to the general public. His seminal work ''The Courage to Be'' follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity. [[Rudolf Bultmann]] used Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts.

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], an [[Existential phenomenology|existential phenomenologist]], was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, G. B., in Robert Audi's ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) [p. 559]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Merleau-Ponty's work ''Humanism and Terror'' greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir,&lt;ref name="Rukhsana"/&gt; who sided with Sartre.

[[Colin Wilson]], an English writer, published his study ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'' in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. ''Introduction to the New Existentialism''), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gunnar Bergström, ''An Odyssey to Freedom'' University of Uppsala, 1983, p. 92. Colin Stanley, ''Colin Wilson, a Celebration: Essays and Recollections'' Cecil Woolf, 1988, p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt;

Existential perspectives are also found in modern literature to varying degrees, especially since the 1920s.

Lovecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/eglovecraft12008.html |title=Zarathustra . . . Cthulhu . Meursault:  Existential Futility in H.P.

Dick]], ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]],  ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] and ''[https://www.writersworkshopindia.com/books/fiction/novel/formless-meanderings/ Formless Meanderings]'' by [[Bharath Srinivasan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Bharath|last=Srinivasan|title= Formless Meanderings|place= Kolkata|publisher= Writers Workshop|url=https://www.writersworkshopindia.com/books/fiction/novel/formless-meanderings/| year= 2009 |pages= 352| isbn=81-8157-945-4|ignore-isbn-error=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing existential themes.

==== Theatre ====
[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote ''[[No Exit]]'' in 1944, an existentialist [[play (theatre)|play]] originally published in French as ''Huis Clos'' (meaning ''[[wikt:in camera|In Camera]]'' or "behind closed doors"), which is the source of the popular quote, "Hell is other people." (In French, "L'enfer, c'est les autres"). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.

Existentialist themes are displayed in the [[Theatre of the Absurd]], notably in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, "If I knew, I would have said so in the play." To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, [[Physical exercise|exercise]], swap hats, and contemplate [[suicide]]—anything "to hold the terrible silence at bay".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 31 December 1964. Quoted in Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The play "exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and [[pathos]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, A., ''Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the [[Meaning of life (philosophy)#Existentialism|meaning of human existence]] and the place of God in human existence.

[[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] [[tragicomedy]] first staged at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="Chrono"&gt;{{cite web | author= Michael H. Hutchins | title=A Tom Stoppard Bibliography: Chronology | work=The Stephen Sondheim Reference Guide | url=http://www.sondheimguide.com/Stoppard/chronology.html | date=14 August 2006 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Hamlet]]''. Comparisons have also been drawn to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'', for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing [[Questions (game)|Questions]], impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.

[[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Antigone (Anouilh play)|Antigone]]'' also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wren|first=Celia |date= 12 December 2007 |title= From Forum, an Earnest and Painstaking 'Antigone' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/11/AR2007121102254.html |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the 5th century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately "Ante-GŌN." The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, "...&amp;nbsp;disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness." She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.

Critic [[Martin Esslin]] in his book ''Theatre of the Absurd'' pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], and [[Arthur Adamov]] wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled "Absurdist" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with [['Pataphysics]] or with [[Surrealism]] than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation.&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin B. ''The Modern American Theater: A Collection of Critical Essays''. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: [[Prentice-Hall]], 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ===
{{Main|Existential therapy}}

A major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of [[Otto Rank]], Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, [[Ludwig Binswanger]] was influenced by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]. A later figure was [[Viktor Frankl]], who briefly met [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[Frankl, Viktor: Recollections: An Autobiography. Perseus Publishing, Massachusetts 2000, p. 51]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[logotherapy]] can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence [[social psychology]], antipositivist micro-[[sociology]], [[symbolic interactionism]], and [[post-structuralism]], with the work of thinkers such as [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Jon. ''Kierkegaard and Existentialism''. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Thomas R. ''Sartre, Foucault, and Historical Reason'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was [[Rollo May]], who was strongly influenced by [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Otto Rank]]. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the USA is [[Irvin D. Yalom]]. Yalom states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Aside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers—who include Ludwig Binswanger, [[Medard Boss]], [[Eugène Minkowski]], V.E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F.T. Buytendijk, G. Bally and Victor Frankl—were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May's highly influential 1985 book ''Existence''—and especially his introductory essay—introduced their work into this country.&lt;ref name=Yalom1980&gt;{{Cite book| first= Irvin D.| last= Yalom| author-link= Irvin D. Yalom| title = Existential Psychotherapy| place= New York| publisher= BasicBooks (Subsidiary of Perseus Books, L.L.C.| year= 1980| page= 17| isbn= 0-465-02147-6| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}} Note: The copyright year has not changed, but the book remains in print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existentialist psychotherapy is the British-based [[Emmy van Deurzen]].

Anxiety's importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in [[psychotherapy]]. Therapists often offer existentialist [[philosophy]] as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. [[Humanistic psychology]] also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. [[Terror management theory]], based on the writings of [[Ernest Becker]] and [[Otto Rank]], is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die.

Also, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of [[philosophical counseling]]. So did [[Michel Weber]] with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium.

== Criticisms ==

=== General criticisms ===

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] criticized 'the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.'&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter Arnold, From Shakespeare To Existentialism (Princeton University Press 1979), p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Logical positivists|Logical positivist]] philosophers, such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb "to be" in their analyses of "being".&lt;ref name="Carnap, Rudolf 1932 pp. 219"&gt;Carnap, Rudolf, ''Uberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache'' [''Overcoming Metaphysics by the Logical Analysis of Speech''], Erkenntnis (1932), pp. 219–41. Carnap's critique of Heidegger's "What is Metaphysics".
&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they argue that the verb "is" is transitive and pre-fixed to a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (e.g., an apple ''is red'') (without a predicate, the word "is" is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. [[Colin Wilson]] has stated in his book ''The Angry Years'' that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: "we can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and [[boredom]], we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole".&lt;ref&gt;Colin, Wilson, ''The Angry Years'' (2007), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sartre's philosophy===
Many critics argue [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s philosophy is contradictory. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized Sartre's 1943 ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory".&lt;ref name=Marcuse1972&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre's Existentialism". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Letter on Humanism'', [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized Sartre's existentialism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism", in ''Basic Writings: Nine Key Essays, plus the Introduction to ''Being and Time'' '', trans. David Farrell Krell (London, Routledge; 1978), p. 208. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=But%20the%20reversal%20of%20a%20metaphysical%20statement%20remains%20a%20metaphysical%20statement.%20With%20it%2C%20he%20stays%20with%20metaphysics%2C%20in%20oblivion%20of%20the%20truth%20of%20Being.&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;q=But%20the%20reversal%20of%20a%20metaphysical%20statement%20remains%20a%20metaphysical%20statement.%20With%20it,%20he%20stays%20with%20metaphysics,%20in%20oblivion%20of%20the%20truth%20of%20Being.

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}
'''Eye-gouging''' is a serious offence in [[rugby union]] where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as ''"contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent"'' but such incidents are usually referred to as "[[eye-gouging]]" among players and in the media.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eye gouging: war is declared on rugby's ‘ultimate sin’ |first=Mark |last=Souster |newspaper=The Times (London) |date=11 January 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article6982910.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The laws of rugby union, as written by [[World Rugby]], define foul play as: "''Anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game. It includes obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the Game".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/91/during-the-match/foul-play/definitions/#clause_91|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10 Definitions |publisher = [[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]] (now World Rugby) |accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they state that ''"A player must not do anything that is dangerous to the opponent"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/95/method-of-playing-the-match/foul-play/dangerous-play-and-misconduct/#clause_95|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10.4|publisher = International Rugby Board|accessdate = 29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WR Regulations provide for punishment for contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent.&lt;ref name="REG17"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|title= REGULATION 17. ILLEGAL AND/OR FOUL PLAY AND MISCONDUCT|publisher= ''[[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate= 29 April 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120609160719/http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|archivedate= 9 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this is usually called "[[eye-gouging]]" by the [[Mass media|media]], fans and players, the term "gouging" is not used in World Rugby's laws or regulations, which do list degrees of gravity of the offence. World Rugby themselves have used the term in a 2009 statement, when the body was known as the International Rugby Board (IRB): "The IRB are firmly of the view there is no place in rugby for illegal or foul play and the act of eye-gouging is particularly heinous".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |title=IRB review signals intent to get tough on gouging |first=Andrew |last=Baldock |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2 July 2009 |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/rugby/IRB-review-signals-intent-to.5421507.jp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scales of the offence ===

Following two separate high-profile [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]] incidents, involving [[Schalk Burger]] and [[Sergio Parisse]], during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence "in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"/&gt;

The regulations provide a scale of seriousness.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; As of the most recent revision to the regulations in 2016, separate scales are provided for "contact with the ''eyes''" and "contact with the ''eye area''", where the "eyes" are defined as all tissues within and covering the orbital cavity, including eyelids, and "eye area" covers areas outside the orbital cavity but in close proximity to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-17/appendix-1 |title=Appendix 1: World Rugby Sanctions for Foul Play (Regulation 17) |work=World Rugby Handbook |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |date=22 April 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Contact with the eyes
* Lower end: up to 12-week ban.
* Mid range: up to 18-week ban.
* Top end: greater than 24-week ban.

;Contact with the eye area
* Lower end: up to 4-week ban.
* Mid range: up to 8-week ban.
* Top end: greater than 12-week ban.

The maximum sanction for either is a 156-week (3 year) ban.

In [[rugby sevens|sevens]], bans are officially expressed in numbers of matches instead of weeks, reflecting the schedule of the Sevens World Series for [[World Rugby Sevens Series|men]] and [[World Rugby Women's Sevens Series|women]], as well as other major events for sevens teams.

== History ==
In the early days of rugby, eye gouging was commonplace and happened mainly in the [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] due to a lack of control by [[referee (rugby)|referees]] and the opportunity the scrum offered for players to commit foul play due to the way the scrum is formed.&lt;ref name=process&gt;{{cite book | first = Eric | last = Dunning  | title = The Sports Process: A Comparative and Developmental Approach | publisher = Human Kinetics | location =  | year = 1996| isbn = 0880116242  | page = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising amount of foul play involving eye gouging eventually lead to the founding of the [[Rugby Football Union]] to control rugby and to reduce the amount of foul play.&lt;ref name=process /&gt; Eye-gouging then began to disappear from the early game as the laws of rugby became stricter due to English [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] students starting to play rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Iain | last = Macintosh  | title = Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Rugby But Were too Afraid to Ask | publisher = A&amp;C Black | location =  | year = 2012| isbn = 1408174367  | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After then foul play including eye-gouging became largely unspoken of and rugby authorities often ignored complaints of eye-gouging. This was due to authorities expecting players to deal with it themselves as it was claimed to be part of the nature of the game and was often viewed as a joke.&lt;ref name=thesis /&gt; In 1992, [[Richard Loe]] made contact with [[Greg Cooper (rugby union)|Greg Cooper]]'s eyes while playing in the [[National Provincial Championship]] and was banned for nine months after a nine-hour deliberation by the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]]'s judicial committee.&lt;ref name=Loe&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-union-loe-banned-for-gouging-1556429.html |title=Loe banned for gouging |publisher=The Independent |date=9 October 1992 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |location=London |first=Steve |last=Bale}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was viewed by observers as a turning point in attitudes towards eye-gouging and punishments for eye-gouging became stricter.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D |chapter=6.2 |title=A discourse analysis of institutionalised logic in the field of New Zealand rugby 1985 and 2005  |author= |last=Harris |first=David |year=2008 |publisher=Massey University |docket= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Daniell, a New Zealand [[Lock (rugby union)|lock]] who played for nearly a decade in France, eye gouging is fairly common and considered "a way of life" in French rugby, where it is known as "la fourchette".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Brendan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/france/4945001/Eye-gouging-just-a-way-of-life-in-French-rugby.html |title=Eye-gouging just a way of life in French rugby |publisher=Telegraph |date=5 March 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanctions for eye-gouging have been subject to debate by journalists and commentators, depending on interpretation by presiding disciplinary officers.&lt;ref name=baffling&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Bills |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/news-comment/peter-bills-varying-punishments-for-eyegouging-are-baffling-2269508.html |title=Varying punishments for eye-gouging are baffling |publisher=The Independent |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments in the Northern Hemisphere are seen by some journalists as being harsher than those for similar offenses seen in Southern Hemisphere countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/04/alan-quinlan-gouging-british-lions | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Rees | title=Alan Quinlan fights gouging citation with Lions tour on the line | date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South African national rugby union team|South African national]] coach, [[Peter de Villiers]] stated he did not believe that an eye-gouging incident for which Schalk Burger was yellow carded merited any punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8122733.stm | work=BBC News | first=Simon | last=Austin | title=Burger 'gouge' angers Fitzgerald | date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:RUeyegouge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clarence Harding after a severe eye gouge]]

As well as many cases involving professional rugby union, the case of Clarence Harding, an amateur player, has received considerable coverage due to the extreme damage caused to his eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1247241/Rugby-player-blinded-eye-eye-gouging-attack.html|title=Police investigate rugby match gouging incident which left player blind in one eye|accessdate=11 May 2010 | location=London | work=Daily Mail|date=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017|failed=y|reason=Per RfC, DAILY MAIL is unreliable and should be removed or replaced.}}&lt;ref name='Blind eyes must not be turned'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,16016_6136583,00.html|title=Blind eyes must not be turned|work=Planet Rugby|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8663226.stm|title=Player blinded in one eye after gouge speaks out |accessdate=11 May 2010 | work=BBC News | date=6 May 2010 |first=Alastair |last=Eykyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding was left without sight in his right eye and can no longer play rugby, and the injury has affected his livelihood and has since had the eye removed due to the pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13029096| title= Maidstone RFC 'tarnished' by RFU eye gouging ruling| work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=10 April 2011 | accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Iles, the player alleged to have injured Harding, was found not guilty by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] as they could not determine which player was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-11827032 | title= Disappointment as Kent rugby player cleared of gouging | work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=24 November 2010 | accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Maidstone RFC]] were fined [[Pound sterling|£]]2,000 and deducted 50 points after being found "guilty of conduct prejudicial to the interests of the game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-12179402 | title= Maidstone RFC fined over eye gouging | work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=13 January 2011 | accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was also investigated by [[Kent Police]] but no criminal charges were brought against Maidstone or Iles due to insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-12001599 | work=BBC News | title=Kent club Maidstone RFC charged over eye gouging | date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2010, [[Gavin Quinnell]] suffered an eye injury during a game between [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] and [[Cross Keys RFC|Cross Keys]], from which he lost the sight in his left eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/9056033.stm | title=Gavin Quinnell loses sight in his left eye  | work=BBC.co.uk | author= | date=7 October 2010 | accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was under investigation by the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] and [[Gwent Police]], with the police arresting the perpetrator. However, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] advised against prosecution, leading to the dropping of criminal charges, and the WRU eventually dropped its citing complaint, to the self-described shock of the Quinnell family, one of the most prominent in Welsh rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/welsh/12964924.stm |title=Quinnell family's shock over sight loss ruling |work=BBC Sport |date=4 April 2011 |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final|Rugby World Cup Final]] on 23 October 2011 led the IRB to reevaluate its disciplinary procedures. [[France national rugby union team|France]] centre [[Aurélien Rougerie]] apparently made contact with the eyes of [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] captain [[Richie McCaw]], who would later state that he had been "half-blinded" for the last few minutes of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/newzealand/rugby/story/155634.html |title=McCaw breaks eye-gouge silence |work=ESPN Scrum |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original camera angles provided by host broadcaster Sky NZ showed no apparent foul play, and Rougerie was not cited within the 36-hour window allowed by IRB rules at the time. Three days after the match, new Sky NZ footage emerged which showed Rougerie apparently raking his hand across McCaw's eyes. The IRB could not cite Rougerie outside the 36-hour window, and the exception allowed in its rules for "exceptional circumstances" did not include the emergence of new evidence. In December 2011 the IRB announced that it would reconsider its procedures to address similar situations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france/rugby/story/153864.html |title=IRB ponder disciplinary overhaul |work=ESPN Scrum |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High-profile cases ===

'''Forced heirship''' is a form of [[testate]] [[partible inheritance]] whereby the [[estate (law)|estate]] of a deceased (''de cujus'') is separated into (1) an indefeasible portion, the ''forced estate'' ([[German_language|Germ]] ''Pflichtteil'', [[French_language|Fr]] ''réserve'', [[Italian_language|It]], ''legittima'', [[Spanish_language|Sp]] ''legítima''), passing to the deceased's [[next-of-kin]]&lt;ref&gt;Persons closely related to the deceased, namely parents, spouse, or children. See C.G. Van der Merwe, Jacques Du Plessis, eds., ''Introduction to the Law of South Africa'' (The Hague, Netherlands: Kluwer Law International, 2004), 172.&lt;/ref&gt; (''conjunctissimi''), and (2) a discretionary portion, or ''free estate'' (Germ ''frei verfügbare Quote'', Fr ''quotité disponible'', It ''quota disponible'', Sp ''tercio de libre disposición''), to be freely disposed of by [[Will (law)|will]]. Forced heirship is generally a feature of [[civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] legal systems which do not recognize total freedom of testation. Normally, the deceased's estate is in-gathered and wound up without discharging [[Legal_liability|liabilities]], which means accepting inheritance includes accepting the liabilities attached to inherited property. The forced estate is divided into shares which include the share of issue ([[legitime]] or child's share) and the spousal share. This provides a minimum protection that cannot be defeated by will. The free estate, on the other hand, is at the discretion of a [[testator]] to be distributed by will on death to whomever he or she chooses.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=2D9ff7T028oC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=forced+heirship&amp;source=web&amp;ots=0yfaccEvOs&amp;sig=1Z-9RdQ2UGLvLhOgGxjB98p2eCU#PPA53,M1&lt;/ref&gt; Takers in the forced estate are known as ''forced heirs'' (Germ ''Pflichtteilserben'', ''Noterben'', Fr ''réservataires'', It ''legittimari'', Sp ''herederos forzosos'').

The expression comes from [[Louisiana]]n legal language and is ultimately a calque of [[Spanish_language|Spanish]] ''sucesión forzosa''.

==Overview==

Forced heirship laws are most prevalent among [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and in [[Islamic]] countries; these include major countries such as [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Japan]]. Reckoning shares in instances of multiple or no children and lack of surviving spouse vary from country to country.

Advocates of forced heirship contend that it is perfectly proper for testators to be required to make adequate provision for their dependants, and that most countries in the world permit wills to be varied where they would leave dependants destitute.  Critics suggest that there is a great difference between varying wills to the minimum degree to provide sufficient financial support for dependants, and prohibiting the testator from distributing the estate or a proportion of the estate to any female children, or younger male children, and that it cannot be any less repugnant to force a deceased person to distribute their assets in a certain manner on their death than it would be to tell them how they may do so during their lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==History==
The institution began as a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[custom (law)|custom]] for [[intestacy|intestate]] inheritance (which was the norm) under which all of a deceased's [[personal property|personalty]] was divided into thirds—the widow's part, bairns' part, and dead's part&lt;ref&gt;Scots law terms. Also known as the customary share, orphanage share, and dead man's share in the custom of London, or alternatively as the customary share, portion natural, and legatory share in the custom of York.&lt;/ref&gt;—the last of which, consisting of clothes, weapons, farm animals and implements, was usually buried with the deceased. With the adoption of Christian funerary practices, it became common to gift away the dead's part, and after the revival of the will, and consequently of testation, the dead's part came to be freely disposable.

[[Real property|Realty]], or heritable property, on the other hand, was originally inherited in [[Concurrent_estate#Joint_tenancy|joint tenancy]], termed [[gavelkind]], and passed on to the kin group as a whole. However, after the household superseded the kin group in importance in the late [[Middle Ages]], preference was given to the deceased's immediate family, specifically any surviving sons, and none could be favored over his siblings. However, gavelkind inheritance gave rise to inter-family rivalries, so [[primogeniture]] laws arose in some areas of feudal Europe giving preference to the eldest son in order to stem feuding. Nevertheless, under medieval communal society, family land could not be sold except for cause, and the family essentially had a right of first refusal (''laudatio parentum'') in any such sale; in some places, this restriction also applied to gifts. 

The family was so favored that in order to keep property within the same family, women—who on marriage in effect joined another family—were accorded very few property rights.&lt;ref&gt;T Hanson &amp; B Corbett, "Forced Heirship - Trusts and Other Problems", (2009) 13, ''JGLRev'', 174, cited in Meryl Thomas, ''Jersey Law Course 2010-11: Testate and Intestate Succession'' (St Helier, Jersey: Institute of Law, 2010), 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[widow]]s were universally disinherited, though they were varyingly entitled to a [[dower]] and/or a terce (or curtesy in the case of widowers), that is, one third of the heritable marital estate. The terce was earliest known as ''tertia collaborationis'' and first appears in the [[Lex Ripuaria|Ripuarian law code]], making it also a localized Germanic custom. In the customs of York and London, for example, a widow was entitled both to her widow's part (''customary share'') and terce (''widow's chamber''), the last of which was half—not a third—of the marital estate.

Eventually, these elements were all consolidated into the modern form of forced heirship most notably in Revolutionary France, which treated personalty and realty in the same way and applied gavelkind inheritance and the system of thirds to both forms of property. After abandoning dowries and dowers in the 20th century, many European countries created or increased the spousal share to be on par with the share of issue ([[legitime]]); Spain is an exception.

==Louisiana==
In [[Louisiana]], Civil Code article 1493 dictates that "Forced heirs are descendants of the first degree who, at the time of the death of the decedent, are twenty-three years of age or younger or descendants of the first degree of any age who, because of mental incapacity or physical infirmity, are permanently incapable of taking care of their persons or administering their estates at the time of the death of the decedent".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=108811&lt;/ref&gt; If they are not disinherited (LCC art. 1494) they qualify as forced heirs. The disinherison must be made expressly and for one of eight just causes; otherwise, it is null (LCC art. 1621). The legitime is equal to 25% of the [[estate (law)|patrimony]] (if one forced heir); or 50% (if more than one); and each forced heir will receive the lesser of an equal proportion of the legitime or what they would have received through [[intestacy]] (LCC art. 1495, Succession of Greenlaw).  If a person who would have otherwise qualified as a forced heir dies before the parent, rights to that share may pass to that person's children, although how that share is distributed among them if one or more is an interdict remains unsettled law.  Forced heirs may demand collation, whereby certain gifts received by any successor in the three years before the death of the parent may be subtracted from their share.  Louisiana does not have a forced heirship provision for spouses, however at death the spouse's interest in any [[community property]] is converted to his or her separate property; and a [[usufruct]] is granted over the remaining community (with the forced heirs as naked owners of their respective shares).  That usufruct terminates at death or remarriage.

Wealthy individuals in the U.S. sometimes seek to circumvent forced heirship laws by transferring assets into an [[offshore company]] and seeking to settle the [[share (finance)|shares]] in the offshore company in a [[trust law|trust]] governed by the laws of a jurisdiction outside their [[domicile (law)|domicile]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25276">In [[artificial intelligence]], the '''frame problem''' describes an issue with using [[first-order logic]] (FOL) to express facts about a robot in the world. Representing the state of a robot with traditional FOL requires the use of many axioms that simply imply that things in the environment do not change arbitrarily. For example, Hayes describes a "[[block world]]" with rules about stacking blocks together. In a FOL system, additional [[axiom]]s are required to make inferences about the environment (for example, that a block cannot change position unless it is physically moved). The frame problem is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Patrick|title=The Frame Problem and Related Problems in Artificial Intelligence|journal=University of Edinburgh|url=http://aitopics.org/sites/default/files/classic/Webber-Nilsson-Readings/Rdgs-NW-Hayes-FrameProblem.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] and [[Patrick J. Hayes]] defined this problem in their 1969 article, ''Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence''.  In this paper, and many that came after, the formal mathematical problem was a starting point for more general discussions of the difficulty of knowledge representation for artificial intelligence. Issues such as how to provide rational default assumptions and what humans consider common sense in a virtual environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=J|author2=P.J. Hayes|title=Some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence|journal=Machine Intelligence|year=1969|volume=4|pages=463–502|citeseerx=10.1.1.85.5082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the term acquired a broader meaning in [[philosophy]], where it is formulated as the problem of limiting the beliefs that have to be updated in response to actions. In the logical context, actions are typically specified by what they change, with the implicit assumption that everything else (the frame) remains unchanged.

==Description==
The frame problem occurs even in very simple domains. A scenario with a door, which can be open or closed, and a light, which can be on or off, is statically represented by two [[proposition]]s &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{on}&lt;/math&gt;. If these conditions can change, they are better represented by two [[Predicate (computer programming)|predicate]]s &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{on}(t)&lt;/math&gt; that depend on time; such predicates are called [[fluent (artificial intelligence)|fluent]]s. A domain in which the door is closed and the light off at time 0, and the door opened at time 1, can be directly represented in logic{{clarify|reason=What kind of logic? If ordinary predicate logic is meant, what is the purpose of the 'true →' in the 3rd formula? If some other logic (situation calculus?) is meant, it should be stated explicitly here, together with the purpose of the 'true →' (e.g. some empty action?) in that logic.|date=August 2013}} by the following formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

The first two formulae represent the initial situation; the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1. If such an action had preconditions, such as the door being unlocked, it would have been represented by &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{locked}(0) \rightarrow \textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, one would have a predicate &lt;math&gt;\textit{executeopen}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for specifying when an action is executed and a rule &lt;math&gt;\forall t . \textit{executeopen}(t) \wedge \textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{open}(t+1)&lt;/math&gt; for specifying the effects of actions.  The article on the [[situation calculus]] gives more details.

While the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what is known, they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences. While the following conditions (representing the expected situation) are consistent with the three formulae above, they are not the only ones.

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  || &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;   || &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Indeed, another set of conditions that is consistent with the three formulae above is:

:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  || &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;   || &lt;math&gt;\textit{on}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The frame problem is that specifying only which conditions are changed by the actions does not entail that all other conditions are not changed. This problem can be solved by adding the so-called “frame axioms”, which explicitly specify that all conditions not affected by actions are not changed while executing that action. For example, since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door, a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\textit{on}(0) \leftrightarrow \textit{on}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

The frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition.{{clarify|reason=Shouldn't then the frame axiom be the following modification of the above rule: '∀t.executeopen(t)→open(t+1)∧(on(t+1)↔on(t))' ? In contrast, the formula 'on(0)↔on(1)' seems to be too particular taylored to the 'executeopen(0)' situation.|date=August 2013}} In other words, the problem is that of formalizing a dynamical domain without explicitly specifying the frame axioms.

The solution proposed by McCarthy to solve this problem involves assuming that a minimal amount of condition changes have occurred; this solution is formalized using the framework of [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]. The [[Yale shooting problem]], however, shows that this solution is not always correct. Alternative solutions were then proposed, involving predicate completion, fluent occlusion, [[successor state axiom]]s, etc.; they are explained below. By the end of the 1980s, the frame problem as defined by McCarthy and Hayes was solved{{clarify|reason=Mention the (combination of) approach(es) by which the frame problem was solved.|date=August 2013}}. Even after that, however, the term “frame problem” was still used, in part to refer to the same problem but under different settings (e.g., concurrent actions), and in part to refer to the general problem of representing and reasoning with dynamical domains.

== Solutions ==
The following solutions depict how the frame problem is solved in various formalisms. The formalisms themselves are not presented in full: what is presented are simplified versions that are sufficient to explain the full solution.

===Fluent occlusion solution===
This solution was proposed by [[Erik Sandewall]], who also defined a [[formal language]] for the specification of dynamical domains; therefore, such a domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically translated into logic. In this article, only the expression in logic is shown, and only in the simplified language with no action names.

The rationale of this solution is to represent not only the value of conditions over time, but also whether they can be affected by the last executed action. The latter is represented by another condition, called occlusion. A condition is said to be ''occluded'' in a given time point if an action has been just executed that makes the condition true or false as an effect. Occlusion can be viewed as “permission to change”: if a condition is occluded, it is relieved from obeying the constraint of inertia.

In the simplified example of the door and the light, occlusion can be formalized by two predicates &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeopen}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeon}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The rationale is that a condition can change value only if the corresponding occlusion predicate is true at the next time point. In turn, the occlusion predicate is true only when an action affecting the condition is executed.

:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{open}(1) \wedge \textit{occludeopen}(1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t . \neg \textit{occludeopen}(t) \rightarrow (\textit{open}(t-1) \leftrightarrow \textit{open}(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t . \neg \textit{occludeon}(t) \rightarrow (\textit{on}(t-1) \leftrightarrow \textit{on}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

In general, every action making a condition true or false also makes the corresponding occlusion predicate true. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeopen}(1)&lt;/math&gt; is true, making the antecedent of the fourth formula above false for &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;; therefore, the constraint that &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}(t-1) \leftrightarrow \textit{open}(t)&lt;/math&gt; does not hold for &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; can change value, which is also what is enforced by the third formula.

In order for this condition to work, occlusion predicates have to be true only when they are made true as an effect of an action. This can be achieved either by [[Circumscription (logic)|circumscription]] or by predicate completion. It is worth noticing that occlusion does not necessarily imply a change: for example, executing the action of opening the door when it was already open (in the formalization above) makes the predicate &lt;math&gt;\textit{occludeopen}&lt;/math&gt; true and makes &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; true; however, &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; has not changed value, as it was true already.

===Predicate completion solution===
This encoding is similar to the fluent occlusion solution, but the additional predicates denote change, not permission to change. For example, &lt;math&gt;\textit{changeopen}(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the fact that the predicate &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; will change from time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, a predicate changes if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true. An action results in a change if and only if it makes true a condition that was previously false or vice versa.

:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0) \wedge \textit{true} \rightarrow \textit{changeopen}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t. \textit{changeopen}(t) \leftrightarrow (\neg \textit{open}(t) \leftrightarrow \textit{open}(t+1))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall t. \textit{changeon}(t) \leftrightarrow (\neg \textit{on}(t) \leftrightarrow \textit{on}(t+1))&lt;/math&gt;

The third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened. Precisely, it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed. The last two conditions state that a condition changes value at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. To complete the solution, the time points in which the change predicates are true have to be as few as possible, and this can be done by applying predicate completion to the rules specifying the effects of actions.

===Successor state axioms solution===
The value of a condition after the execution of an action can be determined by
the fact that the condition is true if and only if:

# the action makes the condition true; or
# the condition was previously true and the action does not make it false.

A [[successor state axiom]] is a formalization in logic of these two facts. For
example, if &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{closedoor}(t)&lt;/math&gt; are two
conditions used to denote that the action executed at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; was
to open or close the door, respectively, the running example is encoded as
follows.

: &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{open}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{on}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\forall t . \textit{open}(t+1) \leftrightarrow \textit{opendoor}(t) \vee (\textit{open}(t) \wedge \neg \textit{closedoor}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

This solution is centered around the value of conditions, rather than the
effects of actions. In other words, there is an axiom for every condition,
rather than a formula for every action. Preconditions to actions (which are not
present in this example) are formalized by other formulae. The successor state
axioms are used in the variant to the [[situation calculus]] proposed by
[[Ray Reiter]].

===Fluent calculus solution===
The [[fluent calculus]] is a variant of the situation calculus. It solves the frame problem by using first-order logic
[[First-order logic#Formation rules|terms]], rather than predicates, to represent the states. Converting
predicates into terms in first-order logic is called [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]]; the
fluent calculus can be seen as a logic in which predicates representing the
state of conditions are reified.

The difference between a predicate and a term in first-order logic is that a term is a representation of an object (possibly a complex object composed of other objects), while a predicate represents a condition that can be true or false when evaluated over a given set of terms.

In the fluent calculus, each possible state is represented by a term obtained by composition of other terms, each one representing the conditions that are true in state. For example, the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term &lt;math&gt;\textit{open} \circ \textit{on}&lt;/math&gt;. It is important to notice that a term is not true or false by itself, as it is an object and not a condition. In other words, the term &lt;math&gt;\textit{open} \circ \textit{on}&lt;/math&gt; represent a possible state, and does not by itself mean that this is the current state. A separate condition can be stated to specify that this is actually the state at a given time, e.g., &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(\textit{open} \circ \textit{on}, 10)&lt;/math&gt; means that this is the state at time &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution to the frame problem given in the fluent calculus is to specify the effects of actions by stating how a term representing the state changes when the action is executed. For example, the action of opening the door at time 0 is represented by the formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(s \circ \textit{open}, 1) \leftrightarrow \textit{state}(s,0)&lt;/math&gt;

The action of closing the door, which makes a condition false instead of true, is represented in a slightly different way:

: &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(s, 1) \leftrightarrow \textit{state}(s \circ \textit{open}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;

This formula works provided that suitable axioms are given about &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;, e.g., a term containing the same condition twice is not a valid state (for example, &lt;math&gt;\textit{state}(\textit{open} \circ s \circ \textit{open}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is always false for every &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

===Event calculus solution===
The [[event calculus]] uses terms for representing fluents, like the fluent calculus, but also has axioms constraining the value of fluents, like the successor state axioms. In the event calculus, inertia is enforced by formulae stating that a fluent is true if it has been true at a given previous time point and no action changing it to false has been performed in the meantime. Predicate completion is still needed in the event calculus for obtaining that a fluent is made true only if an action making it true has been performed, but also for obtaining that an action had been performed only if that is explicitly stated.

===Default logic solution===
The frame problem can be thought of as the problem of formalizing the principle that, by default, "everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is" ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], "An Introduction to a Secret Encyclopædia", ''c''. 1679).  This default, sometimes called the ''commonsense law of inertia'', was expressed by [[Raymond Reiter]] in [[default logic]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{R(x,s)\; :\ R(x,\textit{do}(a,s))}{R(x,\textit{do}(a,s))}&lt;/math&gt;

(if &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true in situation &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, and it can be assumed&lt;ref&gt;i.e., no contradicting information is known&lt;/ref&gt; that &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; remains true after executing action &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;R(x)&lt;/math&gt; remains true).

Steve Hanks and [[Drew McDermott]] argued, on the basis of their [[Yale shooting problem|Yale shooting]] example, that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory.  Hudson Turner showed, however, that it works correctly in the presence of appropriate additional postulates.

===Answer set programming solution===
The counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of [[answer set programming]] is a rule with [[stable model semantics#Strong negation|strong negation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;r(X,T+1) \leftarrow r(X,T),\ \hbox{not }\sim r(X,T+1)&lt;/math&gt;

(if &lt;math&gt;r(X)&lt;/math&gt; is true at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and it can be assumed that &lt;math&gt;r(X)&lt;/math&gt; remains true at time &lt;math&gt;T+1&lt;/math&gt;, then we can conclude that &lt;math&gt;r(X)&lt;/math&gt; remains true).

===Action description languages===
[[Action description language]]s elude the frame problem rather than solving it. An action description language is a formal language with a syntax that is specific for describing situations and actions. For example, that the action &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}&lt;/math&gt; makes the door open if not locked is expressed by:

: &lt;math&gt;\textit{opendoor}&lt;/math&gt; causes &lt;math&gt;\textit{open}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\neg \textit{locked}&lt;/math&gt;

The semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express (concurrent actions, delayed effects, etc.) and is usually based on [[transition system]]s.

Since domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic, the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic. Typically, however, a translation is given from these languages to [[answer set programming]] rather than first-order logic.

'''George Leslie Allen'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=23 March 1971|page=43|title=Classified advertisements}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 13 May 1948, died 21 March 1971) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[Sunshine Football Club (VFA)|Sunshine]] in the [[Victorian Football Association]]. He was a prolific goalkicker during his brief career, but he died suddenly during a preseason game at the age of 22.

Allen played his entire career with the [[Sunshine Football Club (VFA)|Sunshine Football Club]] in the VFA. After playing some Under-16s football with the club from as early as 1961, he became a permanent member of the club's Thirds (Under-19s) team in 1966, where he kicked 98 goals to be the VFA Thirds Division 2 leading goalkicker. The following year, aged 18, he played for the Seconds, and was again the VFA's Division 2 leading goalkicker.&lt;ref name="vale"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sunshine–St. Albans Advocate|page=38|date=24 March 1971|title=Vale George Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played his first two senior games for Sunshine in 1967, and another eight games in 1968, before becoming a permanent member of the senior team in 1969. He immediately established himself as one of the Association's best full forwards, and he was the VFA's Division 2 leading goalkicker in each of 1969 and 1970, kicking 99 and 80 goals respectively – to give him a total of four leading goalkicker awards, across different grades, in just five seasons. In his senior career, he played 49 games and kicked 214 goals.&lt;ref name="vale" /&gt;

On Sunday 21 March, late in the first quarter of a pre-season practice match between Sunshine and [[Benalla Football Club|Benalla]] in Benalla, Allen suddenly collapsed and died on the field. He had crashed heavily to the ground on his side in a marking contest a few minutes earlier, but had returned to full forward and shown no ill-effects from the contest until his collapse. He was 22 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sunshine–St. Albans Advocate|page=38|date=24 March 1971|title=Trip ended in tragedy|author=Jack Chigwidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r9xUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ppADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2265%2C4681282 &lt;i&gt;The Age&lt;/i&gt;, 22 March 1971 "Sunshine forward dies at practice"&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside football, Allen worked in the [[Newport Workshops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|page=3|author=Scot Palmer|date=22 March 1971|title=Full forward dies on field}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt trips are also considered to be a form of [[passive aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Samsel M [http://www.michaelsamsel.com/Content/Difficult_Styles/passive_aggressive.html Passive Aggressive Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The victim may be reminded of something bad they did, made to feel guilty about it and then given an option to escape that guilt. The option will depend on what the manipulator wants them to do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eruptingmind.com/the-psychology-of-guilt-overcoming-types-of-guilt/ Understanding the psychology of guilt] ''EruptingMind''&lt;/ref&gt; People often feel obliged to comply with guilt trip demands as a way of receiving others' approval.&lt;ref&gt;Brighton J [http://www.newlovetimes.com/why-guilt-tripping-can-turn-your-relationship-toxic/ Guilt Trips And Relationships: A Toxic Combination] 25 Apr 2016 ''New Love Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George K. Simon]] interprets the guilt trip as a special kind of [[intimidation]] tactic. A manipulator suggests to the [[conscientious]] victim that he or she does not care enough, is too selfish or has it easy. This usually results in the victim feeling bad, keeping them in a [[doubt|self-doubting]], [[anxious]] and [[submissive]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646166340|title=In sheep's clothing : understanding and dealing with manipulative people|last=K.|first=Simon, George|date=|publisher=Parkhurst Brothers|year=1996|isbn=9781935166306|location=|pages=|oclc=646166340|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known published use of the term is in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=guilt+trip&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cguilt%20trip%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bguilt%20trip%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BGuilt%20Trip%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BGUILT%20TRIP%3B%2Cc0 Guilt trip ngram]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are limited studies examining guilt trips and those studies tend to focus on guilt trips 
in parent-child relationships.&lt;ref name=Humeny&gt;Humeny C (2013)

'''HMS''' '''''Black Prince''''' was a {{sclass-|Duke of Edinburgh|cruiser|0}} [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1900s. She was stationed in the [[Mediterranean]] when the [[World War I|First World War]] began and participated in the [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit]] of the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}}. After the German ships reached [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] waters, the ship was sent to the [[Red Sea]] in mid-August to protect troop convoys arriving from India and to search for German merchant ships. After capturing two ships, ''Black Prince'' was transferred to the [[Grand Fleet]] in December 1914 and was sunk during the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 1 June 1916, with the loss of all hands.

==Design and description==
Two [[armoured cruiser]]s of a new design, ''Duke of Edinburgh'' and ''Black Prince'', the latter named for [[Edward, the Black Prince]], were ordered for the [[Royal Navy]] as part of the 1902–03 Naval Estimates. They were the first ships to be designed for the Royal Navy under the supervision of the new [[Director of Naval Construction]], Sir [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Philip Watts]]. The new design was significantly larger than the previous {{sclass-|Monmouth|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Devonshire|cruiser (1903)|5}}-class cruisers, mounting a heavier main armament of six {{convert|9.2|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} guns in single turrets.&lt;ref name="conways I p71"&gt;Chesneau and Kolesnik 1979, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown p161"&gt;Brown 2003, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Black Prince'' displaced {{convert|12590|LT|t}} as built and {{convert|13965|LT|t}} fully loaded. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|505|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|73|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|27|ft|m|1}}. She was powered by four-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, driving two shafts, which produced a total of {{convert|23000|ihp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by 20 [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s and six cylindrical boilers. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|2150|LT|t}} of coal and an additional {{convert|600|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for {{convert|8130|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship's complement was 789 officers and enlisted men.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;Parkes 1990, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her main armament consisted of six [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|BL 9.2-inch Mk X guns]] in single [[turret]]s, two on the centreline and two on each beam, giving a broadside of four 9.2 in guns. Her secondary armament of ten [[BL 6 inch Mk XI naval gun|BL 6-inch Mark XI guns]] was arranged in single casemates. They were mounted amidships on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. Twenty Vickers QF [[Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers|3-pounders]] were fitted, six on turret roofs and fourteen in the superstructure. The ship also mounted three submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes 1990, pp. 442–443.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
''Black Prince'' was [[Keel#Structural keels|laid down]] on 3 June 1903 at the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]]'s shipyard at [[Blackwall, London]]. She was launched on 8 November 1904 and completed on 17 March 1906.&lt;ref name="conways I p71"/&gt; When completed, ''Black Prince'' served with the 2nd Squadron until 1907, the 1st Cruiser Squadron from 1907–1908, the 5th Cruiser Squadron (as part of the Atlantic Fleet) from 1908–1912 and the Third from 1912–1913.&lt;ref name="conways 2 p13"&gt;Gardiner and Gray 1985, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], ''Black Prince'' was one of the four armoured cruisers serving in the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] of the Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest Troubridge|Ernest Charles Thomas Troubridge]]. She participated in the pursuit of ''Goeben'' and ''Breslau''. Following the escape of the two German ships to neutral [[Turkey]], ''Black Prince''  and ''Duke of Edinburgh'' were sent into the [[Red Sea]] to search for German merchant ships, with ''Black Prince'' capturing the German [[ocean liner]]s ''Südmark'' and ''Istria''.&lt;ref name="conways 2 p13"/&gt; On 6 November, she was ordered to [[Gibraltar]] to join a squadron of French and British ships to search for German warships still at sea off the African coast. This was cancelled on 19 November after the location of the German [[East Asia Squadron]] was revealed by survivors of the [[Battle of Coronel]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett 1938, I, p. 371, 406–407.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Black Prince'' joined the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and was assigned to the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] under [[Rear-Admiral]] Sir [[Robert Keith Arbuthnot]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett 1929, II, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Black Prince'' was modified in March 1916 as a result of lessons learned at the [[Battle of Coronel]], with the 6-inch guns removed from their casemates and replaced by six 6-inch guns mounted individually behind shields between the beam 9.2-inch turrets.&lt;ref name="conways 2 p13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown p161-2"&gt;Brown 2003, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss===
The ship participated in the [[Battle of Jutland]], where she was sunk with heavy loss of life. The circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after. As the British had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed, they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking ''Black Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;Jellicoe 1919, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, the 1st Cruiser Squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet,&lt;ref name="Campbell p36"&gt;Campbell 1998, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Black Prince'' lost contact with the rest of the Squadron as it came into contact with German forces, at about 17:42.&lt;ref name="Campbell p122"&gt;Campbell 1998, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, two other members of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, {{HMS|Defence|1907|2}} and {{HMS|Warrior|1905|2}}, were heavily engaged by German battleships and battlecruisers, with ''Defence'' blowing up and ''Warrior'' receiving heavy damage, which later caused her to sink.&lt;ref name="Campbell p152-3"&gt;Campbell 1998, pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no positive sightings of ''Black Prince'' by the British fleet after that, although a wireless signal from her was received at 20:45, reporting a submarine sighting.&lt;ref name="Campbell p122"/&gt; During the night of 31 May–1 June, the British [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Spitfire|1912|2}}, badly damaged after colliding with the German battleship {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, sighted what appeared to be a German battlecruiser, with two widely spaced funnels, described as being "...a mass of fire from foremast to mainmast, on deck and between decks. Flames were issuing out of her from every corner."  The mystery ship exploded at about midnight.  It was later thought that the burning ship may have been ''Black Prince'', with the two midships funnels having collapsed or been shot away.&lt;ref name="Fawcett p180-1"&gt;Fawcett and Hooper 1921, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent historians, however, hold to the German account of the ship's sinking. ''Black Prince'' briefly engaged the German battleship {{SMS|Rheinland||2}} at about 23:35 [[GMT]], scoring two hits with 6-inch shells.&lt;ref name="Campbell p286-7"&gt;Campbell 1998, pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; Separated from the rest of the British fleet, ''Black Prince'' approached the German lines shortly after midnight. She turned away from the German battleships, but it was too late. The German battleship {{SMS|Thüringen||2}} fixed ''Black Prince'' in her searchlights and opened fire. Up to five other German ships, including the battleships {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, {{SMS|Ostfriesland||2}}, and {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}, joined in the bombardment, with return fire from ''Black Prince'' being ineffective. Most of the German ships were between {{convert|750|and|1500|yard}} of ''Black Prince''&lt;ref name="Campbell p290"&gt;Campbell 1998, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; — effectively [[point-blank range]] for contemporary naval gunnery. The ship was hit by at least twelve heavy shells and several smaller ones,&lt;ref name="Campbell p303"&gt;Campbell 1998, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; sinking within 15 minutes. There were no survivors from her crew, all 857 being killed.&lt;ref name="Campbell p338"&gt;Campbell 1998, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wrecksite is designated as a ''protected place'' under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/uksi_20080950_en_1 SI 2008/950] Designation under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Stephen Baker''' (26 December 1904 – 7 November 1926) was an [[Australia]]n-born [[New Zealand]] [[cricket]]er who played for [[Otago cricket team|Otago]]. He was born in [[Melbourne]] and died in [[Dunedin]].

Baker made a single first-class appearance for the side, during the 1925-26 season, against [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury]]. From the lower-middle order, Baker scored 2 runs in the first innings in which he batted, and a duck in the second, as Otago lost the match by an innings margin.

He lived in the Dunedin suburb of [[Kensington, New Zealand|Kensington]], and worked as a factory hand. He died at the age of 21, less than 12 months after his only first-class appearance. He drowned while swimming off [[Ocean Grove, New Zealand|Tomahawk]] beach in [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bathing Fatality|journal=Otago Daily Times|date=8 November 1926|issue=19941|page=10|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ODT19261108.2.65|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalanchoe''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|l|ə|ŋ|ˈ|k|oʊ|.|iː}},&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book'', 1995:606–607; {{OED|Kalanchoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; or kal-un-KOH-ee,&lt;ref&gt;http://gardening.about.com/od/houseplants/tp/FloweringHouseplants.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or kal-un-kee, also written ''Kalanchöe'' or ''Kalanchoë'', is a genus of about 125 species of [[tropical]], succulent [[flowering plant]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Crassulaceae]], mainly [[native plant|native]] to [[Madagascar]] and tropical [[Africa]].  Kalanchoe was one of the first [[plants in space|plants to be sent into space]], sent on a resupply to the Soviet [[Salyut 1]] space station in 1971.

==Description==
Most are [[shrub]]s or [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous]] plants, but a few are [[annual plant|annual]] or [[biennial plant|biennial]]. The largest, ''[[Kalanchoe beharensis]]'' from Madagascar, can reach {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall, but most species are less than {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall.

Kalanchoes are characterized by opening their flowers by growing new cells on the inner surface of the [[petal]]s to force them outwards, and on the outside of the petals to close them. Kalanchoe flowers are divided into 4 sections with 8 stamens. The petals are fused into a tube, in a similar way to some related genera such as ''[[Cotyledon (genus)|Cotyledon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crassulaceae.ch/de/artikel?akID=68&amp;aaID=1&amp;aiID=C&amp;aID=2211 Crassulaceae Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and taxonomy==
The genus was first described by the botanist [[Michel Adanson]] in 1763.&lt;ref name=AJB&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kalanchoe: The Genus and its Chromosomes| doi=10.2307/2436516|first=J. T.| last=Baldwin Jr.| journal=American Journal of Botany| pages=572–579| volume=25| issue=8| date=October 1938|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| jstor=2436516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adanson cited [[Georg Joseph Kamel|Camellus]] as his source for the name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/3611216#page/1076/mode/1up Adanson, M. Familles des Plantes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camel, J.G. Herbarium aliarumque stirpium in Insulâ Luzone Philippinarum Primariâ nascentium. In: John Ray: Historia plantarum. Band 3, London 1704, Anhang, S. 1–42 p. 6. item 18. [http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/ing/Libro.php?Libro=3675&amp;Pagina=817]&lt;/ref&gt; the name came from the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name "Kalanchauhuy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chernetskyy | first1 = M. A. | year = 2011 | title = Problems in nomenclature and systematics in the subfamily Kalanchoideae (Crassulaceae) over the years | url = | journal = Acta Agrobotanica | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 67–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamel's species was most likely ''[[Kalanchoe ceratophylla]]'' as he describes the plant as having deeply divided leaves.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} ''Kalanchoe ceratophylla'' is called 伽蓝菜 (apparently 'Buddhist temple herb') in China, not very close in pronunciation: ''qiélán cài'' or ''jia lan cai''&lt;ref name="eFloras"&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=3&amp;taxon_id=116917 Kalanchoe, Chinese Plant Names], www.eFloras.org.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the romanisation (but the Cantonese 'gaa laam choi' may be closer).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The genus '''''Bryophyllum''''' was described by [[Richard Anthony Salisbury|Salisbury]] in 1806 and the genus '''''Kitchingia''''' was created by [[John Gilbert Baker|Baker]] in 1881. ''Kitchingia'' is now regarded as a synonym for ''Kalanchoe'', whereas some botanists treat ''Bryophyllum'' as a separate genus.&lt;ref name=AJB/&gt;

==Distribution and ecology== 
The genus is predominantly native to the Old World. 
Only one species of this genus originates from the [[Americas]], 56 from southern and eastern [[Africa]] and 60 species in [[Madagascar]]. It is also found in south-eastern [[Asia]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_6/colloques2/010008454.pdf ird.fr: Allorge-Boiteau, L., 1996. Madagascar Centre de Spéciation et d'Origine du Genre ''Kalanchoe'' (Crassulaceae).  Biogéographie de Madagascar, 1996 : 137-145]&lt;/ref&gt;

These plants are the food plant of the caterpillars of [[Red Pierrot]] butterfly. The butterfly lays its eggs on phylloclades, and after hatching, caterpillars burrow into phylloclades and eat their inside cells.

==Cultivation and uses==
[[Image:Kalanchoe veg.jpg|thumb|right|196px|Production of new individuals along a leaf margin of the air plant, ''[[Kalanchoe pinnata]]''. The small plant in front is about 1 cm tall]]
These plants are cultivated as ornamental [[houseplants]] and rock or [[Cactus garden|succulent garden]] plants. This plant is known to the Chinese as "10,000 purple 1,000 red" (萬紫千紅, wànzǐqiānhóng), and is commonly purchased during the Lunar Calendar New Year for decorative purposes.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} They are popular because of their ease of propagation, low water requirements, and wide variety of flower colors typically borne in clusters well above the phylloclades. The [[section (botany)|section]] ''[[Kalanchoe sect. Bryophyllum|Bryophyllum]]''—formerly an independent genus—contains species such as the "air-plant" ''[[Kalanchoe pinnata]]''. In these plants, new individuals develop [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] as plantlets, also known as bulbils or gemmae, at indentations in phylloclade margins. These young plants eventually drop off and take root. No males have been found of one species of this genus which does flower and produce seeds, and it is commonly called the mother of thousands: ''[[Kalanchoe daigremontiana]]'' is thus an example of [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Reproductive Strategies: Plants.

In common with other Crassulaceae (such as the genera ''[[Tylecodon]]'', ''[[Cotyledon (genus)|Cotyledon]]'' and ''[[Adromischus]]''), some ''Kalanchoe'' species contain [[bufadienolide]] [[cardiac glycosides]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In traditional medicine, ''Kalanchoe'' species have been used to treat ailments such as infections, rheumatism and inflammation.

'''Leopold III''' (1 November 1351 &amp;ndash; 9 July 1386), known as '''the Just''', a member of the [[House of Habsburg]], was [[List of rulers of Austria|Duke of Austria]] from 1365. As head and progenitor of the [[Leopoldian line]], he ruled over the [[Inner Austria]]n duchies of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] and [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] as well as the [[County of Tyrol]] and [[Further Austria]] from 1379 until his death.

==Life==
Born in [[Vienna]], Leopold was a younger son of Duke [[Albert II, Duke of Austria|Albert II of Austria]] (thereby a grandson of King [[Albert I of Germany]]), and younger brother of the Dukes [[Rudolf IV of Austria|Rudolf IV]] and [[Albert III of Austria|Albert III]]. His mother, [[Joanna of Pfirt]], a daughter of Princess [[Joanna of Burgundy]], was 51 when she gave birth to him and died shortly after. Upon the death of Albert II, his eldest son Rudolf IV, called the Founder, assumed the rule over the Habsburg dominions, despite the regulations on a joint rule left by his father. Nevertheless, on 18 November 1364 he promulgated his own [[house law]] (''Rudolfinische Hausordnung''), according to which the Austrian "hereditary lands" were again declared a common possession of the brothers, though the eldest received a number of additional rights.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{Cite ADB|18|392|395|Leopold III., Herzog von Oesterreich, Steiermark und Kärnthen|Alfons Huber|ADB:Leopold III. (Herzog von Österreich, Steiermark, Kärnten und Krain)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rudolf's death on 27 July 1365, Albert III and Leopold (their elder brother Friedrich had died in 1362) assumed the rule over the Habsburg lands, with Albert taking the additional rights as eldest. While Albert ruled, Leopold became a general leading Habsburg troops in battle.  In 1368 he defeated a [[Bavaria]]n incursion into Tirol, bringing all of Tirol under Habsburg authority in 1370. In 1372 Leopold broke with his brother over rights, prestige and income that he felt he was owed. On 25 July 1373 the brothers signed a peace treaty which granted Leopold control over Tirol, [[Further Austria]] and [[Carniola]] while income would be split between the dukes.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  In 1375 their relative [[Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy|Enguerrand VII de Coucy]] led a mercenary army into Alsace and Switzerland to capture the Habsburg possessions of [[Sundgau]], [[Breisgau]] and the county of [[Ferrette]] in the [[Gugler|Gugler war of 1375]]. After Leopold was unable to defeat his cousin, he retreated to [[Breisach]] on the [[Rhine]]. A coalition of Swiss cities then attacked and drove the Gugler army out of their country and ended the war.

By 1375 Leopold had inherited the former [[House of Gorizia|Gorizia]] possessions in the [[Windic March]], [[White Carniola]], [[Friuli]] and [[March of Istria|Istria]] and the city of [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]] in [[Vorarlberg]]. On 6 Aug 1376 he was granted the right to make alliances with foreign rulers.  In 1377 Albert traveled to Prussia for about five months, leaving Leopold in charge of all the Habsburg lands.  During this time, Leopold signed a peace treaty with one of his brother's bitterest rivals, Heinrich von Schaunberg.&lt;ref name=NDB/&gt; When on 7 July 1379 he and Albert III signed the [[Treaty of Neuberg]], Leopold became the exclusive ruler of Styria (then including [[Wiener Neustadt]]), Carinthia, Carniola, Tyrol and the Further Austrian lands in [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]].   In 1382 he was granted the city of [[Trieste]] as part of his payment for defeating Venice.

Leopold significantly promoted trade and commerce in the Tyrolean lands, encouraging the development of cities such as [[Merano|Meran]]. He gained control over the city of [[Basel]] in 1376 and could also purchase [[Laufenburg, Aargau|Laufenburg]] from his Swabian Habsburg cousins ten years later, however, his further attempts to expand his position in [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] failed, when he was killed in the [[Battle of Sempach]].

Initially buried in [[Königsfelden Monastery]], his mortal remains were transferred firstly to [[St. Blaise Abbey, Black Forest|St. Blaise Abbey]] in a solemn ceremony on 14 November 1770, and finally to [[Saint Paul's Abbey, Lavanttal|Saint Paul's Abbey]], Carinthia.

==Family and children==
He was married, on 23 February 1365, to [[Viridis Visconti]] (1352–1414), second daughter of [[Barnabò Visconti]], [[Lord of Milan]], and [[Beatrice Regina della Scala]]. The marriage produced four sons and three daughters including the following:&lt;ref name=NDB&gt;{{NDB|14|287|289|Leopold III.|Paul Uiblein|104089512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLKO"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=1860 |title=Habsburg, Leopold III. der Gerechte |encyclopedia=Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich |publisher=Kaiserlich-königliche Hof- und Staatsdruckerei |location=Vienna |url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Habsburg,_Leopold_III._der_Gerechte |last=von Wurzbach |first=Constantin |volume=6 |page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of known or suspected '''fatal [[cougar]] attacks''' that occurred in [[North America]] by decade in [[chronological order]]. The cougar is also commonly known as '''mountain lion''', '''puma''', '''mountain cat''', '''catamount''', or '''panther'''.  The sub-population in Florida is known as the '''Florida panther'''.

At least 20 people in [[North America]] were killed by cougars between 1890 and 2011, including seven in California. More than two-thirds of the Canadian fatalities occurred on [[Vancouver Island]] in [[British Columbia]]. Fatal cougar attacks are extremely rare and occur much less frequently than [[List of fatal snake bites in the United States|fatal snake bites]], fatal lightning strikes, or fatal bee stings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Children are particularly vulnerable. The majority of the child victims listed here were not accompanied by adults.

As with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person "[[wikt:play dead|plays dead]]." Standing still however may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Subramanian|first=Sushma|title=Should You Run or Freeze When You See a Mountain Lion?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=should-you-run-or-freeze-when-you-see-a-mountain-lion|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=March 10, 2012|date=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.&lt;ref name="Med"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKee |first=Denise |year=2003 |title=Cougar Attacks on Humans: A Case Report |journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 |publisher=Wilderness Medical Society |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/wmsonline/?request=get-document&amp;issn=1080-6032&amp;volume=014&amp;issue=03&amp;page=0169 |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |pmid=14518628 |doi=10.1580/1080-6032(2003)14[169:CAOHAC]2.0.CO;2 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GovBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/cougsf.htm |title=Safety Guide to Cougars |work=Environmental Stewardship Division |year=1991 |accessdate=May 28, 2007 |publisher=[[Government of British Columbia]], Ministry of Environment |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823061650/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/cougsf.htm |archive-date=August 23, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrocosm and Microcosm'''

Macrocosm and Microcosm is an important concept in Macrobiology. It refers to a vision of [[cosmos]] where the part reflects the whole (macrocosm) and vice versa. It is a feature "present in all esoteric schools of thinking", according to scholar [[Pierre A. Riffard]]. It underlies practices such as [[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and [[sacred geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094332/http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-12 |title=Cosmos - an Illustrated Dimensional Journey from microcosmos to macrocosmos |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2016-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mike "Yes Indeed" Reed''' (born 12 January 1993) is a twice-defeated American [[professional boxing|professional boxer]] from [[Waldorf, Maryland]]. Reed campaigns in the [[light welterweight|super lightweight]] division and is promoted by [[Top Rank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toprank.com/fighters/boxing-promotions-mike-reed-bio|title=Mike Reed|work=Top Rank Boxing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur career==
Reed was a decorated amateur, winning many National Championships. He won the 2005 National [[Silver Gloves]] Championship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalsilvergloves.org/hallofchampions/?c=9|title=National Silver Gloves Hall of Champions|website=NationalSilverGloves.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2009 U.S. Junior National Championship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2009c.html|title=US Junior National Championships 2009}},&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 National [[Golden Gloves]] Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldengloves.com/history|title=National Golden Gloves Past Champions|website=GoldenGloves.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed finished second at the 2010 [[United States national amateur boxing championships|U.S. National Championships]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2010.html|title=US National Championships 2010}},&lt;/ref&gt; third at the 2010 National [[Police Athletic League|PAL]] Championships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA_PAL2010.html|title=US National PAL Championships 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fourth at the 2011 [[United States national amateur boxing championships|U.S. National Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/USA2011.pdf|title=US National Championships 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed was named the 2011 Amateur Boxer of the Year by prominent boxing website [[Stiff Jab]]. Reed finished his illustrious amateur career with an impressive record of 90–13.

==Professional career==
He was named 2014 Prospect of the Year by world-renowned blog, Boxing Along the Beltway after a stellar year in which he went 6–0, 2 KOs, defeating two undefeated fighters and signing with the premier promotion in the sport, [[Top Rank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxingalongthebeltway.blogspot.com/2015/01/beltway-boxing-2014-prospect-of-year.html|title=2014 Prospect Of The Year|author=Gary Digital Williams|date=January 13, 2015|work=Boxing Along The Beltway}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the age of 24, Mike is a four-year pro. A blue-chip prospect at 140 pounds, Reed has stayed active in the ring and made good progress. He fought six times in 2013, six times in 2014, and five times in 2015. He has gone the full eight-round distance three times, and the full six-round distance five times.

"All of our matchmakers feel he will be making a big mark on the sport of boxing," Top Rank founder and CEO Bob Arum said in a news conference. "Without much time passing, he will be appearing on the stage in a big televised fight on HBO, or on our pay-per-view events. He is one of the brightest lights in boxing." Reed can move and flutter, but he is a banger, a power puncher. Soft-spoken and relaxed off the clock, Reed is confrontational and direct in the ring.

In his last fight on March 18 in Philadelphia, he won a six-round unanimous decision against Samuel Amoako. Mike consistently outworked Amoako, landed the harder punches, and dominated the fight – scored 60-54 on all three scorecards.

In his previous fight on November 11 in Las Vegas, Mike won by seventh-round TKO against Rondale Hubbert. Hubbert did his best to see the final bell but ate a vicious right hand that sent him to the canvas. He would rise but Reed forced the stoppage with a left hand at the 1:09 mark.

Reed has stepped up his game over his past several fights, hardly a surprise given his rich boxing background. A noted amateur who claimed several titles in compiling a 90-13 record, the southpaw joined a movement of gifted boxers who – in light of major changes in the amateur ranks – opted to turn pro in lieu of making a run for the 2016 U.S. Olympic boxing team.

"He has gotten better and better each time out over the last year," insists Carl Moretti, vice president of operations for Top Rank. "He has impressed all of us at Top Rank with his steady and consistent performances. Out of the ring, Mike and his dad Buck (Michael “Buck” Pinson) are as professional, respectful people as you’ll ever meet. Both are a great pleasure to work with and promote."

As classy as he is outside the ring, Reed has proven to be a fighter to watch from bell to bell.

Now with a professional record of (21–1 12 KOs), the 23-year-old from Washington, D.C. remains focused on his aspirations of having his name mentioned alongside the iconic World Champions who paved the way for Reed's younger generation.

'''Miles Peter Andrews''' (1742 – 18 July 1814) was an 18th-century English playwright, gunpowder manufacturer and politician who sat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] from 1796 to 1814.

==Biography==
[[File:Drury lane facade 1775.png|right|thumb|upright|Drury Lane Theatre in 1775]]
Andrews was the son of William Andrews, a drysalter of Watling Street and his wife Catherine Pigou. After helping his father in business in the day time, he was "accustomed to sally forth in the evening with sword and bag to [[Ranelagh Gardens|Ranelagh]] or some other public place". He gradually made useful social connections and became a constant companion of [[George Lyttelton, 2nd Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttelton]]. He wrote plays musicals and operas. The first was performed at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] in 1774. In 1775 the opera diva [[Ann Cargill]] aged 15 ran away with him and she then had to be restrained at home by a court order. Andrews had several further plays performed at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]]. Andrews lived in a mansion at [[Green Park]] where he entertained the fashionable society of London, and was a member of several clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Andrews, Miles Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his uncle [[Pigou|Frederick Pigou]], a director of the [[British East India Company]], Andrews became the owner of an extensive [[gunpowder]] factory at Hawley Mills on the [[River Darent]] at [[Dartford]], [[Kent]].
[[George Colman the Younger]] described Andrews as "one of the most persevering poetical pests", and his plays as "like his powder mills, particularly hazardous affairs, and in great danger of going off with a sudden and violent explosion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thepoultrykeeper.co.uk/search/results.php?g_seller_id=445&amp;g_orderby=authoraz&amp;g_offset=40 Rarebooksinternational.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} -&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukbookworld.com/cgi-bin/search.pl?s_i_DLR_ID=fenbooks&amp;all=1 UK Book World]&lt;/ref&gt; This was no idle comparison as an explosion occurred in October 1790.&lt;ref&gt;''The World''  14 October 1790&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Between four and five o'clock this afternoon (October 12th 1790) the people here, and in the neighbourhood, were terribly alarmed by the blowing up of Mr Pegu (sic)'s Powder Mills, within a short mile of this town.."

In 1796 Andrews succeeded Lord Lyttleton as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bewdley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bewdley]] which he represented until his death in 1814.&lt;ref name=HOP&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/andrews-miles-peter-1742-1814 History of Parliament Online - Miles Peter Andrews]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a memorial to him in [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]].

'''''Milton the Monster,''''' also called '''''The Milton the Monster Show,''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[animated cartoon]] TV series that ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from October 9, 1965, to September 8, 1968. It was produced and directed by [[Hal Seeger]].

==Overview==
The series starred Milton the Monster, a [[Frankenstein]]-looking monster with a flat-topped, seemingly hollow head which emitted various quantities of white steam or smoke based on his mood or situation. He was created by [[mad scientist]] Professor Montgomery Weirdo and his assistant Count Kook, who lived in a haunted house on Horror Hill. Milton is a smiling, good-natured fellow, thanks to the Professor having used too much "tincture of tenderness" as explained in the opening theme of each individual Milton the Monster segment.  Milton was created not of individual body parts, but rather in a mold from such liquids as "essence of terror" and "sinister sauce."  Out of fear of his creation destroying him, Professor Weirdo intended to add just a touch of the aforementioned tincture of tenderness to the mold, but Count Kook bumped the Professor's elbow, resulting in too much of the tincture being added to the mix. Milton's voice, which was based on the southern accent used by [[Jim Nabors]] in his television role as [[Gomer Pyle]],&lt;ref&gt;Hollis, T. (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ghv8wjJFyW0C&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq= ''Ain't That a Knee-Slapper: Rural Comedy in the Twentieth Century'']. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. p. 192.  {{ISBN|9781604739534}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was provided by [[Bob McFadden]] who also provided voices for Professor Weirdo's resident monsters:

*Heebie - a skull-faced, [[top hat]]-wearing [[ghoul]] with a [[Peter Lorre]] voice
*Jeebie - a slow-witted, [[Cyclops|cyclopian]], hairy green creature with a single sharp tooth that was often used to open soda cans

Professor Weirdo's nemesis was Professor Fruitcake, another mad scientist who lived in a castle on an opposite hill. Professor Fruitcake's major creation was Zelda the [[Zombie]]. Other characters in the series included Fangenstein, a biker monster apparently inspired by [[The Wild One|Marlon Brando]], his sidekick Abercrombie Zombie, and Professor Weirdo's aunt, the witchy Aunt Hagatha.

==Other features==
Other features on the show included:

* ''[[Hal Seeger|Fearless Fly]],'' starring an insect super-hero similar to [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[Atom Ant]]. One of the most popular segments of the Milton the Monster Show, Fearless Fly was, in reality, Hirem, an ordinary housefly who, whenever danger threatens, ducks into a nearby matchbox, dons a red sweater and, in a reversal of [[Clark Kent]], changes into the superhero Fearless Fly by putting on a pair of super high-powered [[glasses]] which "provide(d) millions of mega-tons of energy through the sensitive muscles in his head." FF, according to the opening, is more powerful than a speeding rocket and faster than a beam of light. No flypaper can hold him and no insecticide can stop him. Fearless Fly's sole weakness is losing his glasses, which happens in most of the episodes. To bring the point home, Hirem bemoans his fate by telling the audience, "My glasses! Without them, I'm helpless!" His chief nemesis is the 900-year-old [[Fu Manchu]]-inspired Dr. Goo Fee and his sidekick Gung Ho. Occasionally, Milton the Monster's Professor Weirdo makes an appearance to threaten Fearless Fly. Specifically, the episodes "Fearless Fly meets the Monsters" and "The Spider Spiter." The "Fearless Fly meets the Monsters" episode appears to be an early pilot for Milton the Monster. We see Professor Weirdo creating a monster similar to Milton. The same tincture of tenderness mishap occurs, but this creature's name is George. He basically looks like Milton, but with the Frankenstein Monster's hairstyle, has a deeper voice that sounds nothing like Jim Nabors, and a scar across his forehead. Heebie and Jeebie are present, but have different voices. Heebie's voice sounds more like Jeebie's, while Jeebie's design is basically unchanged except that he has a full set of fangs, instead of just a single sharp tooth, and that his voice sounds like that of [[Peter Lorre]]. Also present is a robot that appears to be an early version of Mechanical Mike, a character who appears in the Milton the Monster episode, "Monster-Sitter." The actual Milton the Monster makes a brief cameo in the episode "Ferocious Fly," as a [[mirage]] Hirem hallucinates while lost in the desert. When Fearless Fly is in the guise of Hirem, he hangs out at the Sugar Bowl with his girlfriend Flory (not Flora, as cited in other reference sources). Hirem's chief antagonist at the bistro is the bullying Horsey the Horsefly. Flory's voice was provided by the un-credited Beverly Arnold. [[Bob McFadden]] usually provided all of the voices, including the female ones, such as the seductive Lady Deflyah.
* ''[[Flukey Luke]],'' with a [[cowboy]] [[detective]] and his [[Ireland|Irish]]-accented [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] companion Two Feathers. Flukey Luke was so named because of his dumb luck that allowed him to get the upper hand despite being incredibly inept.
* ''[[Stuffy Durma]],'' starring a nouveau-riche hobo who resisted the attempts of valet Bradley Brinkley to get some culture and breeding.
* ''[[Muggy-Doo]],'' featuring a sly boy [[fox]] who often gets into trouble with his [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s.
* ''[[Penny Penguin]],'' starring a bratty aquatic bird.

'''Morris King Udall''' (June 15, 1922 – December 12, 1998) was an American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician who served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Arizona]] from May 2, 1961 to May 4, 1991, and was a leading contender for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Democratic Presidential Nomination]]. He was noted by many for his independent and [[American Liberalism|liberal]] views.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu"&gt;[http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/mobio.html "Biographical Information,"] on the [http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/ Morris K.

In 1961, Udall won a special election to succeed his brother, [[Stewart Udall]], as the congressman for [[Arizona's 2nd congressional district]].  In Congress, the younger Udall became a prominent and popular figure for his independent ways, his leading role in the [[conservation]] and [[environmental protection]] movements, his key role in reforming [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[campaign finance|political campaigns]], and his pioneering role in opposing the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine"&gt;Latham, Aaron, [http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/presidnt_htm.html "Will Rogers is Running for President,"] December 1974, ''[[New York Magazine]],'' as reproduced on the [http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/ Morris K.

Udall sought the Democratic nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Jimmy Carter]]. He supported [[Ted Kennedy]]'s strong challenge to Carter in the 1980 Democratic primaries, and Udall delivered the keynote address at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

He served as Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Interior Committee]] from 1977 to 1991. Diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1980, Udall resigned from Congress in 1991 as the effects of the disease worsened. He died in 1998.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt; His son, [[Mark Udall]], represented [[Colorado]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 2009 to 2015, and his nephew [[Tom Udall]] is currently the senior United States Senator from [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Udall was born and schooled in [[St. Johns, Arizona]]—one of six children (''[[New York Times]]'' says three sons, two daughters&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;) of Louisa (née Lee) and [[Levi Stewart Udall]], a lawyer who served as Chief Justice of the [[Arizona Supreme Court]] from 1946 to 1960. His mother was a writer keenly interseted in Indian life and culture. His father preached the importance of responsible people entering public service.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaufman2006&gt;{{Citation|title=The Carter years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIzooiFd6IoC&amp;pg=PA485 |year=2006|author=Kaufman, Burton Ira|journal=Infobase Publishing|pages=485|isbn=978-0-8160-5369-8|accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost his right eye to a friend's pocket knife at the age of six, while the two were attempting to cut some string, and adequate treatment was delayed because of his family's lack of money at the time, ultimately resulting in the loss of the eye. Udall wore a [[glass eye]] for the rest of his life. The loss would later influence his personality and politics.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaufman2006/&gt;

He described his early rural/small-town life in the desert as harsh and primitive, in a town where "everybody worked."  Noting they had "no tractors" he added "we had horses and plows."&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;

==Military service==
Udall attempted to enlist in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]], and almost succeeded, by covering his glass eye each time he was told to alternate during the eye exam.  After he was medically cleared, another potential enlistee complained that he had been medically rejected for flat feet, while Udall had passed with one eye. The examiners retested Udall under closer scrutiny, and he was rejected. Later, medical standards changed and Udall served in the Army, in a non-combat role in the U.S., until the end of the war.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;

An official biography at the University of Arizona—his alma mater, where [http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/ his personal papers] are archived—says that "He entered the [[United States Army Air Forces|United States Army-Air Force]] as a private in 1942 and was discharged as a captain in 1946, having served in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]]."&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' reports that he commanded an all-black squadron for two years, in [[Louisiana]]. Udall later claimed "That really shaped my life," claiming that he had "I fought their fights with them... over local discrimination." The ''Times'' adds that he served in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and achieved the rank of Captain in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;

== Education and athletics ==
While in high school, despite the lost eye, Udall was a star athlete in [[basketball]], and in [[football]] as quarterback leading an undefeated team. He also marched in the school band, wrote a political column for the school paper, and took the lead in the school play.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

Later, Udall attended the [[University of Arizona]], where he was a star [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|basketball]] player (team co-captain), President of the Associated Student Government, and a member of [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

For one year following graduation, Udall played professional [[basketball]] with the [[Denver Nuggets (1948–50)|Denver Nuggets]] during the 1948–49 [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] season. However, neither Udall nor his team performed notably.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

At the same time, he attended the [[University of Denver]] [[Sturm College of Law|school of law]], and then returned to the University of Arizona for [[James E. Rogers College of Law|law school]], where he graduated in 1949 with a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) law degree.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

==Personality and philosophy==
Udall was a tall (6'5"), [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincolnesque]] figure with a self-deprecating wit and easy manner. Because of his wit, columnist [[James J. Kilpatrick]] deemed him "too funny to be [[President of the United States|president]]", which also ended up being the title of his [[autobiography]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

He once said that his physical stature and one eye kept him from ever having a date in high school, and led to his use of self-deprecating humor to survive.&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

Known for his humor, his irreverent and casual style (particularly his colorful western wear and cowboy boots), and his ethics, Udall was summarized by leading political journalist [[James M. Perry]] as "funny, smart, down-to-earth, honest, sassy, patient."&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;

Raised [[Mormon]], his spiritual views began to change. He ceased being active in church by the time he returned from military service. While in college, as he read philosophy and history, his discarded his Mormon faith. In particular, he rejected the Mormon teachings of the time (since repealed) that black people were "cursed.".&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

==Early career==
In 1949 Udall, with his brother, Stewart, started the law firm of Udall &amp; Udall in [[Tucson, Arizona]], practicing law in Tucson until 1961.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

Udall also was elected as the [[Pima County]] chief deputy attorney (1950-1952) and county attorney (1953-1954).  In 1954, though, he failed in a bid to be nominated for a Superior Court judgeship.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

He taught labor law at the University of Arizona law school (1955, 1956),&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt; and in 1961, became vice-president of the [[Arizona Bar Association]]. Udall co-founded the [[Bank of Tucson]], and the [[Catalina Savings and Loan Association]], and in 1960 became president of Tucson's [[YMCA]].&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

== Political career ==
Throughout his early life, Udall dreamed of public office, but—under pressure from his wife—deferred a Congressional race opportunity to his older brother, [[Stewart Udall]], who won the {{ushr|Arizona|2}} seat in 1954. His hopes for a seat on the Arizona Supreme Court (where his father had served) were dashed when the seat went to his ultra-conservative uncle, instead.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;

===Congressman===

In 1961, his brother [[Stewart Udall]], the congressman for {{ushr|Arizona|2}}, was appointed [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] in the [[Kennedy administration]].  Mo Udall won a special election for his brother's vacant seat by only 2,000 votes—with 51% of the vote.  He won the seat in his own right in 1962, and was reelected 13 more times.  He only faced one other close race, in 1978, when he received 52 percent of the vote. He held the post until his resignation May 4, 1991.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

For his first term, he represented the entire state outside of [[Maricopa County]].  After the 1960s round of redistricting, his district was cut back to the southern portion of the state, centered on [[Tucson]].  After a mid-decade redistricting ordered as a result of [[Wesberry v. Sanders]], his district absorbed some outer portions of the Phoenix area.

From 1977 until his retirement in 1991, Udall chaired the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs]] (one which he'd served since 1963). He also served as [[ranking member]] of the [[United States House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service|Committee of the Post Office and Civil Service]], chairman of the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] and was a member of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

====Vietnam War====
Udall first gained national political notoriety for a speech October 23, 1967, in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] at a major regional civic meeting, with an audience of 2,800—largely civic leaders, mostly supportive of [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson's]] policy on the [[Vietnam War]]. Despite their leanings, Udall gave a firm and direct speech calling the nation's involvement in Vietnam "a mistaken and dangerous road." He called for reversing American escalation of the war, and eventual U.S. withdrawal—the first major figure in the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] to openly oppose the Democratic President on the war.  The speech drew a standing ovation, and reverberated nationwide, drawing national media and political attention, and initiating the Democratic Party's gradual split over the war.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;

====Labor legislation====
On labor legislation, however, Udall was less liberal. Though he opposed [[right-to-work laws]] that undermined [[labor unions]], his constituents very strongly supported it, so Udall did, too—particularly in a 1965 Congressional vote that labor leaders held against him for years.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;

====Conservation &amp; the Environment====
On [[conservation]] and [[environmental protection]], Udall's record was mixed—and extreme in both directions—though he is largely credited with being generally a defender of those causes (he first joined the House Interior committee in 1961), particularly as chairman of the [[House Committee on Natural Resources|House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs]]. He fought for [[environmental protection]], and expansion of the [[National Park System]], ushered legislation through Congress absorbing 8 million acres into the federal wilderness system across 20 states, and attempted to restructure the energy industry.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

An important exception was his defense of planned dam-and-reservoir projects in Arizona that threatened to inundate key wilderness areas, including a hydroelectric dam that threatened to flood some of the [[Grand Canyon]].  Hostile campaigning by the nation's leading conservation organization, the [[Sierra Club]], led to Udall's bitter fight with them, and the eventual loss of their [[tax-exempt]] status, which some have blamed on Udall's complaints about them to the [[Internal Revenue Service]].  The projects were eventually abandoned, replaced with [[coal-fired powerplant]]s that Udall thought more polluting than the dams would have been.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;

However, in the opposite extreme, Udall's "proudest achievement" was passage of an Alaska lands bill, permanently preserving 104.3 million acres of extraordinarly scenic wilderness, over the furious opposition of many in Alaska and in the natural resource industries.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;

In 1973, Udall was named "Legislator of the Year" by the [[National Wildlife Federation]].&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

However, in 1974, his Land Use Bill was defeated—some environmentalists blaming Udall's inability to work the bill effectively on the floor of the House.&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

From the beginning of his work on the Interior committee in 1961, Udall had been interested in limiting the controversial practice of [[strip mining]], blamed for massive destruction of wilderness and extensive environmental damage, particularly across the [[American West]].  However, it took several years of wrangling with industry, Congress and administrations (Republican President [[Gerald R. Ford]] vetoed the legislation twice), before he was able to pass a limited bill, into law (signed by Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]]), which constrained the strip-mining of [[coal]], and forced the reclamation of millions of acres of strip-mined areas.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;

Udall helped helped write and pass the [[Alaska Lands Act of 1980]], and landmark 1982 legislation addressing nuclear waste management.&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

====Government legislative reform====
Udall challenged the arcane and Byzantine rules and protocols of the House of Representatives, demanding a reduction in the ability of powerful leaders to covertly control legislation and dominate committees. Udall's efforts eventually led to substantial reform of Congressional rules and operations.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

Udall gained early national political notoriety for being the first Congressman in the 20th Century to challenge a sitting [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] for his seat—going up against Rep. [[John William McCormack|John McCormack]], in 1968.  Though defeated, Udall tried again two years later, against the [[House Majority Leader]], [[Hale Boggs]]—again losing, but shaking the foundations of the House seniority system, which eventually was reformed—largely as a result of the revolt begun by Udall.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

Like any freshman Congressman, Udall struggled to adapt to the office during his first term; but in his second term, he responded to the experience by organizing a school for other incoming freshmen Congressman, to teach them the complex and subtle ways of the House of Representatives, and the how to navigate the Washington bureaucracy. To aid this effort, Udall wrote a 1966 guidebook, ''The Job of a Congressman.''&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

====Government campaign reform====
Udall co-sponsored the [[Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]] and was a key factor in its success—the first major campaign-finance reform legislation since 1925—requiring campaign finance reports from candidates. (It later ensnared President [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[Watergate scandal]]). He also co-sponsored the [[1974 Campaign Reform Act]], signed by President Ford. He fought for financial disclosure legislation, and disclosed his own finances and tax returns.&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;

====Government administrative reform====
Reforming [[Civil service]] and the [[U.S. Post Office]] were a major focus of Udall's efforts in Congress.  On the [[United States House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service|Committee of the Post Office and Civil Service]] since 1961, he eventually became the [[ranking member]]. He attempted to revise pay scales for federal employees and establish merit pay.&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

Ultimately, Udall was one of the principal leaders effecting the first substantial reform of the U.S. civil service system since the 1883 creation of that merit-based government-employment system. The bill created performance incentives for workers in the bureaucracy, and made firing federal workers easier. Though it wasn't his idea (rather a favorite project of President Carter, whom Udall disliked), Udall pushed the bill through Congress, against numerous roadblocks thrown up by federal employees (and by Congressmen representing districts that employed many of them). Udall compromised until getting a consensus bill before the whole House, fighting through additional opposition to success.&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;

Udall sought to change the [[Post Office Department]] from a purely governmental agency into a semiprivate organization (today, it is: the [[U.S. Postal Service]]), and was a key force in passage of the [[Postal Regulation Act]].&lt;ref name="biographical_info_arizona_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;  (This is probably a misnomer; more likely it was the [[Postal Reorganization Act]] of 1970.)

====Other issues====
His childhood eye loss, attributed to poor medical care owing to inadequate family finances, left him with the belief that people should have access to competent medical care regardless of financial condition.&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_new_york_times" /&gt;

In 1963, Udall attempted to get cigarettes (and other tobacco) regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administation]] (FDA).&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt;

On the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]], Udall opposed Reagan administration policies towards [[Central America]].&lt;ref name="obit_1998_12_14_washington_post" /&gt;

=== Presidential campaign ===
In 1976, Udall [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|ran for the Democratic nomination for President]] as a liberal alternative to [[Jimmy Carter]], the former Governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="this_fella_from_arizona_1981_11_audubon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="will_rogers_1974_12_new_york_magazine" /&gt; Carter had gone from obscure maverick to front runner after a string of early [[caucus]] and [[primary election|primary]] victories, beginning in [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]]. At the time of the [[Wisconsin]] primary in April, most of the original 10 candidates had dropped out, leaving Udall, Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry "Scoop" Jackson]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], Governor [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]], and Carter. Udall looked set to win the primary and as the returns ticked in, it looked like he would win it. This might have slowed down the Carter momentum. Udall was projected the winner, exclaiming "Oh, how sweet it is". But as the election night progressed, Carter began chipping away at Udall's lead, eventually going into the lead.

[[File:JFK–MKUdall 1961.jpg|thumb|250px|Mo Udall with [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]], May 18, 1961.]]
Some newspapers actually proclaimed Udall the winner because of his lead the night before, not unlike the famous incident in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], in which the [[headline]]s of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' erroneously proclaimed "[[Dewey Defeats Truman]]."

Carter's win was by 1%, which was no more than 7,500 votes. He won 37% to Udall's 36%, gaining one more convention delegate than Udall. Despite the small margins, Carter got the headlines and a further boost to his momentum, pulling away from Udall and the other candidates. In the end, Udall finished second in the New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New York, Michigan, South Dakota, and Ohio primaries, and won the caucuses in his home state of Arizona, while running even with Carter in the New Mexico caucuses.  Udall finished a distant second place to Carter at the Democratic National Convention, where his name was placed in nomination by [[Archibald Cox]], and Udall's speech received great applause from his supporters.

During the Michigan primary, the Carter campaign had [[Coleman Young]], the mayor of Detroit, accuse Udall of racism for belonging to the LDS church, which at the time, did not allow blacks to serve in the church's priesthood (since changed in 1978 by LDS Church President, [[Spencer W. Kimball]]).  Udall had been a longtime critic of that church policy, and had ceased being an active member because of it.  Carter's subsequent sweeping of the black vote in the Michigan primary was key to his crucial and narrow victory in Michigan.

Udall supported Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]]'s challenge to President Carter in 1980, and Kennedy won the Arizona caucuses, one of only three wins for Kennedy in the west.  Udall delivered the keynote speech at the 1980 Democratic convention, which was a typically witty Udall speech.  Udall considered running for president again in 1984, but he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1980 and his illness kept him on the sidelines.  At the convention that summer, Udall introduced his old foe, President Carter.

== Legacy ==
In 1992, the US Congress founded the [[Morris K. Udall Foundation|Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|102|259}}, 106 Stat. 78, S. 2184, enacted March 19, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an agency of the executive branch of the federal government, and among other functions, gives [[scholarship]]s to students of environmental policy. In 2009, Congress added Mo's brother, Stewart Udall, into the foundation by renaming it the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation.

Federal funds for Parkinson's research are designated through the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Act of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|105|78}}, title VI, §603, November 13, 1997, 111 Stat. 1519, (42 U.S.C. {{USCSec|42|284f}})&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation funded a national network of "Centers of Excellence" to diagnose and treat Parkinson disease patients and to refer patients into research protocols.

In 1996 Morris received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President Clinton.

Udall was married three times. He married Patricia Emery in 1949, with whom he had six children. Udall's first wife, who hated politics, suffered from arthritis and spent much time on a wheelchair. She and Udall rarely saw each other due to his hectic political schedule. By Mo Udall's own account, Pat had become unsatisfied with her life caused by her disinterest in politics and illnesses. Pat was also a high-spirited person who had a tendency to frequently start arguments.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4h0CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mo+udall&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmmJ6axqTdAhV0NX0KHVwTAf8Q6AEIKTAA#v=snippet&amp;q=pat&amp;f=false|title=Mo: The Life and Times of Morris K.

Mo Udall, who was opposed to the divorce, did not object to the dissolution of the marriage mainly because he was more focused on politics than his family. She went on to marry and divorce three more times in the seven years following her split from Udall, all of which were brief marriages which she later regretted.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4h0CgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mo+udall&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmmJ6axqTdAhV0NX0KHVwTAf8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=divorce&amp;f=false|title=Mo: The Life and Times of Morris K.

Both the Udalls later regretted the divorce, explaining that the marriage ended because she failed to get counseling or help and simply acquiesced to pressure and made a poor impulse decision. Pat Udall herself stated that she was "ashamed" by her decision to end the marriage.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Two years later he married Ella Lee Royston, a marriage that would last until Royston's suicide in 1988. In 1989, he married his third wife, Norma Gilbert, who has two grown daughters and one grown son, and they remained together until his death in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/dec98/udall14.htm |title= Environmental Leader Rep. Mo Udall Dies | date=December 14, 1998 | accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udall and his first wife, who were not on the best terms after the divorce especially due to the stress caused by her illnesses, eventually reconciled after she recovered and remained close friends for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Udall's relationship with his children was distant for most of his life. A workaholic, he rarely spent time with his children when they were growing up. His years in retirement were plagued by Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name="Carson"/&gt;

Morris Udall's son [[Mark Udall]] was elected to the U.S. Congress from Colorado's 2nd district in 1998 and to the U.S. Senate in 2008. His nephew [[Tom Udall]] of New Mexico was also elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008, while second cousin Senator [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] of Oregon was defeated for re-election the same year.

'''Pacrat''' is the name of a software agent designed to simulate basic mammalian responses to the environment, as proposed by M. Johnson and R. Scanlon in a 1987 paper titled "Experiences with a Feeling-Thinking Machine". (Proceedings of the IEEE First International Conference on Neural Networks, San Diego, 71-77.)

According to Myles Brandon Bogner: "Pacrat’s actions are driven by eight
brain centers: amygdala, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, isocortex, medial forebrain bundle, reticular ascending substance, and the thalamus. These brain centers model the functional relationships between mammalian centers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bognerfamily.com/myles/papers/RealizingConsciousnessInSoftwareAgents.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009190807/http://www.bognerfamily.com/myles/papers/RealizingConsciousnessInSoftwareAgents.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture is intended to simulate a number of emotional and physical states, including fear, anger/frustration, happiness, curiosity, and hunger. The behavior of the agent is dependent on the interplay of these states.

Pacrat is discussed in the book [[Artificial Minds]] by [[Stan Franklin]], where he states that the designers believe it "both thinks and feels".{{page needed|date=December 2011}} It is compared to [[Animat]], a simpler agent of the same type that is discussed in greater detail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">The '''Polyandrion''' is the archaeological term for the communal tomb in [[ancient Greece]], where more than one body, usually [[warrior]]s, are buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Harris|first=Cyril M.|title=Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=kp_DAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1149&amp;lpg=PT1149&amp;dq=polyandrion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jm1nUhq0o8&amp;sig=iFzFAd4RPpCcXcY-CmV3GEkefNY&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTifH8z_fdAhURbBoKHXcMBxU4FBDoATABegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=polyandrion&amp;f=false|year=2013|publisher=Courier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polyhedron is also called ''δημόσιον σήμα'' (public signal)&lt;ref name=Mollet&gt;{{cite book|last=Mollett|first=J. W. |title=An Illustrated Dictionary of Words Used in Art and Archaeology|year=1883|publisher=Gilbert and Rivington|location= London|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For the marking of polyandrons during the 7th c. BCE, in addition to the form of the [[toumba]] in Northern Greece, or the [[Kouros]] in ancient times, a large stone or marble tombstone was used, like that of the ancient cemetery of Paros, where for at least two centuries there were hero-cult with offerings and sacrifices to the dead, male warriors.

Polyandria of the 5th c. are known in [[Attica]], [[Central Greece|Central]] and [[Northern Greece]], but are scarcely associated with extreme historical conditions. An impressive polyandrion is that of [[ancient Athens]], associated with the early years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] and the sudden plague that broke out in the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baziotopoulou-Valavani |first=E.|editor=Stamatopoulou, M., Yeroulanou, M. |title=Excavating Classical Culture|year=2002|pages=187–201|chapter=A Mass Burial from the Cemetery of Kerameikos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of the typology of the monuments ended around 317 BCE following the legislation of [[Demetrios of Phaleron]], who banned the rich sculpture demonstration. Athenian citizens were mentioned either with a monument called a ''trapeza'' or with a small [[pillar]]. These monuments generally refer to the name of the deceased, the name of his father and the municipality in which the citizen was registered. The simple style of the newer monuments was considered to be an extreme expression of the [[ideology]] of [[isonomia]], the fundamental equality of all citizens&lt;ref name=Mollet /&gt;.

== Vertebrates ==

[[Armadillo]]s are the most well studied vertebrate that undergoes polyembryony, with six species of armadillo in the genus ''[[Dasypus]]'' that are always polyembryonic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27857027|title=Polyembryony in Armadillos: An unusual feature of the female nine-banded armadillo's reproductive tract may explain why her litters consist of four genetically identical offspring|first1=W.

There are two conditions that are expected to promote the evolution of polyembryony: the mother does not know the environmental conditions of her offspring as in the case of parasitoids, or a constraint on reproduction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is thought that nine banded armadillos evolved to be polyembryonic because of the latter.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Invertebrates ==

A more striking example of the use of polyembryony as a competitive reproductive tool is found in the parasitoid [[Hymenoptera]], family [[Encyrtidae]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v44RlnM9ncQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Parasites+and+pathogens:+effects+on+host+hormones+and+behavior+precocious+larvae#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Parasites and pathogens : effects on host hormones and behavior|last=E.|first=Beckage, Nancy|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|isbn=978-0412074011|location=|pages=|oclc=875319486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progeny of the splitting embryo develop into at least two forms, those that will develop into adults and those that become a type of soldier, called precocious larvae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These latter larvae patrol the host and kill any other parasitoids they find with the exception of their siblings, usually sisters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Obligately polyembryonic insects fall in two classes: Hymenoptera (certain wasps), and [[Strepsiptera]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Insects (2nd edition)|last=Strand|first=Michael|publisher=Elsevier|year=2009|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From one egg, these insects can produce over thousands of offspring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Polyembryonic wasps from the Hymenoptera group can be further subdivided into four families including [[Braconidae]] (''Macrocentrus''), [[Platygastridae|Platygasteridae]] (''Platygaster''), [[Encyrtidae]] (''Copidosoma''), and [[Dryinidae]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Polyembryony also occurs in [[Bryozoa]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Helen L.|last2=Waeschenbach|first2=Andrea|last3=Okamura|first3=Beth|last4=Hughes|first4=Roger N.|last5=Bishop|first5=John D. D.|date=2017-01-17|title=Phylogenetically Widespread Polyembryony in Cyclostome Bryozoans and the Protracted Asynchronous Release of Clonal Brood-Mates|pmc=5240946|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=12|issue=1|pages=e0170010|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0170010|issn=1932-6203|pmid=28095467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through recent genotype analysis and molecular data, it has been suggested that polyembryony happens in the entire order [[Cyclostomata]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Plants ==

The term is also used in [[botany]] to describe the phenomenon of [[seedling]]s emerging from one embryo. Around 20 genera of [[Gymnosperm|gymnospores]] undergo polyembryony, termed "[[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] polyembryony," where the original [[zygote]] splits into many identical embryos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In some plant taxa, the many embryos of polyembryony eventually gives rise to only a single offspring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The mechanism underlying the phenomenon of a resulting single (or in some cases a few) offspring is described in ''[[Scots pine|Pinus sylvestris]]'' to be [[programmed cell death]] (PCD), which removes all but one embryo.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Originally, all embryos have equal opportunity to develop into full seeds, but during the early stages of development, one embryo becomes dominant through [[competition]], and therefore the now [[Dormancy|dormant]] seed, while the other embryos are destroyed through PCD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The genus ''[[Citrus]]'' has a number of species that undergo polyembryony, where multiple nucellar-cell-derived embryos exist alongside sexually-derived embryos.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakano|first=Michiharu|last2=Shimada|first2=Takehiko|last3=Endo|first3=Tomoko|last4=Fujii|first4=Hiroshi|last5=Nesumi|first5=Hirohisa|last6=Kita|first6=Masayuki|last7=Ebina|first7=Masumi|last8=Shimizu|first8=Tokurou|last9=Omura|first9=Mitsuo|date=2012-02-01|title=Characterization of genomic sequence showing strong association with polyembryony among diverse Citrus species and cultivars, and its synteny with Vitis and Populus|journal=Plant Science|volume=183|pages=131–142|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.08.002|issn=1873-2259|pmid=22195586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishore|first=Kundan|last2=N.|first2=Monika|last3=D.|first3=Rinchen|last4=Lepcha|first4=Boniface|last5=Pandey|first5=Brijesh|date=2012-05-01|title=Polyembryony and seedling emergence traits in apomictic citrus|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423812000568|journal=Scientia Horticulturae|volume=138|pages=101–107|doi=10.1016/j.scienta.2012.01.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] first described polyembryony in 1719 when the seed in ''Citrus'' was observed to have two germinating embryos.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In ''Citrus'', polyembryony is genetically controlled by a shared polyembryony locus among the species, determined by [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] in the genotypes sequenced.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The variation within the species of citrus is based on the amount of embryos that develop, the impact of the environment, and gene expression.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As with other species, due to the many embryos developing in close proximity, competition occurs, which can cause variation in seed success or vigor.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндра Гео́ргиевна}}; ''née'' '''Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark''' ({{lang-el|Πριγκίπισσα Αλεξάνδρα της Ελλάδας και της Δανίας}}); 30 August 1870 – 24 September 1891) was the third child and firstborn daughter of [[George I of Greece|King George I]] and [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia|Queen Olga]] of Greece, who herself was a daughter of a Russian grand duke, and was also a grandchild of Denmark's [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]]. She was a sister to [[Constantine I of Greece]], and thus aunt of three kings and two queens, Constantine's three sons, who all became kings of Greece, and two of his daughters, who were queens, in name, of Romania and Croatia, respectively. She was also first cousin of [[Tsar Nicholas II of Russia]], [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]], and both [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway,]] as well as a paternal aunt of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].

== Early life==
Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark was born on {{OldStyleDate|30|1870|18 August}} at [[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]], the summer residence of the Greek royal family  on the island of [[Corfu]]. She was the third child and eldest daughter of King [[George I of Greece]] and his wife, [[Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia]]. Alexandra's father was not a native Greek, but he had been born a Danish prince named Christian Wilhelm of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a son of [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX, King of Denmark]], and he had been elected to the Greek throne at the age of seventeen. Thus, the Greek royal family was part of the Danish and it was in a close personal relationship with the British and Russian dynasties since King George's sisters, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dagmar]], married the heirs to thrones of England and Russia.
King George I of Greece and  Queen Olga had eight children. One daughter also named Olga died in childhood, but five sons ([[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]], [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|George]], [[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark|Nicholas]], [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark|Andrew]], [[Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark|Christopher]]) and two daughters ([[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]] and [[Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark|Maria]]) reached adulthood.

The Greek royal family was not wealthy by royal standards and they lived with simplicity. King George was a taciturn man, but contrary to the general approach of the time, he believed in happy rambunctious children. The long corridors of the royal place in Athens were used by Alexandra and her siblings for biking, rollerblading, skateboarding, and sometimes a "bike ride" led by the King himself. Raised by British nannies, English was the children's first language,  but they spoke Greek between themselves. They also learned German and French.

Alexandra, nickname "Aline" within her family, or Greek Alix, to distinguish her from her aunt and godmother, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]], had a sunny disposition and was much loved by her family. "She had one of those sweet and lovable natures that endeared her to everybody who came in touch with her," recalled her brother [[Prince Nicholas of Greece]]. "She looked young and beautiful, and ever since she was a child, life looked as it had nothing but joy and happiness in store for her."&lt;ref&gt;Mager (1998), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra's playmates were her brother Nicholas and her sister Maria, who followed her in age. Alexandra spent many holidays in Denmark visiting her paternal grandparents. In Denmark, Alexandra and her siblings met their Russian and British cousins in large family gatherings.

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich Romanov and Princess Alexandra of Greece.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Princess Alexandra of Greece and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia. Engagement photograph.]]
When she was eighteen years old, she was married to [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia]], her maternal first cousin once removed and the youngest child and sixth son of [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]] and his first wife, [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine]]. They had become close when Grand Duke Paul spent winters in Greece due to his frequent respiratory illnesses. The Greek royal family also frequently spent holidays with the Romanov family on visits to Russia or Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Zeepvat (2004), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Their engagement was announced on 10 November 1888.&lt;ref name="Zeepvat 8"&gt;Zeepvat, ''Dear, Unforgettable Alix'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding took place on {{OldStyleDate|17 June |1889|5 June}} in [[St. Petersburg]], at the chapel of the [[Winter Palace]].&lt;ref name=" Van der Kiste 126"&gt;Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818-1959'', p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

They had two children:

* [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890-1958)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]] (1890–1958)
* [[Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]] (1891–1942)

==Death==
Seven months into her second pregnancy, Alexandra took a walk with her friends on the bank of the [[Moskva River]] and jumped directly into a boat that was permanently moored there, but fell as she got in. The next day, she collapsed in the middle of a ball from violent labour pains. She gave birth to her son, Dimitri, lapsed into a fatal coma, and she died six days later in the Romanovs' estate Ilyinskoe near Moscow. The Grand Duchess was buried in the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]], St. Petersburg.  Her grieving husband had to be restrained from throwing himself into the grave with her.&lt;ref&gt;Zeepvat (2004), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband later [[Morganatic marriage|morganatically]] remarried [[Olga Valerianovna Paley|Olga Karnovich]], and her son would be involved in the murder of [[Grigori Rasputin]], a favorite of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra Feodorvna]], in 1916.

In 1939 when Alexandra's nephew [[George II of Greece]] was reigning, the Greek government obtained a permission from the Soviet government under [[Joseph Stalin]] to rebury Princess Alexandra in Greece. Her body was removed from the vault in [[Leningrad]] and transferred by a Greek ship to Athens. It was finally laid to rest near the [[Tatoi Palace]]. Alexandra's marble tombstone over an empty tomb is still in its place in the Peter and Paul Cathedral.

The "''Alexandra Maternity Hospital''" (now "''Alexandra General Hospital''") in Athens was later named in her memory by another nephew, [[Paul of Greece|King Paul]]; it was affiliated with the [[University of Athens]] with a special remit to research and combat postpartum maternal mortality. [[Alexandras Avenue]] in Athens was also named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Πετρόπουλος|first=Ηλίας|title=Η ονοματοθεσία οδών και πλατειών|publisher=Πατάκης|year=1995|pages=65–68|isbn=960-360-483-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Riley Bloom'' series''' is the spin-off of the fantasy series ''[[The Immortals (books)|The Immortals]]'' by [[Alyson Noel]] first published in 2010 in the United States about the afterlife of Riley Bloom, the sister of Ever Bloom (lead character of The Immortals).

Riley Bloom is a twelve-year-old girl who was about to become a teenager before she died in a car accident. She didn't cross over to heaven after the death of her and her family as she wanted to stay with her big sister - Ever Bloom - who was neither dead or alive after the accident as she had become immortal. Later, due to the force of her sister, she walks over the bridge to heaven. There she meets her Mom, Dad and her pet dog Buttercup. And it's from here the journey starts.

The Riley Bloom Series consists of:

* ''[[Radiance (book)|Radiance]]'' (August 31, 2010)
* ''Shimmer'' (March 15, 2011)
* ''Dreamland'' (September 13, 2011)
* ''Whisper'' (April 24, 2012)

== Synopsis ==

This book follows Riley Bloom. Riley and her family died in a car accident, though her sister became immortal. Her mom and dad and her dog Buttercup were crossing the bridge but she didn't because a part of her longed to stay with her surviving sister. When Ever learned that her little sister was stuck between two worlds, Riley crossed the bridge and entered the Here &amp; Now after Ever told her to move on.

== ''Radiance'' ==
{{main article|Radiance (book)}}

Riley Bloom left her sister, Ever, in the world of the living and crossed the bridge into the afterlife - a place called Here, where time is always Now. Riley and her dog, Buttercup, have been reunited with her parents and just settled into a nice, relaxing death when she's summoned before The Council. They let her in on one condition - the afterlife isn't just an eternity of leisure; Riley has to work. She's been assigned a job, Soul Catcher, and a teacher, Bodhi, a curious boy whom she can't quite figure out.

Riley, Bodhi, and Buttercup return to earth for her first assignment, a Radiant Boy who's been haunting a castle in England for centuries. Many Soul Catchers have tried to get him to cross the bridge and failed.

== ''Shimmer'' ==
Having solved the matter of the Radiant Boy, Riley, Buttercup, and Bodhi are enjoying a well deserved vacation. When Riley comes across a young ghost named Rebecca, Riley soon learns Rebecca's not at all what she sees. As the daughter of a former plantation owner, she is furious about being murdered during a slave revolt in 1733. Mired in her own anger, Rebecca is keeping the ghosts who died along with her trapped in their worst memories.

== ''Dreamland'' ==
Riley's finding that the afterlife can be a lonely place when all you do is focus on work. So.. she goes to the place where dreams happen, hoping to find a way to contact her sister, Ever. She meets the director, who tells her about the two ways to send dreams. As a Dream Jumper, a person can jump into a dreamer's dream, share a message, and participate. As a Dreamweaver, an entire dream can be created in a studio and sent to the dreamer. But dreamweaving was outlawed decades ago, and the studio was boarded up. Thinking that it's her only way to reach out to her sister, Riley goes in search of the old studio. There she finds a ghost boy, who's been creating and sending nightmares to people for years. In order to stop him and reach out to Ever, Riley is going to have to confront and overcome her own fears.

== ''Whisper'' ==
This would be the most challenging Soul Catch for Riley as she has to catch the soul of a Roman Gladiator who's called the Pillar of Doom. For this Riley has to go through a makeover which would make her a teenager she has always wished for. Riley meets Messalina who introduces her to a cute boy named Dacian.

'''Shep''', or '''The Thanhouser Dog''' or '''Shep the Dog''' (died November 1914), was a male [[collie]] dog who starred in a number of silent films made by the [[Thanhouser Company]].

==Life==
Shep was a collie owned by [[Jack Harvey (actor and director)|Jack Harvey]], a film director.
When Harvey was working for [[Vitagraph Studios]], Shep appeared in a number of films, but was not given much publicity.
In September 1914 ''[[Motion Picture Magazine]]'' said that Shep was owned by Arthur Ashley while he was with Vitagraph.{{sfn|Bowers|1993}} In ''[[A Dog's Love]]'', an 11 minute short released in October 1914, Shep plays a dog who grieves after his human playmate ([[Helen Badgley]]) has died.{{sfn|Thanhouser classics ... Stanford University}} Other successful films in which Shep appeared were ''[[Shep's Race with Death]]'' and ''A Dog's Good Deed''.{{sfn|Bowers|1993}}
[[File:The Barrier of Flames 1914.png|thumb|Shep (center) with Helen Badgley on the poster for ''The Barrier of Flames'' (1914)]]
In November 1914 ''Reel Life'' said, "In ''[[The Barrier of Flames]]'', a forthcoming Thanhouser release, Shep, the beautiful collie, who daily reports for work at the New Rochelle studio, performed another daring rescue, distinguishing himself by a feat of human heroism and sagacity by climbing a ladder and rescuing [[Helen Badgley]] from the top story of a burning house."{{sfn|The Barrier of Flames, Reel Life}} The same month, ''The Moving Picture World'' wrote "Shep, Thanhouser's collie, has recently been acclaimed by critics as a great dog actor. His work in motion pictures is a study in itself. The dog rehearses his parts and goes through them just like a regular actor and never grumbles or tries to sass back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanhouser.org/tcocd/Filmography_files/indhc4xt2.htm|title=The Barrier of Flames|publisher=Thanhauser Company|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a feature on Shep ''The Chicago News'' of 23 December 1914 said 
{{blockquote|Shep is the name of a dog whose principal claim to fame is that he graces the screen in the capacity of a star, frequently appearing in the title roles of startling and melodramatic 'thrillers.' Shep is a Thanhouser collie, a valuable acquisition to that studio, and, according to the directors, goes about his work with a determination and precision which would do credit to many of his human friends in the profession. Like any ordinary star or stock performer, Shep must rehearse his parts until he attains a perfect understanding of his role. When a scene is ready to be enacted for the camera the canine takes his place among the players, watches them closely as they go through their respective parts and when his cue comes enters the scene without any delay, performing his duties intelligently, rarely spoiling the picture, thereby causing a take-over.{{sfn|Shep, The Chicago News}} }}

Shep died after a short illness in November 1914. The ''New York Star'' reported the death, and said, "There was much sorrow expressed last week at the death of Shep, the Thanhouser dog, who had created a unique part for himself in moving picture work. For Shep was a dramatic actor and could register sorrow or joy with the ease of a great artist. He was known to thousands for his work upon the screen, and though he had many imitators few were even in his class."{{sfn|Shep Has Played His Last Part, New York Star}}

'''Sian Samantha Blake''' (September 1972 – 14 or 15 December 2015), also known by her stage name '''Syan Blake''', was a British actress, best known for playing [[Frankie Pierre]] on the British television show ''[[EastEnders]]'', appearing in 56 episodes in 1996–97. She later had minor roles in other television shows, before retiring to become a sign language teacher and interpreter.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Blake and her two children were reported missing on 16 December 2015; three weeks later their bodies were found at Blake's home in [[Erith]], London.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; Her partner, Arthur Simpson-Kent, pleaded guilty to the murders and was given a [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales#Whole life order|whole life sentence]] in October 2016.&lt;ref name="whole"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37565626|title=Life sentence for ex-Easteners' actress Sian Blake killer|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=5 October 2016|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Blake was born in [[Walthamstow]], London, in 1972, and attended the [[Guildford School of Acting]]. The youngest of three children, her father was Jamaican.&lt;ref name="BBC profile"/&gt; Her parents divorced when she was six, and her father died from a heart attack when she was eighteen. Adopting the stage name Syan Blake, she landed her first acting role in 1994, playing a [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] patient in that year's [[Casualty (series 9)|Christmas episode]] of ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35241292|title=Sian Blake: Profile of former EastEnders actress|work=BBC News |date=7 January 2016|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a telephone receptionist at a doctor's surgery, Blake landed her most notable role: soul singer [[Frankie Pierre]], a character who appeared in ''[[EastEnders]]'' during 1996 and 1997. She initially auditioned for the minor part of a nurse, but was encouraged to audition for the more long-term role of Frankie after impressing producers. She was initially signed on a six-month contract, but subsequently had her contract extended. One of the character's central storylines involved an affair with a regular male character which ended his on-screen marriage. Blake subsequently said that she left the series after receiving hate mail from viewers who found it difficult to separate fact from fiction.&lt;ref name="frankie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61116063.html|title=I'd go for a married man, even if he had kids, as long as he was right one for me|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|author=Hagan, Angela|date=27 January 1997|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake went on to have roles in ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'', ''[[The Bill]]'' and ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', as well as a second appearance in ''Casualty'', before retiring from acting. She went on to become a sign-language teacher, and interpreter.&lt;ref name="BBC profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jessica|last=Elgot|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|first3=Damien|last3=Gayle|first4=Aletha|last4=Adu|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/05/sian-blake-three-bodies-found-in-hunt-for-missing-former-eastenders-actor|title=Sian Blake: three bodies found in search for ex-EastEnders actor and children|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as television and film, Blake also appeared in and directed several theatre productions. Her acting credits include ''[[Joe Guy (play)|Joe Guy]]'', ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', while directing credits include ''Oxford Street'' at the [[Soho Theatre]] and ''The Burial'' at the [[Almeida Theatre]].&lt;ref name="BBC profile"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Blake lived in [[Erith]], London,&lt;ref name="Remanded"/&gt; with her partner, Arthur Simpson-Kent, and their two sons, Zachary and Amon, who were aged eight and four.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; Blake was diagnosed with terminal [[motor neurone disease]] on 11 December 2015 after first showing neurological symptoms in September 2013.&lt;ref name="Sentencing remarks" /&gt;

==Disappearance and death==
Blake and her two sons went missing on 13 December 2015.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/01/police-woman-missing-london-sian-blake|title=Fears grow for former EastEnders actor missing with two sons|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 January 2016|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Henderson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sian-blake-and-her-two-children-after-they-went-missing-from-north-london-police-appeal-for-a6792656.html|title=Eastenders actor Sian Blake and her two young children feared for after going missing three weeks ago|newspaper=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=1 January 2016|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/missing-sian-blake-murder-squad-7117167|title=Missing Sian Blake: Murder squad take over hunt for EastEnders star who vanished with her children|last=Rockett|first=Karen|author2=Adams, Sam|date=4 January 2016|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December, a family member reported her missing to the [[Metropolitan Police]]. Police interviewed her partner, Arthur Simpson-Kent, the same day, and he went missing three days later.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Her sister said that Blake had wanted to end her relationship with Simpson-Kent "a long time ago".&lt;ref name="Disappearance"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35251552|title=EastEnders actress Sian Blake planned to leave partner, her sister says|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police said that Simpson-Kent was being sought in relation to the deaths; the BBC reported that he was believed to have travelled to [[Ghana]] in December.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; On 9 January a [[Scotland Yard]] spokesman said that [[Ghana Police Service|police in Ghana]] had arrested Simpson-Kent,&lt;ref name="Arrested "&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35273005?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=news_central|title=Sian Blake: Partner arrested in Ghana|work=BBC News |date=9 January 2016|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Johnston|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/09/arthur-simpson-kent-arrested-murder-sian-blake|title=Sian Blake's partner arrested in Ghana over murder of actor and two sons|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 January 2016|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; having travelled there on 19 December; he was remanded for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Remanded"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35292296|title=Sian Blake death: Arthur Simpson-Kent remanded in Ghana|date=12 January 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson-Kent's lawyer, Justice Srem-Sai, claimed that he should be released from prison until official extradition proceedings were underway. Of the legal process, Srem-Sai said that a "person must be released until you have the legal right to detain them. He was not given his full rights, including access to legal counsel. His right to a fair trial is being denied and is still being denied."&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/13/sian-blake-suspect-arthur-simpson-kent-should-be-freed-until-extradition-order|title=Sian Blake murder suspect 'should be freed until extradition order'| work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 January 2016|accessdate=15 January 2016|author=Elgot, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January, Simpson-Kent appeared at an extradition hearing in [[Accra]], where he told the court that he would voluntarily return to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35412127|title=Sian Blake partner 'to return to UK voluntarily' after Ghanaian court hearing|work=BBC News |date=26 January 2016|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson-Kent did return to the UK on 12 February 2016 and was arrested at Heathrow Airport, following which, he was charged with the murder of Blake and their two children.&lt;ref name="Charged"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35561953|title=Sian Blake EastEnders case: Man charged with family murders|date=12 February 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June, Simpson-Kent appeared at the [[Old Bailey]] where he formally entered guilty pleas to the murders of Blake and their two sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36498326|title=Partner admits EastEnders actor Sian Blake murder|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=10 June 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2016, [[Rabinder Singh (judge)|Mr Justice Singh]] sentenced Simpson-Kent to life imprisonment with a whole life order, meaning he will not become eligible for parole and is unlikely to ever be released from prison.&lt;ref name="whole"/&gt;

On 6 January 2016, the Metropolitan Police referred itself to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] over its handling of the inquiry.  Of the referral, the Metropolitan Police said "The Metropolitan Police has today, Wednesday 6 January, made a voluntary referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in relation to the Sian Blake missing person investigation. An initial review has highlighted some potential issues regarding the handling and grading of the missing persons investigation. The Directorate of Professional Standards was informed on Monday, 4 January, and is working with the investigation team to fully understand the timeline of police interaction with the family."&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1617451/met-referred-to-ipcc-over-search-for-sian-blake|title=Met Referred To IPCC Over Search For Sian Blake|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Men sowing   seed (3465701854).jpg|thumb|Men sowing seed by hand in the 1940s]]
'''Sowing''' is the process of planting. An area or object that has had seeds planted in it will be described as being '''sowed'''.

[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|Traditional Sowing Methods]]

==Plants which are usually sown==
Among the major field crops, [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], and [[rye]] are sown, grasses and legumes are seeded and [[maize]] and [[soybean]]s are planted.  In planting, wider rows (generally 75&amp;nbsp; cm (30&amp;nbsp; in) or more) are used, and the intent is to have precise; even spacing between individual seeds in the row, various mechanisms have been devised to count out individual seeds at exact intervals.

===Depth of sowing ===
[[Image:Between corn rows.png|thumb|Regular rows of [[maize|corn]] in a field in Indiana]]

In sowing, little if any soil is placed over the seeds, as seeds can be generally sown into the soil by maintaining a planting depth of about 2-3 times the size of the seed.

===Sowing types and patterns===
For hand sowing, several sowing types exist; these include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4549495/Beds_or_flat-planting_for_southern_wheat_crops|title=Beds or flat-planting for southern wheat crops|first=Farhad|last=Nabin|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flat sowing
* Ridge sowing
* Wide bed sowing

Several patterns for sowing may be used together with these types; these include:
* Regular rows
* Rows that are indented at the even rows (so that the seeds are
* Symmetrical grid pattern – using the pattern described in [[The Garden of Cyrus]] placed in a crossed pattern). This method is much better, as more light may fall on the seedlings as they come out.

==Types of sowing==

===Hand sowing===
'''Hand sowing''' or (planting) is the process of casting handfuls of seed over prepared ground, or broadcasting (from which the [[broadcasting|technological term]] is derived{{fact|date=April 2016}}). Usually, a drag or [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] is employed to incorporate the seed into the soil. Though [[Labor intensity|labor-intensive]] for any but small areas, this method is still used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the desired rate. A hand seeder can be used for sowing, though it is less of a help than it is for the smaller seeds of [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[Fabaceae|legumes]].

[[Image:Horticulture Tray3.jpg|thumb|A tray used in [[horticulture]] (for sowing and taking plant cuttings)]]
Hand sowing may be combined with pre-sowing in [[seed tray]]s. This allows the plants to come to strength indoors during cold periods (e.g. spring in temperate countries).

In [[agriculture]], most seed is now sown using a [[seed drill]], which offers greater precision; seed is sown evenly and at the desired rate. The drill also places the seed at a measured distance below the soil, so that less seed is required. The standard design uses a fluted feed metering system, which is volumetric in nature; individual seeds are not counted. Rows are typically about 10–30&amp;nbsp;cm apart, depending on the [[crop]] species and growing conditions. Several row opener types are used depending on [[soil type]] and local tradition. Grain drills are most often drawn by [[tractor]]s, but can also be pulled by [[horse]]s. [[Pickup truck]]s are sometimes used, since little draft is required.

A seed rate of about 100&amp;nbsp;kg of seed per hectare (2 bushels per acre) is typical, though rates vary considerably depending on crop species, soil conditions, and farmer's preference. Excessive rates can cause the crop to lodge, while too thin a rate will result in poor utilisation of the land, competition with [[weed]]s and a reduction in the [[Crop yield|yield]].

===Open field===
{{Main|Open field system}}
'''Open-field planting''' refers to the form of sowing used historically in the agricultural context whereby [[field (agriculture)|fields]] are prepared generically and left open, as the name suggests, before being sown directly with seed. The seed is frequently left uncovered at the surface of the soil before germinating and therefore exposed to the prevailing [[climate]] and conditions like storms etc. This is in contrast to the [[seedbed]] method used more commonly in domestic [[gardening]] or more specific (modern) agricultural scenarios where the seed is applied beneath the soil surface and monitored and manually tended frequently to ensure more successful growth rates and better yields.

===Pre-treatment of seed and soil before sowing===
[[Image:GrowingAvocadoFromSeed.JPG|thumb|Tropical fruit such as [[avocado]] also benefit from special seed treatments (specifically invented for that particular tropical fruit)]]

Before sowing, certain seeds first require a treatment prior to the sowing process.
This treatment may be seed scarification, [[stratification (botany)|stratification]], seed soaking or seed cleaning with cold (or medium hot) water.

Seed soaking is generally done by placing seeds in medium hot water for at least 24 to up to 48 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ernestina|last=Parziale |url=http://earthnotes.tripod.com/seeds.htm |title=Pre-sowing treatments of seed |publisher=Earthnotes.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seed cleaning is done especially with fruit, as the flesh of the fruit around the seed can quickly become prone to attack from insects or plagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/sprashu.html Sprout safety: how to combat contamination of seed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916114753/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/sprashu.html |date=2008-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed washing is generally done by submerging cleansed seeds 20 minutes in 50 [[Celsius|degree Celsius]] water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Exotische vruchten kweken by Dr Gabriele Lehari&lt;/ref&gt; This (rather hot than moderately hot) water kills any organisms that may have survived on the skin of a seed. Especially with easily infected [[tropical fruit]] such as [[lychee]]s and [[rambutan]]s, seed washing with high-temperature water is vital.

In addition to the mentioned seed pretreatments, [[seed germination]] is also assisted when a disease-free soil is used. Especially when trying to germinate difficult seed (e.g. certain tropical fruit), prior treatment of the soil (along with the usage of the most suitable soil; e.g. [[potting soil]], prepared soil or other [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]s) is vital. The two most used soil treatments are [[pasteurisation]] and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilisation]]. Depending on the necessity, pasteurisation is to be preferred as this does not kill all organisms. Sterilisation can be done when trying to grow truly difficult crops. To pasteurise the soil, the soil is heated for 15 minutes in an oven of 120&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Tu'i Malila''' (1777 – 19 May 1965) was a [[tortoise]] that Captain [[James Cook]] was traditionally said to have given to the royal family of [[Tonga]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robb|first=Joan|year=1971|title=TU'I MALILA, "COOK'S TORTOISE"|jstor=42906170|journal=Records of the Auckland Institute and Museum|volume=8|pages=229–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a female [[radiated tortoise]] (''Geochelone radiata'') from [[Madagascar]] and is the longest-lived tortoise whose age has been verified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The name means ''king Malila'' in the [[Tongan language]]. Tu'i Malila was hatched around 1777&lt;ref&gt;http://www.captcook-ne.co.uk,&lt;/ref&gt; and then given by Captain Cook to the Tongan royal family upon his visit to Tonga in July 1777.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captcook-ne.co.uk/ccne/timeline/voyage3.htm|title=Captain Cook Timeline – Third Voyage 1776 – 1780|publisher=Captain Cook Birthplace Museum|accessdate=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, [[George Tupou I]] obtained her from a vessel which called in Haapai in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Zoology/Zoology-idx?type=turn&amp;id=Zoology.GINYZooSoc&amp;entity=Zoology.GINYZooSoc.p0015&amp;isize=text|title=Madison Zoological Museum Collection: Bulletin - New York Zoological Society: [An account of the reptiles inhabiting the Galápagos Islands]|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tu'i Malila remained in their care until death on 19 May 1965 due to [[natural causes]].

'''William Bradley''' (1758&amp;ndash;13 March 1833) was a British naval officer and [[cartographer]] who was one of the officers who participated in the [[First Fleet]] to [[Australia]]. During this expedition, Bradley undertook extensive surveys and became one of the first of the settlers to establish relations with the [[Indigenous Australians|aborigines]], with whom he struck up a dialogue and whose customs and nature he studied extensively. He later however fell out with his aboriginal contacts and instead undertook a mission to gather food which ended with an eleven-month stay on [[Norfolk Island]] after a shipwreck.

Bradley's later career was overshadowed by his steadily deteriorating mental state. Although a successful small ship commander, Bradley became increasingly erratic and was eventually retired as a result. A few years later, suffering serious mental problems, Bradley committed a highly unusual case of postal fraud and was ultimately exiled. He never returned to Britain but lived in quiet disgrace in [[France]].

==Early career==
Bradley was born on 14 November 1758 in Portsmouth, a great nephew of the [[Astronomer Royal]] [[James Bradley]]. His family was closely associated with the [[Royal Naval Academy]] and both his younger brother James and his father John Bradley served on the faculty. Bradley entered the [[Royal Navy]] in 1772, and served on a rapid succession of ships before becoming [[lieutenant]] in 1778.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He continued in service aboard {{HMS|Lenox|1758|6}}, {{HMS|Aldborough|1756|6}}, {{HMS|Mermaid|1761|6}}, {{HMS|Rippon|1758|6}}, {{HMS|Prothee|1780|6}}, {{HMS|Phaeton|1782|6}} and {{HMS|Ariadne|1776|6}} until 1786, when he joined {{HMS|Sirius|1786|6}}. His service during the [[American Revolutionary War]] was not significant, but Bradley was attached on the ''Sirius'' to the [[First Fleet]] destined to colonise [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010134b.htm Bradley, William (1757 - 1833)], ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', Janet D.

==Service in Australia==
[[File:First Fleet entering Sydney 1788 Bradley.jpg|thumb|First Fleet Entering Port Jackson, by William Bradley, [http://digital.sl.nsw.gov.au/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?embedded=true&amp;toolbar=false&amp;dps_pid=FL1113928 Safe 1 / 14 Op p.65]]]During 1788, Bradley did not involve himself directly in colonial affairs, but instead joined [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|John Hunter]] in extensive operations along the [[Sydney Harbour]] coastline. The two men were often away from the colony for extended periods, conducting surveys of the coastline and the lands around.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D.

A keen note-taker and sketcher, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journals_of_the_First_Fleet#William_Bradley Bradley compiled a journal which begins in 1786] with the organisation of the fleet from Deptford and records the voyage to Australia. It describes ports, ships passed, the weather, as well as difficulties on board. Bradley also recounts his impressions of the colony as well as his interest in Aboriginal people and natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D.

[[File:SLNSW 868573 William Bradley Journal titled A Voyage to New South Wales December 1786 May 1792 compiled 1802.jpg|thumb|[http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314966 Journal by William Bradley] held by the [[State Library of New South Wales]], Safe 1 / 14 Op p.65]]

In October 1788, Bradley joined a six-month [[circumnavigation]] of the globe to collect supplies for the colony from the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Returning in March 1789, Bradley worked on the repair of ''Sirius'', combined with further survey and more observations of the aborigines. During this time, Bradley developed a strong antipathy for the aborigines due to unknown reasons and was involved in the November 1789 raid which captured [[Colbee]] and [[Bennelong]], a job he found extremely unpleasant.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D. Hine, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-william-1820 'Bradley, William (1757–1833)'], Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, ''Sirius'' and {{HMS|Supply|1759|6}} were dispatched to [[Norfolk Island]] in search of better food supplies. At Norfolk Island, the Sirius was caught in a storm and wrecked. Marooned on the island, Bradley his crew conducted extensive surveys of the land during the eleven months spent there. In 1791, Bradley and others returned to [[Port Jackson]] and from there took a ship to the [[Philippines]] and then to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The ships arrived in 1792 and the crews were court-martialled for the loss of ''Sirius'', but honourably acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D. Hine, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-william-1820 'Bradley, William (1757–1833)'], Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Bradley was promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|master and commander]] in 1791, and in 1793 was given the [[fire ship]] {{HMS|Comet|1783|6}} as part of the [[Channel Fleet]] under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]]. In May 1794, a year after the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], Howe's fleet began the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], chasing a French grain convoy deep into the Atlantic. The campaign concluded with the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], where Howe's fleet defeated an equally sized French force but failed to stop the convoy. Bradley acted as a signal repeater during the campaign, relaying Howe's signals to the large fleet. He performed so well at this duty that he was promoted to [[post-captain]] in the aftermath of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D. Hine, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-william-1820 'Bradley, William (1757–1833)'], Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley soon took command of the [[frigate]] {{HMS|Cambrian|1797|6}} and served in her on the [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]] station for the next eight years. He returned to Britain in 1802 on the [[Peace of Amiens]] and in 1805 took command of the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Plantagenet|1801|6}}. In neither of Bradley's commands did he perform any significant or notable service, remaining on convoy and blockade duties. In 1809 however, Bradley suffered the first of his increasingly severe mental disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D. Hine, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-william-1820 'Bradley, William (1757–1833)'], Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental illness==
Removed from service by his illness, Bradley later joined the [[Impressment|impress]] unit at [[Cowes]], but in 1812 again suffered a mental breakdown, and was retired as a rear-admiral. Two years later, Bradley suffered personal disaster when he was caught involved in a minor attempt to defraud the postal authorities. Arrested and brought before the [[Winchester]] [[Assizes]], his conduct was noted as being highly unusual, but this was not taken into account initially and he was stripped of his rank and pension and sentenced to death. Appeals from his family later brought about a reduction of sentence, firstly to [[penal transportation|transportation]] and subsequently [[exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet D. Hine, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-william-1820 'Bradley, William (1757–1833)'], Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retiring to [[Le Havre]], [[France]] in 1816, Bradley devoted the sane hours of his life to a series of inventions designed to easily calculate [[longitude]]. He hoped that by inventing such a device, the Admiralty might be persuaded to reverse his sentence and permit him to return to Britain.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; This never occurred, and attempts by his family to get the sentence repealed on the grounds of his insanity were equally fruitless. Bradley finally gave up these efforts after years of failure and died in France, a recluse, in March 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D. Hine, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bradley-william-1820 'Bradley, William (1757–1833)'], Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 30 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley left three daughters and a son. His wife described him as 'a kind husband and affectionate father', but fellow officers often considered him disagreeable and aloof.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He left behind a large body of work on the coasts and aborigines of the [[Sydney]] area which is still available in the [[State Library of New South Wales]]. This work includes, surveys, charts, personal observations and sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Janet D.

His name is commemorated in the name of [[Bradleys Head]].

The '''Xindi''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɪ|n|d|i}} is the collective term for six [[Fantasy tropes and conventions#Sentient "races"|fictional races]] in the [[science fiction]] [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''. The entire [[Star Trek: Enterprise#Season 3|third season]], broadcast in 2003 to 2004, centered on this group of previously unknown aliens. They are native to the [[planet]] Xindus in a region of [[outer space|space]] known as the [[List of Star Trek regions of space#Delphic Expanse|Delphic Expanse]]. They consist of five species resembling familiar Earth animals (a rarity for alien races in ''Star Trek'') and a sixth resembling humans. At first they appeared as violent enemies wanting no interaction with humanity, but common ground gradually emerged as the crew of the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' discovered that the Xindi were being manipulated into this enmity by their Guardians. Some Xindi became important recurring characters as the 24-episode story arc unfolded.

During the thirteenth live-action film in the series, ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'', the Xindi were mentioned along with the [[Romulans]] as aliens that humanity fought wars against in the years leading up to the formation of the Federation. Their defeat and eventual alliance was the cause behind Edison's mutiny against the Federation, leading him to become the villain Krall.

==First appearance==
The Xindi's presence was established in the second-season finale of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'', [[The Expanse (Star Trek episode)|"The Expanse"]], in which the Xindi launched a probe that attacked [[Earth in fiction|Earth]] in April, 2153, killing seven million people in a strip of destruction stretching from [[Florida]] to [[Venezuela]]. They appeared again in the third-season premiere, "[[The Xindi]]", to play a major role in the primary story arc of season three.

==Xindi history==
{{see also|Star Trek: Enterprise (season 3)}}
The Xindi are a collective of six different intelligent species which evolved simultaneously on the same planet (Xindus). Despite the radically different appearance of all six species, they all share identical ridges on their cheekbones, and have very similar DNA. All six of these species were involved in a war lasting about 100 years and ending in the 2030s. Alliances among the Xindi species were forged and changed continuously throughout the war, so much that 50–60 years into the war, most Xindi forgot what started it. However, everyone remembered how it ended. In an act of desperation, the Insectoids and Reptilians detonated several charges beneath the eight largest seismic fissures of the geologically-unstable planet Xindus, leading to its destruction and ultimately the extinction of the Avian race.

After the war, the Xindi scattered throughout the Expanse into several [[colony|colonies]]. As a whole, they have a passionate desire to establish a new homeworld and unify all Xindi, but differ greatly on how to accomplish this and on who should hold the ultimate reins of power. The Xindi then spent the early part of 2153 deciding how to confront the threat of humanity and planned a [[biological weapon]] based on the human genetic profile. This was ultimately rejected by the Xindi Council (the Reptilians went along with the bio weapon but were eventually foiled) and so they worked on a weapon to blow up Earth. (They technically succeeded, however that timeline was undone.)

===Sphere Builders===
The Xindi were actually pawns in the [[Temporal Cold War]], as interference in their history began shortly after the ending of their civil war, with the appearance of a trans-dimensional alien race, who guided them to new homelands and resources. The Xindi came to revere these "Guardians", whom they later understood to be the same species as the "Sphere Builders". These aliens were also similarly revered by the Triannon, who believed that deities, who they called "The Makers," constructed the spheres to transform the expanse into a paradise. This led to a devastating religious civil war, as seen in the episode "[[Chosen Realm]]".

The Xindi were also informed by the Guardians, at least as early as 2152, that they would be victims of a [[genocide|genocidal]] attack from humans in the 26th century. Following their guidance, the Xindi launched a pre-emptive test strike on Earth as a precursor to a devastating second attack. In [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Daniels|Daniels]]' timeline, Xindi crewmen serve in the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] in the 26th century, in a battle with humans and Xindi against the Sphere Builders. With the help of Captain Archer's evidence of the future cooperation, the Xindi Council began to split over the issue of whether the Guardians were the real enemy or not. The split widened when Reptilian Council Member [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Dolim|Dolim]] killed Primate Council Member [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Degra|Degra]].

With the help of the Guardians, the Reptilians and Insectoids then took control of the finished Xindi weapon and set on a course for Earth, thus triggering a new [[civil war]]. A combined fleet of Arboreals, Primates and Aquatics pursued the weapon. En route to Earth, a rift appeared in the Reptilian-Insectoid alliance when the Insectoids proposed delaying the destruction of Earth in light of Archer's revelation about the true nature of the Sphere Builders. The Reptilians, determined to see the task completed, eliminated the accompanying Insectoid vessel. Arriving near Earth, an [[Andorian]] vessel, commanded by [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Thy'lek Shran|Shran]], suddenly destroyed the Reptilian vessel, allowing humans to board the Xindi weapon and destroy it. At the same time, ''Enterprise'' was able to destroy the entire sphere network, stopping the spatial anomalies. With the Sphere Builder threat ended, the Xindi Council reconvened (the Reptilians were eventually convinced to return), and the Xindi abandoned their belief in the Guardians, and their hostile intent toward humans.

==Xindi species==

===Xindi-Aquatics===
Xindi-Aquatics resemble Earth [[sirenia]]ns, swimming underwater and speaking through [[animal echolocation|echolocation]]. Aquatics have a reputation for taking a very long time to make a decision, but are more readily convinced by visual evidence. The Xindi have a saying, "It's easier to count the stars than it is for an Aquatic to reach a decision." The appearance of the Aquatics in the series was inspired by the [[Mosasaurus]].

Even though the Aquatics are peaceful, they have a strong military. Their warships resemble large Earth [[manta ray]]s and are filled with water. However, there is at least one section of the ship that is sealed and filled with air for land-based races. This room also has a window so the visitors can communicate with the Aquatic crew. Aquatic vessels can emit a field that disrupts targeting scanners. This can also be applied to protect other ships. However, their ships are very slow and cannot travel much faster than Warp 2. Aquatic ships also carry extremely powerful weapons and are more than a match for Insectoid and Reptilian ships. Aquatic warships are huge and one of them was depicted carrying the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise NX-01]]'' to Earth inside a chamber within the vessel after the Xindi weapon was destroyed.

===Xindi-Arboreals===
Xindi-Arboreals are covered with [[hair]], and resemble Earth [[sloth]]s. They run kemocite-production facilities throughout the Delphic Expanse. [[List of Star Trek characters (G–M)#G|Gralik]], a Xindi-Arboreal, gave [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Degra|Degra]] a shipment of impure kemocite, to sabotage production of the Council's weapon [[prototype]]. They have shown the least interest in destroying humanity. Arboreals are also afraid of the water. They are well known as scientists. [[Jannar]] was a friend of [[Degra]] and an ally of [[Jonathan Archer|Captain Archer]].
{{clear}}

===Xindi-Avians===
Xindi-Avians were [[bird]]like Xindi with the ability to fly, although all that is ever seen of this species is a single skull, identical to that of a [[giraffe]]. They once darkened the skies of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld. They are thought to be extinct since the Reptilians and Insectoids planted explosives that destroyed the Xindi homeworld after the Hundred-Year War. The Avians, having primitive technology, could not leave the planet and were wiped out. Because of this, the Reptilians say that their lair, in which the Xindi Council now convenes, has a "stench of failure."

===Xindi-Insectoids===
Xindi-Insectoids resemble a cross between six-foot Earth [[Mantis|praying mantids]], [[fly|flies]] and [[ant]]s. Insectoids have an [[Life expectancy|average life span]] of 10–12 years. They reproduce [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]] by laying [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, which take about a week to mature. Egg sacs are suspended from ceilings, and tubules connected to them spray chemicals that cause passers-by to reverse-[[Imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on the hatchlings, protecting them as a [[parent]] would. Hatchlings are so important to Insectoids that hatcheries aboard starships are heavily shielded. As seen in episode "[[Hatchery (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Hatchery]]", the Insectoid crew will sacrifice themselves to preserve their unborn offspring.

They speak a clicking [[language]], of which there are 67 known dialects. [[Insectoid]] [[iconography]] is radically different from that of other Xindi. Insectoid personal names get longer with age. Insectoids have a reputation for rushing into decisions. Insectoid starships are designed differently from other vessels. They don't have one area designated for bridge duties; command functions are distributed throughout the ship. Insectoid chairs and assault vehicles are designed for Insectoid anatomy and not humanoids. They have a long-standing alliance with the Reptilians and together they destroyed the Xindi homeworld after the Hundred-Year War.

===Xindi-Primates===
Xindi-Primates resemble Earth [[human]]s and have a similar brain structure to the Xindi-Reptilians. They were one of the first Xindi species (including the Reptilians) to be informed of the "threat" posed by humanity. Degra, a Xindi-Primate, was assigned to develop the weapon which was to destroy Earth. In late 2153, the crew of the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' boarded and studied a Primate's vessel and interrogated the crew. In the episode "[[Stratagem (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Stratagem]]", Archer learned from Degra that a colony of Primates resides on [[Azati Prime]], where the weapon was being constructed. Like humans, Xindi-Primates have differences in skin tone.  The chairman of the Xindi council was a Xindi-Primate.
{{clear}}

===Xindi-Reptilians===
Xindi-Reptilians resemble a cross between several Earth [[lizard]]s. This species is responsible for a preemptive attack on Earth in 2153. Aided by trans-dimensional beings, the Reptilians also traveled to 2004 to collect [[blood]] samples for their bio-weapon in the future but were foiled by [[Jonathan Archer]] and [[T'Pol]]. Reptilians prefer to be low to the ground, as opposed to high-rise buildings. They use weapons with regenerative biometric power cells that overload if another species tries to use them. They use thermal chambers on board their ships to keep their energy. They are the most aggressive race of Xindi and seem to be more interested than the other races in destroying Earth. The military leadership of the Reptilians appear to be obsessed with [[eugenics]].  The Xindi-Insectoids are the race that the Reptilians are closest to.  Along with the Insectoids, they are responsible for the destruction of the Xindi homeworld. The attack squadrons seen at [[Azati Prime]] consisted of two Reptilian ships and two Insectoid ships. Commander [[Dolim]] was the Xindi-Reptilian representative on the Council.

==Xindi Council==
The Xindi Council is the joint [[government]]al body of the Xindi races, as seen Season three of ''Star Trek: Enterprise''. The Council was formed after the destruction of the Xindi homeworld Xindus in the 2030s. It consists of two representatives of each of the Xindi species, and was formed to find a new homeworld for all the Xindi races. However, although they found a few suitable planets, they could never agree on a final choice. The Council chamber is located on a planet 15.6 [[light-year]]s from Azati Prime. The land-based races sit at a large round table in the center of the room, while the Aquatics look on from a large tank adjoining the chamber by a window. The chamber has built-in equipment for holographics and a viewscreen for telemetry. The chamber itself was actually a stronghold built by the Xindi-Avians before they were wiped out.

Circa 2152, the council discovered that humans were going to destroy them in four hundred years. In a panic, they assigned the Primate scientist, Degra, to construct a weapon to destroy Earth. After a number of disagreements, the Council was dissolved. In order to do the Sphere Builders' bidding, the Reptilians and Insectoids broke away from the Primates, Arboreals, and eventually the Aquatics. [[Civil war]] ultimately broke out when Commander Dolim killed Degra. After Dolim was killed, the Sphere Builders were discredited, the super-weapon destroyed, and the Council reconvened. The names of council representatives as revealed in "[[The Council (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Council]]" were:
*Arboreals: [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Jannar|Jannar]]
*Aquatics: Kiaphet Amman'sor
*Insectoids: unknown- (most Xindi Insectoid names are unpronounceable by humans; called "Shrest" in the novelizations&lt;ref&gt;''The Expanse'' by J.M. Dillard, the novelization of Star Trek: Enterprise episodes "The Expanse" and "The Xindi".&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Primates: The Chairman, [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Degra|Degra]]
*Reptilians: [[regiment]]al commander [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Dolim|Dolim]]
