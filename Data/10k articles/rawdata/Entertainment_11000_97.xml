[[Image:Aquarium - dried food2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Various types of prepared fish food]]
'''Aquarium fish feed''' is [[plant]] or [[animal]] material intended for consumption by pet [[fish]] kept in [[aquariums]] or [[ponds]]. Fish foods normally contain [[Macronutrient (nutrition)|macronutrients]], trace [[Micronutrient|elements]] and [[vitamins]] necessary to keep captive fish in good health. Approximately 80% of [[fishkeeping]] hobbyists feed their fish exclusively prepared foods that most commonly are produced in flake, pellet or tablet form.&lt;ref name="baensch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Riehl |first=Rüdiger. Editor. |author2=Baensch, HA |title=Aquarium Atlas |year=1996 |edition=5th |publisher=Tetra Press |location=Germany |isbn=3-88244-050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pelleted forms, some of which sink rapidly, are often used for larger fish or bottom feeding species such as [[loaches]] or [[catfish]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Some fish foods also contain additives such as [[sex hormones]] or [[beta carotene]] to artificially enhance the color of ornamental fish.

==Prepared foods==
Prepared foods are those foods that are non-living and are made by the aquarist or bought already prepared for consumption for fish.&lt;ref name=axelrod&gt;{{cite book|title=Exotic Tropical Fishes|last=Axelrod|first=Herbert R.|authorlink=Herbert R. Axelrod|publisher=T.F.H. Publications|year=1996|isbn=0-87666-543-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry foods===
Flake food is a type of proprietary or artificially manufactured [[fish]] food consumed by a wide variety of tropical and saltwater fish and [[invertebrate]]s. It is ideally suited to top dwellers and mid-water fish though numerous bottom dwelling species consume flake food once it has settled on the bottom. Flake food is baked to remove moisture, ensuring a longer shelf life.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Generally the more moisture a particular example of fish food contains, the more readily it will deteriorate in quality.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Dry foods are also available as [[Pelletizing|pellets]], sticks, tablets, [[:wikt:granule|granules]], and [[wafers]], manufactured to float or sink, depending on the species they are designed to feed.

===Vacation food===
Vacation foods, also known as "food blocks" (or "weekend blocks" for smaller versions), are designed to be placed inside the aquarium to forgo feeding while the owner is absent.  These blocks release small amounts of food as they dissolve. Food blocks can be a good choice for smaller tropical fish, but can pollute the water if the tank is neglected for too long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loveoffish.com/vacation.html fish care when you are away]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicated fishfood===
Medicated fishfood is a safe and effective method to deliver medication to fish. One advantage is that medicated food does not contaminate the aquatic environment and also, unlike [[bath treatment (fishkeeping)|bath treatments]], does not negatively affect fish, filtration and [[algae]] growth in the [[aquarium]]. The parasites will get treated spot on by medicated food, because the fish is ingesting it.

===Freeze-dried and frozen fish diets===
Freeze-dried and frozen fish foods were primarily developed for tropical and marine fish and are useful in providing variety to the diet or specialist feeding needs of some species.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} These include [[tubifex|tubifex worms]], [[mosquito|mosquito larvae]], [[Chironomidae#Behavior and description|bloodworms]], [[water flea]]s (''[[Daphnia]]'' and ''[[Cyclops (genus)|Cyclops]]'' spp.) along with [[brine shrimp]] (''[[Artemia salina]]'').

===Frozen fish food===
Perishable food can be preserved by frozen storage, and is often sold in blister packs or resealable packets. These can contain a variety of ingredients such as bloodworms, ''Daphnia'', or brine shrimp, and are commonly used to feed such fish as [[Discus (fish)|''Discus'']] which require a high protein diet. Often fed on beef heart fish food within the aquaculture industry, the discus fish are not the only fish which can benefit from a high quality prepared frozen mixture such as beef heart, although by far these are the fish most associated with this particular frozen food. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Live foods==
Live fish food include [[earthworm]]s, [[sludge worm]]s, [[water flea]]s, [[Chironomidae#Behavior and description|bloodworm]]s, and [[feeder fish]]. Food for [[larva]]e and young fish include [[infusoria]] ([[Protozoa]] and other [[microorganisms]]), newly hatched brine shrimp and [[Panagrellus redivivus|microworms]]. These are the most preferred type of food for fishes,but are difficult to get. However, freeze dried forms of earthworms, tubifex etc. are available now.

==Ingredients of quality fish food==

Fish food should ideally provide the fish with fat (for energy) and amino acids (building blocks of proteins) and the fish food (whether flake or pellet) must be speedily digested in order to prevent buildup of intestinal gas, renal failure and infections (such as swim bladder problems and dropsy) and  to avoid aquarium pollution due to excessive ammonia.  Aquatic diets for carnivores must contain vegetable matter such as spirulina.

=== Building block ingredients of fish food ===

*[[Amino acids]] are the basic components of proteins. Protein requirements vary according to species. Carnivorous fish need a greater percentage of proteins than herbivorous. An example of an aquatic diet that is a good source of amino acid is a crumbled hard boiled egg offered to small [[:wikt:fry#Etymology 2|fry]].   Large amounts of [[DL-Methionine]] enhance the headgrowth of the [[Lionhead (goldfish)|Lionhead]] [[goldfish]].
*[[Fat]]s that are broken down into [[fatty acids]] are the main source of energy in fish especially for the heart and skeletal muscles.  Fats also assist in vitamin absorption.  Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble or can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats.
*[[Carbohydrates]] are molecular substances that include sugars, starches, gums and [[cellulose]]s. Most of the carbohydrates that are incorporated into aquatic diets are of plant origin and are sources of the enzyme [[amylase]].  Carbohydrates, however, are not a superior energy source for fish over protein or fat but digestible carbohydrates do spare protein for tissue building. Unlike in mammals, [[glycogen]] is not a significant storage depot of energy in fish.

=== Sources of fish food ===

*[[Fish meal]] (protein source) have two basic types: (a) those produced from fishery wastes associated with the processing of fish for human consumption (such as salmon and tuna) and (b) those from specific fish (herring, menhaden and pollack) which are harvested solely for the purpose of producing fish meal.
*[[Shrimp mix]] (shrimp meal) is made from cull shrimp that are being processed before freezing or from whole shrimp that is not of suitable quality for human consumption. The material to be made into shrimp meal is dried (sun-dried or by using a dryer) and then ground.   Shrimp meal is a source of pigments that enhances the desirable color in the tissues of fish.   It is also a secondary supplemental protein source for fish.
*[[Squid meal]] is made from squid viscera portions from cannery plants including the eggs and testis.  Squid Meal is a highly digestible protein source for fish which provides a full range of amino acids, vitamins, minerals and cholesterol (1.0–1.5%) of cholesterol suitable for fish fry and young fish.
*[[Brine shrimp]] (adult ''[[Artemia]]'') is a common food source for fish that are available in adult-form, as eggs or freeze-dried.   Brine shrimp is a source of protein, carotene (a color enhancer) and acts as a natural laxative in fish digestive systems.  Brine shrimps can also supply the fish with vegetable matter due to their consumption of algae.
*[[Soybean meal]] is a high protein source for fish and has become a substitute for traditionally-used marine animal meals.
*[[Spirulina (genus)|Spirulina]] is a blue-green plant plankton rich in raw protein, vitamins A, B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, C and E, beta-carotene, color enhancing pigments, a whole range of minerals, essential fatty acids and eight amino acids required for complete nutrition.
*[[Whole wheat]] (carbohydrates) is not the best source of energy in fish but is an excellent source of [[roughage]] for fish such as Goldfish and [[Koi]].  It is also a natural source of vitamin E which promotes growth and enhances coloration.

[[File:Peter Cook Beyond the Fringe 1962.JPG|thumb|[[Peter Cook]] ]]
'''''Beyond the Fringe''''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedy]] stage revue written and performed by [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Alan Bennett]], and [[Jonathan Miller]]. It played in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] and then in America, both on tour and on [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the early 1960s. Hugely successful, it is widely regarded as seminal to the "[[satire boom]]", the rise of [[Satire|satirical]] comedy in 1960s Britain.

==The show==
The idea, of bringing together the best of revues by the [[Cambridge Footlights]] and [[The Oxford Revue]], both of which had transferred to [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe Festival]] for short runs in previous years, was conceived of, in 1960, by an Oxford graduate, [[Robert Ponsonby]], artistic director for the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]. [[Johnny Bassett|John Bassett]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huBWhAEz220 16 November 1979] [[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]] [[Peter Cook]]&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of Wadham College, Oxford, who was Ponsonby's assistant, recommended [[Dudley Moore]], his jazz bandmate and a rising cabaret talent. Moore in turn recommended [[Alan Bennett]], who had had a hit at Edinburgh a few years before. Bassett also chose [[Jonathan Miller]], who had been a Footlights star in 1957.  Miller recommended Cook.

Bennett and Miller were already pursuing careers in academia and medicine respectively, but Cook had an agent, having written a [[West End theatre|West End]] revue for [[Kenneth Williams]]. Cook's agent negotiated a higher weekly fee for him, but by the time the agent's fee was deducted Cook actually earned less than the others from the initial run.

The majority of the sketches were by Cook and were largely based on material written for other revues. Among the entirely new material were "The End of the World", "TVPM" and "The Great Train Robbery". Cook and Moore revived some of the sketches on their later television and stage shows, most famously the [[two-hander]] "[[One Leg Too Few]]".

The show's runs in Edinburgh and the provinces had a lukewarm response, but when the revue transferred to the [[Fortune Theatre]] in London, in a revised production by [[Donald Albery]] and [[William Donaldson]], it became a sensation, thanks in some part to a favourable review by [[Kenneth Tynan]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter ''That Was Satire That Was'', pp. 122–23; Tynan's review is extensively quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 the show transferred to the [[John Golden Theatre]] in New York, with its original cast. President [[John F. Kennedy]] attended a performance on 10 February 1963. The show continued in New York, with most of the original cast, until 1964, when [[Paxton Whitehead]] replaced Miller, while the London version continued with a different cast until 1966.

==Controversy==
The revue was widely considered to be ahead of its time, both in its unapologetic willingness to debunk figures of authority, and by virtue of its inherently surrealistic comedic vein. Humiliation of authority was something only previously delved into in ''[[The Goon Show]]'' and, arguably, ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', with such parliamentarians as [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] coming under special scrutiny — although the BBC were predisposed to frown upon it. Macmillan — according to Cook — was not particularly fond of the slurred caricature and charade of senile forgetfulness (marked by a failure to pronounce 'Conservative Party' coherently) handed down on him in Cook's impersonation. Since ''Beyond the Fringe'' was not owned by the BBC, however, the quartet enjoyed relative carte blanche. The only protocol they were obliged to adhere to was that their scripts be sent to the [[Lord Chamberlain]] for approval prior to performance. This requirement was abolished in 1968.

Most specifically, its lampooning of the British war effort in a sketch titled "The Aftermyth of the War" was scorned by some war veterans for its supposed insensitivity.{{fact|date=June 2016}} One British visitor to the Broadway performance was said to have stood up and shouted 'rotters!' at a sketch he found distasteful, before apparently sitting down again and enjoying the remainder of the show, while another, at the first performance in Edinburgh allegedly stood up and declared that the 'young bounders don't know the first thing about it!' and promptly left the auditorium.{{fact|date=June 2016}} In response to these negative audience reactions, the ''Beyond the Fringe'' team insisted that they were not ridiculing the efforts of those involved in the war, but were challenging the subsequent media portrayal of them.

== Influence ==
''Beyond the Fringe'' was a forerunner to British television programmes ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'', ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.&lt;ref name="Yapp2008"&gt;{{Cite web

As with the established comedy revue, it was a series of [[satire|satirical]] sketches and musical pieces using a minimal set, looking at events of the day. It effectively represented the views and disappointments of the first generation of British people to grow up after [[World War II]], and gave voice to a sense of the loss of national purpose with the end of the [[British Empire]]. Although all of the cast contributed material, the most often quoted pieces were those by Cook, many of which had appeared before in his Cambridge [[Footlights]] revues. The show broke new ground with Peter Cook's impression of then Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]]; on one occasion, this was performed with Macmillan in the audience, and Cook added an ''ad lib'' ridiculing Macmillan for turning up to watch. In 2006, Jonathan Miller recounted that the breach of decorum this represented was a source of embarrassment to both audience and performers.

The show is credited with giving many other performers the courage to be satirical and more improvisational in their manner, and broke the conventions of not lampooning the Royal Family or the government of the day. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]an drama was another target of their comedy. There were also a number of musical items in the show, using Dudley Moore's music, most famously an arrangement of the [[Colonel Bogey March]] which resists Moore's repeated attempts to bring it to an end.

The show prefigured the [[Satire Boom]] of the 1960s. Without it, there might not have been either ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' or ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'', the satirical magazine which originated at the same time, that partially survived due to financial support from Peter Cook, and that served as the model for the later American ''[[Spy Magazine]]''.  Cook and Moore formed a comedy team and appeared in the popular television show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]'', and the 1967 film ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]''.  Cook also launched his club, [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]], around this time.  Many of the members of [[Monty Python]] recall being inspired by ''Beyond the Fringe''.

The retrospective show ''Before the Fringe'', broadcast during the early years of [[BBC 2]], took its title from this production.  It consisted of performances of material that was popular in theatrical revue before the advent of ''Beyond the Fringe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=274239|title = Before the Fringe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Success==

The show's success was not limited to the UK. In 1962, it also opened in South Africa. Next it arrived in the US. First the Broadway Company opened on 27 October 1962, then it was performed by the National Company in 1963. Subsequently, opening on 8 October 1964, the National Touring Company took it on a nationwide tour for six months as ''Beyond the Fringe '65'' under the auspices of Alexander H. Cohen, with the cast consisting of Robert Cessna, Donald Cullen, [[Joel Fabiani]], and [[James Valentine (actor)|James Valentine]]. Slight changes were made to adapt the show for American audiences, for instance the opening number (discussing America) was retitled "Home Thoughts from Abroad".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond The Fringe" Playbill, Ethel Barrymore Theatre, N.Y., 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was revived in slightly altered form in Los Angeles in 2000 and 2001 by Joseph Dunn's ReEstablishment Theater to critical acclaim.

==Legacy==

All four original members of Beyond the Fringe feature prominently in the play ''[[Pete and Dud: Come Again]]'', by Chris Bartlett and [[Nick Awde]], although performed by other actors. Appropriately, the comedy drama had a sellout run at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe before transferring to London's West End at The Venue, in 2006, in a version starring [[Kevin Bishop]] as Moore, [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Cook, [[Fergus Craig]] as Alan Bennett and [[Colin Hoult]] as Jonathan Miller. It subsequently embarked on a nationwide tour. Most recently, Beyond the Fringe was recreated for an episode of the [[Netflix]] TV series [[The_Crown_(TV_series)|The Crown]] in which Prime Minister [[Harold_Macmillan|Macmillan]] is attendance, and singled out for abuse by [[Peter Cook]] (performed by Patrick Warner.) The creation, performance and aftermath of the show is covered in the 2004 film [[Not Only But Always]].

'''''Bloodline Champions''''' ('''''BLC''''') is a free-to-play [[action game]] developed by the Swedish company Stunlock Studios. ''Bloodline Champions'' won both "Game of the Year" and "Winner XNA" in the [[Swedish Game Awards]] 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2009.gameawards.se/news/winners-winners-winners/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831003246/http://2009.gameawards.se/news/winners-winners-winners/ |archivedate=2010-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http://plaskis.se/wp/2009/06/16/studenter-fran-hogskolan-i-skovde-vann-swedish-game-awards/&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;swap=1&lt;/ref&gt; The game officially launched in the United States on January 13, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodlinechampions.com/news.php?id%3D7929 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116171629/http://www.bloodlinechampions.com/news.php?id=7929 |archivedate=2011-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual successor to the game, ''[[Battlerite]]'', created by the same developer Stunlock Studios, was released as a [[free-to-play]] game on November 7, 2017.

The players in this game are split up into two teams (Warm and Cold) with up to five players per team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wakoopa.com/software/bloodline-champions#more |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131120355/http://wakoopa.com/software/bloodline-champions |archivedate=2010-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is different depending on the game mode, ranging from team deathmatch and capture-the-flag to map point control.

==Gameplay==
{{Gameplay|date=January 2016}}

Main features:
* 100% skill based game play, no random elements. You can see the match statistics to see exactly what skills were used and what damage it did
* Team-based arena-style player vs. player (PvP) gameplay
* Three different game modes: Arena (known as team deathmatch in other games), Capture The Artifact (aka Capture The Flag) and Conquest (map control point game mode)
* Solo and Team Matchmaking, supporting 2v2 and 3v3 brackets
* Also supports game creating and joining, using a "lobby" system
* Rounds are fast-paced, last 2 minutes in matchmaking games and they are best of 5 to determine the overall winner and undetermined amount on custom games
* Purely skill-based: there is no targeting, no random damage and no "critical" hits; every ability requires aiming
* Instead of using mana as in other similar games, Bloodline Champions uses cooldowns which have to be managed effectively
* Top-down view of the arena, mouse and keyboard controls, VOIP chat, Observer view when dead or observing

There are four categories of bloodlines (character archetypes): melee attack, ranged attack, healer, and tank.  There are currently 26 bloodlines, with six or seven in each category. Stunlock Studios have announced that they are working on new bloodlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlinechampions.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f%3D45%26t%3D12943 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504024406/http://www.bloodlinechampions.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&amp;t=12943 |archivedate=2011-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each bloodline has seven abilities, two of which have an EX version, an enhanced version of the ability. Each has its own cooldown, as well as triggering short global cooldowns. The seventh ability is an "ultimate" ability that may only be used after gaining sufficient energy through executing other abilities successfully, such as healing allies, damaging enemies, and otherwise helping your team.

Bloodlines also have HP (Health Points) - when the champion runs out of HP, the champion dies, removing it from combat until the end of the round. Each champion also has two items that grant additional abilities. The Bloodline Medallion allows a champion to recover an increasing amount of HP over a period of time and Resurrect revives nearby fallen teammates. Both items require a significant amount of uninterrupted time to prepare, which makes them impractical in immediate combat. In Conquest and Capture The Artifact modes resurrection skill has been replaced with warp skill that allows you to warp a short distance every 20 seconds.

The controls in Bloodline Champions are similar to a [[first-person shooter]], as the bloodline's movement is controlled using the W, A, S, and D keys. The primary two abilities are mapped to the left and right mouse buttons, and the rest of the abilities are used with the Q, E, R, F, and space keys. Almost all the abilities are aimed, where the direction of the ability is determined by the position of the cursor on the screen relative to the champion's position. There are two different camera modes; Free Look and Static. The static camera stays over the characters head at all times regardless of the location of the players cursor. The Free Look camera allows the player to control their camera with the cursor. A few defensive abilities are directed by hovering the cursor on the desired recipient, and some abilities target a specific location on the playing field.

Bloodline Champions also features [[Fog of war#Simulations and games|fog of war]] which represents the areas of the map which cannot be seen due to visual obstruction or distance. There are obstacles on the map which create fog of war and inhibit movement. Champions have their own collision, which can be used to inhibit movement and protect allies (for example a tank bloodline will have a larger collision size, making it easier to defend teammates by blocking fire, but also being more susceptible to focus fire).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/video/default.htm?pres=20090817_2030&amp;story=7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bloodlines===
Bloodline Champions has 27 characters split into 4 archetypes: tank, ranged damage, melee damage, and healer. Tanks are generally close-quarters fighters and specialize in defense as well as peeling; removing pressure from allies by putting equal pressure on enemies. Ranged damage characters have lower health and deal high damage from a safe distance. They generally have many ways to escape melee combat but are taken down quickly if outmaneuvered. These bloodlines generally deal the most damage but must be in close range and have slightly higher health than ranged damage bloodlines. They tend to have very limited ways to control fights aside from their high damage output. Healers, as the title implies, keep their allies alive through a mix of powerful control and healing abilities.  They have the lowest health of all bloodlines and generally lack mobility options other characters enjoy.

===Game modes===
Bloodline Champions has several game modes that provide different types of gameplay. The central game mode is Arena, as it is the only one available through matchmaking.

====Arenas====

Players can face an engaging challenge in competing in 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 arenas.

====Capture the Artifact====
The objective is to capture both artifacts and bring them back to your own base. Each team begins with one artifact in their base, and the first team to hold both artifacts for a period of time wins the round. The artifacts can be carried and thrown, but lifting one from its starting position takes time and can be interrupted by attacks. The carrier may drop the artifact by using certain abilities as well as receiving attacks by specific enemy abilities. When dropped, the artifact can be instantly picked up after it has sat for a short delay.

====Conquest====
In Conquest, the players have an infinite amount of respawns but the delay before respawning can increase with time. The teams battle for a number of capture points, and if one team holds all of them, the other team cannot respawn until they capture one of the capture points. To capture a point, the player must stay at that point for a period of time without taking damage or using abilities. The starting point provides a healing aura to the team that started there, and power rune pickups are distributed across the map, allowing champions to temporarily boost their capabilities. A team wins by either killing all the enemy champions while they cannot respawn, or holding the capture points for a set amount of time.

===In-game currencies===
Bloodline Champions is Free-to-Play (F2P). Bloodlines rotate every day, so there are always four available Bloodlines, one of each archetype. Players earn Blood Coins and spend them on additional Bloodlines, titles, avatars and other visual perks. None of the purchasable items give an edge in gameplay since there are no weapons with higher damage, for example, but they create more variety and choices in gameplay and appearance. Players can also choose to buy Funcom Points by using real money. Funcom Points serve the same purpose as Blood Coins, but they are bought using real currency instead of earned through in-game accomplishments. All marketplace items cost significantly less Funcom Points than Blood Coins.

'''''Empire of Dreams''''' ('''''El imperio de los sueños''''', 1988) is a [[postmodern]] book of poetry by [[Giannina Braschi]], who is widely considered "one of the most [[revolutionary]] voices in [[Latin American literature]] today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bookfest/author/giannina_braschi|title=Giannina Braschi|work=National Book Festival|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|quote="Braschi, one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin America today."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Language Association Presents Giannina Braschi|quote ="Considered one of the most revolutionary Latin American poets writing today, Giannina Braschi, author of the epic prose poem 'Empire of Dreams'."|url=http://circumferencemag.org/?event=modern-language-association-presents-giannina-braschi|website=Circumference Magazine: Poetry in Translation, Academy of American Poets|date =January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Literature in Translation: Giannina Braschi's Empire of Dreams|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300057959&amp;printer=y|website=Yale University Press|quote="Braschi's book is a modern classic, informed with all of the major concerns of our contemporary culture."|date=August 1994|access-date=2015-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091257/http://yalepress.yale.edu/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300057959&amp;printer=y|archive-date=2015-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PEN: Free Expression/Literature|url=https://www.pen.org/giannina-braschi|website=PEN American Center|quote="Giannina Braschi, one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin America today, wrote the postmodern poetry classic EMPIRE OF DREAMS."|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D'Amore|author2=Anna Maria|title='Translating Contemporary Mexican Texts: Fidelity to Alterity'|quote="In the stakes of literary acclaim and respectability is Giannina Braschi, considered by many to be Puerto Rico's premier poet."|publisher=Berkeley Insights in Linguistics and Semiotics|place=New York|page=104|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, ''Empire of Dreams'' debuted in Spain to acclaim as ''El imperio de los sueños'', with an English translation by Tess O'Dwyer later inaugurating the [[Yale]] Library of World Literature in Translation (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Barnstone|first1=Willis|title=Literature of Asia, Africa, and Latin America: From Antiquity to the Present|quote="Empire of Dreams is an epic length sequence of poems published to acclaim".../"brightest new voice in her generation in the Spanish language."|place=Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=1954|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed from 1980 to 1986, this series represents the first major phase of Braschi's [[Work of art|oeuvre]]: poetry written entirely in classical and modern Spanish.

Forming a hybrid of [[prose poetry]], [[drama]], [[musical theater]], [[manifesto]], [[gossip]], [[autobiography]], [[diary]], [[literary theory]], and [[antinovel]], ''Empire of Dreams'' is a mixed genre [[trilogy]] on the culture of excess. The central axis of this [[epic poem]] is the Latin American [[immigrant]]'s optimistic new life in the "[[Big Apple]]", which is dramatized by Braschi as the epicenter of the [[American Dream]]. However, social and linguistic references to other Latin cities and neighborhoods abound, such as "the Latin American Quarter in Paris, the ''barrio chino barcelonés'', the ''zaguanes'' of Borges's Buenos Aires, and the colonial houses in Old San Juan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Carrion, Maria Mercedes|title='Geography, (M)Other Tongues and the Role of Translation in Giannina Braschi's El imperio de los sueños'|quote= "the Latin American Quarter in Paris, the ''barrio chino barcelonés'', the ''zaguanes'' of Borges's Buenos Aires, and the colonial houses in Old San Juan".|journal=Studies in 20th Century Literature|volume=20|pages=167–192|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author later wrote the first full-length [[Spanglish]] novel ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'' and a controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NGO News|url=http://ngonewsbd.com/asa-accused-endorsing-puerto-rican-terrorists/|title=ASA accused of endorsing Puerto Rican Terrorists|quote="Frontpage Magazine pulled the Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi into the fray for having read gruesome scenes of black humor from her novel "United States of Banana" which dramatized the collapse of the World Trade Center of September 11th as a metaphor for the fall of the [[American imperialism|American Empire]]".|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2013/12/22/giannina-braschi-gets-drawn-into-asas-polemical-boycott-of-israeli-institutions/|title=Repeating Islands: News and Commentary on Caribbean Culture, Art, and Literature|quote="Giannina Braschi gets drawn into ASA's polemical boycott of Israeli Institutions."|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; work of [[political fiction]] in English, ''[[United States of Banana]]'', which provides a scathing critique of the false promise of [[meritocracy]] within the American Dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://johnjay.jjay.cuny.edu/latinaliteraryconference2015/_images/FridayApril24Abstracts.pdf|authors=((Riofio, John, College of William and Mary))|title=Fractured Dreams: Life and Debt in United States of Banana|publisher=Biennial Conference on Latina/o Utopias Literatures: "Latina/o Utopias: Futures, Forms, and the Will of Literature"|year=2015|quote="Braschi's novel is a scathing critique...of over-wrought concepts of Liberty and the American Dream....(It) connects the dots between 9/11, the suppression of individual liberts, and the fragmentation of the individuals and communities in favor of a collective worship of the larger dictates of the market and the economy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject, Structure, and Themes==

''Empire of Dreams'' deals with issues of artistic creation, [[immigration]], commercialism, [[capitalism]], [[identity crisis]], sexual and gender ambiguity, and [[revolution]]. The narrator journeys through a "phantasmagoria of internal and external trials in order to experience the center—of political power, of meaning, of feeling, and of personal identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalebooks.com/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300057959|title=Yale University Press Reviews|quote="New York City becomes the site of liberation for its marginal citizens, as the narrator is led through a seeming phantasmagoria of internal and external trials in order to experience the center—of political power, of meaning, of feeling, and of personal identity."|date=August 1994|access-date=2015-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619011053/http://www.yalebooks.com/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300057959|archive-date=2015-06-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has been compared structurally to the [[Chinese boxes|Chinese box]] and the [[Matryoshka doll]], given that the book has six books inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Literature|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Hispanic-American Literature|volume=5|pages=429|publisher=Infobase Learning|date=August 31, 2008|isbn =9781438140605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part one, "Assault on Time", is a sequence of meditative prose poems on the subject of love lost and the ineptitude of language and grammar to communicate emotions. It is Braschi's first book of poetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/2012/09/14/1ea74c24-f2e4-11e1-a612-3cfc842a6d89mar_story.html/|title=The Washington Post|quote="Giannina Braschi's first published work was a book of poetry,"Asalto al tiempo"; since then she has had essays, a novella and more poetry published in Spanish. She went on to write the novel "Yo-Yo Boing!" in Spanglish. Her new novel is her first in English "United States of Banana."|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it begins with the breaking of silence: "Behind the word is silence./Behind what sounds is the door".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Braschi, Giannina|title='Empire of Dreams' translated by Tess O'Dwyer|quote="Behind the word is silence./Behind what sounds is the door"|publisher=Yale University Press|place=New Haven, CT|page=1|isbn=9780300057959|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters take on a life of their own, roaming the streets of New York, and punctuation marks, such as [[Colon (punctuation)|colons]] and [[semicolon]]s denote pivotal points in a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Literature|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Hispanic-American Literature|volume=5|pages=429|publisher=Infobase Learning|date=August 31, 2008|isbn =9781438140605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part two, "Profane Comedy", turns loud as the poet pays homage to the evolution of poetry and performance, especially [[comedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ostriker|first=Alicia|title=Introduction to Empire of Dreams|quote="Profane Comedy is an homage to performance, especially comedia dell'arte."|place=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=x-xx1|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Profane Comedy" is composed of four books of poetry, each with humorous gusto and a flair for the grotesque: 1. "Book of Clowns and Buffoons", 2. "Poems of the World; or The Book of Wisdom", 3. "Pastoral; or, The Inquisition of Memories", and 4. "Song of Nothingness". Throughout, Braschi intermingles television [[jingles]] and pop songs by the likes of [[The Beatles]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] with poems of the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. References include [[Luis de León]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Luis de Góngora]], [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], and [[Francisco Quevedo]], while cameo appearances are made by poets, painters, philosophers, and composers, such as: [[César Vallejo]], [[Rimbaud]], [[Goethe]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Breughal]], [[Beethoven]], [[Van Gogh]], and [[Picasso]], among others. Quotations of classical poets abound, transformed by the appropriating hand of a joyful poet who uses the "sampling technique of rap music" and [[hip hop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ostriker|first=Alicia|title=Introduction to "Empire of Dreams"|place=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=x-xx1|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Braschi writes with a strong literary tradition behind her and from an erudite standpoint, "she imbues her text with jollity and a brilliant energy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kuebler|first=Caroline|title="Empire of Dreams" Review|quote="Braschi writes with a strong poetic tradition behind her, and from her erudite standpoint she forges an odd mixture of poetry, prose, drama, and a little of what could be considered music. She imbues her text with jollity and a brilliant energy that stretches its audience from lovers of modernism to seekers of a broadened artistry of language."|publisher=Review of Contemporary Fiction|place=Dalkey Archives, Champaign, Il|date=August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text unfolds through a series of violent and [[surrealism|surreal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Barnstone|first1= Willis|title=Literature of Latin America|quote="Braschi is a Spanish Arthur Rimbaud reinventing surrealism, creating a modern classic"|place=Princeton|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=460|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; theatrical scenes performed by clowns, buffoons, shepherds, lead soldiers, magicians, madmen, witches, and fortune tellers. These gender-bending migrant characters attack and occupy the American mainstream, including business centers and tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cruz Malave, Arnaldo|title=Under the Skirt of Liberty: Giannina Braschi Rewrites Empire|journal=American Quarterly|volume=66.3|pages=801–818|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a climatic episode of "[[Pastoral]] ; or, the [[Inquisition]] of Memories", shepherds cause traffic jams on [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] during the [[Puerto Rican Day Parade]], ring the bells of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] and take over the observation deck of the [[Empire State Building]] where they dance and sing: "Now we do whatever we please, whatever we please, whatever we damn well please".

Part three, "Intimate Diary of Solitude," is a lighthearted [[antinovel]] that mocks the [[Latin American Boom]] and [[dictator novel]]s. The composition is a mix-mash of [[flash fiction]], pop songs, [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], [[Advertising|commercials]], diary excerpts, political and literary [[manifestos]], performance art, ending with a philosophical treatise on the writer's role in the modern age. The heroine Mariquita Samper, a [[Macy's]] make-up artist who dreams of being a star, calls for a [[revolution]] of "poetic eggs" and shoots the [[narrator]] of Latin American Boom novels (such as ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'') who keeps rewriting her own diary in order to turn it into a bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marting|first1=Diane|title= New/Nueva York in Giannina Braschi's 'Poetic Egg': Fragile Identity, Postmodernism, and Globalization|place=Indiana|publisher=The Global South|pages=167–182|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate between quality and originality versus fame and fortune is a constant theme in ''Empire of Dreams''. The work closes with a quotation from an anonymous poem of [[Medieval Spanish literature]], a line from "El Conde Arnaldos": "I only sing my song/to whomever follows me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Braschi, Giannina|title=Empire of Dreams|publisher=AmazonCrossing|place=Seattle|page=197|ISBN=9781611090659|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Giannina Braschi credits T.S. Eliot's "[[The Waste Land]]" as the single most impactful English language poem to inform the rhythmic shifts and the inspiration from which she creates a chorus of anonymous voices to capture the collective conscience of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Braschi|first=Giannina|interviewer=Rathke, Eric J.|title=52 Weeks / 52 Interviews: Week 34: Giannina Braschi|quote="I've studied music all my life. I've sung songs in foreign languages and learned those languages through those songs. I memorized [[T.S. Eliot]]'s The Waste Land from tapes before I (mis)spoke English and discovered in Eliot's dramatic shifts my own music—the anonymity of the voices that come from no where—the Greek chorus that captures the conscience of the people."|url=http://monkeybicycle.net/52-weeks-52-interviews-week-34-giannina-braschi/|location=London|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholar and poet [[Alicia Ostriker]] notes in the introduction to ''Empire of Dreams'' that the poet's voice sounds decidedly "[[macho]]" and yet it can be theoretically "paired with [[Luisa Valenzuela]], [[Clarice Lispector]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Helene Cixous]], and [[Marguerite Duras]], and obviously she owes a great deal to Gertrude Stein".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ostriker|first=Alicia|title=Empire of Dreams|place=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=x-xxi|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braschi has published scholarly works on Spanish language poetry by [[Cervantes]], [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]], [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Federico García Lorca]], and [[César Vallejo]], from whose work she quotes throughout ''Empire of Dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NGO News|url=http://ngonewsbd.com/modern-language-association-convention-2013|quote="On the scholarly front, she published a book on the Spanish Romantic poet Bécquer and essays on classics by Cervantes, Garcilaso, Lorca, Machado, and Vallejo."|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with NBC Latino, Braschi identified her favorite poet as [[César Vallejo]]: "Vallejo is a jack-in-the-box who performs the movement of my spirit. No matter how much you push him down into the box, the poet always bounces back to affirm his love for life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbclatino.com/2013/04/27/8-poets-disclose-their-favorite-lines-of-poetry/|title=8 Latino Poets Disclose Their Favorite Lines of Poetry|publisher=NBC Latino|quote="Nuyorican spoken word poet and author Giannina Braschi's favorite line from a poem is by César Vallejo: I want to live always, even on my belly/because, as I was saying and I say it again/so much life and never! And so many years/and always, lots of always, always, always!" (Translation by Tess O'Dwyer) "Vallejo is a jack-in-the-box who performs the movement of my spirit," says Braschi. "No matter how much you push him down into the box, the poet always bounces back to affirm his love for life."|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips''''' is a 1944 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Friz Freleng]].&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;{{bcdb|3765|Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Somewhere in the Pacific, Bugs is floating in a box, singing to himself, when 'the island that inevitably turns up in this kind of picture' turns up. Bugs swims towards it, and admires the peace and quiet, when bombs start going off ("The Storm" from the ''[[William Tell Overture]]'' is also heard in the background). Bugs ducks into a haystack, and soon comes face to face with a Japanese soldier; a short, buck-toothed, bare-footed Japanese man who says his 'Ls' as 'Rs' and who might be rapidly stating the names of Japanese cities whenever he moves. The soldier chases Bugs to a rabbit hole, where the soldier dumps a bomb inside. However, Bugs manages to blow the soldier up with the bomb. When the soldier tries to swing a sword at Bugs, Bugs appears as a Japanese general (presumably [[Hideki Tojo]]), but is soon recognized by his trademark carrot eating, prompting the soldier (who says he saw Bugs in the "Warner Bros. Leon Schlesinger ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon pictures", referring to the fact that Bugs was originally exclusive to that series) to ask him "What's up, Honorable Doc?"

Bugs then jumps into a plane and the soldier also jumps into a plane. However, Bugs ties the soldier's plane to a tree, causing the plane to be yanked out from under him. The soldier parachutes down, but is met by Bugs in mid-air, who hands "Moto" (cf. [[Mr. Moto]]) some 'scrap iron' (an [[anvil]]),&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to US companies selling scrap metal to Japan before the war.&lt;/ref&gt; causing the soldier to fall. Painting a Japanese flag on a tree to denote one soldier down, Bugs runs into a [[sumo wrestler]], whom he confidently faces off against (cockily marking a second bigger flag on the tree). After getting temporarily beaten by the sumo wrestler (and, to be fair, wipes the second mark off the tree before collapsing), Bugs dresses as a [[Geisha|geisha girl]] and knocks the wrestler out, who repaints a second flag on the tree before passing out.

Seeing a bunch of Japanese landing craft making their way to the island (exclaiming "Japs! Hundreds of 'em!"), Bugs thinks of a plan to get rid of all of them. He comes out in a 'Good Rumor' (a parody of [[Good Humor]]) truck, which plays Mozart ("Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja" from ''[[The Magic Flute]]''). Bugs hands each of the Japanese an ice cream bar with a grenade inside it, calling them racist slurs such as "monkey-face" and "slant-eyes" whilst doing so. All the Japanese are killed off from the explosions, save for one who was killed after redeeming a 'free' ice cream bar from Bugs. Having now painted dozens of Japanese flags on the trees denoting all the downed enemy, Bugs comments again about the 'peace and quiet – and if there's one thing I CAN'T stand, it's peace and quiet!'.

Bugs spots an American battleship in the distance and raises a white flag, yelling for them to come get him, but they keep going.  Bugs is insulted. "Do they think I want to spend the rest of my life on this island?" With this remark, a female rabbit (dressed in a more Hawaiian outfit) appears saying, "It's a possibility!"  Bugs then pulls down the distress flag, lets out a wolf cry and goes running after her.

==Analysis==
The films depicting the Japanese enemy during World War II tended to both identify a formidable wartime adversary and to depict said adversary as inferior to its American counterparts. In cartoons, this translated to a tendency to depict the Japanese as either superman or buffoon. This film closer represents the latter tendency.&lt;ref name="Fuller"&gt;Fuller (2001), p. 285-287&lt;/ref&gt; The caricature portrayal of this film serves as a host to well-worn stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;

The film opens with Bugs singing from within a crate.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"&gt;Fuller (2010), p. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; He is somewhere in the Pacific and is waiting for the inevitable island to turn up.&lt;ref name="Shull"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; He then sees an island and swims towards its beach.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Already in the introduction, Bugs identifies his Pacific island setting as a "[[garden of Eden]] and a "[[Shangri-La]]". This in reference to the exotic havens depicted in South Sea island films and to the epic film ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937). Only then is Bugs alerted to the mortal danger that awaits him on the island. The seductive first impression serves to set up a hazardous trap.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;

Bugs escapes rapid gunfire by running for cover into a haystack.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The initial encounter of Bugs with a Japanese soldier presents an optical illusion, that the two share a body. Bugs' head peeks above the haystack, while the legs of the soldier appear below it.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; Then the owner of the feet confronts Bugs. The soldier has buck teeth, a thin mustache, dark eyeglasses, slanted eyebrows and curly, wavy hair.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

The soldier pulls out a sword and starts swiping at Bugs. He speaks in Oriental-sounding [[gibberish]], consisting of short syllables spoken in a [[staccato]] voice. In response, Bugs assumes the form of a Japanese general and stands stiffly at attention.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Bugs' face is briefly transformed into a Japanese caricature, only to be contrasted with the face of an actual, if impish, Japanese soldier. Bugs disguised as a general imitates photographs of [[Hideki Tojo]].&lt;ref name="Fuller3"&gt;Fuller (2010), p. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt; The soldier bows in supplication to the authority figure. Bugs accidentally gives away his identity by casually chewing on a carrot.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

The soldier resumes use of his sword and talks gibberish again. Bugs takes off in a Japanese plane, followed by the soldier in his own plane.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Both planes are presumably based on the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]].&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; Bugs ties the rival plane to a tree. The soldier parachutes out and Bugs hands him an anvil. Mocking: "Here's some scrap iron for Japan, Moto."&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; There is a spoken reference to [[Mr. Moto]] to provide a well-acquainted name to the wartime enemy.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs then bumps into a [[Rikishi|sumo wrestler]]. The man is huge with a large stomach, a mustache, a goatee, buck teeth with a large gap between the front teeth, and a [[Mohawk hairstyle]]. In response, Bugs transforms into a [[geisha]]. He speaks in Japanese-sounding gibberish and coaxes the wrestler into a near kiss. The kiss turns into a fatal blow with a [[mallet]]. Bugs triumphantly shouts "timber" as the man falls.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] scene involving the wrestler and the geisha makes use of two relatively harmless civilian-type characters to cast the enemy in a humorous light.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; In concept, it suggests that an Oriental guise can be put on and discarded at will.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs then sees several Japanese ships floating towards the island. He is next seen disguised as [[ice cream truck|Ice cream car]] vendor in the mold of the [[Good Humor]] man. He entices many Japanese soldiers to come get their ice cream.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; There are many Japanese soldiers besieging Bugs' ice cream truck. Suggesting that their threat relies on their numbers. They are an easily fooled mob, not a group of individuals.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; They resemble a swarm of bees and they are rendered less as human figures and more like a scourge in need of extermination.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs insults his customers by calling them "monkey face" and "slant eyes".&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The scene with the ice cream track partially obscures the faces and bodies of the enemy soldiers, but Bugs verbalizes a physical description. The phrases "bowlegs", "monkey face", "slant eyes" both serve as racial epithets and audibly support the visualized stereotypes of the film. They are all elements of the Japanese wartime caricature.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

They get served with chocolate-covered ice cream bars embedded with grenades.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; The soldiers run off as soon as they get served. Then numerous explosions are heard.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; One battered soldier returns to present his specially-marked stick, earning him a free ice cream bar. He is the last one.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; Bugs' mission is accomplished. He then signals an American ship to come get him.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

Bugs hates being confined to a world of "peace and quiet". He celebrates the approach of an American ship and his potential rescue, until he meets a [[sarong]]-clad female bunny.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; The female bunny ignites his passion. He howls and thumps his foot, his eyes bulging from their sockets. He leaps into an amorous pursuit and the film ends.&lt;ref name="Lerner"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 210-213&lt;/ref&gt;

The short placed an emphasis on physical peculiarities to imply racial inferiority. The preeminent danger is positioned to be treachery and not military might.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; The Japanese are distinctively [[Othering|othered]] as physically deformed.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; The Japanese are characterized as single-minded, subservient to their superiors and gullible. The gag with the ice cream-seeking soldiers makes use of the American perception of the Japanese as both gullible and greedy. Bugs' stereotypical portrayal of Japanese womanhood renders him a meek and seductive creature, speaking in a falsetto voice.&lt;ref name="Brcak"&gt;Brcak, Pavia (2002), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The short has similarities to both ''[[Wackiki Wabbit]]'' (1943) and ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'' (1945).&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; The soundtrack includes ''Trade Winds'' and ''Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat''.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; There are two musical quotations from ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (1870) by [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; The Japanese soldiers are repeatedly presented on screen to the tune of the ''[[Kimigayo]]'' (1870)&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; The ice cream truck scene uses the tune of the opening aria of Papageno, from ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (1791) by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].&lt;ref name="Lerner2"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; When Bugs professes his hatred of the peace and quiet, demanding someone to get him out of this place, the tune is the ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]''.

Neil Lerner attempts to decipher [[Carl Stalling]]'s intentions in quoting Wagner at the end of the battle scenes. He suggests that it is connected to the role of the [[Valkyrie]]s, taking fallen warriors to [[Valhalla]]. In this case, the use is ironic as Stalling would not view the deceased Japanese soldiers as fallen heroes who deserve an afterlife paradise.&lt;ref name="Lerner3"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bugs signals the American ship, the tune is from the scene where [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]] announces her pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Lerner3"/&gt; Lerner suggests that Stalling was inspired by the name of [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], "peace through victory". Stalling could intend the scene to represent the United States reaching such a peace. Alternatively, he might be inspired by the stark isolation of Brünnhilde on a rocky mountain – in which case, the reference would have been Bugs being trapped on the island.&lt;ref name="Lerner4"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
*Since the 1960s, "Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips" has become very controversial because the short stereotypes against Japanese people. However, the cartoon was not one of the "[[Censored Eleven]]" and was occasionally shown on television in syndicated packages with other pre-August 1948&lt;ref&gt;The latest released WB cartoon sold to a.a.p. was ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'', released on July 24, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. cartoons whose copyrights were under the ownership of [[Associated Artists Productions]]. The short debuted on home video in December 1991 on [[The Golden Age of Looney Tunes#Volume 1|the first volume of ''Golden Age of Looney Tunes'']] [[laser disc]] collection. The niche market format did not cause a stir, but when the 5-disc set was later issued in the more accessible VHS format on 10 separate tapes in 1993, Japanese groups went against its distribution. Originally, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (the copyright owners of the Turner/Associated Artists Productions shorts at the time) defended against the Japanese groups and did not withdraw the release, but later they changed their minds and both releases were withdrawn. Future releases for both formats replaced the cartoon with ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]'', which already appeared on another LaserDisc and VHS set. The VHS reissue combined volumes 4 and 7 of the 10-tape set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/02/17/wwii-cartoons-pulled/f190dd30-5da9-4e7a-ba92-52edb9fd2f45/&lt;/ref&gt; After the pulling of the short in 1993 from home video, the short was also pulled from American television networks and has been since.
*This was one of the 12 Bugs Bunny cartoons that were pulled out of Cartoon Network's June Bugs 2001 marathon by order of [[AOL Time Warner]] due to stereotypes of Japanese people. However, in a promo for this event, the scene where Bugs does a double-take on noticing the female rabbit was used.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsz9Kqxx0dg&lt;/ref&gt; This cartoon was shown, albeit in clips, on a special episode of the Cartoon Network show ''[[ToonHeads]]'' about cartoons from the World War II era, while a voiceover explained how Japanese stereotypes in World War II cartoons tended to be very cruel (as shown in Norm MacCabe's ''[[Tokio Jokio]]'', this cartoon and clips of World War II-era [[Popeye]] cartoons).
*This cartoon was made during [[World War II]], and reflects the United States' attitude towards one of its main enemies at the time, the [[Empire of Japan]]. In the cartoon, [[Bugs Bunny]] lands on an island in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and is pitted against a group of highly [[Stereotype|racially stereotyped]] Japanese soldiers. Bugs shows no mercy against the Japanese soldiers, greeting them with several [[racial slurs]] such as "monkey face" and "slant eyes", making short work of a large [[sumo wrestler]], and bombing most of the Japanese army using various explosives, including grenades hidden in [[ice cream bar]]s. The cartoon's title is a play on the verb "nip" as in "bite" and "[[Nip]]s", which at the time was a widely used [[List of ethnic slurs|slur]] for Japanese people, as the Japanese word for "Japan" is "Nippon" (or "Nihon").
*The ''[[Film Daily]]'' called the seven-minute short "good fun", and gave the following synopsis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Bugs Bunny, castaway on a Pacific isle, thinks the setting is ideal until he finds his paradise infested with Japanese soldiers. How he single-handedly exterminates the enemy makes for a laugh-filled few minutes of typical Bugs antics, off-screen remarks and action in this Technicolor cartoon produced by Leon Schlesinger."&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews of New Films," ''The [[Film Daily]]''. 5/10/44. p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chuckle Brothers''' were an English children's comedy [[double act]] comprising '''Barry David Elliott''' (24 December 1944 – 5 August 2018) and '''Paul Harman Elliott''' (born 18 October 1947).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mr Barry David Elliott director information.

The comedy of the Chuckle Brothers usually derived from [[slapstick]], [[wordplay]] and other [[visual gag]]s, and their [[catchphrases]] included "To me, to you" and "Oh dear, oh dear".

==Early life==
The brothers were born in [[Rotherham]] to Amy and James Patton Elliott, in 1944 and 1947. Their father was a [[Gang Show]] performer whose stage name was Gene Patton; he worked with the 18-year-old [[Peter Sellers]] in 1943 in The No. 10 Gang and gave performances in [[London]], [[Orkney]] and the [[Hebrides]], [[Iceland]], the Far East, India, and [[Burma]]. Their two older brothers, Jimmy and Brian, are known professionally as the [[Patton Brothers]] and have appeared in ''[[ChuckleVision]]'', Jimmy as the nameless character known colloquially as "No Slacking", and Brian as another unnamed character known as "Getoutofit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Their primary work was mainly focused on children's television, beginning initially on Christmas Day in 1980 with them taking part in a televised children's show, ''A Merry Morning'', in which the brothers entertained around 250 children from the Leeds area in [[Yeadon Town Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceFilmWorks/150233180|title=Collections Search {{!}} BFI {{!}} British Film Institute|website=collections-search.bfi.org.uk|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the brothers launched a pre-school programme on the BBC entitled ''Chuckle Hounds'', in which they performed routines with no [[dialogue]], while dressed up in giant dog costumes. Their success in children's television came in 1987, with the launch of their iconic children's show, ''[[ChuckleVision]]'', in which their real-life siblings [[Patton Brothers|Jimmy and Brian Patton]] made occasional appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/the-chuckle-brothers-life-after-television-9107691.html|title=The Chuckle Brothers: Life after television for Barry and Paul Elliott|date=5 February 2014|work=The Independent|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show proved a ratings hit with children, running for twenty-one series over a period of twenty-two years, and giving them a Special Award for Lifetime Achievement at the [[British Academy Children's Awards]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2008/childrens/bafta-kids-vote|title=2008 Children's BAFTA Kids' Vote {{!}} BAFTA Awards|website=awards.bafta.org|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final series of the programme was aired in December 2009.

The two contributed further to children's entertainment, performing at the ''Children's Royal Variety Performance'' in May 1992,&lt;ref name="RT2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Children's Royal Variety Performance|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/9a9d93694cce4f9c82c71fa9ea54604c|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=The Radio Times|date=21 May 1992|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launching a children's [[game show]] titled ''[[To Me... To You...|To Me, To You!]]'', which ran between 1996 and 1998 and which took its name from their signature [[catchphrase]].

Outside of children's entertainment, the brothers have made appearances in many other television series, both together and separately.

==Critical reception==
In November 2005, [[Jacques Peretti]], a reporter for ''[[The Guardian]]'', remarked on how "the appeal of the Chuckle Brothers remains a mystery to anyone over eight, but to anyone under eight, they're the ultimate entertainment experience". "The little people think they're hilarious, and if you add up all the little people across the country who think they're hilarious, you'd think it's ''ChuckleVision'' that should have the 28 comedy gongs, not ''Little Britain'' or ''The Office''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Jacques Peretti: Down with the Kids|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/26/tvandradio.theguide|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate = 10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2007, [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] chairman Denis Coleman announced that the brothers had both been made honorary presidents of the football club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In April 2007, whilst on holiday on the Greek island of [[Cephalonia]], Paul broke his nose and suffered cuts and bruises when he lost control of his motorcycle after suddenly braking to avoid a goatherd and herd.

An [[urban legend]] surrounding Barry Chuckle's supposed death from a heart attack has circulated since at least 2008. In 2010, the brothers issued a statement on their website stating that the story was "complete and utter rubbish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechucklebrothersontour.co.uk/news/index.html |title=News On Barry |year=2010 |publisher=The Chuckle Brothers |accessdate=14 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305072045/http://www.thechucklebrothersontour.co.uk/news/index.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that the death hoaxes had upset young viewers, and had shocked Barry when they re-surfaced.&lt;ref name="bbchoax" /&gt; The hoax was said to have initially spread via [[Facebook]] in 2008, but re-surfaced in 2010 via [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="bbchoax"&gt;{{cite news|title=Barry Chuckle's shock over death rumours|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/10268581.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 June 2010 | date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Paul was caught [[speeding]] in a 40&amp;nbsp;mph zone. As a result of his actions he chose to undertake a [[National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme|speed awareness course]], as opposed to accepting three [[Point system (driving)|penalty points]] and a fine. He reportedly stated at the time that he was "a careful driver" who had previously never "been done" in the fifty years that he had been driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk/news/silly-me-moment-for-chuckle-brother-caught-speeding-in-south-yorkshire-1-7633190|title=‘Silly me’ moment for Chuckle Brother caught speeding in South Yorkshire|work=South Yorkshire Times|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/chuckle-brother-paul-elliott-is-caught-speeding-154407026.html|title=Chuckle Brother Paul Elliott Is Caught Speeding|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In December 2010, Barry announced his support for a proposal that one of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition]] government's planned [[Free school (England)|free schools]], a taxpayer-funded school independent of the local authority, should be established in Rotherham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotherhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/88038/free-school-a-brilliant-idea-says-barry-chuckle.aspx|title=Free school "a brilliant idea" says Barry Chuckle|date=7 December 2010|work=The Rotherham Advertiser|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, it was announced that Barry had planned to incorporate a 100-pupil free school named ''Rotherham Central Free School'' in his hometown of Rotherham. His son's partner was to serve as the head teacher of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barry Chuckle to set up Rotherham school|url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a301287/barry-chuckle-to-set-up-rotherham-school.html|work= Digital Spy|accessdate = 9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2012, no premises, staff or pupils for the school had been confirmed, despite announcing an intention on opening in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Exclusive: Mystery of a Chuckle Brother’s ‘ghost’ school with no staff or pupils|url = http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/education/exclusive-mystery-of-a-chuckle-brother-s-ghost-school-with-no-staff-or-pupils-1-4220165|work= Yorkshire Post|accessdate = 9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the Chuckle Brothers attended the trial of [[Dave Lee Travis]]. Paul stated that it was a "complete shock" that such an attack had occurred in their presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chuckle Brothers' 'shock' at Dave Lee Travis sex assault claims|url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/12/chuckle-brothers-dave-lee-travis-trial|work= The Guardian|accessdate = 9 October 2015|first = Press|last = Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; After giving evidence, the Brothers posed for a [[selfie]] outside [[Southwark Crown Court]] with Paul tweeting it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ITV News on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/itvnews/status/510435558414221312|website = Twitter|accessdate = 31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to thousands of followers on his Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chuckle Brothers take selfie outside DLT court|url = http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-09-12/chuckle-brothers-take-selfie-outside-dlt-court/|website = ITV News|accessdate = 31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brothers had smiled whilst taking the photograph, and later some deemed their actions as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is this the most inappropriate selfie of all time?|url = http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/is-this-the-most-inappropriate-selfie-of-all-time--g1i720kdVg|website = i100|accessdate = 31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Barry received condemnation for sharing a [[Facebook]] post from the [[Far-right politics|far right-wing]] political party [[Britain First]]. The post, originally shared in June 2015, called on politicians to strip migrants of their citizenship if they left the country to join a terror group. Following the unearthing of the post, [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]], former leader of the [[English Defence League]] (EDL) came to Barry's defence, calling on people to "leave the man alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/britain-first-meme-shared-by-chuckle-brother-barry-elliott-sparks-fury_uk_56f01a2fe4b0cc1ede8c7082|title=Chuckle Brother Barry's Britain First Controversy Defended By Tommy Robinson|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain First subsequently described the incident as a "non-story".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britainfirst.tv/chuckle-brothers-star-outed-as-britain-first-supporter/|title=Chuckle Brothers star "outed" as Britain First supporter|last=|first=|date=21 March 2016|website=Britain First|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170624190251/https://www.britainfirst.tv/chuckle-brothers-star-outed-as-britain-first-supporter/|archivedate=24 June 2017|dead-url=yes|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 2018, Barry died after a period of ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45074955 |title=Entertainer Barry Chuckle dies at 73 |publisher=BBC News |date=5 August 2018 |accessdate=5 August 2018 |quote=It is with great sadness that the family announce that Barry passed away peacefully at his home surrounded by his wife Ann and all his family.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dixon |first1=Stephen |title=Barry Chuckle obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/05/barry-chuckle-obituary |accessdate=6 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul grieved Barry's death stating "I've not just lost my brother, I've lost my theatrical partner of many, many years and my very best friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/barry-chuckle-of-the-chuckle-brothers-dies-aged-73-manager-says-11461833|title=Barry Chuckle of the Chuckle Brothers duo dies aged 73|work=Sky News|access-date=7 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''each-way''' [[gambling|bet]] is a wager offered by [[bookmaker]]s consisting of two separate bets: a win bet and a place bet. For the win part of the bet to give a return, the selection must win, or finish first, in the event. For the place part of the bet to give a return, the selection must either win or finish in one of the predetermined places for the event, such as first place or second place. The odds paid on the place part of the bet are usually a fraction (commonly {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|1|4}} or {{frac|1|5}}) of the win odds. The trade-off being that one has a greater chance of making one's bet in trade for getting less payoff for doing so.  Examples are domestic football knockout competitions (e.g. [[FA Cup]]) where the quoted place terms may be {{frac|1|2}}.

In horse racing in the United Kingdom, the "place" is set strictly by the [[Jockey Club]] and will depend on the size of the field (that is, how many horses are running) so that the "place" may be just 1st and 2nd, 1st 2nd and 3rd, or even 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th on a big race like the [[Grand National]], and may pay {{frac|1|4}} or {{frac|1|5}} the odds.

== Staking ==
Because an each-way wager comprises two bets, the total staked is twice the unit stake. For example, a £5 each-way [[Glossary of bets offered by UK bookmakers|single]] would cost £10, as would a £5 each-way [[Glossary of bets offered by UK bookmakers|treble]] comprising as it does a £5 win treble and a £5 place treble.

==Settling the bets==
Calculation of returns uses either decimal odds or (fractional odds + 1).

===Example 1===
£50 each-way on a football team 'to win the cup' at 15-2 and {{frac|1|3}} the odds a place 1 or 2 would cost £100.
*Returns for the win part of the bet would be (£50 × 7.5) + stake = £425
*Returns for the place part of the bet would be (£50 × 2.5) + stake = £175
*If the team 'won the cup' the total returns would be £425 + £175 = £600 and if the team was beaten in the final the returns would be £175. If the team did not reach the final the wager would be lost.

===Example 2===
A £10 each-way single on a 10-1 selection in a horse race and paying {{frac|1|4}} the odds a place 1, 2, or 3 would cost £20.
* Returns on the win part of the bet would be £10 × (10/1 × 1) + stake = £110
* Returns on the place part of the bet would be £10 × (10/4 × 1) + stake = £35
* Total returns would be £110 + £35 = £145 if the horse won the race, but just £35 if the horse only finished second or third.

== Horse Racing Place Terms ==
The number horses and the type of race generally determines the number of places paid out and the fraction of the win odds used for settling the place part of an each way bet.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.paddypower.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/381/~/horse-racing-place-terms&lt;/ref&gt;

Often for big races or as a special promotion the big bookie's will offer enhanced place terms where they pay an extra place or pay the place part at 1/4 instead of 1/5.

Continuing his relationship with the Slovene National Theater, in 2003 he was appointed director of Maribor ballet, leading the company towards new and distinctive directions. Throughout the past decade, Clug drew attention of the international audience to himself, due to his specific choreographic style. He equally succeeded in putting the Maribor Ballet ensemble on the international dancing map. The Ballet of the SNG Maribor participated in the largest theatre festivals throughout the world performing his choreographies. His ''Radio &amp; Juliet'', choreographed in 2005 in Maribor, became an international hit and toured internationally: Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (USA), The Stars of the with nights festival in Mariinski theatre St.Petersburg, Festival of Firsts in Pittsburgh, Arts Festival in Singapore, Biarritz Festival in France, Dance Festival in Tel Aviv, Sintra Festival in Portugal, Festival Des Arts de Saint-Sauveur (Canada), and at the Seoul International Dance Festival (Korea), at the Milan Teatro Piccolo and toured Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and the countries of ex-Yugoslavia.

(2012) and together with Lazar "No Men´s Land" (2014). Both pieces received great response from critics and the audience.

After Stuttgart Ballet, Edward Clug continues to work with other major companies. For the Zurich Ballet he created the acclaimed Hill Harper´s Dream (2013) and Royal Ballet of Flanders commissioned him to stage Stravinsky´s "Les Noces" (2013). His latest creation for the Maribor Ballet is Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. Maggie Foyer describes his work in Dance Europe magazine: "Edward Clug, director of the Maribor Ballet, has achieved the near impossible: a new and meaningful interpretation of Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps". His works are being performed around the world and were commissioned by many ballet theatres: West Australian Ballet, Romanian National Ballet in Bucharest, Station Zuid in the Netherlands, Bitef Dance Company in Belgrade, Aalto Ballet in Essen, Ukrainian National Ballet in Kiev, Ballet Graz, Croatian National Ballet in Zagreb and Rijeka and Ballet Augsburg. New works are being on the way for Zurich Ballet and NDT2 in 2015.

'''''Encore Theatre Magazine''''' is an online magazine relating to contemporary [[theatre]] published in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=AboutETM&gt;[http://www.encoremagazine.org.uk/about_us_2.html "About Us"] at ''Encore Theatre Magazine'', Retrieved 16 Sept. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=not&gt;This online site is ''not'' the ''[http://www.bandt.com.au/view_media.asp?mediaid=55205 Encore] Film and TV Directory'', described as "Australia's leading film and television industry contacts directory" and published in Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;  A monthly internet publication begun in May 2003, it was inspired by the defunct magazine of the same title (''Encore''), which had a brief but influential life from 1954 to 1965: {{quotation|"The life of Encore (right) was brief but furious. For little more than a decade, between 1954 and 1965, the magazine railed at the state of British theatre, championing work that it saw as standard-bearing for the experimental, challenging, vital theatre it sought. It was not an ideologically-driven magazine; it was not consistent; it admired the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]], [[Theatre Workshop]], [[Eugène Ionesco|Ionesco]], [[John Arden|Arden]], and [[Kenneth Tynan|Tynan]], and it often attacked all of these. But it had passion and it had curiosity. Its standards were invariably high. It knew what it wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’ve named this site after Encore. We’re not reviving the magazine but maybe we can revive its spirit.&lt;ref name=AboutETM/&gt;}}  Articles published in the original ''Encore'' have been reprinted in a volume entitled ''The'' Encore ''Reader: A Chronicle of New Drama''. According to [[Robert Brustein]], the original magazine ''Encore'' embodied both the virtues and the failings of the movement it examined; he criticizes it for being "bursting with energy, vigor, and excitement" but being "seriously lacking in balanced [[judgment]]s or penetrating ideas."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Brustein]], ''[[The Third Theatre]]'' (New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], 1969) 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

|title=An evil laugh, with echo effects applied
|description=
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

'''Evil laughter''' or '''maniacal laughter''' is a stock [[mania|manic]] [[laughter]] by a [[villain]] in [[fiction]]. The expression "evil laugh" dates back to at least 1860.&lt;ref name=littell64_228/&gt; "Wicked laugh" can be found even earlier, dating back to at least 1784.&lt;ref name=burney1784/&gt; Another variant, the "sardonic laugh," shows up in 1714 and might date back even further.&lt;ref name=steele_addison1714/&gt;

In comic books, where [[supervillain]]s utter such laughs, it is variously rendered as ''mwahahaha'', ''mwhahaha'', ''muahahaha'', ''hehehehe, ''bwuhuhuhaha'', etc. ''(Compare with [[Ho ho ho]].)&lt;ref name="zawacki_dignan2003" /&gt; These words are also commonly used on internet [[blog]]s, [[bulletin board system]]s, and games. There, they are generally used when some form of victory is attained, or to indicate [[superiority complex|superiority]] over someone else. The words are often used as [[interjection]]s, and less frequently as nouns.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

During the 1930s, the popular radio program ''[[The Shadow]]'' used a signature evil laugh as part of its presentation. This was voiced by actor [[Frank Readick]], and his laugh was used even after [[Orson Welles]] took over the lead role.&lt;ref name=mott2009/&gt; The evil laugh voiced by [[Vincent Price]] has been used or copied many times in radio, film, music, and television,{{cn|date=December 2010}} notably at the end of the music video ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]''.

In films, evil laughter often fills the soundtrack when the villain is off-camera. In such cases, the laughter follows the hero or victim as they try to escape.{{cn|date=September 2018}} An example is in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', where [[Belloq]]'s laugh fills the South American jungle while [[Indiana Jones]] attempts to escape from the Hovitos.

On the television series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', [[JR Ewing]] ([[Larry Hagman]]) would often break into his trademark evil laugh whenever he knew he had put one over on somebody, especially [[Cliff Barnes]] ([[Ken Kercheval]]). {{cn|date=September 2018}}

The '''Giza Zoo''' is a  [[zoo|zoological garden]] in  [[Giza]], [[Egypt]]. It is one of the few green  areas in the city, and includes Giza's largest park. The zoo covers about {{Convert|80|acre|ha|}},&lt;ref name="Giza Zoo Superficy"/&gt; and is home to many [[endangered species]], as well as a selection of [[endemism|endemic]] fauna.

Rare species have been successfully bred in the zoo - including the first [[California sea lion]] to be born in the [[Middle East]] in 2002.

==History==
[[File:Japanese Building.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese building at the zoo]]

The zoo was built by [[Khedive Ismail]] and opened on 1 March 1891. It was built on about 50 [[feddan]] ({{Convert|21|ha|acre}}) that was once part of the harem gardens. Ismail imported many plants from India, Africa, and South America, of which a banyan tree planted about 1871 can still be seen. The original 180 birds and 78 other animals in the zoo's collection were taken from Ismail's private menagerie.&lt;ref name="egy"/&gt;

In the late 1870s the state took over the zoo as partial payment of the Ismail's debts. In January 1890, the harem building was opened as a natural history museum, and was used in this manner until a new museum was opened in Tahrir Square in 1902. The portion of the gardens facing the Nile were sold to the public for large homes, but the harem gardens were kept intact.&lt;ref name="egy"/&gt;

When the zoo was built, the exhibits with semi-natural habitats were considered spacious by European standards. The animal collection emphasized Egyptian species, and at one time claimed 20,000 individuals representing 400 species, though many of these may have been migratory birds. By the mid-twentieth century, the zoo was considered one of the best zoos in the world, but it has had trouble adapting to the pressures of growth in the latter half of the century as human populations in Cairo have increased.&lt;ref name="animalpeoplenews"/&gt;

By the end of [[World War II]] the zoo claimed 4,700 exhibits, with a total of 700 mammals and 500 reptiles. Attendance levels of 43,567 in 1889 rose to 223,525 by 1906.&lt;ref name="egy"/&gt; In 2007, the zoo hosted almost 3.4 million visitors.&lt;ref name="zoo_history"/&gt;

In 2004, the zoo lost its membership with the [[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (WAZA).&lt;ref name="redorbit"/&gt; The zoo did not pay membership fees, and then ignored the recommendations of WAZA inspectors.&lt;ref name="reuters_2008-10"/&gt; As of 2010, it is a member of the [[African Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] (PAAZAB),&lt;ref name="zoo_main"/&gt; and is working towards getting re-accredited by WAZA.

==Animals in the zoo==

===Mammals===
Mammals at the zoo include giraffes, Rhinoceros, Black bears, Raccoons, Elephant, Sea lions, Tigers, Lions, Cheetahs, zebras, agouti, Red Fox, Dorcas gazelle, Scimitar horned oryx, and many more.
===Birds===
The Giza Zoo has lot of different species of birds like flamingos, falcons, vultures, ibis, love birds, and macaws.
===Reptiles===
The zoo has many species of reptiles that belong to Egypt like the Egyptian cobra and tortoise.It also has Nile Crocodiles and American Alligators.

==Facilities==

The gardens include roads paved with black stone flags from Trieste, footpaths decorated with plebbles laid out like mosaics, and a pond with a marble island that is now the zoo's Tea Island.&lt;ref name="egy"/&gt;

The zoo also includes a suspension bridge designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]] that lets visitors view the animals from above. This bridge may have been the first elevated viewing area at any zoo in the world.&lt;ref name="animalpeoplenews"/&gt;

There is a reptile house and taxidermist's building on site.

==The future==

As part of the upgrades to help the zoo recover its membership in WAZA, in 2008 the bear exhibit was outfitted with fans and misters to help cool the bears. There are plans to run chilled water through the floors to make the bears more comfortable.&lt;ref name="reuters_2008-10"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1877">Construction by [[Jean-François Mertens]] and Zamir implementing with  [[John Harsanyi]]'s proposal to model games with incomplete information by supposing that each player is characterized by a privately known type that describes his feasible strategies and payoffs as well as a probability distribution over other players' types.&lt;ref name="mertens"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jean -François Mertens and Shmuel Zamir| title=Formulation of Bayesian analysis for games with incomplete information| journal=INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME THEORY| date=1985-03-01| volume=14| issue=1| pages=1–29| doi=10.1007/BF01770224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such probability distribution at the first level can be interpreted as a low level belief of a player. One level up the probability on the belief of other players is interpreted as beliefs on beliefs. A recursive universal construct is built—in which player have beliefs on their beliefs at different level—this construct is called the hierarchy of beliefs.

The result is a universal space of types in which, subject to specified consistency conditions, each type corresponds to the infinite hierarchy of his probabilistic beliefs about others' probabilistic beliefs. They also showed that any subspace can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a finite subspace.

Another popular example of the usage of the construction is the [[Prisoners and hats puzzle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">'''Jon Mostad''' (born 21 April 1942) is a composer from [[Fredrikstad]], [[Norway]]. He received the Norwegian state three-year scholarship for artists from 1982 until 1984.

==Musical style==
In his early compositions Mostad is moving from a linear-expressionist style to a more timbre-oriented line of thinking where both modernist and romantic music are inspiring his work. From around 1975 the timbre/harmonic aspect of his music becomes more related to the harmonic series. During the 80s and 90s he combines this with other types of modal and free compositional techniques, sometimes utilising modal techniques as well as more overtone-oriented harmonic spectra within the same composition.

At the same time he has also been experimenting with untraditional structuring of his material, both in works of one movement and in cyclical works. Many of Mostad's instrumental works as well as vocal music, are inspired by Judæo-Christian texts which often influence the structuring of the music. For instance in "And the light shines in darkness" a massive dark sounding layer with lots of rhythmical unrest gradually gets introduced to a lighter sounding chord with notes from the harmonic series.

Mostad has written chamber music, solo pieces for piano, guitar, organ and utilised electronics, both pre-recorded and live with interaction with live musicians, but his main focus has been orchestral and vocal music. His longest composition is the work "[[Were you there, when they crucified my Lord?]]" for choir, recitation, solo voices and orchestra.

==Performances==
The music of Jon Mostad has been played by leading orchestras in Norway (Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim...) as well as performed at [[Bergen International Festival]], the Elverum Festival, Music Factory in Bergen and Dartington International Summer School in Totnes, England among other festivals. In 2010 he was featured composer of the Vinteriss festival in [[Østfold]] (a region in Norway). He has been represented at [[Nordic Music Days]] and has been played on radio in the [[Nordic countries]], former Jugoslavia and England. His "2 psalms" for choir has been sung numerous times in Japan, England and Norway.

Mostad's music has also been performed by local amateur ensembles. Music ranging from small chamber pieces to the multimedia show [[Terje Vigen]] based on texts by [[Henrik Ibsen]] and theatrical music for Ibsen's [[Peer Gynt]] were written for local ensembles in [[Fredrikstad]].

Mostad has also got commissions from Ny Musikk, [[NRK]] radio and TV, Ungdomssymfonikerne, Det Norske Blåseensemble, Amsterdams Gitaartrio and Oslo Sinfonietta as well as from local ensembles in Fredrikstad.

Mostad plays the piano, but has seldom been involved in performing his own music. Occasionally he has improvised pre- and postludes when susbtituting as organist in local churches and from time to time he has also played some of his smaller works for piano (with or without electronics) live at concerts. During the 2010 Vinterriss festival he was playing the live electronics part at the premiere of his piece "Ikke helt solo" ("not quite solo") for cello and quadrophonic live electronics.

==Recordings==
The music of Jon Mostad has been recorded by [[The norwegian Soloist's choir]], The [[Oslo Philharmonic]], [[Øystein Birkeland]] and [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]]. His orchestral works "House", "The light shines in darkness" and "Concerto for cello and orchestra" were chosen by a jury of the [[Norwegian Society of Composers]] to be recorded on the Aurora label, resulting in the CD "The light shines in darkness" with [[Oslo Philharmonic]], cellist [[Øystein Birkeland]] and conductor [[Michel Swierczewski]].

==Education==
Theological candidate 1965. Music and pedagogy 1969. Diploma in composition at the [[Norwegian Academy of Music]] (ending in 1974). Main teacher: [[Finn Mortensen]]. An important inspiration during his studies were the private seminars in sonology and on Mahler by [[Olav Anton Thommessen]]. Shorter courses in studio work at NSEM, Høvikodden (1975/76), EMS [[Stockholm]] (1983).

==Other activities==
In addition to composing, Jon Mostad was teaching arrangement and composition, music and religion at high schools in [[Fredrikstad]] and [[Moss]] (years 10-12 or 11-13 in the Norwegian school system) until he retired in 2006. Among his many students were film director [[Harald Zwart]] and composer [[Frank Tveor Nordensten]].

He has also been active in organisations such as Ny Musikk Østfold, the regional branch of an organisation promoting contemporary music, [[Norwegian Society of Composers]] and [[TONO]].

Mostad is a devout Lutheran and has done volunteer work in Christian organisations such as being a Sunday school teacher, visiting prisoners, helping find funding and equipment for a hospital in Nigeria and delivering humanitarian aid to a village in Russia shortly after the fall of the Soviet bloc.

'''''Komunisti''''' (in {{lang-en|'''Communist'''}}), ({{lang-ka|კომუნისტი|tr}}, {{IPA-ka|kʼɔmunistʼi}}) was a daily newspaper published by the Georgian Communist Party Central Committee. The first number was issued on June 3, 1920 in [[Tbilisi]] as the daily organ of the Communist Party of Georgia and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, named "New Communist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|first government of independent Georgia]] the newspaper was named "Georgia Communist". After the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|establishment of the Soviet government in Georgia]] on March 2, 1921, it was renamed ''Komunisti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Komunisti'' reflected all the important periods of the history of the Georgian SSR, supporting the CPSU and the Government's decisions. The newspaper covered topics about policy, economics, industry, agriculture, literature, arts, education and other issues. The newspaper had its additions – journals ''Torch'' (1923–1925), ''Science and Technology'' (1925–1926), ''Flag'' (1929–1934), and ''Agriculture'' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Korean drama]]s started broadcasting in the [[Philippines]] since 2003, beginning with [[GMA Network]] airing ''[[Successful Story of a Bright Girl|Bright Girl]]''.

Most media broadcasters in the Philippines airing Korean dramas are ABS-CBN, GMA and The 5 Network, as well as minor TV network [[Net 25]] and government channel [[People's Television Network|PTV]], among others. All Korean dramas go through the process of localization: re-dubbing, pre-editing, post-editing and finalization before going on-air.

==History==
Korean dramas began airing in the Philippines in 2003, with shows such as ''[[Successful Story of a Bright Girl|Bright Girl]]'', ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]'', ''[[Lovers in Paris]]'' and ''[[My Girl (2005 TV series)|My Girl]]''.

Korean dramas have become hits since the 2000s, excluding Japanese dramas. The huge demand from viewers for Korean dramas has prompted Philippine TV stations to import Korean, Taiwanese and Chinese dramas only. Top Korean drama series ''[[Lovers in Paris]]'', ''[[Full House (South Korean TV series)|Full House]]'', ''[[My Lovely Sam Soon|My Name Is Kim Sam Soon]]'', ''[[Stairway to Heaven (2003 TV series)|Stairway to Heaven]]'' and ''[[The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince|Coffee Prince]]'' were imported and dubbed in Filipino language, instantly becoming hits. The success of ''[[Dae Jang Geum|Jewel in the Palace]]'' in Korea was also replicated in the Philippines and many other Asian countries.

The Taiwanese drama ''[[Meteor Garden]]'' was also a ratings success when it first aired on ABS-CBN in 2003. Its remake, the Korean ''[[Boys Over Flowers (TV series)|Boys Over Flowers]]'', starring [[Lee Min-ho (actor born 1987)|Lee Min Ho]], [[Kim Hyun-joong|Kim Hyun Joong]], [[Kim Bum]], [[Kim Joon]], [[Kim So-eun|Kim So Eun]] and [[Ku Hye-sun|Koo Hye Sun]], also succeeded in capturing audiences. It was aired in the Philippines from May to August 2009 and became a phenomenal success.

The 5 Network, the third largest network in the country, aired Korean dramas such as ''[[Hero (2009 TV series)|Hero]]'' and ''[[Queen of Housewives|My Wife is a Superwoman]]'', together with the Taiwanese drama ''Easy Fortune Happy Life'', Israeli drama ''[[Split (TV series)|Split]]'', and primetime variety show ''[[Wil Time Bigtime|Willing Willie]]'' hosted by [[Willie Revillame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/6170/tv5-brings-top-hit-my-wife-is-a-superwoman-and-two-more-asian-drama-titles-on-primetime, TV5 brings top hit My Wife is a Superwoman and two more Asian drama titles on primetime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/6367/international-hit-vampire-series-invades-the-philippines|title=International hit vampire series invades the Philippines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a The 5 Network representative said that instead of putting all their own Korean dramas in primetime, they've decided to move it on noontime: "''It's actually the strategy of TV5 to do counter-programming. When everyone else is going high-energy with noontime shows, here we are offering the best titles of Koreanovelas on noontime. It's like it will be our primetime. We want to provide an alternative.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/5744/tv5s-koreanovelas-offer-alternative-to-noontime-shows, TV5's koreanovelas offer alternative to noontime shows]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past years, ABS-CBN has aired a score of Korean dramas, including ''[[Marrying a Millionaire]]'', ''[[The 101st Proposal|101st Proposal]]'', ''[[Green Rose]]'', ''[[Boys Over Flowers (TV series)|Boys Over Flowers]]'', ''[[Lovers in Paris]]'', ''[[You're Beautiful|He's Beautiful]]'', ''[[Heartstrings (TV series)|Heartstings]]'', ''[[City Hunter (TV series)|City Hunter]]'', ''[[Something Happened in Bali|Memories of Bali]]'', ''[[Rooftop Prince]]'', ''[[Missing You (2013 TV series)|Missing You]]'', ''[[Princess Hours]]'', ''[[My Girlfriend is a Nine-Tailed Fox|My Girlfriend is a Gumiho]]'', ''[[Dream High]]'', ''[[My Girl (2005 TV series)|My Girl]]'', ''[[Fated to Love You (2014 TV series)|Fated to Love You]]'', ''[[My Lovely Girl]]'', ''[[When a Man Falls in Love]]'', ''[[That Winter, the Wind Blows]]'', ''[[The Heirs]]'', ''[[Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth|Hwarang]]'', ''[[Love in the Moonlight]]'', ''[[The Legend of the Blue Sea|Legend of the Blue Sea]]'', ''[[Guardian: The Lonely and Great God|Goblin]]'', ''[[Black (TV series)|Black]]'', ''[[A Korean Odyssey|Hwayugi]]'', and many more.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/09/117_51344.html, Korean Dramas Continue to Captivate the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magic Lantern.jpg|thumb|19th century magic lantern with printed slide inserted (upright, so if the lantern were lit it would project an inverted picture)]]
[[File:Magic lantern slide Carpenter and Westley.jpg|thumb|Magic lantern slide by [[Carpenter and Westley]]]]

The '''magic lantern''', also known by its Latin name '''lanterna magica''', is an early type of [[image projector]] employing pictures painted, printed or produced [[photograph]]ically on transparent plates (usually made of glass), one or more [[lens (optics)|lens]]es, and a light source. It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly applied to educational purposes during the 19th century. Since the late 19th century smaller versions were also mass-produced as a toy for children. The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century, when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35&amp;nbsp;mm photographic slides: the [[slide projector]].

==Technology==

===Apparatus===
[[File:1721? Jacob 's Gravesande - Physices Elementa Mathematica.jpg|thumb|A page of [[Willem 's Gravesande]]'s 1720 book ''Physices Elementa Mathematica'' with Jan van Musschenbroek's magic lantern projecting a monster. The depicted lantern is one of the oldest known to be preserved and is in the collection of [[Museum Boerhaave]], Leiden]]
The magic lantern used a concave mirror in back of a light source to direct as much of the light as possible through a small rectangular sheet of glass—a "lantern slide"—on which was the image to be projected, and onward into a lens at the front of the apparatus. The lens was adjusted to optimally focus the plane of the slide at the distance of the projection screen, which could be simply a white wall, and it therefore formed an enlarged image of the slide on the screen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pfragner, Julius. "An Optician Looks for Work". The Motion Picture: From Magic Lantern to Sound. Great Britain: Bailey Brothers and Swinfen Ltd. 9-21. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some lanterns, including those of Christiaan Huygens and Jan van Musschenbroek, used 3 lenses.

===Slides===
Originally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides. Initially figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used. Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper. Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light, so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames. Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer, but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect the painted layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm|title=All about lantern slides (1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most hand-made slides were mounted in wood frames with a round or square opening for the picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen2_uk.htm|title=All about magic lantern slides (2)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10 Story about a boy falling in a barrel of honey.JPG|thumb|left|A paper rimmed mass-produced slide.]]
After 1820 the manufacturing of hand colored printed slides started, often making use of [[decalcomania]] transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/platen1_uk.htm#decal|title=All about lantern slides (1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.

The first photographic lantern slides, called "Hyalotypes", were invented by the German-born brothers Ernst Wilhelm (William) and Friedrich (Frederick) Langenheim in 1848 in [[Philadelphia]] and patented in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US7784|title=U.S. Patent US7784 A: Improvement in photographic pictures on glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/23363210/Glass_Transparencies_Marketing_Photographys_Luminosity_and_Precision_2016_|title=Glass Transparencies: Marketing Photography’s Luminosity and Precision|last=[[Kim Timby|Timby]]|first=[[Kim Timby|Kim]]|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Camera: William and Frederick Langenheim|url=http://historiccamera.com/cgi-bin/librarium2/pm.cgi?action=app_display&amp;app=datasheet&amp;app_id=1799&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light sources===
Apart from sunlight, the only light sources available at the time of invention in the 17th century were candles and oil lamps, which were very inefficient and produced very dim projected images. The invention of the [[Argand lamp]] in the 1790s helped to make the images brighter. The invention of [[limelight]] in the 1820s made them very much brighter. The invention of the intensely bright electric [[arc lamp]] in the 1860s eliminated the need for combustible gases or hazardous chemicals, and eventually the incandescent electric lamp further improved safety and convenience, although not brightness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Waddington, Damer. "Introduction". Panoramas, Magic Lanterns and Cinemas. Channel Islands, NJ: Tocan Books. xiii-xv. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
{{further information|projector}}
Several types of projection systems existed before the invention of the magic lantern. [[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] and [[Cornelis Drebbel]] did even describe and/or draw image projectors that may have been quite similar to the magic lantern.

In the 17th century there was an immense interest in optics. The [[telescope]] and [[microscope]] were invented (in 1608 and the 1620s respectively) and apart from being useful to some scientists, such instruments were especially popular as entertaining curiosities with people who could afford them.&lt;ref name=rossell2002&gt;{{cite web|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002|title=The Magic Lantern|url=https://www.academia.edu/345943/The_Magic_Lantern}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magic lantern would prove to be a perfect successor.

===Camera obscura===
The magic lantern can be seen as a further development of [[camera obscura]]. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. It was known at least since the 5th century BCE and experimented with in darkened rooms at least since circa 1000&amp;nbsp;CE. The use of a lens in the hole has been traced back to circa 1550. The portable camera obscura box with a lens was developed in the 17th century.

[[File:1645 kircher - steganographia.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Kircher's Steganographic mirror in his 1645 book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'']]
The 1645 first edition of German Jesuit scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' included a description of his invention, the "Steganographic Mirror": a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long distance communication. He saw limitations in the increase of size and diminished clarity over a long distance and expressed his hope that someone would find a method to improve on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hUvNnJteew4C&amp;pg=RA1-PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|page=912|year=1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1654 Belgian Jesuit mathematician [[André Tacquet]] used Kircher's technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary [[Martino Martini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch, Latin|title=De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 10|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001199401_01/_zev001199401_01_0033.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes reported that Martini lectured throughout Europe with a magic lantern which he might have imported from China, but there's no evidence that anything other than Kircher's technique was used. However, Tacquet was a correspondent and friend of [[Christiaan Huygens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossell|first=Deac|title=Laterna Magica - Magic Lantern: Vol. 1|year=2008|publisher=Füsslin Verlag|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may thus have been a very early adapter of the magic lantern technique that Huygens developed around this period.

==Invention==
===Christiaan Huygens===

[[File:1659 huygens - figure1.jpg|thumbnail|left|Huygens' 1659 sketches for a projection of Death taking off his head]]
Prominent Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], is nowadays widely accepted as the true inventor of the magic lantern. He knew [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s 1645 edition of ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k778725|title=Oeuvres complètes de Christiaan Huygens. Supplémént à la correspondance varia. Biographie de Chr. Huygens. Catalogue de la vente des livres de Chr. Huygens / publ. par la Société hollandaise des sciences|first=Christiaan (1629-1695) Auteur du texte|last=Huygens|date=|publisher=M. Nijhoff|via=gallica.bnf.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight. Christiaan's father Constantijn had been acquainted with Cornelis Drebbel who used some unidentified optical techniques to transform himself and summon wonderful appearances in magical performances. Constantijn Huygens wrote very enthusiastically about a camera obscura device that he got from Drebbel in 1622.

The oldest known document concerning the magic lantern is a page on which Christiaan Huygens made ten small sketches of a skeleton taking off its skull, above which he wrote "for representations by means of convex glasses with the lamp" (translated from French). As this page was found between documents dated in 1659, it is believed to also have been made in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christiaan|last=Huygens|title=Pour des representations par le moyen de verres convexes à la lampe|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv22_01/huyg003oeuv22_01_0093.php|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens soon seemed to regret this invention, as he thought it was too frivolous. In a 1662 letter to his brother [[Lodewijck Huygens|Lodewijk]] he claimed he thought of it as some old "bagatelle" and seemed convinced that it would harm the family's reputation if people found out the lantern came from him. Christiaan had reluctantly sent a lantern to their father, but when he realized that Constantijn intended to show the lantern to the court of King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the Louvre, Christiaan asked Lodewijk to sabotage the lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christiaan |last=Huygens |date=19 April 1662 |title=letter to Lodewijk Huygens |language=French |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv04_01/huyg003oeuv04_01_0059.php#z1005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiaan initially referred to the magic lantern as "la lampe" and "la lanterne", but in the last years of his life he used the then common term "laterna magica" in some notes. In 1694 he drew the principle of a "laterna magica" with two lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christiaan|last=Huygens|date=1694|title=Aanhangsel II bij het eerste Complement van de Dioptrica |language=Dutch |url=https://adcs.home.xs4all.nl/Huygens/13/compl-v.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walgensten, the Dane===
[[File:1674 Dechales - Cursus seu mundus mathematicus - Laterna Magica.jpg|thumb|left|Walgensten's magic lantern as illustrated in [[Claude Dechales]] ''Cursus seu mundus mathematicus - Tomus secundus'' (1674)]]
Thomas Rasmussen Walgensten (c. 1627 – 1681), a mathematician from [[Gotland]], studied at the [[Leiden University|university of Leyden]] in 1657–58. He possibly met Christiaan Huygens during this time (and/or on several other occasions) and may have learned about the magic lantern from him. Correspondence between them is known from 1667. At least from 1664 until 1670 Walgensten was demonstrating the magic lantern in Paris (1664), Lyon (1665), Rome (1665-66) and Copenhagen (1670).&lt;ref name=rossell2002 /&gt; He "sold such lanterns to different Italian princes in such an amount that they now are almost everyday items in Rome" according to Athanasius Kircher in 1671.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonurgia.se/rendel/mageng.html|title=mageng.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1670 Walgensten projected an image of Death at the court of [[King Frederick III of Denmark]]. This scared some courtiers, but the king dismissed their cowardice and requested to repeat the figure three times. The king died a few days later. After Walgensten died, his widow sold his lanterns to the Danish Royal collection, but they have not been preserved.&lt;ref name=rossell2002/&gt; Walgensten is credited with coining the term "Laterna Magica",&lt;ref name="magiclantern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/history/history04.php|website=magiclantern.org.uk|title=An Introduction to Lantern History: The Magic Lantern Society|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; assuming he communicated this name to [[Claude Dechales]] who in 1674 published about the machine of the "erudite Dane" that he had seen in 1665 in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cursus seu mundus mathematicus - Tomus primus|language=Latin|last=Dechales|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=vSNZjGNDZ0UC&amp;lpg=PA655&amp;ots=qy_uGEsmjd&amp;dq=dechales%20%22laterna%20magica%22&amp;pg=PA655#v=onepage&amp;q=laterna%20magica&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cursus seu mundus mathematicus - Tomus secundus|last=Dechales|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=s1w2Zb7NZV0C&amp;pg=PA665#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=Latin|year=1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible German origins: Wiesel and Griendel===
[[File:1676 Johann Christoph Sturm - Griendel's lantern.jpg|thumb|Illustration of an early southern German lantern from Sturm's '' Collegium experimentale sive curiosum'' (1677)]]
There are many gaps and uncertainties in the magic lantern's recorded history. A separate early magic lantern tradition seems to have been developed in southern Germany and includes lanterns with horizontal cylindrical bodies, while Walgensten's lantern and probably Huygens' both had vertical bodies. This tradition can be traced back to 1671 with the arrival of instrument maker Johann Franz Griendel in the city of [[Nuremberg|Nürnberg]], which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. Griendel was indicated as the inventor of the magic lantern by Johann Christoph Kohlhans in a 1677 publication.&lt;ref name=Rossell2009 /&gt; It has been suggested that this tradition is older and that instrument maker Johann Wiesel (1583–1662) from [[Augsburg]] may have been making magic lanterns earlier on and possibly inspired Griendel and even Huygens. Huygens is known to have studied samples of Wiesel's lens-making and instruments since 1653. Wiesel did make a ship's lantern around 1640 that has much in common with the magic lantern design that Griendel would later apply: a horizontal cylindrical body with a rosette chimney on top, a concave mirror behind a fixture for a candle or lamp inside and a biconvex lens at the front. There is no evidence that Wiesel actually ever made a magic lantern, but in 1674 his successor offered a variety of magic lanterns from the same workshop. This successor is thought to have only continued producing Wiesel's designs after his death in 1662, without adding anything new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/20378426/The_Origins_of_the_Magic_Lantern_in_Germany_an_example_of_the_use_and_mis-use_of_technology_in_media_history|title=The Origins of the Magic Lantern in Germany|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further history==
Before 1671 only a small circle of people seemed to have knowledge of the magic lantern, and almost every known report of the device from this period had to do with people that were more or less directly connected to Christiaan Huygens. Despite the rejection expressed in his letters to his brother, Huygens must have familiarized several people with the lantern. 

In 1664 Parisian engineer [[Pierre Petit (engineer)|Pierre Petit]] wrote to Huygens to ask for some specifications of the lantern, because he was trying to construct one after seeing the lantern of "the dane" (probably Walgensten). The lantern that Petit was constructing had a concave mirror behind the lamp.&lt;ref name=Petit/&gt; This directed more light through the lens, resulting in a brighter projection, and it would become a standard part of most of the lanterns that were made later. Petit may have copied it from Walgensten, but he expressed that he made a lamp stronger than any he had ever seen.

Since 1661 Huygens corresponded with London optical instrument-maker [[Richard Reeve]].&lt;ref name=rossell2002/&gt; Reeve was soon selling magic lanterns, demonstrated one in his shop on 17 May 1663 to [[Balthasar de Monconys]]&lt;ref name="picturegoing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picturegoing.com/?p=4885|website=picturegoing.com|title=Journal des voyages de Monsieur de Monconys &amp;raquo; Picturegoing|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold one to [[Samuel Pepys]] in August 1666.&lt;ref name="pepysdiary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/19/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Sunday 19 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pepysdiary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/08/22/|website=pepysdiary.com|title=Wednesday 22 August 1666 (The Diary of Samuel Pepys)|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Optic Projection fig 404.jpg|thumbnail|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of hellfire or purgatory]]
[[File:1671 kircheri - ars magna lucis et umbrae - 769.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from Kircher's 1671 ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae'' - projection of Death]]
One of Christiaan Huygens' contacts imagined how [[Athanasius Kircher]] would use the magic lantern: "If he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv03_01/huyg003oeuv03_01_0031.php#191T|title=letter from Pierre Guisony to Christiaan Huygens |date=25 March 1660 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as "Lucerna Magica" in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae''.&lt;ref name="ars magna"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gki6ZIbrgQ8C|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|first=Athanasius|last=Kircher|year=1671|language=latin |accessdate=19 August 2010 |pages=767=769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern. Kircher described this improved lantern, but it was illustrated in a confusing manner:&lt;ref name=Rendel /&gt; the pictures seem technically incorrect with both the projected image and the transparencies (H) shown upright (while the text states that they should be drawn in an inverted position), the hollow mirror is too high in one picture and absent in the other, and the lens (I) seems to be placed at the wrong side of the slide. However, experiments with a construction as illustrated in Kircher's book proved that it could work as a point light-source projection system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/kircher_uk.htm|title=The mystery of the wrongly placed lenses (luikerwaal.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The projected image in one of the illustrations shows a person in purgatory or hellfire and the other depicts Death with a scythe and an hourglass. According to legend Kircher secretly used the lantern at night to project the image of Death on windows of apostates to scare them back into church.&lt;ref name=luikerwaal&gt;{{cite web|title=The miracle of the magic lantern|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wonder1_uk.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kircher did suggest in his book that an audience would be more astonished by the sudden appearance of images if the lantern would be hidden in a separate room, so the audience would be ignorant of the cause of their appearance.&lt;ref name=Rendel&gt;{{cite web|last2=Rendel|first2=Mats|first1=Athanasius|last1=Kircher|title=About the Construction of The Magic Lantern, or The Sorcerers Lamp|url=http://www.phonurgia.se/rendel/mageng.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fotothek df tg 0003764 Optik ^ Lochkamera.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a lantern slide depicting Bacchus in Sturm's ''Collegium experimentale sive curiosum'' (1677)]]
The earliest reports and illustrations of lantern projections suggest that they were all intended to scare the audience. Pierre Petit called the apparatus "lanterne de peur" (lantern of fear) in his 1664 letter to Huygens.&lt;ref name=Petit&gt;{{cite web|last=Petit|first=Pierre|title=letter to Christiaan Huygens|date=28 November 1664 |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv04_01/huyg003oeuv04_01_0132.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving lantern plates and descriptions from the next decades prove that the new medium was not just used for horror shows, but that all kinds of subjects were projected. In 1675 Wilhelm Leibniz saw an important role for the magic lantern in a plan for a kind of world exhibition with projections of "attempts at flight, artistic meteors, optical effects, representations of the sky with the star and comets, and a model of the earth (...), fireworks, water fountains, and ships in rare forms; then mandrakes and other rare plants and exotic animals." In 1685/6 Johannes Zahn was an early advocate for use of the device for educational purposes: detailed anatomical illustrations were difficult to draw on a chalkboard, but could easily be copied onto glass or mica.&lt;ref name=rossell2002/&gt;

[[File:Études prises dans le bas peuple ou les Cris de Paris - Lorgue de Barberie.jpg|thumb|1737 etching/engraving of an organ grinder with a magic lantern on her back by [[Anne Claude de Caylus]] (after Edme Bouchardon)]]
By the 1730s the use of magic lanterns started to become more widespread when travelling showmen, conjurers and storytellers added them to their repertoire. The travelling lanternists were often called Savoyards (they supposedly came from the Savoy region in France) and became a common sight in many European cities.&lt;ref name=rossell2002/&gt;

In France in the 1770s [[François Dominique Séraphin]] used magic lanterns to perform his "Ombres Chinoises" (Chinese shadows), a form of [[shadow play]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Magic lanterns had also become a staple of science lecturing and museum events since Scottish lecturer [[Henry Moyes]]’s tour of America in 1785–86, when he recommended that all college laboratories procure one. French writer and educator [[Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis]] popularized the use of magic lanterns as an educational tool in the late 1700s when using projected images of plants to teach botany. Her educational methods were published in America in English translation during the early 1820s.&lt;ref name="mitpressjournals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/TNEQ_a_00418|website=mitpressjournals.org|title=MIT Press Journals|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A type of lantern was constructed by Moses Holden between 1814 and 1815 for illustrating his astronomical lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Holden, Moses (DNB00) - Wikisource, the free online library|url = https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Holden,_Moses_(DNB00)|website = en.m.wikisource.org |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821 Philip Carpenter's London company, that would become [[Carpenter and Westley]] after his death, started manufacturing a sturdy but lightweight and transportable "Phantasmagoria lantern" with an Argand style lamp, which produced high quality projections and was suitable for use in classrooms. Carpenter also developed a "secret" copper plate printing/burning process to mass-produce glass lantern slides with printed outlines, which were then easily and quickly hand painted ready for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianmicroscopeslides.com/pdf/pcarpenter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007153815/http://www.victorianmicroscopeslides.com/pdf/pcarpenter.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These "copper-plate sliders" contained three or four very detailed 4" circular images mounted in thin hardwood frames. The first known set ''The Elements of Zoology'' became available in 1823, showing over 200 images in 56 frames of zoological figures, classified according to the system of the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]]. The same year many other slides appeared in the company's catalogue: "The Kings and Queens of England" (9 sliders taken from David Hume’s History of England), "Astronomical Diagrams and Constellations" (9 sliders taken from Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel’s textbooks), "Views and Buildings", Ancient and Modern Costume (62 sliders from various sources).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Carpenter, 1823, A Companion to the Magic Lantern: Part II.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen sliders of the category "Humorous" provided some entertainment, but the focus on education was obvious and very successful.

The mass production of slides also meant that the magic lantern now became affordable to the common men, opening a market for smaller lanterns with smaller glass sliders which instead of wooden frames usually had colorful strips of paper glued around their edges.

Although the popularity of magic lanterns waned after the introduction of [[film|movies]] in the 1890s, they remained a common medium until [[slide projector]]s came into widespread use during the 1950s.

==Moving images==
[[File:1870 Plaque de lanterne magique a double systeme--c5620.jpg|thumb|Mice jump into the mouth of a sleeping bearded man on a popular mechanical slide from circa 1870.]]
The magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images.

Some suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern "animations" used two glass slides projected together - one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.

Motion in animated slides was mostly limited to either two phases of a movement or transformation, or a more gradual singular movement (e.g. a train passing through a landscape). These limitations made subjects with repetitive movements popular, like the sails on a windmill turning around or children on a seesaw. Movements could be repeated over and over and could be performed at different speeds.

A common technique that is comparable to the effect of a panning camera makes use of a long slide that is simply pulled slowly through the lantern and usually shows a landscape, sometimes with several phases of a story within the continuous backdrop.

Movement of projected images was also possible by moving the magic lantern itself. This became a staple technique in [[phantasmagoria]] shows in the late 18th century, often with the lantern sliding on rails or riding on small wheels and hidden from the view of the audience behind the projection screen.

===History===
In 1645 Kircher had already suggested projecting live insects and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror in his Steganographic system to perform dramatic scenes.&lt;ref name=Gorman2007&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P333.PDF|page=44|title=Inside the Camera Obscura|first=Michael John|last=Gorman|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches (see above) suggest he intended to [[animation|animate]] the skeleton to have it take off its head and place it back on its neck. This can be seen as an indication that the very first magic lantern demonstrations may already have included projections of simple animations.&lt;ref name=Rossell2005/&gt;

In 1668 [[Robert Hooke]] wrote about the effects of a type of magic lantern installation: "Spectators not well versed in optics, that should see the various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions that may this way be represented, would readily believe them to be supernatural and miraculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=92lnIw3oKGMC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;ots=Ym_S2RrJ4U&amp;dq=It+produces+Effects+not+only+very+delightful,+but+to+such+as+know+the+contrivance,+very+wonderful;+so+that+Spectators,+not+well+versed+in+Opticks,&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, from Their Commencement in 1665 to the Year 1800|author=|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1675 German polymath and philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] proposed a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should open and close with magic lantern shows, including subjects "which can be dismembered, to represent quite extraordinary and grotesque movements, which men would not be capable of making" (translated from French).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/379115/Leibniz_and_the_Lantern|title=Leibniz and the Lantern|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dr%C3%B4le_de_Pens%C3%A9e,_touchant_une_nouvelle_sorte_de_repr%C3%A9sentations|year=1675|title=Drôle de Pensée, touchant une nouvelle sorte de représentations|author1=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reports of early magic lantern screenings possibly described moving pictures, but are not clear enough to conclude whether the viewers saw animated slides or motion depicted in still images.&lt;ref name=Rossell2005/&gt;

In 1698 German engraver and publisher [[Christoph Weigel the Elder|Johann Christoph Weigel]] described several lantern slides with mechanisms that made glass parts move over one fixed glass slide, for instance by the means of a silk thread, or grooves in which the mobile part slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|title=Light and Movement|last1=Mannoni|last2=Campagnoni|last3=Robinson|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1709 a German optician and glass grinder named Themme (or Temme) made moving lantern slides, including a carriage with rotating wheels, a cupid with a spinning wheel, a shooting gun and falling bombs. Wheels were cut from the glass plate with a diamond and rotated by a thread that was spun around small brass wheels attached to the glass wheels. A paper slip mask would be quickly pulled away to reveal the red fiery discharge and the bullet from a shooting gun. [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]] visited Themme's shop and liked the effects, but was disappointed about the very simple mechanisms. Nonetheless he bought seven moving slides, as well as twelve slides with four pictures each, which he thought were delicately painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZX5dAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;ots=M30ocyCaf3&amp;dq=Uffenbach%20themme&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=zauber&amp;f=false|last=Von Uffenbach|title=Merkwürdige Reisen durch Niedersachsen, Holland und Engelland - Erster Theil|pages=62–63|year=1753|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several types of mechanical slides were described and illustrated in Dutch professor of mathematics, physics, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]]'s second edition (1739) of ''Beginsels Der Natuurkunde''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Js1WAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA627#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Beginsels Der Natuurkunde|year=1739|last=Van Musschenbroek|first=Pieter|page=617+633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieter was the brother of Jan van Musschenbroek, the maker of an outstanding magic lantern with excellent lenses and a diaphragm (see illustration above).&lt;ref name=Rossell2005/&gt;

In 1770 [[Edmé-Gilles Guyot]] described a method of using two slides for the depiction of a storm at sea, with waves on one slide and ships and a few clouds on another. Lanternists could project the illusion of mild waves turning into a wild sea tossing the ships around by increasing the movement of the separate slides. Guyot also detailed how projection on smoke could be used to create the illusion of ghosts hovering in the air, which would become a technique commonly used in [[phantasmagoria]].&lt;ref name=Rossell2005&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/341263/The_Magic_Lantern_and_Moving_Images_before_1800|first=Deac|last=Rossell|title=The Magic Lantern and Moving Images before 1800|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An especially intricate multiple rackwork mechanism was developed to show the movements of the planets (sometimes accompanied by revolving satellites) revolving around the sun. In 1795 one M. Dicas seems to have offered an early magic lantern system, the Lucernal or Portable Eidouranian, that showed the orbiting planets. From around the 1820s mechanical astronomical slides became quite common.&lt;ref name="The Magic Lantern Society p. 21-22"&gt;The Magic Lantern Society. ''Encyclopedia of the Magic Lantern''. p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Various types of mechanical slides===

Various types of mechanisms were commonly used to add movement to the projected image:
*'''slipping slides''': a movable glass plate with one or more figures (or any part of a picture for which movement was desired) was slipped over a stationary one, directly by hand or with a small drawbar (see: Fig. 7 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a tightrope walker sliding across the rope). A common example showed a creature that could move the pupils in its eyes, as if it was looking in all directions. A long piece of glass could show a procession of figures, or a train with several wagons. Quite convincing illusions of moving waves on a seas or lake have also been achieved with this method.&lt;ref name=luikerbew1&gt;{{cite web|title=Luikerwaal - Mechanical Slides |url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/bewegend1_uk.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''slipping slides with masking''': black paint on portions of the moving plate would mask parts of the underlying image - with a black background - on the stationary glass. This made it possible to hide and then reveal the previous position of a part, for instance a limb, to suggest repetitious movement. The suggested movement would be rather jerky and usually operated quickly. Masking in slides was also often used to create change rather than movement (see: Fig. 6 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a man, his wig and his hat): for instance a person's head could be replaced with that of an animal. More gradual and natural movement was also possible; for instance to make a nose grow very long by slowly moving a masking glass.
*'''lever slides''': the moving part was operated by a lever. These could show a more natural movement than slipping slides and were mostly used for repetitive movements, for instance a woodcutter raising and lowering his axe, or a girl on a swing.&lt;ref name=luikerbew1/&gt; (see: Fig. 5 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a drinking man raising and lowering his glass + Fig. 8: a lady curtsying)
*'''pulley slides''': a pulley rotates the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wipwaps01_uk.htm|title=Magic lantern - collection of moving magic lantern slides part 1.|publisher=Luikerwaal }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see: fig. 4 on illustration by Van Musschenbroek)
*'''rack and pinion slides''': turning the handle of a rackwork would rotate or lift the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill or for having a hot air balloon take off and descend. A more complex astronomical rackwork slide showed the planets and their satellites orbiting around the sun.&lt;ref name=luikerbew1/&gt;
*'''fantoccini slides''': jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels. A popular version had a somersaulting monkey with arms attached to mechanism that made it tumble with dangling feet. Named after the Italian word for animated puppets, like marionettes or [[Jumping jack (toy)|jumping jacks]]. Two different British patents for slides with moving jointed figures were granted in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/fantoccini1_uk.htm|title=Luikerwaal - Fantoccini Slides}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a snow effect slide can add snow to another slide (preferably of a winter scene) by moving a flexible loop of material pierced with tiny holes in front of one of the lenses of a double or triple lantern.&lt;ref name="luikerwaal.com"/&gt;

Mechanical slides with abstract special effects include:

*the '''Astrometeoroscope''' or Astrometroscope: a large slide that projected a lacework of dots forming constantly changing geometrical line patterns, compared with stars and meteors. It was invented in or before 1858 by the Hungarian engineer S. Pilcher and used a very ingenious mechanism with two metal plates obliquely crossed with slits that moved to and fro in contrary directions. Except for when the only known example was used in a performance, it was kept locked away at the Polytechnic so no one could discover the secret technique. When the Polytechnic auctioned the device, Picher eventuaslly paid an extravagant price for his own invention in order to keep is workings secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924031248051|title=The book of lantern ; being a practical guide to the working of the optical (or magic) lantern ; with full and precise directions for making and colouring lantern pictures|first=Thomas Cradock|last=Hepworth|date=22 May 1888|publisher=London : Wyman &amp; Sons|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=xiYynDew1pUC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=astrometroscope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic2YiN6JrXAhUIiRoKHb9wCawQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=astrometroscope&amp;f=false|title=Popular Educator a Complete Encyclopaedia of Elementary, Advanced, and Technical Education|author=|date=22 May 2018|publisher=Cassell|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolving views===
{{main article|Dissolving views}}
[[File:Magiclantern.jpg|thumb|Advertisement with picture of a triple lantern / dissolving view apparatus (1886)]]
The effect of a gradual transition from one image to another, known as a [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] in modern filmmaking, became the basis of a popular type of magic lantern show in England in the 19th century. Typical dissolving views showed landscapes dissolving from day to night or from summer to winter. This was achieved by aligning the projection of two matching images and slowly diminishing the first image while introducing the second image.&lt;ref name=luikerbew1/&gt; The subject and the effect of magic lantern dissolving views is similar to the popular [[Diorama]] theatre paintings which originated in Paris in 1822. The terms "dissolving views", "dioramic views", or simply "diorama" were
often used interchangeably in 19th century magic lantern broadsides.&lt;ref name=HuhtamoReview/&gt;

The effect was reportedly invented by phantasmagoria pioneer [[Paul de Philipsthal]] while in Ireland in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns to make the spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the [[Witch of Endor]]. While working out the desired effect, he got the idea of using the technique with landscapes. An 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented what was possibly a relatively early incarnation of a dissolving views show, describing it as a "a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect.”&lt;ref name=Mirror1842&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LUMFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, And Instruction|page=98|year=1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt;

Another possible inventor is [[Henry Langdon Childe]], who purportedly once worked for De Philipsthal.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt; He is said to have invented the dissolving views in 1807 and to have improved and completed the technique in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=MvBeAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&amp;pg=PA372#v=onepage&amp;q=%22henry%20langdon%20childe%22&amp;f=false|title=The Art-journal, New Series, Volume XIII|year=1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known use of the term "dissolving views" occurs on playbills for Childe's shows at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London in 1837.&lt;ref name=HuhtamoReview/&gt; Childe further popularized the dissolving views at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.&lt;ref name=Mirror1842/&gt;

Despite the later reports about the early invention and apart from De Philipsthal's 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known and in some cases confusion with the Diorama or similar media is possible. In 1826 Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry's introduced what he referred to as "Beautiful Dissolvent Scenes", "imperceptibly changing views", "dissolvent views" and "Magic Views" which were created "by Machinery invented by M. Henry". In 1827 Henry Langdon Childe presented "Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade" with a series of subjects that would become classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827 De Philipsthal returned with a show that included "various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as if it were by Magic) from one form into another".&lt;ref name=HuhtamoReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt;

Biunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views. Possibly the first horizontal biunial lantern, dubbed the "Biscenascope" was made by the optician Mr. Clarke and presented at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London on December 5, 1840.&lt;ref name=Mirror1842/&gt; The earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in Horne &amp; Thornthwaite catalogue in 1857.&lt;ref name="The Magic Lantern Society p. 21-22"/&gt; Later on triple lanterns enabled additional effects, for instance the effect of snow falling while a green landscape dissolves into a snowy winter version.

A mechanical device could be fitted on the magic lantern, which locked up a diaphragm on the first slide slowly whilst a diaphragm on a second slide was opened simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt;

Philip Carpenter's copper-plate printing process, introduced in 1823, may have made it much easier to create duplicate slides with printed outlines that could then be colored differently to create dissolving view slides.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt; However, all early dissolving view slides seem to have been hand-painted.&lt;ref name=HuhtamoReview&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ghost Notes: Reading Mervyn Heard’s Phantasmagoria. The Secret Life of the Magic Lantern|journal=The Magic Lantern Gazette|volume=18|issue=4|first=Erkki|last=Huhtamo|url=https://library.sdsu.edu/pdf/scua/ML_Gazette/MLGvol18no04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments===
There have been many different experiments involving sorts of movement with the magic lantern. These include:
*[[galvanometer]] slide: a flattened coil with a magnetized needle moving from side to side when a battery is connected.
*projection of moving frog legs, with the nerves and muscles of severed frog legs connected to electric wires.
*hour-glass projection: the projection of a flattened hourglass showed the sand flowing upwards. Extreme magnification made the effect extra impressive, with the grains of sand forming a wave-like pattern.
*cohesion figure projection of liquids: different oils and fats create all kinds of moving patterns when manipulated between clear glass plates or a narrow glass box.
Several of these experiments were publicly demonstrated at the [[University of Westminster#1837 to 1881: Royal Polytechnic Institution|Royal Polytechnic Institution]] Institution.&lt;ref name=Hepworth1888&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/bookoflanternbei00hepwrich#page/170/mode/2up|last=Hepworth|title=The book of the lantern|first=T.C.|year=1888|pages=171–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choreutoscope and phenakistiscope-type systems===
Versions of the magic lantern were used to project transparent variations of the [[phenakistoscope|phénakisticope]]. These were adapted with a mechanism that spins the disc and a shutter system. Duboscq produced some in the 1850s and Thomas Ross patented a version called "Wheel of life" in 1869 and 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelPROJECTINGpart1.htm |title=Projection Phenakistoscope 1 |first=Stephen |last=Herbert |website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Choreutoscope''' was invented around 1866 by the [[Greenwich]] engineer J. Beale and demonstrated at the Royal Polytechnic. It projected six pictures from a long slide and used a hand-cranked mechanism for intermittent movement of the slide and synchronized shutter action. The mechanism became a key to the development of the movie camera and projector. The Choreutoscope was used at the first professional public demonstration of the [[Kinetoscope]] to explain its principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=WVVX4NHS8TwC&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=choreutoscope&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Living Pictures: The Origins of the Movies|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An "Optical Instrument" was patented in the U.S. in 1869 by O.B. Brown, using a phenakistiscope-like disc with a technique very close to the later cinematograph; with Maltese Cross motion; a star-wheel and pin being used for intermittent motion, and a two-sector shutter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US93594 |title=U.S. Patent No. 93,594 |date=10 August 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in the lantern - Bio-Phantoscope===
John Arthur Roebuck Rudge built a lantern for [[William Friese-Greene]] with a mechanism to project a sequence of seven photographic slides. It was reportedly made in 1872, but also 1875 and a more likely date of 1882 have been given. The surviving slides show a man removing his head with his hands and raising the loose head. The photographed body belonged to Rudge and Friese-Greene posed for the head. The slides probably provided the very first trick photography sequence projection. Friese-Greene's demonstrated the machine in his shop, until the police ordered him to remove it when it attracted too large a crowd.&lt;ref name="cinematheque"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/fr/catalogues/appareils/collection/lanterne-de-projectionap-94-33.html|title=Lanterne de projection (AP-94-33) - Collection - Catalogue des appareils cinématographiques - La Cinémathèque française|website=cinematheque.fr|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phantasmagoria==
{{main article|Phantasmagoria}}
[[File:1867 interpretation of Robertson's Fantasmagorie.jpg|thumb|Interpretation of Robertson's Fantasmagorie from F. Marion's ''L'Optique'' (1867)]]
Phantasmagoria was a form of horror theater that used one or more magic lanterns to project frightening images, especially of ghosts. Showmen used rear projection, mobile or portable projectors and all kinds of effects to produce convincing [[necromancy|necromantic]] experiences. It was very popular in Europe from the late 18th century to well into the 19th century.

It is thought that optical devices like concave mirrors and the camera obscura have been used since antiquity to fool spectators into believing they saw real gods and spirits,&lt;ref name=Heard2006&gt;Heard, Mervyn. ''PHANTASMAGORIA: The Secret History of the Magic Lantern''. The Projection Box, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but it was the magician [[Paul Philidor|"physicist" Phylidor]] who created what must have been the first true phantasmagoria show. He probably used mobile magic lanterns with the recently invented [[Argand lamp]]&lt;ref name="Grau"&gt;[[Oliver Grau|Grau, Oliver]]. ''Remember the Phantasmagoria!'' chapter from ''MediaArtHistories'', MIT Press/Leonardo Books, 2007, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; to create his successful ''Schröpferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen'' (Schröpfer-esque and Cagiostro-esque Ghost Apparitions)&lt;ref&gt;Phylidor ''Schröpferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen'' flyer 1790&lt;/ref&gt; in Vienna from 1790 to 1792. Phylidor stated that his show of perfected apparitions revealed how charlatans like [[Johann Georg Schröpfer]] and [[Cagliostro]] had fooled their audiences. As "Paul Filidort" he presented his ''Phantasmagorie'' in Paris From December 1792 to July 1793,&lt;ref name= Rossell2001&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/4609248/The_19_Century_German_Origins_of_the_Phantasmagoria_Show|title=The_19_Century_German_Origins_of_the_Phantasmagoria_Show|last=Rossell|first=Deac|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Affiches, annonces et avis divers''. 1793-07-23&lt;/ref&gt; probably using the term for the first time. As "Paul de Philipsthal" he performed ''Phantasmagoria'' shows in Britain since 1801 with great success.

One of many showmen who were inspired by Phylidor, [[Etienne-Gaspard Robert]] became very famous with his own ''Fantasmagorie'' show in Paris from 1798 to 1803 (later performing throughout Europe and returning to Paris for a triumphant comeback in Paris in 1814). He patented a mobile "Fantascope" lantern in 1798.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt;

==Royal Polytechnic Institution shows==
Since its opening in 1838 The Royal Polytechnic Institution in London became a very popular and influential venue with all kinds of magic lantern shows as an important part of its program. At the main theatre, with 500 seats, lanternists would make good use of a battery of six large lanterns running on tracked tables to project the finely detailed images of extra large slides on the 648 square feet screen. The magic lantern was used to illustrate lectures, concerts, pantomimes and other forms of theatre. Popular magic lantern presentations included Henry Langon Childe's dissolving views, his chromatrope, phantasmagoria and mechanical slides.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=chQiAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=childe%20polytechnic&amp;pg=PA410#v=onepage&amp;q=childe%20polytechnic&amp;f=false|title=The Magazine of Science, and Schools of Art - Vol. IV|year=1843|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utushi-e==
Utushi-e is a type of magic lantern show that became popular in Japan in the 19th century. The Dutch probably introduced the magic lantern in Japan before the 1760s. A new style for magic lantern shows was introduced by Kameya Toraku I, who first performed in 1803 in [[Edo]]. Possibly the phantasmagoria shows (popular in the west at that moment) inspired the rear projection technique, moving images and ghost stories. Japanese showmen developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could move the projections of different colourful figures move around the screen at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f.waseda.jp/kusahara/Utsushi-e/What_Is_Utsushi-e.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Western techniques of mechanical slides were combined with traditional Japanese skills - especially from [[Karakuri puppet]]s - to further animate the figures and for special effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f.waseda.jp/kusahara/Utsushi-e/Taneita%28Slides%29.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Some enthusiasts claim that the brilliant quality of color in lantern slides is unsurpassed by successive projection media. The magic lantern and lantern slides are still popular with collectors and can be found in many museums. However, of the original lanterns from the first 150 years after its invention only 28 are known to still exist (as of 2009).&lt;ref name =Rossell2009&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Magic Lantern Gazette|url=https://library.sdsu.edu/pdf/scua/ML_Gazette/MLGvol21no01.pdf|last=Rossell|first=Deac|title=Early Magic Lantern Illustrations: What Can They Tell Us About Magic Lantern History?|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Museums usually prefer not to use their slides for projections, but often provide video representations of the slides.

A collaborative research project of several European universities called ''A Million Pictures'' started in June 2015 and will last until May 2018. It addresses the sustainable preservation of the massive, untapped heritage resource of the tens of thousands of lantern slides in the collections of libraries and museums across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a-million-pictures.wp.hum.uu.nl/|title= A Million Pictures (website)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genuine public lantern shows are relatively rare; several regular performers state to be the only one of their kind in their part of the world. These include Pierre Albanese and glass harmonica player [[Thomas Bloch]] live Magic Lantern/Phantasmagoria shows since 2008 in Europe&lt;ref name="thomasbloch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasbloch.net/en_performances.html|author=Thomas Bloch|title=THOMAS BLOCH ** ONDES MARTENOT - GLASSHARMONICA - CRISTAL BASCHET --- performances, ensembles...|website=thomasbloch.net|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The American Magic-Lantern Theater.&lt;ref name="magiclanternshows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiclanternshows.com/introducing.htm|website=magiclanternshows.com|title=American Magic-Lantern Theater -|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magic Lantern Society maintains a list of active lanternists, which contains more than 20 performers in the U.K. and circa eight performers in other parts of the world (Europe, U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/lanternists/index.php|title=Active Lanternists: The Magic Lantern Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MarineDepot.com''' is an [[e-commerce]] company that sells [[aquarium]] supplies for reefkeeping hobbyist and [[fishkeeping]]. It is based in [[Garden Grove, California]].&lt;ref&gt;MarineDepot.com http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/marine-depot-aquarium-supplies, Retrieved June 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded in 1997 by Ken Wong. MarineDepot.com is a subsidiary of Fins, Furs &amp; Feathers, Inc.

== History ==
In 1997, [[pre-med]] student and self-professed "reef geek"&lt;ref&gt;Rodner, Derek. http://www.reefdisorder.com/reef-blog/exclusive-interview-with-ken-won-ceo-of-marine-depot-347, Retrieved June 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Wong was frustrated: there wasn't a single fish store in [[Orange County, California]] that could satisfy all his saltwater aquarium needs under one roof. Sometimes a store wouldn't have the right product. Other times store employees were unable to answer technical questions about the products they carried. Wong often found himself [[commuting]] from store-to-store in order to find the best products, the best prices and the best advice. This gave him an idea.&lt;ref&gt;MarineDepot.com http://www.marinedepot.com/aquarium_marine_depot_newsletter_emailed_20071109-ap.html, Retrieved June 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong envisioned a one-stop shop where customers could find everything they needed, from product specifications and information on [[marine aquarium fish species]] to expert advice on the hobby and friendly, one-on-one [[technical support]]. He began contacting product [[manufacturers]] and [[Distribution (business)|distributors]] to secure inventory and, armed with some off-the-shelf software and a copy of ''[[For Dummies|HTML 4 For Dummies]]'', Wong launched the first MarineDepot.com website on January 7, 1998.

It began as a one-man operation in a one-bedroom apartment. He fielded customer service calls, packed orders, handled the books and was the company IT guy. Wong invested everything he had into his [[startup company]]. His dedication paid off: with the advent of always-on Internet technologies like [[DSL]], along with advancements in the aquarium hobby, Wong's [[small business]] grew exponentially.

Wong relocated MarineDepot.com in 1999 from his apartment to a 1,000 [[square foot]] location in a [[Santa Ana, California]] [[strip mall]]. Continued growth necessitated another move midway through 2000 to a larger 3,600 square foot location in [[Costa Mesa, California]]. Later that same year, the company moved into an even larger 5,500 square foot [[warehouse]]. In early 2001, MarineDepot.com moved into a 15,000 square foot building on [[Gene Autry]] Way in [[Anaheim, California]], down the street from [[Angel Stadium]]. The company acquired a second 9,500 square foot building to accommodate additional staff and inventory. In 2007, the company moved into its current 30,000 square foot location in [[Garden Grove, California]].

== Catalog ==
MarineDepot.com began printing a biannual product [[Mail order|catalog]] in 2002, which has since become a staple of the brand. Catalogs are mailed twice yearly to customers, usually in the fall and spring. A typical catalog contains 136 or more pages and consists of non-paid product placements accompanied by paid advertisements.

== Products ==
MarineDepot.com specializes in the sale of [[marine aquarium]] and [[reef aquarium]] supplies. They also carry an assortment of [[freshwater aquarium]] products and equipment for [[ponds]], [[water features]] and [[water gardens]]. In total, the company carries more than 7,500 products, which include the following:

[[File:Menko-square-circle-collection.jpg|thumb|Rectangular and various size round menko cards.]]
[[File:Men'uchi.jpg|thumb|Men'uchi from the Edo period.]]
'''''Menko''''' (めんこ, 面子), also known as Bettan or Patchin, is a Japanese [[card game]] played by two or more players. It is also the name of the type of cards used to play this game. Each player uses Menko cards made from thick paper or cardboard, printed on one or both sides with images from [[anime]], [[manga]], and other works. A player's card is placed on the hardwood or concrete floor and the other player throws down his card, trying to flip the other player's card with a gust of wind or by striking his card against the other card. If he succeeds, he takes both cards. The player who takes all the cards, or the one with the most cards at the game's end, wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, rebecca; ''Japanese popular prints: from votive slips to playing cards'', University of Hawaii Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8248-3083-0}} p182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shūichi Katō, Chia-ning Chang; ''A sheep's song: a writer's reminiscences of Japan and the world'', University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-520-21979-3}} p48&lt;/ref&gt;

Menko has been popular since the [[Edo period]]. They were originally known as men'uchi (面打) and were made with putting clay in molds which were then baked. Its quick and simple rules have made it popular among children of all age groups.  Because technique is just as important as power in this game, smaller children can compete fairly with older players.

The pictures on these cards reflect the popular culture of their time, and Menko cards from the past reflect important information about their era.  In the Edo and early [[Meiji period]], images like [[ninja]] and [[samurai]] were popular.  Before World War II, the most popular images were of the military, like fighter planes and battleships.  After the war, characters from [[anime]] and [[manga]] were popular, as well as [[Nippon Professional Baseball|baseball]] players.  Collectors of Japanese baseball cards collect [[baseball menko]].  In the late 1980s to early 1990s, Menko cards were decorated with [[holography|holographs]] and sparkles.

'''''Method''''' ({{ko-hhrm|메소드||Me-so-deu}}) is a 2017 South Korean [[drama film]] directed by [[Bang Eun-jin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[Cine feature] Women directors, Japan and China lead 22nd Busan International Film Festival|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/813588.html|publisher=The Hankyoreh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Park Sung-woong]], [[Yoon Seung-ah]] and Oh Seung-hoon.

==Plot==
Veteran actor Jae-ha and idol star Young-woo are cast in a stage play called ''Unchain'' as Walter and Singer, respectively. Young-woo is initially uncooperative during rehearsals, arriving late and failing to display any interest in or enthusiasm for the play. Frustrated by Young-woo's flippant attitude toward acting, Jae-ha pushes him to change his behavior. Young-Woo becomes intrigued by Jae-ha's passion for his work, and devotes himself to his role, reading books Jae-ha gives him and accompanying him on outings to find props for the play. Jae-ha's girlfriend Hee-won begins to sense the connection between the two actors as they grow closer. Jae-ha himself is increasingly tense and agitated, confused about his feelings for Young-woo, until one day he accidentally hurts Young-woo during a rehearsal. Later, he encounters Young-woo in the empty theater and the two share a kiss which is witnessed by Hee-won. The next day, Jae-ha finds Young-woo at his house and drags him into one of Hee-won's storage sheds, where Young-woo acknowledges his feelings for Jae-ha and they kiss again. The two drive to the beach together, where Young-woo posts pictures of them on Instagram which prompt rumors about the nature of their relationship. They are soon found embracing in the car by Young-woo's manager and Hee-won. Young-woo is driven away by his manager as Hee-won confronts Jae-ha about his sexuality.

The day of the press conference for ''Unchain'', Young-woo tells Jae-ha that he posted those pictures on purpose, because he wanted to share their love with the world. He asks Jae-ha if he loves Young-woo, and begs him to tell everyone about their relationship. Jae-ha does not reply, but in the press conference dismisses rumors about them by saying that they were only acting, and requesting that people stop prying into their personal lives and instead focus on the play itself. Young-woo is devastated by this and visits Jae-ha's house while he and Hee-won are sleeping. The next day, after Jae-ha leaves, Hee-won becomes aware of another person in the house, and one of her sculptures is knocked to the ground and broken.

Young-woo arrives late to the first performance of the play, and as he and Jae-ha act, Young-woo's lines suggest that he hurt Hee-won, enraging Jae-ha. He asks Jae-ha to kiss him, and when he does, Young-woo whispers to him that the kiss was not in the script. In the final scene of the play, Young-woo acts out his character's suicide, but chooses not to use the safety mechanism, which causes him to hang himself temporarily. Jae-ha holds him up until the scene ends. Jae-ha finds Young-woo unconscious, but Young-woo wakes up and tells him backstage that now he is the perfect Singer, while Jae-ha is only a mediocre Walter. Young-woo leaves after the play, and Jae-ha and Hee-won reunite.

==Reception==
Pierce Conran of ''[[Screen Anarchy]]'' said the film is director Bang's "least impressive work as it trudges through thinly drawn and tired themes". Conran also went on to write that the fact ''Method'' is a queer film is "almost irrelevant as it feels like a cheap trick to add something to a rote, forbidden-love narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Busan 2017 Review: Method Gets Booed Off the Stage|url=http://screenanarchy.com/2017/10/busan-2017-review-method-gets-booed-off-the-stage.html|website=ScreenAnarchy|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teddy bear was inspired by a cartoon by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning cartoonist [[Clifford K. Berryman]] depicting [[American president]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] having compassion for a bear at the end of an unsuccessful hunting trip in [[Mississippi]] in 1902, he was also later nicknamed "Teddy". Michtom saw the drawing and created a tiny plush bear cub which he sent to Roosevelt. After receiving permission to use Roosevelt's name,&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/aa/roosevelt/aa_roosevelt_bears_1.html| title=Teddy Bears| publisher=Library Of Congress| accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michtom put a plush bear in the shop window with a sign "Teddy's bear." After the creation of the bear in 1902, the sale of the bears was so brisk that in 1907 Michtom created the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/tr_teddy.htm True story of the Teddy Bear by The Theodore Roosevelt Association].

'''Movie Theaters and hand painted Movie Posters in Ghana''' are a cultural component of this West African state.

== History ==
In the 1980s, thanks to the invention of video recorders, the first small cinemas came up in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colourful hand painted movie posters. These were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with artists and sign painters like Daniel Anum Jasper, Heavy Jeaurs, Leonardo, Kwesi Blue, Salvation or Dallas who created for each movie a matching billboard.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe Ernie, Clive Barker: Extreme Canvas. Handpaintedd movie posters from Ghana. Los Angeles, Dilettante Press/Kesho Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sign painters ==
The artists and sign writers looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable and light linen underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This material adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints and the posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Michelle: Shocking Images: Ghanaian Painted Posters. In: Ghana, Yesterday and Today, Musée Dapper 2003, pp.353-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New developments ==
Since Ghanaians now buy or rent their films on DVD and prefer to watch them at home, they no more go to the small cinemas. Most of the movie houses had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, they rather use printed ones. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left who still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like [[Paa Joe]] or [[Kudjoe Affutu]] in painting their [[Fantasy coffin|figurative coffins]], [[Figurative palanquin|palanquins]] and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or Leonardo,&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, Regula: Hors-Champs. Genèse de l'affiche de l'exposition. Exh. Cat. Hors-champs, Atelier PréTexte Neuchâtel, 2013, pp. 218-221.&lt;/ref&gt; also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of [[contemporary African art]] where they are getting more and more attention.&lt;ref&gt;Barlovic, Ingo, Wolfgang Stäbler: Faszinierende Werbekunst: Gemalte Filmplakate aus Ghana.

[[File:Milkdrop Screenshot Mandala Chasers.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot of preset included in [[MilkDrop]], a PC based music visualization software (version 1.04d, 2001)]]
'''Music visualization''' or '''music visualisation''', a feature found in electronic music visualizers and [[media player (application software)|media player]] [[software]], generates animated [[Computer-generated imagery|imagery]] based on a piece of music.  The imagery is usually generated and rendered in real time and in a way synchronized with the music as it is played.

Visualization techniques range from simple ones (e.g., a simulation of an [[oscilloscope]] display) to elaborate ones, which often include a plurality of [[Compositing|composited]] effects.  The changes in the music's [[loudness]] and [[frequency spectrum]] are among the properties used as input to the visualization.

Effective music visualization aims to attain a high degree of visual [[correlation]] between a musical track's spectral characteristics such as frequency and [[amplitude]] and the objects or components of the visual image being rendered and displayed.

==Definition==
''"Music visualization"'' can be defined, in contrast to previous existing pre-generated music plus visualization combinations (as for example [[music videos]]), by its characteristic as being [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] generated. Another possible distinction is seen by some in the ability of some music visualization systems (such as Geiss' [[MilkDrop]]) to create different visualizations for each song or audio every time the program is run, in contrast to other forms of music visualization (such as [[music videos]] or a [[laser lighting display]]) which always show the same visualization. Music visualization may be achieved in a 2D or a 3D [[coordinate system]] where up to 6 dimensions can be modified, the 4th, 5th and 6th dimensions being color, intensity and transparency./

==History==
[[File:Atarivideomusic.png|300px|thumb|right|The [[Atari Video Music]], available in 1976. The unit never gained enough popularity and was in production for only a year.]]
The first electronic music visualizer was the [[Atari Video Music]] introduced by [[Atari, Inc|Atari Inc.]] in 1976, and designed by the initiator of the home version of ''[[Pong]]'', Robert Brown. The idea was to create a visual exploration that could be implemented into a [[Hi-Fi]] stereo system. It is described in {{Cite patent|US|4081829}}. In [[Great Britain]] music visualization was first pioneered by [[Fred Judd]].

Music and audio players were available on early home computers, ''Sound to Light Generator'' (1985, Infinite Software) used the ZX Spectrum's cassette player for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0018300|title=Sound to Light Generator|work=World of Spectrum |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984 movie [[Electric Dreams (film)|Electric Dreams]] prominently made use of one, although as a pre-generated effect, rather than calculated in [[Live streaming|real-time]].

For [[IBM PC|PC]]/[[MS-DOS|DOS]] one of the first modern music visualization programs was the [[open-source]], multi-platform ''[[Cthugha (software)|Cthugha]]'' in 1993. In the 1990s the emerging [[demoscene|demo]] and [[Tracker (music software)|tracker music]] scene pioneered the real-time technics for music visualization on the PC platform; resulting examples are ''Cubic player'' (1994), ''Inertia Player'' (1995) or in general their real-time generated [[Demo coding|Demo]]s.&lt;ref name="hartmann"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Hartmann |first=Doreen |title=Computer Demos and the Demoscene: Artistic Subcultural Innovation in Real-Time. |conference=16th International Symposium of Electronic Art |year=2010 |url=http://www.isea2010ruhr.org/files/redaktion/pdf/isea2010_proceedings_p11_hartmann.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CESCG-2002&gt;{{cite web|author1=Boris Burger |author2=Ondrej Paulovic |author3=Milos Hasan |url=http://www.cescg.org/CESCG-2002/BBurger |work=CESCG-2002 |title=Realtime Visualization Methods in the Demoscene |publisher=[[Technische Universität Wien]] |date=2002-03-21 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, PC computer music visualization became widespread in the mid to late 1990s as applications such as ''[[Winamp]]'' (1997), ''[[Audion (software)|Audion]]'' (1999), and ''[[SoundJam]]'' (2000). By 1999, there were several dozen [[freeware]] non-trivial music visualizers in distribution. In particular, ''[[MilkDrop]]'' (2001) and its predecessor "geiss-plugin" (1998) by [[Ryan Geiss]], ''G-Force'' by [[Andy O'Meara]], and [[Advanced Visualization Studio|AVS]] (2000) by [[Nullsoft]] became popular music visualizations. AVS is part of [[Winamp]] and has been recently [[open-source]]d,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/avs/ AVS] on [[sourceforge]].com&lt;/ref&gt; and G-Force was licensed for use in [[iTunes]]&lt;ref&gt;"About iTunes" - iTunes 8.0.0.35 credits&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Media Center]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and is presently the flagship product for Andy O'Meara's software startup company, SoundSpectrum. 

Some of the more recent applications such as Luminant Music (2017), produce visualization in real time and render to a full-3D environment. 

With the increasing popularity of [[virtual reality]], several start ups have begun working on music visualization although reception has been mixed &lt;ref name="theverge.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/28/10675270/gear-vr-virtual-reality-music-visualizer-groovr|title=Does anybody really want a virtual reality music visualizer?|date=28 December 2015|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one informal poll finding that only 33% of respondents were interested in music visualization for VR.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt;

'''Nelly Power'''&lt;ref name=note&gt;While her name is given variously as Nellie or Nelly in contemporary press reports and in advertisements for her appearances, Nelly is the name on her gravestone.&lt;/ref&gt; (10 April 1854 &amp;ndash; 19 January 1887) was an English singer, actress and performer in [[music hall]], [[Victorian burlesque]] and [[pantomime]].&lt;ref name=Era1&gt;''The Era'', 22 January 1887 "Death of Miss Nelly Power"&lt;/ref&gt; Her funeral attracted three to four thousand spectators at [[Abney Park Cemetery]] and a further great crowd at the start of the procession from her home.&lt;ref name=Era2&gt;''The Era'', 29 January 1887 "Funeral of Miss Nelly Power"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This was added without any citations: Her real name was Ellen Maria Power, and she was married to Roland Israel Gideon Barnett, a diamond dealer, on 1 June 1874. The marriage foundered within a year. --&gt;

==Career==
Power was a performer in [[music hall]] from the age of 8 when, as a pupil of Mrs J W Gordon, she appeared, singing two comic songs, at Gordon's Music Hall in Southampton.&lt;ref name=LMHD&gt;[http://www.rhul.ac.uk/drama/music-hall/more.asp?actnum=13608 London Music Hall Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This was added to the article without any citations: In September 1863, she appeared at Turnham's Concert Hall in Paddington, London. --&gt; She continued to sing and also performed impersonations and developed a comic style mimicking that of [[George Leybourne]], which brought her fame by the age of 15&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;Aberdeen Weekly Journal, 24 January 1887 Death of Miss Nelly Power&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her first appearance on the legitimate London stage in 1868 in the [[pantomime]] ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' at the [[Surrey Theatre]].&lt;ref name=BhamPost&gt;"Gleanings", ''Birmingham Daily Post'', 25 January 1887&lt;/ref&gt; She then moved to the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] performing as principal "boy" in a number of [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] plays by [[Robert Reece]] and [[Henry J. Byron]]: ''Don Carlos, Elizabeth Camaralzaman, The Orange Tree and the Bumble Bee, The Very Last Days of Pompeii'', and ''Romulus and Remus''. This was followed by a further spell in pantomime at the Surrey Theatre and the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] where, in 1881, she had the title role in the pantomime ''Sindbad the Sailor'', with [[Vesta Tilley]] as Captain Tralala.&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/drurylanepantos.html Pantomimes at Drury Lane]&lt;/ref&gt; She achieved national fame in the music halls with an act in which she caricatured dandies with comic songs such as "La-di-la".&lt;ref name=Era1/&gt; She was the original singer of "[[The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery]]", which was written for her by songwriter/composer George Ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/boyilove-rev |title=The Boy I Love Is Up In the Gallery |website=British Theatre Guide |year=2010 |author=Simon Sladen |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17219 |title=The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery by Marie Lloyd |website=Songfacts |author=Alexander Baron |accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Another uncited addition: Her final appearance was at the Trocadero [WHERE WAS THIS?] on 15 January 1887. --&gt;

Power died from [[pleurisy]] in 1887, aged 32, and was buried at [[Abney Park Cemetery]] in London. A commemorative [[blue plaque]] was erected in 2017 at her former home, 97 Southgate Road, [[Islington]], by the theatre charity [[The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themusichallguild.com/news.php "Nelly Power is Commemorated"], The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America, accessed 14 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10789">A '''no-budget film''' is a [[film]] made with very little or no money.

Young directors starting out in filmmaking and several older ones commonly use this method because there are few other options available to them at that point. All the actors and technicians are employed in these films without [[remuneration]]. These films are largely [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]. Usually the [[Film director|director]] works alone on such films, or uses a very minimum "crew" of volunteers to assist him/her on such projects, where no money or financing is available, not including the cost of equipments and software used in production and post-production.

Footage for no-budget films is often shot [[Filming location|on location]], either with permission, or without permission which is referred to as "[[guerrilla filmmaking]]", using sites such as the home of the filmmaker or their friends, in the backyard or local neighborhood. No-budget films have often been made in the past using [[Super 8 mm film]] or [[video]], but recent films have taken advantage of low-cost digital cameras and editing programs. A notable example of this could be found in the work of [[ASS Studios]], a no-budget film studio founded in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and [[Reverend Jen Miller]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;http://filmmakermagazine.com/27295-courtney-fathom-sells-hi-8-high-life/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://filmmakermagazine.com/29016-so-you-wanna-be-an-underground-filmmaker/#.VQ-DxkLjNFI&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Japan}}
{{nihongo|'''''Noh'''''|[[wiktionary:能|能]]|Nō}}, derived from the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] word for "skill" or "talent", is a major form of classical Japanese musical [[drama]] that has been performed since the 14th century. Developed by [[Kan'ami]] and his son [[Zeami]], it is the oldest major theatre art that is still regularly performed today.&lt;ref name=Bowers /&gt; Traditionally, a ''Noh'' program includes five ''Noh'' plays with comedic ''[[kyōgen]]'' plays in between; an abbreviated program of two ''Noh'' plays and one ''kyōgen'' piece has become common in ''Noh'' presentations today. An ''okina''&lt;!--link points back here--&gt; (翁) play may be presented in the very beginning especially at New Year, holidays, and other special occasions.&lt;ref name="the Japan Arts Council"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Noh and Kyogen|url=http://www2.ntj.jac.go.jp/unesco/noh/en/|website=the Japan Arts Council|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nō'' together with ''Kyōgen'' is part of ''[[Nōgaku]]'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/nogaku-theatre-00012|title=Nôgaku theatre - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|author=|date=|website=ich.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Noh'' is often based on tales from traditional literature with a supernatural being transformed into human form as a hero narrating a story. ''Noh'' integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent the roles such as ghosts, women, children, and the elderly. Written in ancient Japanese language, the text "vividly describes the ordinary people of the twelfth to sixteenth centuries".&lt;!-- quote requires inline attribution—but why is this even being quoted? --&gt;{{attribution needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="UNESCO Nogaku"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nôgaku theatre|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;RL=00012|website=The Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation, ''Noh'' is extremely codified and regulated by the ''[[iemoto]]'' system.

== History ==
[[Image:Noh stage Miyajima Sep2008.jpg|thumb|right|World's oldest ''Noh'' stage at [[Itsukushima|Miyajima]]]]
[[File:Karaori Garment (Noh costume), Edo period, 18th century, bamboo and chrysanthemum design on red and white checkered ground - Tokyo National Museum - DSC06159.JPG|thumb|''Karaori'' garment, Edo period, 18th century, bamboo and chrysanthemum design on red and white checkered ground]]

===Origins===
The word ''Noh'' is a borrowing from [[Middle Chinese]] ''nong'' {{lang|zh|能}} (cf. [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] ''néng''), and means "skill", "craft", or "talent", particularly in the field of performing arts in this context. The word ''Noh'' may be used alone or with ''gaku'' (fun, music) to form the word ''nōgaku''. ''Noh'' is a classical tradition that is highly valued by many today. When used alone, ''Noh'' refers to the historical genre of theatre originated from ''[[sarugaku]]'' in the mid 14th century and continues to be performed today.&lt;ref name="Ortolani" /&gt;

''Noh'' and ''kyōgen'' "originated in the 8th century when the ''sangaku'' ([[:ja:散楽]]) was transmitted from China to Japan. At the time, the term ''sangaku'' referred to various types of performance featuring acrobats, song and dance as well as comic sketches. Its subsequent adaption to Japanese society led to its assimilation of other traditional art forms."&lt;ref name="UNESCO Nogaku" /&gt;

Various performing art elements in ''sangaku'' as well as elements of ''[[dengaku]]'' (rural celebrations performed in connection with rice planting), ''[[sarugaku]]'' (popular entertainment including acrobatics, juggling, and pantomime), ''[[shirabyōshi]] ''(traditional dances performed by female dancers in the Imperial Court in 12th century), and ''[[gagaku]]'' (ancient music and dance performed in the Imperial Court beginning in 7th century) evolved into ''Noh'' and ''kyōgen''.&lt;ref name="Bowers"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowers |first1=Faubion |title=Japanese Theatre |date=1974 |publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co. |location=Rutland, Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on [[genealogy]] of the ''Noh'' actors in 14th century indicate they were members of families specialized in performing arts; they had performed various traditional performance arts for many generations. Sociological research by Yukio Hattori reveals that the [[Konparu]] School ([[:ja:金春流]]), arguably the oldest school of ''Noh'', is a descendant of [[Mimashi]] (味摩之), the performer who introduced ''[[gigaku]]'', now-extinct masked drama-dance performance, into Japan from [[Baekje|Kudara Kingdom]] in 612.&lt;ref name="Ortolani" /&gt;

Another theory by Shinhachirō Matsumoto suggests ''Noh'' originated from outcastes struggling to claim higher social status by catering to those in power, namely the new ruling ''[[samurai]]'' class of the time. The transferral of the [[Shōgun|shogunate]] from [[Kamakura]] to [[Kyoto]] at the beginning of [[Muromachi period]] marked the increasing power of the samurai class and strengthened the relationship between the shogunate and the court. As ''Noh'' became the ''shōgun''{{'}}s favorite art form, ''Noh'' was able to become a courtly art form through this newly formed relationship. In 14th century, with strong support and patronage from ''shōgun'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]], Zeami was able to establish ''Noh'' as the most prominent theatre art form of the time.&lt;ref name="Ortolani" /&gt;

=== Kan'ami and Zeami ===
{{main article|Zeami Motokiyo|Kan'ami}}
[[Kanami|Kan'ami Kiyotsugu]] and his son [[Zeami Motokiyo]] brought Noh to what is essentially its present-day form during the [[Muromachi period]] (1336 to 1573).&lt;ref name="Watanabe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe |first=Takeshi|title=Breaking Down Barriers: A History of Chanoyu |year=2009|publisher=Yale Art Gallery |isbn=978-0-300-14692-9|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kan'ami was a renowned actor with great versatility fulfilling roles from graceful women and 12-year-old boys to strong adult males. When Kan'ami first presented his work to 17-year-old [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]], Zeami was a child actor in his play, around age 12. Yoshimitsu fell in love with Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.&lt;ref name="Ortolani" /&gt;

===Tokugawa era===
During the [[Edo period]] Noh continued to be aristocratic art form supported by the ''[[shōgun]]'', the feudal lords (''[[daimyō]]s''), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While ''[[kabuki]]'' and [[Jōruri (music)|''joruri'']] popular to the middle class focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture the essence of performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.&lt;ref name="Ortolani"/&gt;

=== Modern ''Noh'' after Meiji era ===
The fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868 and the formation of a new modernized government resulted in the end of financial support by the government, and the entire field of Noh experienced major financial crisis. Shortly after the [[Meiji Restoration]] both the number of Noh performers and Noh stages greatly diminished. The support from the imperial government was eventually regained partly due to Noh's appeal to foreign diplomats. The companies that remained active throughout the [[Meiji era]] also significantly broadened Noh's reach by catering to the general public, performing at theatres in major cities such as Tokyo and [[Osaka]].&lt;ref name=Ishii&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ishii|first1=Rinko|title=能・狂言の基礎知識 [The Fundamentals of Noh and Kyogen]|date=2009|publisher=Kadokawa|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 the Japanese Government designated ''nōgaku'' as an [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Intangible Cultural Property]], which affords a degree of legal protection to the tradition as well as its most accomplished practitioners. [[National Noh Theatre|The National Noh Theatre]] founded by the government in 1983 stages regular performances and organizes courses to train actors in the leading roles of ''nōgaku''. Noh was inscribed in 2008 on [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by UNESCO as Nôgaku theatre.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Nogaku" /&gt;

Although the terms ''nōgaku ''and Noh are sometimes used interchangeably, ''nōgaku ''encompasses both Noh and ''kyōgen''.&lt;ref name="Noh Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|title=能楽 (Nôgaku)|url=http://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp|website=National Cultural Heritage Database|publisher=The Agency for Cultural Affairs|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kyōgen'' is performed in between Noh plays in the same space. Compared to Noh, "''kyōgen'' relies less on the use of masks and is derived from the humorous plays of the [[sarugaku|''sangaku'']], as reflected in its comic dialogue."&lt;ref name="UNESCO Nogaku" /&gt;

==''Jo-ha-kyū''==
{{main article|Jo-ha-kyū}}
The concept of ''[[jo-ha-kyū]]'' dictates virtually every element of Noh including compiling of a program of plays, structuring of each play, songs and dances within plays, and the basic rhythms within each Noh performance. ''Jo'' means beginning, ''ha'' means breaking, and ''kyū'' means rapid or urgent. The term originated in ''[[gagaku]]'', ancient courtly music, to indicate gradually increasing tempo and was adopted in various Japanese traditions including Noh, tea ceremony, poetry, and flower arrangement.&lt;ref name=Tsuchiya&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsuchiya|first1=Keiichirō|script-title=ja:能、世阿弥の「現在」|trans-title=The "Present" of Noh and Zeami|language=ja|date=2014|publisher=Kadokawa|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jo-ha-kyū'' is incorporated in traditional five-play program of Noh. The first play is ''jo'', the second, third, and fourth plays are ''ha'', and the fifth play is ''kyū''. In fact, the five categories discussed [[Noh#Theme|below]] were created so that the program would represent ''jo-ha-kyū'' when one play from each category is selected and performed in order. Each play can be broken into three parts, the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. A play starts out in a slow tempo at ''jo'', gets slightly faster at ''ha'', then culminates in ''kyū''.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

Actors begin their training as young children, traditionally at the age of three. Historically, Noh performers had been exclusively male, but daughters of established Noh actors have begun to perform professionally since the 1940s. In 2009, there were about 1200 male and 200 female professional Noh performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/4170226/Players_Performances_and_Existence_of_Womens_Noh_Focusing_on_the_Articles_Run_in_the_Japanese_General_Newspapers|title =Players, Performances and Existence of Women's Noh: Focusing on the Articles Run in the Japanese General Newspapers |last=Suzumura |first=Yusuke |date=Mar 8, 2013 |journal = Journal of International Japan-Studies |accessdate=Nov 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training ===
Zeami isolated nine levels or types of Noh acting from lower degrees which put emphasis on movement and violence to higher degrees which represent the opening of a flower and spiritual prowess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Eckersley. M. (ed.) |year=2009 |title=Drama from the Rim | publisher=Drama Victoria |location=Melbourne |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, there are five extant schools of Noh acting called [[Kanze (Noh school)|Kanze]] (観世), [[Hōshō (Noh school)|Hōshō]] (宝生), [[Komparu]] (金春), [[Kongō (Noh school)|Kongō]] (金剛), and [[Kita (Noh school)|Kita]] (喜多) schools that train ''shite'' actors. Each school has its own ''iemoto'' family that carries the name of the school and is considered the most important. The ''iemoto'' holds the power to create new plays or modify lyrics and performance modes.&lt;ref name=Hayashi&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hayashi |first1=Kazutoshi |title=能・狂言を学ぶ人のために [For Those Learning Noh and Kyogen] |date=2012 |publisher=Sekai Shisou Sha |location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Waki'' actors are trained in the schools Takayasu (高安), Fukuou (福王), and Hōshō (宝生). There are two schools that train ''kyōgen'', Ōkura (大蔵) and Izumi (和泉). 11 schools train instrumentalists, each school specializing in one to three instruments.&lt;ref name="Nohgaku Performers' Association" /&gt;

The Nohgaku Performers' Association (''Nōgaku Kyōkai''), to which all professionals are registered, strictly protects the traditions passed down from their ancestors (see ''[[iemoto]]''). However, several secret documents of the Kanze school written by Zeami, as well as materials by [[Konparu Zenchiku]], have been diffused throughout the community of scholars of Japanese theatre.&lt;ref name="Nohgaku Performers' Association"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Nohgaku Performers' Association |url=http://www.nohgaku.or.jp/about/index.html |website=The Nohgaku Performers' Association |accessdate=Nov 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roles ===
[[Image:Noh-stage.png|thumb|250px|right|Noh stage. Center: ''shite''; front right: ''waki''; right: eight-member ''jiutai'' (chorus); rear center: four ''hayashi-kata'' (musicians); rear left: two ''kōken'' (stage hands).]]

There are four major categories of Noh performers: ''shite'', ''waki'', ''kyōgen'', and ''hayashi''.&lt;ref name="performers"&gt;{{cite web |page=3 |title=Enjoying Noh and Kyōgen |publisher=The Nohgaku performers' association |url=http://www.nohgaku.or.jp/download/guide_english.pdf }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=Darkmorpher |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Shite'' (仕手, シテ).  ''Shite'' is the main protagonist, or the leading role in plays. In plays where the ''shite'' appears first as a human and then as a ghost, the first role is known as the ''mae-shite'' and the later as the ''nochi-shite''.
#* ''Shitetsure'' (仕手連れ, シテヅレ). The ''shite's'' companion.  Sometimes ''shitetsure'' is abbreviated to ''tsure'' (連れ, ツレ), although this term refers to both the ''shitetsure'' and the ''wakitsure''.
#* ''Kōken'' (後見) are stage hands, usually one to three people.
#* ''Jiutai'' (地謡) is the chorus, usually comprising six to eight people.
# ''Waki'' (脇, ワキ) performs the role that is the counterpart or foil of the ''shite''.
#* ''Wakitsure'' (脇連れ, ワキヅレ) or ''Waki-tsure'' is the companion of the ''waki''.
# ''[[Kyōgen]]'' (狂言) perform the ''aikyōgen'' (間狂言), which are interludes during plays. ''Kyōgen'' actors also perform in separate plays between individual Noh plays.
# ''Hayashi'' (囃子) or ''hayashi-kata'' (囃子方) are the instrumentalists who play the four instruments used in Noh theatre: the transverse {{nihongo|[[flute]]|笛|[[fue]]}}, {{nihongo|hip drum |大鼓|[[ōtsuzumi]]}} or {{nihongo||大皮|ōkawa}}, the {{nihongo|shoulder-drum |小鼓 |[[kotsuzumi]]}}, and the {{nihongo|stick-drum |太鼓|[[taiko]] }}. The flute used for noh is specifically called {{nihongo||能管|nōkan or nohkan}}.

A typical Noh play always involves the chorus, the orchestra, and at least one ''shite'' and one ''waki'' actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Eckersley. M. (ed.) |year=2009 |title=Drama from the Rim | publisher=Drama Victoria |location=Melbourne |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance elements==
Noh performance combines a variety of elements into a stylistic whole, with each particular element the product of generations of refinement according to the central Buddhist, [[Shinto]], and minimalist aspects of Noh's aesthetic principles.

===Masks===

''Noh'' [[mask]]s (能面 ''nō-men'' or 面 ''omote'') are carved from blocks of Japanese cypress (檜 "''[[hinoki]]''"), and painted with natural pigments on a neutral base of glue and crunched seashell. There are approximately 450 different masks mostly based on sixty types, all of which have distinctive names. Some masks are representative and frequently used in many different plays, while some are very specific and may only be used in one or two plays. Noh masks signify the characters' gender, age, and social ranking, and by wearing masks the actors may portray youngsters, old men, female, or nonhuman ([[Divinity|divine]], [[demon]]ic, or [[animal]]) characters. Only the ''shite'', the main actor, wears a mask in most plays, even though the ''tsure'' may also wear a mask in some plays to represent female characters.&lt;ref name=Rath /&gt;

Even though the mask covers an actor's facial expressions, the use of the mask in Noh is not an abandonment of facial expressions altogether. Rather, its intent is to stylize and codify the facial expressions through the use of the mask and to stimulate the imagination of the audience. By using masks, actors are able to convey emotions in a more controlled manner through movements and body language. Some masks utilize lighting effect to convey different emotions through slight tilting of the head. Facing slightly upward, or "brightening" the mask, will let the mask to capture more light, revealing more features that appear laughing or smiling. Facing downward, or "clouding" it, will cause the mask to appear sad or mad.&lt;ref name=Komparu&gt;{{cite book |last1=Komparu |first1=Kunio |title=The Noh Theater: Principles and Perspectives |date=1983 |publisher=John Weatherhill |location=New York / Tokyo |isbn=0-8348-1529-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noh masks are treasured by Noh families and institution, and the powerful Noh schools hold the oldest and most valuable Noh masks in their private collections, rarely seen by the public. The most ancient mask is supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was carved by the legendary regent [[Prince Shōtoku]] (572-622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's ''Style and the Flower'' written in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Rath&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rath|first1=Eric C.|title=The Ethos of Noh - Actors and Their Art|date=2004|publisher=Harvard University Asia Center|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-01397-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the [[Noh masks of the Konparu school|masks of the Konparu school]] belong to the [[Tokyo National Museum]], and are exhibited there frequently.&lt;ref name="TNM17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=1842&amp;lang=en |title=Noh masks formerly owned by Konparu Sōke |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Tokyo National Museum |access-date=2018-01-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===
[[File:Noh-stage.jpg|alt=A contemporary Noh theatre with indoor roofed structure|thumb|left|A contemporary Noh theatre with indoor roofed structure]]
[[Image:Noh-stage-diagram.png|thumb|1: hashigakari. 2: kyōgen spot. 3: stage attendants. 4: stick drum. 5: hip drum. 6: shoulder drum. 7: flute. 8: chorus. 9: ''waki'' seat. 10: ''waki'' spot. 11: ''shite'' spot. 12: ''shite-bashira''. 13: ''metsuke-bashira''. 14: ''waki-bashira''. 15: ''fue-bashira''.]]

The traditional Noh [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] has complete openness that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience throughout the performance. Without any proscenium or curtains to obstruct the view, the audience sees each actor even during the moments before they enter (and after they exit) the central "stage". The theatre itself is considered symbolic and treated with reverence both by the performers and the audience.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

One of the most recognizable characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes the sanctity of the stage, with its architectural design derived from the worship [[pavilion]] (''[[Haiden (Shinto)|haiden]]'') or sacred dance pavilion (''[[kagura-den]]'') of [[Shinto]] shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an architectural entity.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

The pillars supporting the roof are named ''shitebashira'' (principal character's pillar), ''metsukebashira'' (gazing pillar), ''wakibashira'' (secondary character's pillar), and ''fuebashira'' (flute pillar), clockwise from upstage right respectively. Each pillar is associated with the performers and their actions.&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brockett |first1=Oscar G. |last2=Hildy |first2=Franklin J. |title=History of the Theatre |date=2007 |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston, MA |isbn=0-205-47360-1 |edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage is made entirely of unfinished ''[[hinoki]]'', Japanese cypress, with almost no decorative elements. The poet and novelist [[Tōson Shimazaki]] writes that "on the stage of the Noh theatre there are no sets that change with each piece. Neither is there a curtain. There is only a simple panel (''kagami-ita'') with a painting of a [[pine|green pine tree]]. This creates the impression that anything that could provide any shading has been banished. To break such monotony and make something happen is no easy thing."&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

Another unique feature of the stage is the ''hashigakari'', a narrow bridge at upstage right used by actors to enter the stage. ''Hashigakari'' means "suspension bridge", signifying something aerial that connects two separate worlds on a same level. The bridge symbolizes the mythic nature of Noh plays in which otherworldly ghosts and spirits frequently appear. In contrast, ''[[hanamichi]]'' in [[Kabuki]] theatres is literally a path (''michi'') that connects two spaces in a single world, thus has a completely different significance.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

===Costumes===
Noh actors wear silk costumes called ''shozoku'' (robes) along with wigs, hats, and props such as the fan. With striking colors, elaborate texture, and intricate weave and embroidery, Noh robes are truly works of art in their own right. Costumes for the ''shite'' in particular are extravagant, shimmering silk brocades, but are progressively less sumptuous for the ''tsure,'' the ''wakizure,'' and the ''aikyōgen''.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

For centuries, in accordance with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for a peasant or commoner. But in the late sixteenth century, the costumes became stylized with certain symbolic and stylistic conventions. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and ''samurai'' in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, Anne Nishimura, et al. ''MFA Highlights: Arts of Japan''. Boston: Museum of Fine Arts Publications, 2008. p109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The musicians and chorus typically wear formal ''montsuki'' ''[[kimono]]'' (black and adorned with five family crests) accompanied by either ''[[hakama]]'' (a skirt-like garment) or ''kami-shimo'', a combination of ''hakama'' and a waist-coat with exaggerated shoulders. Finally, the stage attendants are garbed in virtually unadorned black garments, much in the same way as stagehands in contemporary Western theatre.&lt;ref name=Ishii /&gt;

===Props===
The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most commonly used prop in Noh is the [[Fan (implement)|fan]], as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the ''[[Obi (sash)|obi]] ''(the sash). The fan is usually placed at the performer's side when he or she takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing brush. The fan may represent various objects over the course of a single play.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

When hand props other than fans are used, they are usually introduced or retrieved by ''[[kuroko]]'' who fulfill a similar role to stage crew in contemporary theatre.  Like their Western counterparts, stage attendants for Noh traditionally dress in black, but unlike in Western theatre they may appear on stage during a scene, or may remain on stage during an entire performance, in both cases in plain view of the audience. The all-black costume of ''kuroko'' implies they are not part of the action on stage and are effectively invisible.&lt;ref name=Ishii /&gt;

Set pieces in Noh such as the boats, wells, altars, and bells, are typically carried onto the stage before the beginning of the act in which they are needed. These props normally are only outlines to suggest actual objects, although the great bell, a perennial exception to most Noh rules for props, is designed to conceal the actor and to allow a costume change during the ''kyōgen'' interlude.&lt;ref name=Rath /&gt;

===Chant and music===
[[Image:Noh-Hayashi.png|thumb|250px|right|''Hayashi-kata'' (noh musicians).  Left to right: ''[[taiko]]'', ''[[ōtsuzumi]]'' (hip drum), ''[[kotsuzumi]]'' (shoulder drum), ''[[flute]]''.]]

Noh theatre is accompanied by a chorus and a [[hayashi (music)|''hayashi'']] ensemble (''Noh-bayashi'' 能囃子). Noh is a chanted drama, and a few commentators have dubbed it "Japanese [[opera]]". However, the singing in Noh involves a limited tonal range, with lengthy, repetitive passages in a narrow dynamic range. Texts are poetic, relying heavily on the Japanese seven-five rhythm common to nearly all forms of [[Japanese poetry]], with an economy of expression, and an abundance of allusion. The singing parts of Noh are called "''Utai''" and the speaking parts "''Kataru''".&lt;ref name=Pound&gt;Pound, 1959. {{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music has many blank spaces (''ma'') in between the actual sounds, and these negative blank spaces are in fact considered the heart of the music. In addition to ''utai'', Noh ''hayashi'' ensemble consists of four musicians, also known as the "hayashi-kata", including three drummers, which play the ''[[shime-daiko]]'', ''[[ōtsuzumi]]'' (hip drum), and ''[[kotsuzumi]]'' (shoulder drum) respectively, and a ''[[nohkan]]'' flutist.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

The chant is not always performed "in character"; that is, sometimes the actor will speak lines or describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator.  Far from breaking the rhythm of the performance, this is actually in keeping with the other-worldly feel of many Noh plays, especially in those characterized as ''mugen''.

==Plays==
Of the roughly 2000 plays created for Noh that are known today, about 240 make up the current repertoire performed by the five existing Noh schools. The current repertoire is heavily influenced by the taste of aristocratic class in Tokugawa period and does not necessarily reflect popularity among the commoners.&lt;ref name="Ortolani"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no#v=onepage&amp;q=mugen-no%20Genzai-no%20waki-no&amp;f=false |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=0-691-04333-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to classify Noh plays.

=== Subject ===
All Noh [[Play (theatre)|play]]s can be classified into three broad categories.&lt;ref name="Ishii" /&gt;
* ''Genzai'' Noh (現在能, "present Noh") features human characters and events unfold according to a [[linear timeline]] within the play. 
* ''Mugen'' Noh (夢幻能, "supernatural Noh") involves supernatural worlds, featuring gods, spirits, ghosts, or phantasms in the ''shite'' role. Time is often depicted as passing in a [[non-linear]] fashion, and action may switch between two or more timeframes from moment to moment, including flashbacks.
* ''Ryōkake'' Noh (両掛能, "mixed Noh"), though somewhat uncommon, is a [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] of the above with the first act being ''Genzai'' Noh and the second act ''Mugen'' Noh.
While ''Genzai'' Noh utilizes internal and external conflicts to drive storylines and bring out emotions, ''Mugen'' Noh focuses on utilizing [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s of the past and the deceased to invoke emotions.&lt;ref name="Ishii" /&gt;

===Performance style===
Additionally, all Noh plays may be categorized by their style.
* ''Geki'' Noh (劇能) is a drama piece based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action.
* ''Furyū'' Noh (風流能) is little more than a dance piece characterized by elaborate stage action, often involving acrobatics, stage properties, and multiple characters.&lt;ref name=Ortolani /&gt;

===Theme===
[[Image:春日神社ー篠山ー翁奉納P1011774.jpg|thumbnail|''Okina hōnō'' (dedication of Noh play ''A Venerable Old Man'') on [[Japanese New Year|New Year's Day]] ]]
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jo-ha-kyū]] --&gt;
All Noh plays are divided by their themes into the following five categories. This classification is considered the most practical, and is still used today in formal programming choices today.&lt;ref name=Ortolani/&gt; Traditionally, a formal 5-play program is composed of a selection from each of the groups.&lt;ref name=Ishii/&gt;
# ''Kami mono'' (神物, god plays) or ''waki Noh'' (脇能) typically feature the ''shite'' in the role of a deity to tell the mythic story of a shrine or praise a particular god. Many of them structured in two acts, the deity takes a human form in disguise in the first act and reveals the real self in the second act. (e.g. ''Takasago'', ''Chikubushima'')&lt;ref name=Ortolani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ishii/&gt;
# ''Shura mono'' (修羅物, warrior plays) or ''ashura Noh'' (阿修羅能) takes its name from the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Buddhist underworld]]. The protagonist appearing as a ghost of a famous ''samurai'' pleads to a monk for salvation and the drama culminates in a glorious re-enactment of the scene of his death in a full war costume. (e.g. ''Tamura'', ''Atsumori'')&lt;ref name=Ortolani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ishii/&gt;
# ''Katsura mono'' (鬘物, wig plays) or ''onna mono'' (女物, woman plays) depict the ''shite'' in a female role and feature some of the most refined songs and dances in all of Noh, reflecting the smooth and flowing movements representing female characters. (e.g. ''Basho'', ''Matsukaze'')&lt;ref name=Ortolani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ishii/&gt;
# There are about 94 "miscellaneous" plays traditionally performed in the fourth place in a five-play program. These plays include subcategories ''kyōran mono'' (狂乱物, madness plays), ''onryō mono'' (怨霊物, [[vengeful ghost]] plays), ''genzai mono'' (現在物, present plays), as well as others. (e.g. ''Aya no tsuzumi'', ''Kinuta'')&lt;ref name=Ortolani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ishii/&gt;
# ''Kiri Noh'' (切り能, final plays) or ''oni mono'' (鬼物, demon plays) usually feature the ''shite'' in the role of monsters, goblins, or demons, and are often selected for their bright colors and fast-paced, tense finale movements. Kiri Noh is performed the last in a five-play program.&lt;ref name=Ortolani/&gt; There are roughly 30 plays in this category, most of which are shorter than the plays in the other categories.&lt;ref name=Ishii/&gt;

In addition to the above five, ''[[Okina (play)|Okina]]'' (or ''Kamiuta'') is frequently performed at the very beginning of the program. Combining dance with [[Shinto]] ritual, it is considered the oldest type of Noh play.&lt;ref name=Ishii/&gt;

== Influence in the West ==
Many Western artists have been influenced by Noh.

===Theatre practitioners===
*[[Eugenio Barba]]&amp;nbsp;– Between 1966 and 1972, Japanese Noh Masters [[Hideo Kanze]] and [[Hisao Kanze]] gave seminars on Noh at Barba’s [[Theater Laboratory of Holstebro]]. Barba primarily studied the physical aspects of Noh.&lt;ref name=Sky&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dr. Sky|title=Therapeutic Noh Theater: Sohkido Pathway VII of the Seven Pathways of Transpersonal Creativity|date=2014|publisher=Two Harbors Press|isbn=1626528225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Samuel Beckett]]&lt;ref name=Sky /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Yoshihiko Ikegami considers Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot'' a parody of Noh, particularly ''Kami'' Noh, in which a god or a spirit appears before a secondary character as the protagonist. Ikegami argues that "the dramatic conflict which was much in evidence in Yeats is so completely discarded that Beckett's theatre (where 'nothing happens') comes to look even closer to Noh than Yeats's did."&lt;ref name=Takahashi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Takahashi|first1=Yasunari|last2=Ikedami|first2=Yoshihiko|title=The Ghost Trio: Beckett, Yeats, and Noh|journal=The Empire of Signs: Semiotic Essays on Japanese Culture|date=1991|pages=257–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bertolt Brecht]]&amp;nbsp;– According to Maria P. Alter, Brecht began reading Japanese plays during the middle twenties and have read at least 20 Noh plays translated into German by 1929. Brecht's ''Der Jasager'' is an adaptation of a Noh play ''Taniko''. Brecht himself identified ''Die Massnahme'' as an adaptation of Noh play.&lt;ref name=Alter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alter|first1=Maria P.|title=Bertolt Brecht and the Noh Drama|journal=Modan Drama|date=Summer 1968|volume=11|issue=2|pages=122–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Peter Brook]]&amp;nbsp;– Yoshi Oida, a Japanese actor with training in Noh, began working with Brook in their production of ''The Tempest'' in 1968. Oida later joined Brook's company.&lt;ref name=Scotland&gt;{{cite web|title=Drama - Advanced Higher - Twentieth-Century Theatre - Peter Brook - Annotated Bibliography|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/Images/peter_brook_tcm4-121234.pdf|website=Education Scotland|publisher=UK government|accessdate=10 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724124830/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/Images/peter_brook_tcm4-121234.pdf|archivedate=24 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paul Claudel]]&lt;ref name=Sky /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– According to John Willet, Paul Claudel learned about Noh during the time he served as French Ambassador to Japan. Claudel's opera ''[[Christophe Colomb]]'' shows an unmistakable influence of the Noh.&lt;ref name=Willett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willett|first1=John|title=The Theater of Bertolt Brecht: A Study from Eight Aspects|date=1959|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jacques Copeau]]&amp;nbsp;– In 1923, Copeau worked on a Noh play, ''Kantan,'' along with [[Suzanne Bing]] at [[Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier]] without ever having seen a Noh play. Thomas Leabhart states that "Jacques Copeau was drawn instinctively by taste and tendency to a restrained theatre which was based in spirituality." Copeau praised Noh theatre in writing when he finally saw a production in 1930.&lt;ref name=Leabhart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leabhart|first1=Thomas|title=Jacques Copeau, Etienne Decroux, and the ‘Flower of Noh'|journal=New Theatre Quarterly|date=2004|volume=20|pages=315–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jacques Lecoq]]&lt;ref name=Sky /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– [[Physical theatre]] taught at [[L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq]] founded by Lecoq is influenced by Noh.
*[[Eugene O'Neill]]&lt;ref name=Sky /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– O'Neill's plays ''The Iceman Cometh'', ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'', and ''Hughie'' have various similarities to Noh plays.&lt;ref name=Hori&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hori|first1=Mariko|title=Aspects of Noh Theatre in Three Late O'Neill Plays|journal=Eugene O'Neill Review|date=1994|volume=18|issue=1/2|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilder's work ''Our Town'' incorporates various elements of Noh such as lack of plot, representative characters, and use of ghosts.&lt;ref name=Ashida&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashida|first1=Ruri|title=Elements of Japanese Noh in Thornton Wilder's Our Town|journal=The Bulletin of the International Society for Harmony &amp; Combination of Cultures|date=June 2009|volume=13|pages=18–31|url=http://atlantic.gssc.nihon-u.ac.jp/~ISHCC/bulletin/13/b018_Ashida.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003410/http://atlantic.gssc.nihon-u.ac.jp/~ISHCC/bulletin/13/b018_Ashida.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
*[[William Henry Bell]]&amp;nbsp;– An English composer Bell wrote music for modern presentation of several Noh plays, including ''Komachi'' (1925), ''Tsuneyo of the Three Trees'' (1926), ''Hatsuyuki'' (1934), ''The Pillow of Kantan'' (1935), and ''Kageyiko'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William Henry Bell 1873-1946: Music for Japanese no plays|url=http://www.unsungcomposers.com/forum/index.php?topic=4608.0|publisher=Unsung Composers|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Benjamin Britten]]&lt;ref name=Sky /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Britten visited Japan in 1956 and saw for the first time Japanese Noh plays, which he called "some of the most wonderful drama I have ever seen." &lt;ref name=Britten&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britten|first1=Benjamin|title=Letters from a Life: The Selected Letters of Benjamin Britten, Volume IV, 1952–1957|date=2008|publisher=The Boydell Press|location=London|isbn=9781843833826}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influences were seen and heard in his ballet ''[[The Prince of the Pagodas]]'' (1957) and later in two of the three semi-operatic "Parables for Church Performance": ''[[Curlew River]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Prodigal Son (Britten)|The Prodigal Son]]'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Carpenter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carpenter|first1=Humphrey|title=Benjamin Britten: A Biography|date=1992|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0571143245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[David Byrne]]&amp;nbsp;– Byrne encountered Noh when he was on tour in Japan with [[Talking Heads]] and he was inspired by the highly stylized practices of Noh, completely different from its Western counterparts that focus on [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]].&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: David Byrne, musician, author|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/interview-david-byrne-musician-author-1-2514846|website=The Scotsman|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josh Kun, "Japanese Noh theatre inspired him to design the oversize business suit that became a visual staple of Talking Heads live shows."&lt;ref name=Kun&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kun|first1=Josh|title=CSI: David Byrne|url=http://prospect.org/article/csi-david-byrne|website=The American Prospect|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alan Watts]]&amp;nbsp;– 20th century philosopher, the liner notes from his third song off the 1962 album 'This is IT' state "Watts in a Japanese no-noh."
*[[Harry Partch]]&amp;nbsp;– Partch called his work ''Delusion of the Fury'' "a ritualistic web". Kate Molleson wrote for '''[[The Guardian]]'' that "the narrative is a bleary mix of Japanese Noh theatre, Ethiopian folk mythology, Greek drama and his own wacky imagination".&lt;ref name=Molleson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molleson|first1=Kate|title=Harry Partch – how Heiner Goebbels bought Delusion of the Fury to Edinburgh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/29/harry-partch-delusion-of-the-fury-heiner-goebbels-edinburgh|website=The Guardian|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Will Salmon cites Partch himself writing, "Noh has been for centuries a fine art, one of the most sophisticated the world has known." ''Delusion of the Fury'' incorporates two Noh plays, ''Atsumori'' by Zeami and ''Ikuta'' by Zenbō Motoyasu, into its story.&lt;ref name=Salmon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Will|title=The Influence of Noh on Harry Partch's Delusion of the Fury|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1983|volume=22|issue=1/2|pages=233–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]&amp;nbsp;– The essentially plotless libretto of Stockhausen's grand operatic cycle ''[[Licht]]'' ("Light") is based on "a mythology drawing on multiple cultural traditions, from Japanese Noh theatre to German folklore".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name=Robin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robin|first1=William|title=An Operatic Conundrum Untangled|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/arts/music/sonntag-by-karlheinz-stockhausen-in-cologne.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Iannis Xenakis]]&amp;nbsp;– Xenakis "admired Noh, the venerable theatrical form known for its ritualistic formality and gestural complexity."&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jack|title=The Week Ahead Feb. 28 — March 6|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/arts/28weekahead_web.html|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=The New York Times|date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic Music Foundation presented ''Xenakis &amp; Japan'' in March 2010, "a dance/music event highlighting Xenakis' lifelong interest in Japanese music and theatre". The event featured a female Noh performer Ryoko Aoki.&lt;ref name="Xenakis &amp; Japan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xenakis &amp; Japan|url=http://www.emf.org/emfproductions/pastevents0910/xenakis&amp;japan.html|website=Electronic Music Foundation|accessdate=14 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905234835/http://www.emf.org/emfproductions/pastevents0910/xenakis%26japan.html|archive-date=2015-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poets===
*[[William Butler Yeats]]&lt;ref name=Sky /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sekine&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sekine|first1=Masaru|last2=Murray|first2=Christopher|title=Yeats and the Noh: A Comparative Study|date=1990|publisher=Rl Innactive Titles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Yeats wrote an essay on Noh titled "Certain Noble Plays of Japan" in 1916. As much as he tried to learn Noh, there were limited resources available in England at the time. The lack of complete understanding of Noh led him to create innovative works guided by his own imagination and what he fantasized Noh to be.&lt;ref name=Albright&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albright|first1=Daniel|title=Pound, Yeats, and the Noh Theater|journal=The Iowa Review|date=1985|volume=15|issue=2|pages=34–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats wrote four plays heavily influenced by Noh, using ghosts or supernatural beings as the central ''[[dramatis personæ]]'' for the first time. The plays are [[At the Hawk's Well]], ''The Dreaming of the Bones'', ''The Words upon the Window-Fane'', and ''Purgatory''.&lt;ref name=Takahashi /&gt;

==Aesthetic terminology==
Zeami and Zenchiku describe a number of distinct qualities that are thought to be essential to the proper understanding of Noh as an art form.
* '''''Hana''''' (花, flower): In the ''Kadensho'' (Instructions on the Posture of the Flower), Zeami describes ''hana'' saying "after you master the secrets of all things and exhaust the possibilities of every device, the ''hana'' that never vanishes still remains." &lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt; The true Noh performer seeks to cultivate a rarefied relationship with his audience similar to the way that one cultivates flowers.  What is notable about ''hana'' is that, like a flower, it is meant to be appreciated by any audience, no matter how lofty or how coarse his upbringing.  ''Hana'' comes in two forms.  Individual ''hana'' is the beauty of the flower of youth, which passes with time, while "true ''hana''" is the flower of creating and sharing perfect beauty through performance.
* '''''Yūgen''''' (幽玄, profound sublimity): ''Yūgen'' is a concept valued in various forms of art throughout Japanese culture. Originally used to mean elegance or grace representing the perfect beauty in ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'', ''yūgen'' is invisible beauty that is felt rather than seen in a work of art. The term is used specifically in relation to Noh to mean the profound beauty of the transcendental world, including mournful beauty involved in sadness and loss.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;
* '''''Rōjaku''''' (老弱): ''Rō'' means old, and ''jaku'' means tranquil and quiet. Rōjaku is the final stage of performance development of the Noh actor, in which he eliminates all unnecessary action or sound in the performance, leaving only the true essence of the scene or action being imitated.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;
* '''''Kokoro''''' or '''''shin''''' (both 心): Defined as "heart," "mind," or both.  The kokoro of noh is that which Zeami speaks of in his teachings, and is more easily defined as "mind."  To develop hana the actor must enter a state of no-mind, or [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]].
* '''''Myō''''' (妙): the "charm" of an actor who performs flawlessly and without any sense of imitation; he effectively becomes his role.
* '''''Monomane''''' (物真似, imitation or mimesis): the intent of a Noh actor to accurately depict the motions of his role, as opposed to purely aesthetic reasons for abstraction or embellishment.  ''Monomane'' is sometimes contrasted with ''yūgen'', although the two represent endpoints of a continuum rather than being completely separate.
* '''''Kabu-isshin''''' (歌舞一心, "song-dance-one heart"): the theory that the song (including poetry) and dance are two halves of the same whole, and that the Noh actor strives to perform both with total unity of heart and mind.

==Existing Noh theatres==
Noh is still regularly performed today in public theatres as well as private theatres mostly located in major cities. There are more than 70 Noh theatres throughout Japan, presenting both professional and amateur productions.&lt;ref name="Noh Theater Search"&gt;{{cite web|title=Noh Theater Search|url=http://www.nohgaku.or.jp/hall/index.html|website=The Nohgaku Performers Association|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public theatres include [[National Noh Theatre]] (Tokyo), [[Nagoya Noh Theater]], and Osaka Noh Theater. Each Noh school has its own permanent theatre, such as Kanze Noh Theater (Tokyo), Hosho Noh Theater (Tokyo), Kongo Noh Theater ([[Kyoto]]), and Nara Komparu Noh Theater ([[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). Additionally, there are various prefectural and municipal theatres located throughout Japan that present touring professional companies and local amateur companies. In some regions, unique regional Noh such as [[Ogisai Kurokawa Noh]] have developed to form schools independent from five traditional schools.&lt;ref name=Komparu /&gt;

==Audience etiquette==
Audience etiquette is generally similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. [[Surtitles]] are not used, but some audience members follow along in the [[libretto]]. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.&lt;ref name=Ishii /&gt;

At the end of the play, the actors file out slowly (most important first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (''hashigakari''), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the ''shite'' character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in ''Kokaji,'' for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.&lt;ref name=Hayashi /&gt;

During the interval, [[tea]], [[coffee]], and ''[[wagashi]]'' (Japanese sweets) may be served in the lobby. In the Edo period, when Noh was a day-long affair, more substantial ''[[makunouchi]]' [[bentō]]'' (幕の内弁当, "between-acts lunchbox") were served. On special occasions, when the performance is over, お神酒 (''o-miki,'' ceremonial ''[[sake]]'') may be served in the lobby on the way out, as it happens in [[Shinto]] rituals.

The audience is seated in front of the stage, to the left side of the stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the ''metsuke-bashira'' pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.&lt;ref name=Ishii /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2111">In [[rhetoric]], '''parechesis''' ({{Lang|grc|παρήχησις}}) is the repetition of the same sound in several words in close succession.&lt;ref&gt;Gert J. C. Jordaan -''Ancient Greek Inside Out: The Semantics of Grammatical Constructions - Guide for Exegetes and Students in Classical and New Testament Greek''  2013- Page 171 3643903537 "NT: 1.27 Parechesis (παρήχησις, likeness ofsound) 0 Definition: Parechesis is repetition of the same sound in successive words. It includes alliteration (repetition of the same consonant) and assonance (repetition of the same vowel).&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of a parechesis is: "He persuades the Pithian ({{Lang|grc|πείθει τὸν Πειθίαν}})."&lt;ref&gt;cf. Xen. ''Hist.'' 7.41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] discusses parechesis in his work ''On the invention of arguments'' (Περὶ εὑρέσεως).&lt;ref&gt;Herm. ''Inv.'' 4.7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alliteration]] (initial rhyme) is a special case of parechesis. 

It is related to [[paronomasia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Historia Monachorum in Aegypto: Monastic Hagiography in ... 0191075817 Andrew Cain - 2016  "Three types of paronomasia are prevalent in the work: same root (verb) but different inflection;16 same root (verb) but different or added prefix;17 and same root but different derivatives.18 Parechesis is identical to paronomasia except that verbal resonance is achieved through the concurrence of words, similar in sound but dissimilar in sense, which are from different roots..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullinger, E. W. ''Figures of Speech Used in the Bible'' 1970  "In these cases, where the Paronomasia is in the Hebrew thought, it is called Parechesis so far as the Greek is concerned. And it is only when we go to the Hebrew thought that we can hear the Hebrew words sounding beside the Greek words."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RIA Novosti''' ({{lang-ru|РИА Новости}}), sometimes '''RIA''' ({{lang-ru|РИА}}) for short, was Russia's international [[news agency]] until 2013 and continues to be the name of a state-operated domestic Russian-language news agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1102275.stm#media Country profile: Russia – Media], BBC News, last updated 6 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Operating under the purview of the Russian [[Ministry of Communications and Mass Media (Russia)|Ministry of Communications and Mass Media]], RIA Novosti is headquartered in [[Moscow]] and operated about 80 bureaus internationally.

Its Russian name was '''[[Federal State Unitary Enterprise]] Russian Agency of International Information «RIA Novosti»''' ({{lang-ru|Федеральное государственное унитарное предприятие Российское агентство международной информации «РИА Новости», Federal'noye Gosudarstvennoye Unitarnoye Predpyatye Rossiyskoye Agentsvo Mezhdunarodnoy Informatsii}}), ''[[Unitary enterprise|FGUP]] RAMI «RIA Novosti»'' ({{lang-ru|ФГУП РАМИ «РИА Новости»}}) for short. Its formal English name was '''Russian News &amp; Information Agency "RIA Novosti"'''. Early in 1990s it had the name '''state enterprise RIA «Novosti»''' (named after Soviet ''Press Agency «Novosti»'' and ''Information Agency «Novosti»''). ''RIA'' means ''Russian Information Agency'' and ''Novosti'' means ''News'' in Russian. The common abbreviation in Russian is RIA.

==History==
RIA Novosti's history dates back to June 24, 1941, when by a resolution of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|USSR Council of People’s Commissars]] and the Communist Party Central Committee, "''On the Establishment and Tasks of the Soviet Information Bureau''", the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] (Sovinformburo) was set up under the USSR Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee. Its main task was to oversee work to cover international, military events and the events of the country's domestic life in periodicals and on the radio (from October 14, 1941, to March 3, 1942, was based in Kuibyshev – modern-day Samara).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The bureau's main task was to compile reports on the situation on the frontline of the war, work on the home front, and the partisan movement for the radio, newspapers and magazines. Sovinformburo directed the activity of the All-Slavonic Committee, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Women, Anti-Nazi Committee of the Soviet Youth, Anti-Nazi Committee of Soviet Scientists, and the Jewish Anti-Nazi Committee. In 1944, a special bureau on propaganda for foreign countries was set up as part of Sovinformburo.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Through 1,171 newspapers, 523 magazines and 18 radio stations in 23 countries, Soviet embassies abroad, friendship societies, trade unions, women's, youth and scientific organizations, Sovinformburo informed readers and listeners about the struggle of the Soviet people against Nazism and in the post-war years about the main areas of Soviet domestic and foreign policies.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Sovinformburo heads included [[Aleksandr Shcherbakov (politician)|A.S. Shcherbakov]] (1941–45), [[Solomon Lozovsky|S. A. Lozovsky]] (1945–48) and Y.S. Khavinson, D.A. Polikarpov.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

[[File:Newspaper stall and women in East Berlin, with person in wheelchair, 1984.jpg|thumb|right|Novosti operated this East Berlin [[news stall]] in 1984.]]
In 1961, the Novosti Press Agency (APN) succeeded Sovinformburo. It became the leading information and press body of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] public organizations. The constituent conference was held on February 21, 1961. The conference of representatives of Soviet public organizations adopted a decision to create a press agency of public organizations named Novosti. The agency's guiding body was the Council of the Agency’s Founders.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The APN founders were the USSR Journalists Union, USSR Writers Union, Union of Soviet Societies of Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Znaniye Society. On April 3, 1961, the Agency charter was adopted. Under its charter, APN's aim was "to contribute to mutual understanding, trust and friendship among peoples in every possible way by broadly publishing accurate information about the USSR abroad and familiarizing the Soviet public with the life of the peoples of foreign countries." APN's motto was "Information for Peace, for the Friendship of Nations". APN had bureaus in over 120 countries. The Agency published 60 illustrated newspapers and magazines in 45 languages with a one-time circulation of 4.3 million copies. With the Union of Soviet Friendship Societies, APN published the newspaper, ''Moscow News'', which in September 1990 became an independent publication. APN Publishing House put out over 200 books and booklets with a total annual circulation of 20 million copies. In 1989, a TV center opened in APN. Later, it was transformed into the TV-Novosti TV company.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The APN heads included Boris Burkov (1961–70), Ivan Udaltsov (1970–75), Lev Tolkunov (1975–83), Pavel Naumov (1983–86), [[Valentin Falin]] (1986–88), Albert Vlasov (1988–90).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
[[Image:Newsroom RIA Novosti, Moscow 2.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The newsroom of the agency, 2008]]
By a decree of USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, "On the Establishment of the Information Agency Novosti," the Information Agency Novosti (IAN) succeeded APN on July 27, 1990. "To provide information support for the USSR's state domestic and foreign policies and proceeding from the interests of the democratization of the mass media," the Novosti Press Agency was renamed the Information Agency Novosti (IAN). IAN's tasks remained the same – preparing and publishing printed, TV and radio materials in the USSR and abroad; studying public opinion on Soviet foreign and domestic policies in the USSR and abroad." A computer databank was created in the Agency. Initially, it contained over 250,000 documents. In 1991, the Infonews hotline started operating in the Agency. IAN had bureaus in 120 countries. It published 13 illustrated magazines and newspapers. The chairman of the IAN Board was Albert Ivanovich Vlasov.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

[[File:Information Office - Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C.JPG|thumb|240px|RIA Novosti bureau in Washington DC]]
The Russian Information Agency Novosti was created in September 1991 on the basis of IAN and the Russian Information Agency. By a [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential decree]] of the Russian president dated August 22, 1991, RIA Novosti was placed within the competence of the Press and Information Ministry. RIA Novosti had about 80 bureaus and news offices abroad, over 1,500 subscribers in CIS countries and about a hundred in non-CIS countries. A [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential decree]] of the [[President of Russia|Russian president]] of September 15, 1993 "''On the Russian Information Agency Novosti''", transformed RIA Novosti to a state news-analytical agency. RIA Novosti's radio channel – RIA-Radio worked in 1996. In August 1997, the TV channel Kultura was set up on the basis of the RIA TV channel under the sponsorship of the [[VGTRK]] TV and radio broadcasting company. By a decree of the Russian president, "On Improving the Work of the State Electronic Media," the VGTRK information holding was created in May 1998, which RIA Novosti joined.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

In May 1998, the agency was renamed the Russian Information Agency Vesti. As a mass media body, it retained the name of RIA Novosti.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; In 2005, RIA Novosti launched [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (originally Russia Today) a global multilingual television news network, which is a government-funded but autonomous, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]]. RIA Novosti asserts that it "merely participated in establishing the channel" which retained "complete legal, editorial and operational independence."&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaus von Twickel.

'''Radio y Televisión Martí''' is a US propaganda broadcaster based in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], financed and sanctioned by the [[Federal government of the United States]] through the [[U.S. Agency for Global Media]] (formerly Broadcasting Board of Governors, BBG), which transmits [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] propaganda in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to [[Cuba]]. Its broadcasts can also be heard and viewed worldwide through their website and on [[shortwave radio]] frequencies.

Named after the [[Hero of the Republic of Cuba|Cuban national hero]] and intellectual [[José Martí]], it was established in 1983 with the addition of TV Martí in 1990.&lt;ref name="cl01"/&gt; The 2014 budget for the Cuba broadcasting program is approximately US$27 million.

Radio y Televisión Martí is an element of the [[International Broadcasting Bureau]] (IBB). The sister elements in the IBB are [[Voice of America]] (VOA), [[Alhurra]]/[[Radio Sawa]], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL), [[Radio Farda]], and [[Radio Free Asia]] (RFA). The IBB and the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] are independent federal entities spun off from the now defunct [[United States Information Agency]].

==Radio Martí==
===History===
In the early 1980s, the U.S. Government planned to create a radio station to be known as Radio Free Cuba, modeled on [[Radio Free Europe]]/[[Radio Liberty]], the mission of fighting [[communism]] in an attempt to incite a [[coup d'état]] against [[President of Cuba|Cuban President]] [[Fidel Castro]]. The station – renamed ''Radio Martí'' after Cuban writer [[José Martí]], who had fought for Cuba's independence from [[Spain]] and against U.S. influence in the [[Americas]] – was established in 1983 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] at the urging of [[Jorge Mas Canosa]]. Existing [[North America]]n broadcasters objected strenuously to the establishment of Radio Martí, fearing that its broadcasts would lead Cuba to retaliate by [[Radio jamming|jamming]] existing commercial medium-wave broadcasts from Florida.

On May 20, 1985, Radio Martí began broadcasts to Cuba from the United States. The first day of broadcasting was chosen to commemorate the 83rd anniversary of [[Cuba (1902–1959)#Cuba in the early 20th century|Cuba's independence from United States rule]] on May 20, 1902. The fears of broadcasters proved well-founded, when Cuba-based transmitters briefly broadcast powerful signals on the medium-wave band in 1985, disrupting U.S. [[AM radio ]]station broadcasts in several states.  Cuba continues to broadcast interference against U.S. broadcasts specifically directed to Cuba in attempts to prevent them from being received within Cuba.

After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] at the end of 1991, the budget for all U.S.-government-run foreign broadcasters, with the exception of Radio Martí, was sharply reduced. In 1996, Radio Martí{{'}}s studios were moved from [[Washington, D.C.]]  to Miami, Florida. The move, in addition to placing the station's studios closer to its target audience, also underscored its growing independence from the [[Voice of America]], another U.S.-government-run foreign broadcaster with which Radio Martí had previously shared studios.

===Today===
[[File:Radio Martí broadcast studio.jpg|thumb|left|Radio Martí broadcast studio.]]
Today, Radio Marti broadcasts over [[Shortwave|short-wave]] transmitters in [[Delano, California|Delano]], [[California]], and [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]], [[North Carolina]], and a [[Mediumwave|medium-wave]] transmitter in [[Marathon, Florida|Marathon]], Florida (GC: {{Coord|24|41|58|N|81|5|19|W|type:landmark_scale:2000_region:US}}). Its studios are located in Miami, Florida. Cuba jams both the medium-wave and shortwave signals, but the shortwave program is heard in [[Canada]] and throughout [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. On occasion, the medium-wave transmitter at 1180&amp;nbsp;kHz can be heard as far north as [[Washington, D.C.]]

Two hours of Radio Martí's news programs are carried each night, 10:00 PM to midnight local time, by Miami's [[WSUA]] (Caracol 1260 AM). Three hours of news, sports and entertainment programming are available to subscribers of [[SiriusXM]] Satellite Radio on channel 153 Monday to Friday from 9:00 PM to midnight.{{fact|date=March 2016}} Additionally, Radio Marti is streamed live on martinoticias.com and for users of the martinoticas App available on iTunes and Android.

Radio Martí operates with about 100 employees and a budget of $15 million. Its mission, in its own words, is to provide "a contrast to Cuban media and provide its listeners with an uncensored view of current events." Former prisoners in Cuba and [[Cuban exile]]s often speak on Radio Martí, and on Saturdays a Spanish-language version of the U.S. president's weekly radio address, as well as the opposition's response, are transmitted.&lt;ref name="philly1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nichols |first=John S. |date=September 11, 1993 |title=Pull The Plug On Politicized Radio Marti |url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-09-11/news/25985369_1_television-marti-tv-marti-cuban-government-jamming |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate= June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessments==
There is much debate about the effectiveness of these broadcasts. As with Radio Free Europe during the [[Cold War]], there is no way to judge the station's true audience through the usual listener surveys. Thus, the actual number of listeners is open to speculation. 

The watchdog group Cuban Americans for Engagement (CAFE) has been critical of the radio station and television for broadcasts critical of warming relations and cooperative efforts with U.S. organizations. A report from the Committee on Foreign Relations in 2010 reported that less than 2 percent of Cubans listen in and U.S. Senator [[Mark Pryor]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arkansas|AR]]) and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] member [[Betty McCollum]] introduced the Stop Wasting Taxpayer Money on Cuba Broadcasting Act to shut the stations down. Alliance for Responsible Cuba Policy has also been critical of the stations.&lt;ref name="cl01"&gt;{{cite news |last=Perry |first=Mitch |date=February 20, 2014 |title=Propping up the propaganda; What's the point of Radio and TV Marti? |url=http://cltampa.com/politicalanimal/archives/2014/02/20/propping-up-the-propaganda |newspaper=[[Creative Loafing|Creative Loafing Tampa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV Martí==
===History===
In 1990, the U.S. Government created TV Martí to broadcast television programming to Cuba. It began broadcasting on March 27, 1990, beaming daily programs in Spanish via a transmitter affixed to an [[aerostat]] balloon – nicknamed "Fat Albert" by people in the area – tethered 10,000 feet (3,048 m) above [[Cudjoe Key, Florida|Cudjoe Key]], Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibb7-2.ibb.gov/pubaff/ocbfact.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218010656/http://ibb7-2.ibb.gov/pubaff/ocbfact.html |archivedate=February 18, 2007 |title=Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 2001 |website= |publisher=Office of Cuba Broadcasting, International Broadcasting Bureau, Office of External Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather affected the broadcasts; "Fat Albert" sometimes was hauled down because of high winds, once broke loose and drifted into the [[Everglades]] in 1991, and was destroyed by [[Hurricane Dennis]] in 2005. After the aerostat{{'}}s destruction, TV Martí in October 2006 began to use [[fixed-wing aircraft]] to transmit its signals, first a military [[C-130 Hercules]] which proved too expensive to operate, and then a [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream twin engine]] airplane flying a figure-eight pattern off [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], Florida. One of these aircraft has since been retired.&lt;ref name="fahrenthold"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fahrenthold |first=David |date=September 2, 2013 |title=Grounded TV Marti plane a monument to the limits of American austerity |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/grounded-tv-marti-plane-a-monument-to-the-limits-of-american-austerity/2013/09/02/18cdc324-1047-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first TV Martí broadcasts took place in the very early morning hours to avoid interference with Cuban domestic television programming. This combined with Cuban jamming of the signal has led to low viewership of TV Martí in Cuba, where, according to a U.S. official who was stationed in [[Havana]] in the station{{'}}s early days, it is known as ''La TV que no se ve'' ("The TV that can't be seen"). U.S. Government telephone surveys in 1990, 2003, 2006, and 2008 reported Cuban viewership of TV Martí of less than one percent; the U.S. Government ceased the surveys after 2008, claiming that obtaining accurate Cuban domestic television viewership statistics was too difficult.&lt;ref name="fahrenthold"/&gt;

Despite the frequent reports of its low viewership in Cuba, TV Martí{{'}}s defenders cited continuing Cuban government jamming of its signal as evidence of its importance, and U.S. Government funding of it continued, with TV Martí broadcasting daily programs in Spanish. In 2012, the administration of President [[Barack Obama]] finally asked the [[United States Congress]] to cease funding of the program, but Congress nonetheless continued to provide money for it.&lt;ref name="fahrenthold"/&gt;

===TV Martí today===

Like Radio Martí, TV Martí is an element of the International Broadcasting Bureau. TV Marti airs half-hour early and late evening newscasts which a low-power Miami [[television channel]], [[WGEN-TV|WGEN-LD]], Virtual digital Channel 8.1 (RF digital Channel 45.1), carries along with other propaganda.&lt;ref name="usc1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/070104_tv_radio_marti_boost_their_volume_to_cuba_expanding_their_servi |title=TV/Radio Marti Boost Their Volume to Cuba, Expanding Their Services |last1=Snyder |first1=Alvin |date=January 4, 2007 |publisher=[[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pay-TV platform [[DirecTV]], which is pirated by many people in Cuba, also carries TV Martí. 

In May 2013, the U.S. Congress finally eliminated funding for the operation of ''Aero Martí'', the lone aircraft still committed to TV Martí broadcasts. However, funding for the preservation and maintenance of the plane continues, and it remains in storage in a [[hangar]] in [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], ready to return to service if funding of its operations resumes.&lt;ref name="fahrenthold"/&gt;

==Controversy and legality==
Fabio Leite, Deputy Director of the Radiocommunications Office of the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), has condemned radio and television transmissions to Cuba from the United States as illegal and inadmissible and more so when they are designed to foment internal subversion on the island. The director emphasized that this constant U.S. attack is in violation of ITU regulations, which stipulate that radio transmissions within commercial broadcasting on medium wave, modulated frequency or television must be conceived of as a good quality national service within the limits of the country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davalos |first=Gabriel |date=February 14, 2007 |title=Radio-electronic aggression of Cuba condemned |url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2007/febrero/mier14/07conden-i.html |deadurl=yes |newspaper=[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]] |location= |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017021606/http://granma.cu/ingles/2007/febrero/mier14/07conden-i.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban government also has insisted the penetration of their airwaves violates international law. This claim has not been elucidated; however, Cuba responds to these broadcasts by jamming the signals.

The Radio Martí broadcasts are directed at Cuba, but can be picked up throughout North, Central, and South America when Cuba is not jamming them. However, Radio Martí programs cannot be specifically directed at U.S. citizens under the same law that restricts Voice of America broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5329394.stm |title=US 'paid anti-Cuba journalists' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 8, 2006 |website=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2007, delegates to the World Radiocommunication Conference 2007 declared illegal the U.S. government's use of airplanes to beam the signals of Washington-funded Radio y Televisión Martí into Cuba, stating "A radio broadcasting station that functions on board an aircraft and transmits only to the territory of another administration without its agreement cannot be considered in conformity with the radio communications regulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/825879/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20071217052232/http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/825879/ |archivedate=2007-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B4FDFDE06-BB12-49C5-8BAE-EA1D06B8E794%7D)&amp;language=EN |title=US Radio Bombing of Cuba Found Illegal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119215903/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B4FDFDE06-BB12-49C5-8BAE-EA1D06B8E794%7D%29&amp;language=EN |publisher=[[Prensa Latina]] |archivedate=November 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] accuses the station of engaging in political propaganda in the forms of editorializing, use of offensive and incendiary language in broadcasts, use of unsubstantiated reports coming from Cuba, and presentation of individual views as news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=David |date=February 15, 2009 |title=Time to scrap TV Marti, critics say |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/world/time-to-scrap-tv-marti-critics-say/976246 |newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=February 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims of unprofessionalism are strongly rejected by the station's management. [[National Public Radio]]'s [[On the Media]] programme has pointed out that while "the U.S. has spent close to a half billion dollars on TV and Radio Martí, the Cuban government has managed to effectively block the transmission signal, at least on the TV side. Viewership on the island is estimated to be a third of one percent. One study several years ago found that nine out of ten Cubans had never even heard of the channel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_081806_e.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001132449/http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_081806_e.html |archivedate=October 1, 2006 |subject= John Nichols |interviewer= [[Bob Garfield]] |title=Straits Flush  |work= [[On the Media]] |publisher= [[WNYC]]/[[NPR|National Public Radio]] |location= New York City |date= August 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a January 10, 2007 episode of the news and commentary program ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CRE) called for a congressional investigation into the legality of broadcasting Radio and TV Martí over commercial airwaves from southern Florida. The group states that the Bush administration has reached an agreement with two south Florida commercial Spanish-language TV and radio stations to broadcast the TV Martí program, which the CRE accuses the US government of illegally paying the station $200,000 to air the Radio Martí program daily for six months, citing that U.S law prohibits broadcasting of propaganda inside the country.

''Democracy Now!'' went on to state that a senior TV Martí executive was indicted by federal prosecutors for providing kickbacks in trade for certain contracts and the [[inspector general]]{{'}}s office has launched a review into the operations of the [[Office of Cuba Broadcasting]] which oversees Martí. In addition, the program indicates that [[Massachusetts]] Congressman [[William Delahunt]] has also promised to hold hearings on TV Martí.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/10/should_state_run_media_be_broadcast |subject= Joe O’Connell, John Nichols, [[Joe García]] |interviewer= [[Amy Goodman]] |title=Should State-Run Media Be Broadcast in the United States? A Debate on Radio and TV Marti Airing in South Florida |work= [[Democracy Now!]] |publisher= [[Pacifica Radio]] |location= New York City |date= January 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics consider the actual ineffectiveness to reach a Cuban audience, the risk of the broadcaster's purposes for heavy budget-cuts and the fear of limited editorial independence in order to be manipulated by right-wing Cuban exiles and their political agenda for personal political gain.&lt;ref name="philly1"/&gt;

On September 28, 2015, at his first speech ever to the United Nations General Assembly, President Raúl Castro demanded an end to "anti-government radio and television broadcasts".

In May 2018 Martí broadcast video segments attacking George Soros as a "multimillionaire Jew of Hungarian origin" threatening Latin American democracy. The videos were based on assertions by [[Judicial Watch]]. In October 2018 the employees responsible for producing the videos were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into their conduct.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/10/us-government-funded-news-network-ran-a-hit-piece-on-soros-that-called-him-a-multimillionaire-jew/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Ranma ½'''''|らんま 1/2|Ranma Nibun-no-Ichi|pronounced ''Ranma One-Half''|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Rumiko Takahashi]]. It was serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Sunday]]'' from September 1987 to March 1996, with the chapters collected into 38 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by [[Shogakukan]]. The story revolves around a teenage boy named [[Ranma Saotome]] who has trained in [[martial arts]] since early childhood. As a result of an accident during a training journey, he is cursed to become a girl when splashed with cold water, while hot water changes him back into a boy. Throughout the series Ranma seeks out a way to rid himself of his curse, while his friends, enemies and many fiancées constantly hinder and interfere.

''Ranma ½'' has a comedic formula and a sex-changing main character, who often willfully transforms into a girl to advance his goals. The series also contains many other characters, whose intricate relationships with each other, unusual characteristics, and eccentric personalities drive most of the stories. Although the characters and their relationships are complicated, they rarely change once they are firmly introduced and settled into the series.

The manga has been adapted into two [[anime]] series created by [[Studio Deen]]: ''Ranma ½'' and {{Nihongo4|''Ranma ½ Nettōhen''|らんま½ 熱闘編}}, which together were broadcast on [[Fuji Television]] from 1989 to 1992. In addition, they developed 12 [[original video animation]]s and three films. In 2011, a live-action television special was produced and aired on [[Nippon Television]]. The manga and anime series were licensed by [[Viz Media]] for English-language releases in North America. [[Madman Entertainment]] released the manga, part of the anime series and the first two movies in [[Australasia]], while [[MVM Films]] released the first two movies in the [[United Kingdom]]. The ''Ranma ½'' manga has over 53 million copies in print in Japan. Both the manga and anime are cited as some of the first of their mediums to have become popular in the United States.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Ranma ½ characters}}

On a training journey in the [[Bayan Har Mountains|Bayankala Mountain Range]] in the [[Qinghai|Qinghai Province]] of China, [[Ranma Saotome]] and his father [[Genma Saotome|Genma]] fall into the cursed springs at {{nihongo4|Jusenkyo|呪泉郷}}. When someone falls into a cursed spring, they take the physical form of whatever drowned there hundreds or thousands of years ago whenever they come into contact with cold water. The curse will revert when exposed to hot water until their next cold water exposure. Genma fell into the spring of a drowned panda while Ranma fell into the spring of a drowned girl.

[[Soun Tendo]] is a fellow practitioner of {{nihongo4|''Musabetsu Kakutō Ryū''|無差別格闘流|}} or "Anything-Goes School" of martial arts and owner of a [[dojo]]. Genma and Soun agreed years ago that their children would marry and carry on the Tendo Dojo. Soun has three teenaged daughters: the polite and easygoing [[Kasumi Tendo|Kasumi]], the greedy and indifferent [[Nabiki Tendo|Nabiki]] and the short-tempered, martial arts practicing [[Akane Tendo|Akane]]. Akane, who is Ranma's age, is appointed for bridal duty by her sisters with the reasoning that they are the older sisters and can dump the duty on her, and that they all dislike the arranged engagement and think Akane's dislike of men is the right way to express it to the fathers. At the appointed time they are surprised when a panda comes in and puts a girl in front of their father. The Tendo girls all laugh. It takes several more pages for the situation to be explained to Soun Tendo and his daughters. Both Ranma and Akane refuse the engagement initially, having not been consulted on the decision, but the fathers are insistent and they are generally treated as betrothed and end up helping or saving each other on some occasions. They are frequently found in each other's company and are constantly arguing in their trademark awkward love-hate manner that is a franchise focus.

Ranma goes to school with Akane at {{nihongo4|Furinkan High School|風林館高校|Fūrinkan Kōkō}}, where he meets his recurring opponent [[Tatewaki Kuno]], the conceited [[kendo]] team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also falls in love with Ranma's female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters eventually knowing it). [[Nerima]] serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost [[Ryoga Hibiki]] who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately fell into the Spring of the Drowned Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he takes the form of a little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted [[Mousse (Ranma ½)|Mousse]], who also fell into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Genma and Soun's impish grandmaster, [[Happosai]], who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.

Ranma's prospective paramours include the martial arts rhythmic gymnastics champion [[Kodachi Kuno]], and his second fiancée and childhood friend [[Ukyo Kuonji]] the [[okonomiyaki]] vendor, along with the Chinese [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Shampoo (Ranma ½)|Shampoo]], supported by her great-grandmother [[Cologne (Ranma ½)|Cologne]]. As the series progresses, the school becomes more eccentric with the return of the demented, Hawaii-obsessed [[Principal Kuno]] and the placement of the power-leeching alternating child/adult [[Hinako Ninomiya]] as Ranma's English teacher. Ranma's indecision to choose his true love causes chaos in his romantic and school life.

==Production==
[[Rumiko Takahashi]] stated that ''Ranma ½'' was conceived to be a martial arts manga that connects all aspects of everyday life to martial arts.&lt;ref name="ComestoAmerica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi10.html |title=Inuyasha Comes to America |last=Yoshida |first=Toshifumi |publisher=Furinkan.com |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because her previous series had female protagonists, the author decided that she wanted a male this time. However, she was worried about writing a male main character, and therefore decided to make him half-female.&lt;ref name="Italian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi8.html |title=Interview in Italy |last=Acres |first=Dylan |publisher=Furinkan.com |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before deciding on water for initiating his changes, she considered Ranma changing every time he was punched. It was after deciding this that she felt Jusenkyo had to be set in China, as it is the only place that could have such mysterious springs.&lt;ref name="MemorialBook"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi2.html |title=Memorial Interview |publisher=Furinkan.com |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She drew inspiration for ''Ranma ½'' from a variety of real-world objects. Some of the places frequently seen in the series are modeled after actual locations in Nerima, Tokyo (both the home of Takahashi and the setting of ''Ranma ½'').&lt;ref name="furinkan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.furinkan.com/ranma/misc/inspirations.html |publisher=Ranma ½ Perfect Edition |title=Miscellaneous – Inspirations |date=2006-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224115426/http://www.furinkan.com/ranma/misc/inspirations.html |archivedate=2007-02-24 |df= }}&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1990 interview with ''[[Amazing Heroes]]'', Takahashi stated that she had four assistants that draw the backgrounds, panel lines and tone, while she creates the story and layout, and pencils and inks the characters.&lt;ref name="Retrospective"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi3.html |title=Career Retrospective |last=Smith |first=Toren |authorlink1=Toren Smith |publisher=Furinkan.com |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; All her assistants are female; Takahashi stated that "I don't use male assistants so that the girls will work more seriously if they aren't worried about boys." In 1992, she explained her process as beginning with laying out the chapter in the evening so as to finish it by dawn, and resting for a day before calling her assistants. They finish it in two or three nights, usually utilizing five days for a chapter.&lt;ref name="Italian" /&gt;

Takahashi purposefully aimed the series to be popular with women and children. In 1993, an ''[[Animerica]]'' interviewer talking with Takahashi asked her if she intended the sex-changing theme "as an effort to enlighten a male-dominated society." Takahashi said that she does not think in terms of societal agendas and that she created the ''Ranma ½'' concept from simply wanting "a simple, fun idea". She added that she, as a woman and while recalling what manga she liked to read as a child, felt that "humans turning into animals might also be fun and [[:Wiktionary:märchenhaft|märchenhaft]]... you know, like a fairy tale."&lt;ref name="Takahash7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi7.html |title=Animerica Interview |last=Horibuchi |first=Seiji |publisher=Furinkan.com |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she revealed that at the start of ''Ranma'' her editor told her to make it more dramatic, but she felt that was something she could not do. However, she admitted that drama did start to appear at the end. She also sat in on the voice actor auditions for the anime, where she insisted that male and female Ranma be voiced by different actors whose gender corresponded to that of the part.&lt;ref name="35anniversary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://natalie.mu/comic/pp/rumic35/page/2#contents2 |title=35th Anniversary Interview |publisher=Natalie.mu |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manga===
{{main article|List of Ranma ½ chapters}}

Written and illustrated by [[Rumiko Takahashi]], ''Ranma ½'' began publication in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Sunday]]'' issue #36 of 1987, following the ending of her series ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]''. From September 1987 until March 1996, the manga was published on a near weekly basis with the occasional colored page to spruce up the usually black and white stories. After nearly a decade of storylines, the final chapter was published in ''Weekly Shōnen Sunday'' issue #12 of 1996. The 407 chapters were periodically collected and published by [[Shogakukan]] into a total of 38 black and white ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes from 1988 to 1996. They were reassembled into 38 ''[[shinsōban]]'' from April 2002 to October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://skygarden.shogakukan.co.jp/skygarden/owa/solc_dtl?isbn=4091265014| script-title=ja:らんま１／２〔新装版〕 / 1| publisher=[[Shogakukan]]| language=Japanese| accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://skygarden.shogakukan.co.jp/skygarden/owa/solc_dtl?isbn=4091265383| script-title=ja:らんま１／２〔新装版〕 / 38| publisher=[[Shogakukan]]| language=Japanese| accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American publisher [[Viz Media]] originally released ''Ranma ½'' in a monthly [[comic book]] format that contained two chapters each from 1992 to 2003, and had the images "flipped" to read left-to-right, causing the art to be mirrored. These were periodically collected into graphic novels. On March 18, 2004, after releasing 21 volumes, Viz announced that it would reprint a number of its graphic novels. The content remained the same, but the novels moved to a smaller format with different covers and a price drop.&lt;ref name="viz-secondeditionmanga"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/2004/03_secondedition.php |publisher=Viz Media |title=2004 Press Releases |date= April 25, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230134551/http://viz.com/news/newsroom/2004/03_secondedition.php |archivedate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each volume covers roughly the same amount of material as the Japanese volumes, but retained its left-to-right format and had minor differences in grouping so that it spans 36 volumes rather than the original 38. The final volume was released in stores on November 14, 2006,&lt;ref name="viz-vol36page"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.viz.com/products/products.php?product_id=5766 |date= October 20, 2006 |publisher=Viz Media |title=Product page for volume 36}}&lt;!-- {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.viz.com/products/products.php?product_id=5766 |date=* }}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it Viz's longest running manga, spanning over 13 years. At [[Anime Expo]] on July 7, 2013, Viz Media announced they would begin re-releasing the manga in a format that combines two individual volumes into a single large one. With the first volume published on March 11, 2014, it marks the first time the series has been released in North America in its original right-to-left format.&lt;ref name="2in1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-07/viz-media-adds-deadman-wonderland-gangsta-manga|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|title=Viz Media Adds Deadman Wonderland, Gangsta. Manga|date=2013-07-07|accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madman Entertainment]] publishes the two-in-one version in Australasia.

Together with ''[[Spriggan (manga)|Spriggan]]'', it was the first manga published in Portugal, by [[Texto Editora]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bedeteca.com/index.php?pageID=recortes&amp;recortesID=1555|title= Fenómeno Manga ameaça explosão |author= Pedro Cleto|date= 15 November 2004|accessdate= 14 December 2014|work= bedeteca.com|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anime===
{{Main article|List of Ranma ½ episodes}}

An [[anime]] television series was created by [[Studio Deen]] and aired weekly between April 15, 1989 and September 16, 1989 on [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] for 18 episodes, before being canceled due to low ratings. The series was then reworked by most of the same staff, retitled {{Nihongo4|''Ranma ½ Nettōhen''|らんま½ 熱闘編}} and launched in a different time slot, running for 143 episodes from October 20, 1989 to September 25, 1992. The anime stays true to the original manga but does differ by keeping Ranma's sex transformation a secret from the high school students, at least throughout most of its length. It also does not introduce [[Hikaru Gosunkugi]] until very late in the series, instead, [[Sasuke Sarugakure]], the diminutive ninja retainer of the Kuno family fills a number of Gosunkugi's roles in early storylines but is a major character in his own right. The anime also alters the placement of many story arcs and contains numerous original episodes and characters not adapted from the manga.

Viz Media licensed both anime series in 1993, making ''Ranma ½'' one of the very first anime titles licensed by Viz. The English dub produced for the series was recorded by [[The Ocean Group]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. They released the series on VHS from their own ''Viz Video'' label, and on DVD a few years later in association with [[Geneon USA|Pioneer Home Entertainment]]. Their releases collected both anime series as one, separated episodes into what they call "seasons", and changed the ordering of many of the episodes. Viz themselves re-released it on DVD in 2007 using their own DVD production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JVT28G/ |title=Ranma 1/2: Season One: The Digital Dojo; TV Anime Season 1 DVD Box Set|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Otakon]] 2013, Viz announced that they re-acquired the TV series for [[Blu-ray]] and DVD release in 2014. The show is streamed on their anime channel service [[Neon Alley]] since Autumn 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viz Media to Release Ranma Anime on BD/DVD|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/viz-media-to-release-ranma-anime-on-bd/dvd|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madman Entertainment]] licensed some of the series for release in [[Australasia]], although their rights expired after releasing only the first four "seasons" as one series.&lt;ref name="Madseason1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/ranma-12-tv-season-1-collection_article_78225.html|title=Ranma 1/2 TV Season 1 Collection|publisher=Mania.com|accessdate=February 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216190226/http://www.mania.com/ranma-12-tv-season-1-collection_article_78225.html|archivedate=December 16, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="madseason4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Madman Panel - Complete Report|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2006/madman-panel-complete-report|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films and original video animations===
{{Main article|List of Ranma ½ episodes#Films}}
Studio Deen also created three theatrical films; ''The Battle of Nekonron, China! A Battle to Defy the Rules!'' on November 2, 1991; ''Battle at Togenkyo! Get Back the Brides'' on August 1, 1992; and ''Super Indiscriminate Decisive Battle! Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix'' on August 20, 1994. The first two movies are feature length, but the third was originally shown in theaters with two other movies: ''[[Ghost Sweeper Mikami]]'' and ''Heisei Dog Stories: Bow''.

Following the ending of the TV series, 11 [[original video animation]]s were released directly to home video, the earliest on December 7, 1993 and the eleventh on June 4, 1996.&lt;ref name="furinkan_ranma_ova"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.furinkan.com/ranma/anime/ovas.html |publisher=Ranma ½ Perfect Edition |title=OVAs |date= November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; All but one are based on stories originally in the manga. Twelve years later, a ''Ranma'' animation was created for the "It's a Rumic World" exhibition of Rumiko Takahashi's artwork. Based on the "Nightmare! Incense of Deep Sleep" manga story from volume 34, it was shown on odd numbered days at the exhibition in Tokyo from July 30 to August 11, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Ranma 1/2 Short Debuts at Takahashi's Tokyo Event|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-08-02/new-ranma-short-debuts-at-takahashi-tokyo-event|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not released until January 29, 2010, when it was put in a DVD box set with the ''Urusei Yatsura'' and ''[[Inuyasha]]'' specials that premiered at the same exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B002IWF242/ |title=It's a Rumic World スペシャルアニメBOX【完全予約限定商品】 (DVD)|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then released on DVD and Blu-ray by itself on October 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0040I119M/ |title=It’s a Rumic World らんま1/2~悪夢!春眠香 (DVD)|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viz Media also licensed all three movies, and the original 11 OVAs for distribution in North America (however they released the third movie as an OVA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CCZRBI/ |title=Ranma 1/2: OVA Series Box Set|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EJ9VO8/ |title=Ranma 1/2 Movie Box Set|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MVM Films]] has released the first two movies in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="MVMmovie1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/ranma-movie-8211-big-trouble-nekonron-china_article_77596.html|title=Ranma 1/2 The Movie - Big Trouble Nekonron China|publisher=Mania.com|accessdate=February 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131530/http://www.mania.com/ranma-movie-8211-big-trouble-nekonron-china_article_77596.html|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MVMmovie2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/ranma-movie-2-nihao-my-concubine_article_77976.html|title=Ranma 1/2 The Movie 2 - Nihao My Concubine|publisher=Mania.com|accessdate=February 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154013/http://www.mania.com/ranma-movie-2-nihao-my-concubine_article_77976.html|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Madman Entertainment released them in Australasia.

===Video games===
{{Main article|List of Ranma ½ video games}}
There have been fifteen [[video game]]s based on the ''Ranma ½'' franchise.

==Reception==
Rumiko Takahashi said that after ''Urusei Yatsura'', which was popular with high school and college students, she purposefully aimed ''Ranma ½'' to be popular among women and children. Both series' peak readership figures were with 15-year-olds, but the distribution of ''Ranma ½'' readers was skewed towards younger females.&lt;ref name="Takahash7"/&gt; By November 2006, it was reported that the series had sold over 49 million manga volumes in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives/novx.htm|publisher=Anime News Service|title=Anime News Service - October 18 - November 9 Anime News|accessdate= June 27, 2011 |quote=RANMA has sold more than 49 million copies in Japan, and is one of the most recognized and acclaimed series ever produced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shogakukan has printed 53 million copies as of November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-23/live-action-ranma-tv-special-1st-ad-aired|title=Live-Action Ranma 1/2 TV Special's 1st Ad Aired|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Lum Invader|Lum]] from Takahashi's first series ''Urusei Yatsura'' is often cited as the first ''[[tsundere]]'' character in anime and manga, Theron Martin of [[Anime News Network]] stated that ''Ranma ½''{{'}}s Akane Tendo is closer to how they would later typically be portrayed in the 2000s. He also suggested that one could argue ''Ranma'' is an early example of a [[Harem (genre)|harem]] or reverse harem series, due to the main character attracting suitors in both genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/ranma/blu-ray-set-1|title=Ranma ½ Blu-Ray - Review|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series's publication in North America proved highly successful as well, being many Americans' first introduction to manga and its anime adaptation one of the first Japanese animation shows to achieve popularity in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/ranma-2-in-1-edition/gn-1|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|title=Ranma ½ [2-in-1 Edition] GN 1 - Review|date=2014-03-19|accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=The Rising Sun Responds|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=55|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=February 1994|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western comic book artists that have cited ''Ranma ½'' as an influence include Canadian [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]] on his series ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' and American [[Colleen Coover]] on her erotic series ''Small Favors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/12/02/tokyo-comicon-2017-bryan-lee-omalley-scott-pilgrim-talks-about-the-influence-from-ranma-12|title=Tokyo ComiCon 2017: Bryan Lee O'Malley (Scott Pilgrim) Talks about The Influence from "Ranma 1/2"|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=2017-12-02 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comicsalliance.com/colleen-coover-small-favors-interview/|title=Everyone Has Fun: Colleen Coover Talks 'Small Favors'|publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]]|date=2017-02-16 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an overview of the series, [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] called ''Ranma ½'' "the direct ancestor of all comedy-action manga, like ''[[Sumomomo Momomo]]'' and ''[[History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi]]''", although noted that it was not the first, but only spanned the period when manga and anime sales were at their height.&lt;ref name="JasonThompson"/&gt; Relating it to Takahashi's other works, he summed the series up as "At the start, the fighting is minimal and it's almost a semi-serious relationship comedy, like ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]''; then it turns completely ridiculous; and by the climax, when Ranma fights the evil bird-people of Phoenix Mountain in an excessively long and un-funny shonen fight scene, it's like a warmup for ''[[Inuyasha]]''."&lt;ref name="JasonThompson"/&gt; He states that "Eventually Takahashi adds too many characters, and the manga starts repeating itself. Because of the lack of a strong story arc, a lot of people stop reading ''Ranma ½'' at some point in the middle".&lt;ref name="JasonThompson"/&gt; Reviewing Viz Media's final English volume of the manga, Anime News Network remarked that "Every dimension of Rumiko Takahashi's storytelling skills come into play here: comedy, romance and introspection, and of course, high-flying fantasy martial-arts action."&lt;ref name="ANNreview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/ranma-1/2/gn-36|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|title=Ranma 1/2 GN 36|date=2007-02-06|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they felt some of the action scenes were hard to follow and noted that the mirroring to left-to-right format caused errors with the art.&lt;ref name="ANNreview"/&gt;

The ''Ranma ½'' anime was ranked number 17 on ''[[Anime Insider]]'''s 2001 list of the Top 50 Anime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-07-16/wizard-lists-top-50-anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|title=Wizard lists Top 50 Anime|date=2001-07-16|accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the list was limited to series that were released in North America.

{{nihongo|'''''Ring 0: Birthday'''''|リング0 バースデイ|Ringu Zero: Bāsudei}} is the 2000 Japanese [[Horror film|horror]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''  directed by [[Norio Tsuruta]]. The film is based on a [[screenplay]] by Hiroshi Takahashi which in turn is based on the short story ''Lemonheart'' from the ''[[Birthday (short story collection)|Birthday]]'' [[anthology]] by [[Koji Suzuki]].  ''Ring 0: Birthday'' was nominated for the 2001 edition of [[Fantasporto]] but lost to ''[[Amores perros]]''.

==Plot==
Thirty years before the events of ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', Akiko Miyaji, a reporter whose fiancé and fellow reporter was killed during Shizuko Yamamura's publicized ESP demonstration years before, interviews Sudo, an elementary school principal and a former teacher of Shizuko's daughter, Sadako, attempting to gain information and evidence that Sadako inherited her mother's [[nensha]] powers. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old Sadako joins an acting troupe as an [[understudy]] as a therapy to her nightmares suggested by her doctor. Sadako has natural beauty and charisma for the play, infuriating her senior, Aiko Hazuki, whose relationship with the troupe director, Yusaku Shigemori, sours due to the latter's newfound favor for the young trainee. Aiko is later found murdered by a figure in white, thus Sadako takes her place for the upcoming play as the lead character. Sadako attracts and reciprocates the attention of the troupe sound director, Hiroshi Toyama, much to the disappointment of costume designer and Toyama's girlfriend, Etsuko Tachihara. While praised by Shigemori and Toyama, other troupe members grow to distrust and fear Sadako, as they suspect that she is the one who caused Aiko's death and other supernatural occurrences, including strange dreams pertaining to a well and an apparition of a girl in white with long hair very similar to Sadako.

Meanwhile, Akiko is told by Sudo that though initially pleasant, Shizuko descended to madness before her suicide ever since her moving to live with Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, and that Sudo heard strange childlike noises in the attic. Etsuko, wanting to discover Sadako's origins, contacts Sadako's psychiatrist, but he refuses to answer and throws away Sadako's résumé; the résumé is taken by Akiko's assistant, allowing him and Akiko to locate Sadako in the troupe. When they start to photograph her, she telekinetically breaks the camera; the two later discover that all photographs contain ghostly faces and a girl with long hair, confirming Akiko's suspicion of the existence of "two" Sadakos. Shigemori, having been obsessed with Sadako, says that he knows of her dark past and tells that he will kill her if she tries to kill him so they could be together. However, Toyama interrupts the process and Shigemori is killed through a cut that also wounds Toyama. However, Sadako manages to heal him just by touching him and later is able to make a disabled man regain his ability to walk. The two confess their love for each other and promise to leave the troupe and live together after finishing their last play.

The play is a disaster as Sadako, influenced by recordings of her mother's demonstration played by Etsuko, sees visions of her mother and other reporters during the demonstration and kills her psychiatrist. The troupe members, except Toyama, beat her to death, though is informed by Akiko that their job is not yet done. They visit Ikuma who tells them that Sadako, once a single individual, split into two beings resembling each of her parents; the malevolent one who resembled her unknown father is kept from growing by Ikuma in the attic. Before they can kill it, both Sadakos merge with each other and escape with Toyama. In her merged form, Sadako kills all the troupe members, including Toyama. Akiko and Etsuko manage to flee and hide in Ikuma's house but Sadako corners them and forces Akiko to shoot Etsuko before forcing her to shoot herself.  

Sadako eventually recovers and tearfully mourns her own actions. However, Ikuma, albeit reluctantly, drugs and chases her to a nearby well, where he apologizes to her before throwing her down the well. Sadako briefly has a dream of meeting with Toyama again before cutting down to the present. She looks up and screams as the well stone is slid to its place, trapping her inside.

==Production==
In 1999, [[Koji Suzuki]] was finishing his written sources for the Ring series by including a fourth titled ''Birthday'' which collects three short stories that filled in details of the story.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}} [[Asmik Ace]] decided to hire ''[[Ring 2]]'' screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi to adapt the story ''Lemonheart'' from ''Birthday''.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}} ''Birthday'' captured the life of the character of [[Sadako Yamamura|Sadako]] just before she songigned to her fate seen in the later Ring series.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}} Producer Takasige Ichise offered [[Hideo Nakata]] the chance to direct who passed on the offer.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}}

==Reception==
Online film database [[AllMovie]] gave the film two stars out of five, referring to it as a "mediocre ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' rip" and that it "can only be truly reviled as a desecration of the original Ringu's uniquely persuasive and subtle horror." The review noted that the "film's effort to explain exactly who Sadako (Yukie Nakama) is and how she became a powerful evil force, the film heaps contrivance upon contrivance, mixing clichés from backstage melodramas with those from Carrie and all its imitators, and leaving the viewer with little beyond the strength of Nakama's appealing performance and a few mild scares to hang on to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/ringu-0-basudei-v250540/review|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|title=Ringu 0: Basudei|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandokan ''' is a fictional pirate of the late 19th century, who first appeared in publication in 1883, created by [[Italy|Italian]] author [[Emilio Salgari]]. He is the protagonist of eleven adventure novels and is known throughout the [[South China Sea]] as "The Tiger of [[Malaysia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1654&amp;lpg=PA1654&amp;dq=Sandokan+Emilio+Salgari.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pwJBz5jSvw&amp;sig=sQaU4piN_MyQ2DPuiOnS8vVukw8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oYTvVH3H8VLUp4IY&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&amp;q=Sandokan%20Emilio%20Salgari.&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2006-12-26 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sandokan novels==
[[Emilio Salgari]] wrote several novels chronicling the adventures of Sandokan and Yanez, two of his most legendary creations. The pirates are introduced in ''[[The Tigers of Mompracem]]'', which portrays their relentless struggle against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] powers that seek to wipe them out. In subsequent novels they battle against [[James Brooke]], the [[Raja]] of [[Sarawak]] and also travel to [[India]] to measure themselves against the [[Thuggee|Thugs]], a notorious band of stranglers devoted to the goddess [[Kali]].

The titles in the series are:
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Salgari riscossa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sandokan Fights Back]] --&gt;

The last two titles were published posthumously.

There were also several other Sandokan titles published by Italian authors Luigi Motta, Emilio Fancelli and Salgari's son Omar.

[[Paco Ignacio Taibo II]] has written a modern Sandokan novel called The Return of the Tigers of Malaysia.

==Fictional biography==
Sandokan is the son of Kaigadan, the last of a dynasty of rulers of [[Borneo]], whose parents were massacred by the British to take the throne. Sandokan has sworn revenge on them and assembles a group of rebel pirates, the Tigers of Mompracem, to attack them, which earns him the name of "The Tiger of Malaysia". Stranded in [[Labuan]], Sandokan is recovering of his wounds in the house of  Lord James Guillonk when he meets Marianna, "The Pearl of Labuan," the niece of Guillonk with whom he falls in love. Although having to escape, Sandokan manages to meet Marianna again and they marry eventually. Defeated by the British, he manages to free his men and apparently gives up piracy and escapes to Java with his wife.

Sandokan and his friend Yanez De Gomera, later help Kammamuri to fight [[James Brooke]], "The Exterminator", the White Rajah of Sarawak, so as to free Tremal-Naik. Sandokan eventually has to help Tremal-Naik again, when his daughter is kidnapped by the Thugs of the [[Kali]], a sect of killers commanded by Suyodhana, "The Tiger of India."

After many battles throughout the years, Sandokan manages to defeat all of his enemies and retires as rajah of Kili Balù, while his friend Yanez is appointed rajah of [[Assam]].

== Characteristics ==
Sandokan is depicted by Salgari as a gallant pirate. He is described as tall, charming, very muscular, slender and attractive, with cold, black eyes, a fierce and severe look, a big turban on his head. Unlike his troops, who are described as mostly half-naked, Sandokan always wears fine oriental clothes, generally red silk with embroidered gold, and long red leather boots.

Sandokan is a formidable fighter, brave, ruthless with his enemies, but kind, generous and faithful to his friends. He has absolute leadership over his men, and is often shown as having no fear, with Yanez playing as a sort of counterweight to his impulsive nature.

'''''Scolica enchiriadis''''' is an [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] ninth-century [[music theory]] treatise and commentary on its companion work, the ''[[Musica enchiriadis]]''. These treatises were once attributed to [[Hucbald]], but this is no longer accepted.&lt;ref name=hoppin&gt;Hoppin, Richard H. ''Medieval Music''. Norton, 1978, pp.188-193. {{ISBN|978-0-393-09090-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Scolica enchiriadis'' is written as a tripartite dialogue, and despite being a commentary on the ''Musica enchiriadis'', it is nearly three times as long. &lt;ref name=grove&gt;Erickson, Raymond. "Musica enchiriadis, Scholia enchiriadis". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''. London: Macmillan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the theory discussed by the treatise is indebted to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] conceptions of music, especially its affirmations of the importance of [[mathematics]] to music as kindred disciplines of the ''[[quadrivium]]''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Later sections draw heavily on the music theory of [[Boethius]] and [[Cassiodorus]], two early medieval authors whose works on music were widely read and circulated hundreds of years after their death. The treatise makes use of the [[monochord]] to explain [[interval (music)|interval]] relations. The treatise also discusses singing technique, [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]] of plainchant, and [[polyphony]] in the style of [[organum]]. 

The [[scale (music)|scale]] used in the work, which is based on a system of [[tetrachord]]s,  appears to have been created solely for use in the work itself rather than taken from actual musical practice.&lt;ref name=hoppin/&gt; The treatise also uses a very rare system of notation, known as [[Daseian]] notation. This notation has a number of figures which are rotated ninety degrees to represent different pitches.

A critical edition of the treatises was published in 1981, and an English translation by Raymond Erickson in 1995.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Tennis enjoys a considerable following in India, although it is limited to urban areas but still it is counted among the most popular sports in India.&lt;ref name="The encyclopaedia of tennis"&gt;{{cite book | title=The encyclopedia of tennis | author=Robertson, Max | authorlink=India | year=1974 | publisher=[[Allen and Unwin]] | location=London | pages=392 | isbn=0-04-796042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has produced a number of tennis players, who have achieved international recognition and have made their presence in some of the top [[List of tennis tournaments|tennis tournament]]s and [[Grand Slam (Tennis)|grand slam]]s.&lt;ref name="iloveindia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iloveindia.com/sports/tennis/ | title=Tennis in India | accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[All India Tennis Association]] (AITA) established in 1920, is the governing body of '''tennis in India''' and is a member of the [[Asian Tennis Federation]].&lt;ref name="asiantennis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asiantennis.com/about_atf/nat_associations.htm | title=National Associations and their Offices | accessdate=24 March 2011 | publisher=[[Asian Tennis Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India Davis Cup team]] is the most successful team of Asia in [[Davis Cup]], who has finished as runners-up 3 times.&lt;ref name="daviscup"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/history/champions.aspx | title=Champions | accessdate=24 March 2011 | publisher=[[Davis Cup]] (official website)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tennis has been a popular sport in India since around the 1880s when the British Army and Civilian Officers brought the game to India. Soon after regular tournaments like the 'Punjab Lawn tennis Championship' at [[Lahore]] (Now in [[Pakistan]]) (1885); 'Bengal Lawn Tennis Championship' at [[Calcutta]] (now [[Kolkata]]) (1887) and the 'All India Tennis Championships' at [[Allahabad]] (1910) were organised. In the history of major tournaments, India has already beaten among others [[France Davis Cup team|France]], [[Romania Davis Cup team|Romania]], [[Netherlands Davis Cup team|Holland]], [[Belgium Davis Cup team|Belgium]], [[Spain Davis Cup team|Spain]] and [[Greece Davis Cup team|Greece]] in Davis Cup ties (1921 to 1929).&lt;ref name="aitatennis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aitatennis.com/New%20AITA/about.html | title=AITA History | accessdate=24 March 2011 | publisher=[[All India Tennis Association]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122071350/http://www.aitatennis.com/New%20AITA/about.html | archivedate=22 November 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Art of Lawn Tennis"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Art of Lawn Tennis |author1=Tilden, William Tatem  |author2=Fletcher, John  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] | location=U.S. | pages=128 | isbn=1-4191-5265-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of tennis in India goes back a long way. In the 1880s, the Britishers introduced the game of tennis in India during the colonial rule and soon it started gaining momentum. BK Nehru in 1905 and Sardar Nihal Singh in 1908 were later joined by M Saleem, Fayzee brothers and Jagat Mohan Lal who made it to last 16 stages at the Wimbledon. Ghaus Mohammad was the first Indian to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1939 where he lost to American champion Bobby Riggs.

According to the All India Tennis Association, in Davis Cup ties between 1921 and 1929, India beat, among others, France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece. Top Indian players like Saleem, Fayzee brothers, Cotah Ramaswamy and Krishna Prasad beat a large number of ranked European players and teams to bring glory to the nation.

In the 1960s, the sport witnessed a golden era. Ramanathan Krishnan earned his highest seeding – No. 4 in Wimbledon in 1962. In the Davis Cup, India repeatedly became the Zonal Champions. Ramanathan Krishnan, along with Premjit Lal, SP Misra, Jaidip and RK Khanna as the non-playing captain, steered India to the Cup finals in 1966. They lost the Cup but not before Krishnan and J Mukerjea beat New Combe and Tony Roche, the Wimbledon champions, (1965) in doubles.

In the 1970s, [[Vijay Amritraj]] burst onto the scene. With teammates [[Sashi Menon]], [[Jasjit Singh (tennis)|Jasjit Singh]] and brother [[Anand Amritraj]], Vijay took India to World Cup Finals for the second time in 1974. Vijay also made it to the quarterfinals of US Open in 1973 and 1981; and Wimbledon in 1973 and 1974. Ramesh Krishnan, the son of Ramanathan Krishnan, won the junior Wimbledon championship and junior French Open title in 1979 and was ranked number 1 junior in the world. He made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (1986) as US Open (twice).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibnlive.com/news/sports/leander-paes-and-sania-mirza-have-enriched-indian-tennis-1096134.html&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Somdev Devvarman]] and [[Yuki Bhambri]] have been carrying the Indian flag in Men's singles category. There are also a few other players who have been representing the country in the Men's single category such as [[Prajnesh Gunneswaran]], [[Saketh Myneni]], and [[Sumit Nagal]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/singles?rankDate=2018-11-19&amp;rankRange=1-5000&amp;countryCode=IND.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand Slam Finals==
In 1997, India won their first Grand Slam title at the French open, in the Mixed Doubles. Since then Indians have won Grand Slam titles in the Mixed Doubles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles besides Girls' Doubles events. No Indian has so far won a Grand Slam Singles title in the Men's or Women's category.

In this film, adventurer Rick O'Connell travels to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, with an archaeologist and her brother. There they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a high priest from the reign of the pharaoh Seti I who has been cursed for eternity.

Filming began in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the [[Sahara]]. The visual effects were provided by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], who blended film and [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the titular mummy. [[Jerry Goldsmith]] provided the orchestral score.

''The Mummy'' opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43&amp;nbsp;million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; a [[sleeper hit|surprise hit]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqF7fw6-6ko Youtube - 10 Surprisingly Profitable Movie Franchises&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420203917/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqF7fw6-6ko |date=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'', as well as [[The Mummy (TV series)|an animated series]], and the [[prequel]]/[[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. Seven years later, the third installment, ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'', opened on August 1, 2008. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] also opened a [[roller coaster]], ''[[Revenge of the Mummy]]'', in 2004. [[Novelization]]s of the film and its sequels were written by [[Max Allan Collins]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- A plot summary serves as an overview of the film's event. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more info. The word count of a plot summary is usually 400-700 words. --&gt;
In [[Thebes, Egypt]], 1290 BC, high priest [[Imhotep (character)|Imhotep]] has a love affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti I]]. When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to [[Hamunaptra]], the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the [[Medjay|Medjai]]. Imhotep's priests are all [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|mummified]] alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh-eating [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetles]]. Imhotep is sealed away in a [[sarcophagus]] at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god [[Anubis]] and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return.

In 1926, [[List of The Mummy characters#Jonathan Carnahan|Jonathan Carnahan]] presents his sister, [[List of The Mummy characters#Evelyn "Evie" Carnahan O'Connell|Evelyn]], a Cairo librarian and aspiring [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], with an intricate box and map, which leads to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from an American adventurer, Rick O'Connell, who discovered the city three years earlier while in the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison.

Rick leads Evelyn and her party to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick's cowardly colleague [[List of The Mummy characters#Beni Gabor|Beni Gabor]]. The expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Against Ardeth's advice to leave the city, the two expeditions continue to excavate. Evelyn searches for the famous Book of the Living, a book made of pure gold. Instead of finding the book, she, Rick, and Jonathan stumble upon the statue of Anubis and the remains of Imhotep buried underneath. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover the black [[Book of the Dead]], accompanied by [[canopic jar]]s carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs.

At night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the members of the American expedition one by one, and brings the [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.

Imhotep, Evelyn, and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth. Imhotep prepares to sacrifice Evelyn, but she is rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests. When Evelyn reads from the Book of Amun-Ra, Imhotep becomes mortal again, and Rick forces him into the River of Death. Imhotep leaves the world of the living, but not before vowing revenge by saying "Death is only the beginning.". While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. Ardeth rides away as Rick and Evelyn kiss and, with Jonathan, ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.

* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Rick O'Connell: An adventurer who served in the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Producer James Jacks offered the role of Rick O'Connell to [[Tom Cruise]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Matt Damon]] and [[Ben Affleck]] but the actors were not interested or could not fit the role into their respective schedules.&lt;ref name= "Hobson"/&gt; Jacks and Director Stephen Sommers were impressed with the money that ''[[George of the Jungle (film)|George of the Jungle]]'' was making at the box office and cast Brendan Fraser as a result;&lt;ref name= "Hobson"/&gt; Sommers also commented that he felt Fraser fit the [[Errol Flynn]] swashbuckling character he had envisioned perfectly.&lt;ref name="show me 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273360_2,00.html|title=Show Me The Mummy (page 2)|author=Staff|date=1999-05-14|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor understood that his character "doesn't take himself too seriously, otherwise the audience can't go on that journey with him".&lt;ref name= "Braund"&gt;{{cite news| last = Braund| first = Simon| title = Equally Cursed and Blessed| publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]| date = July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Evelyn Carnahan: A clumsy yet intelligent Egyptologist. Evelyn undertakes the expedition to Hamunaptra to discover an ancient book, proving herself to her peers. Rachel Weisz was not a big fan of horror films but did not see this film as such. As she said in an interview, "It's hokum, a comic book world."&lt;ref name= "Jones, Alison"&gt;{{cite news| last = Jones| first = Alison| title = Great Excavations| publisher = The Birmingham Post| date = June 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as Jonathan Carnahan: Evelyn's bumbling older brother, whose primary goal is to get rich; he signs on for the trip to Hamunaptra after learning from Evelyn that the city is supposed to be where the ancient pharaohs hid "the wealth of Egypt." Jonathan is also a thief; he steals the key needed to open the Book of Amun-Ra from Rick in prison, and manages to pickpocket the same key from Imhotep during the film's climactic battle.
* [[Arnold Vosloo]] as [[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]]: One of Pharaoh Seti I's most trusted advisers, Imhotep betrays his sovereign out of love for Anck-Su-Namun. He is cursed and slowly killed for his treachery, but is resurrected 3,000 years later to continue his plans. South African stage actor Vosloo understood the approach that Sommers was going for in his screenplay, but only agreed to take on the role of Imhotep "if I could do it absolutely straight. From Imhotep's point of view, this is a skewed version of '[[Romeo and Juliet]]'."&lt;ref name= "Hobson"/&gt;
* [[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]] as Beni Gabor: A former soldier in the Foreign Legion, like Rick. Beni is obsessed with wealth, but also extremely cowardly; he betrays his employers when faced with Imhotep's wrath, who takes him in as his servant when he prays to God in [[Hebrew]], the language of [[Jew|those who were enslaved]] in his time.
* [[Oded Fehr]] as Ardeth Bay: A member of the Medjai, an ancient order dedicated to protecting the resting place of Imhotep. When the mummy is awakened, he and his warriors pledge to destroy the creature.
* [[Stephen Dunham]], [[Corey Johnson]], and [[Tuc Watkins]] as Henderson, Daniels, and Burns: Americans who travel to Hamunaptra in a treasure-hunting expedition. Opening a cursed box, they steal priceless canopic jars. They are all eventually killed by Imhotep, who fully regenerates by sucking the life out of each of them.
* [[Jonathan Hyde]] as Dr. Allen Chamberlain: An Egyptologist who leads a rival expedition to Hamunaptra, led by Beni. While Chamberlain tries to open the Book of the Dead, he knows not to read from it, and turns to the Medjai when Imhotep is brought to life. Since he opened the box that contained the Book of the Dead, he is cursed and eventually killed.
* [[Omid Djalili]] as Gad Hassan: A man from Cairo who went along with Rick, Evelyn, and Johnathan to Hamunaptra in order to find riches. When he wandered off in Hamunaptra he found Scarab beetle shells on the wall and mistakes them for blue gold. While plucking them from the wall, one drops and the scarab crawls out of the shell and crawls under Hassan's skin and eats him very slowly, leading to his death.
* [[Erick Avari]] as Dr. Terrence Bay: Evelyn's superior who works at a museum in Cairo. Bay deliberately tries to stop Evelyn and her brother from learning the location of Hamunaptra, knowing what evil lurks beneath the desert.
* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Winston Havelock: A retired [[Royal Air Force]] pilot from World War I living at the fort Rick and the others hide at.  He later helps Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth get to Hamunaptra, but is killed by the sandstorm Imhotep creates.
* [[Patricia Velásquez]] as [[Anck-Su-Namun]]: The mistress of Seti I; no other man is allowed to touch her. When Seti's body guards learn of her affair with Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun commits suicide rather than be caught for Seti's murder.
* [[Aharon Ipalé]] as [[Seti I|Pharaoh Seti I]]: The Pharaoh that was going to marry Anck-Su-Namun. But he was murdered by her and Imhotep so that she could marry Imhotep instead.

==Production==

===Origins===
In 1992, producers James Jacks and Sean Daniel decided to update the original ''Mummy'' film for the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Cinescape"&gt;{{cite news|title=''The Mummy'' That Wasn't|publisher=Cinescape|date=May 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] gave them the go-ahead, but only if they kept the budget around $10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hobson|first=Louis B|title=Universal rolls out new, improved ''Mummy''|publisher=[[Calgary Sun]]|date=May 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks remembers that the studio "essentially wanted a low-budget horror franchise";&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; in response, Jacks and Daniel recruited horror filmmaker/writer [[Clive Barker]] on board to direct. Barker's vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies.&lt;ref name="Cinescape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slotek"&gt;{{cite news|last=Slotek|first=Jim|title=Unwrapping ''The Mummy''| publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=May 2, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks recalls that Barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism",&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie".&lt;ref name="Slotek"/&gt; After several meetings, Barker and Universal lost interest and parted company.

Director [[Joe Dante]] was the next choice, increasing the budget for his idea of [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as a brooding Mummy.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; This version's draft was written by [[Alan Ormsby]], and was later re-written by [[John Sayles]]. It was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story.&lt;ref name="Slotek"/&gt; It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, making it to the final product.&lt;ref name="Cinescape"/&gt; However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15&amp;nbsp;million and rejected Dante's version.

Filmmaker [[George A. Romero]] was brought in with a vision of a zombie-style horror film similar to ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', but which also relied heavily upon elements of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of [[Ramesses II]].&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens as a result of his preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance, recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in [[Nineteenth Dynasty]] Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

[[Mick Garris]] was attached to direct but eventually left the project,&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Donald|title=What Have They Unearthed?|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wes Craven]] was offered the film but turned it down.&lt;ref name="Slotek"/&gt; Stephen Sommers called Jacks and Daniel in 1997 with his vision of ''The Mummy'' "as a kind of [[Indiana Jones]] or ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time".&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight, and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale.&lt;ref name="Snead"&gt;{{cite news|last=Snead|first=Elizabeth|title=Updating A Well-Preserved Villain|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=May 7, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had wanted to make a ''Mummy'' film since 1993, but other writers or directors were always attached. Finally, Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his idea to Universal with an 18-page treatment.&lt;ref name="Cinescape"/&gt; At the time, Universal's management had changed in response to the box office failure of ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'', and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Liane |last=Bonin |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84361,00.html |title=That's a Wrap |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=1999-05-07 |accessdate=2008-04-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220235235/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C84361%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $15&amp;nbsp;million to $80&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Argent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Argent|first=Daniel|title=Unwrapping ''The Mummy'': An Interview with Stephen Sommers|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
Filming began in [[Marrakech, Morocco]] on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17&amp;nbsp;weeks. Photography moved to the [[Sahara desert]] outside the small town of [[Erfoud]], and to the United Kingdom before completion of shooting on August 29, 1998.&lt;ref name="behind"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Scenes |work=The Mummy Official Site |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1999 |url=http://www.mummyvideo.com/bhs/ |accessdate=2007-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602130721/http://www.mummyvideo.com/bhs/ |archivedate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions.&lt;ref name="Portman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Portman|first=Jamie|title=''Mummy'' Unearths Horror, Humour|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=May 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours.&lt;ref name="Braund"/&gt; Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.&lt;ref name="Portman"/&gt;

Brendan Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged. Weisz remembered, "He [Fraser] stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated."&lt;ref name="Jones, Alison"/&gt; The production had the official support of the Moroccan army, and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them,&lt;ref name="Slotek"/&gt; a fact Sommers disclosed to the cast only after shooting had finished.&lt;ref name="show me 3" /&gt;

Production designer Allan Cameron found a dormant volcano near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the location because, "A city hidden in the crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out in the middle of the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano."&lt;ref name="behind"/&gt; A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at [[Shepperton Studios]], where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes.&lt;ref name="behind"/&gt; Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] which doubled for the [[Giza]] Port on the [[River Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office |url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1999/10/the-mummy-1999/ |title=Kent Film Office The Mummy Film Focus |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014183250/http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1999/10/the-mummy-1999/ |archivedate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set was {{convert|600|ft|m|0}} in length and featured "a steam train, an Ajax [[traction engine]], three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".&lt;ref name="behind"/&gt;

===Special effects===
The filmmakers reportedly spent $15&amp;nbsp;million of the $80&amp;nbsp;million budget on special effects, provided by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]];&lt;ref name="modern mummy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slotek2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Slotek|first=Jim|title=''Mummy'' Unwraps a New Fraser "Cartoon" Character|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=1999-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the producers wanted a new look for the Mummy so that they would avoid comparisons to past movies.&lt;ref name="modern mummy"/&gt; John Andrew Berton, Jr., Industrial Light &amp; Magic's Visual Effects Supervisor on ''The Mummy'', started developing the look three months before filming started. He said that he wanted the Mummy "to be mean, tough, nasty, something that had never been seen by audiences before". Berton used [[motion capture]] in order to achieve "a menacing and very realistic Mummy".&lt;ref name="behind"/&gt; Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could see exactly how he moved and replicate it.&lt;ref name="modern mummy"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Estelle|last=Shay|title=Thoroughly modern Mummy|journal=[[Cinefex]]|date=April 1999|issue=77|pages=71–76|quote=On the special effects used in the film, and on the company who made them, Industrial Light &amp; Magic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics. He matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can see right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do."&lt;ref name="behind"/&gt; Vosloo described the filming as a "whole new thing" for him; "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree."&lt;ref name="show me 3"/&gt; Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.&lt;ref name="Portman"/&gt;

'''''The Mummy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], with orchestrations provided by [[Alexander Courage]].&lt;ref name=amg/&gt; The soundtrack was released by [[Decca Records]] on May 4, 1999. Like many Goldsmith scores, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements;&lt;ref name="score reviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scorereviews.com/reviews/review.aspx?id=219|title=The Mummy (Jerry Goldsmith) Soundtrack Review|work=ScoreReviews.com|accessdate=2008-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215095846/http://www.scorereviews.com/reviews/review.aspx?id=219 |archivedate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith also used sparing amounts of vocals, highly unusual for most of his work.&lt;ref name="score reviews"/&gt;

Overall, Goldsmith's score was well received. [[AllMusic]] described it as a "grand, melodramatic score" which delivered the expected highlights.&lt;ref name=amg&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r414518|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic: The Mummy (1999 Original Score)|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews positively noted the dark, percussive sound meshed well with the plot, as well as the raw power of the music. The limited but masterful use of the chorus was also lauded, and most critics found the final track on the CD to be the best overall.&lt;ref name="score reviews"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TrackSounds&gt;{{cite web|author=Coleman, Christopher |year=2000 |url=http://www.tracksounds.com/reviews/themummy.htm |title=The Mummy by Jerry Goldsmith |work=TrackSounds.com |accessdate=2008-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522130814/http://www.tracksounds.com/reviews/themummy.htm |archivedate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some critics found the score lacked cohesion,&lt;ref name="filmtracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/mummy.html |title=The Mummy: Editorial Review |work=FilmTracks.com |accessdate=2008-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228211642/http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/mummy.html |archivedate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the constant heavy action lent itself to annoying repetition.&lt;ref name="score reviews"/&gt; Roderick Scott off CineMusic.net summed up the score as "representative of both Goldsmith's absolute best and his most mediocre.

[[Stephen Holden]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "This version of ''The Mummy'' has no pretenses to be anything other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think ''Night of the Living Dead'' stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' grafted onto a [[Bing Crosby]]-[[Bob Hope]] road picture (''The Road to Hamunaptra''?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Sarcophagus, Be Gone: Night of the Living Undead|work=The New York Times|date=May 7, 1999|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0D7103CF934A35756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=The+Mummy&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications like ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' came to the conclusion that despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion;&lt;ref name=observer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Savlov, Mark |title=The Mummy |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=1999-05-07 |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A142860 |accessdate=2008-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221002833/http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A142860 |archivedate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; talking about the special effects, the ''Observer'' lamented "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy."&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite news|author=Hinson, Hal |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999-05-13/film/mummy-dearest/ |title=Mummy dearest |work=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=1999-05-07 |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220062347/http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999-05-13/film/mummy-dearest/ |archivedate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications such as ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'' felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to ''The Mummy''; "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the ''Jump Cut'', "is standard-issue I.L.&amp;M.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ernest |last=Larsen |title=The Mummy: traffic in mummies |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |url=http://ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/Mummy.html |date=July 2000 |issue=43 |pages=12–15, 128 |accessdate=2008-04-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218211522/http://ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/Mummy.html |archivedate=2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Newman of the [[British Film Institute]] judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic.&lt;ref name="bfi" /&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was "not free of stereotypes",&lt;ref name="usa today" /&gt; a sentiment with which the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] concurred.&lt;ref name="bfi"&gt;{{cite web|author=Newman, Kim |date=1999-06-01 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/152 |title=Sight and Sound: The Mummy |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410113311/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/152 |archivedate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene.

'''''The Nanny''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] which originally aired on [[CBS]] from 1993 to 1999, starring [[Fran Drescher]] as [[Fran Fine]], a Jewish fashion queen from [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing, New York]] who becomes the nanny of three children from the New York/British high society.

The show was created and produced by [[Fran Drescher|Drescher]] and her husband [[Peter Marc Jacobson]], taking much of its inspiration from Drescher's personal life growing up in Queens, involving names and characteristics based on her relatives and friends. The show earned a [[Rose d'Or]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose d'Or: winners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/02/broadcasting|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=May 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one [[Emmy Award]], out of a total of twelve nominations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nanny|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/nanny|publisher=Emmy Awards|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Drescher was twice nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] and an Emmy. The sitcom has also spawned several [[The Nanny (TV series)#Foreign adaptations|foreign adaptations]], loosely inspired by the original scripts.

==Plot==
[[American Jews|Jewish-American]] Fran Fine turns up on the doorstep of British Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) to sell cosmetics after having been both dumped and fired by her boyfriend and employer Danny Imperialli. Instead, she finds herself the nanny of Maxwell's three children: Maggie, Brighton, and Grace.  Maxwell Sheffield is unhappy about it at first, but Fran turns out to be just what he and his family needed.

While Fran Fine manages the children, butler Niles ([[Daniel Davis]]) manages the household and watches all the events that unfold with Fran as the new nanny. Niles, recognizing Fran's gift for bringing warmth back to the family, does his best to undermine Maxwell's business partner C.C. Babcock ([[Lauren Lane]]) who has her eyes on the very available Maxwell Sheffield. Niles is often seen making witty comments directed towards C.C with C.C often replying with a comment of her own in their ongoing game of [[one-upmanship]].

As the series progresses, it becomes increasingly obvious that Maxwell is smitten with Fran even though he won't admit it, and Fran is smitten with him. The show teases the viewers with their closeness and "near misses" as well as with an engagement. Towards the later seasons, they finally marry and expand their family by having [[Fraternal Twins|fraternal twins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenanny.com/nannystory.html|title=The Nanny Home Page: Background Story &amp; FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the series, it's also clear that Niles and C.C.'s constant sharp barbs are their bizarre form of flirtation, after a few false starts (including multiple impulsive and failed proposals from Niles) the pair marry in the series finale.

Fran, as a result of her mother's overbearing personality, often feels the need to date and is compelled to get married as well. She is usually seen getting into trouble and having to solve those problems through using her street smarts. 

'''Maxwell Sheffield''' is the male protagonist who ends up hiring Fran Fine to watch over his three children, Maggie, Brighton, and Grace. He is a widowed Broadway producer, having lost his wife Sara four years before the start of the series. While he does have some success as a Broadway producer, he remains constantly in the shadow of his rival [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], who always seems to have the upper hand. He does not spend a lot of time with his children due to his busy schedule, hence he ends up hiring Fran Fine as the children's nanny. Despite his mutual attraction to Fran, he tries to keep their relationship professional for fear of commitment.

'''Margaret Sheffield''' is the eldest child of Maxwell Sheffield. She is constantly seen bickering with her brother, Brighton, who views her as a nerd. While she is constantly fighting with Brighton, her relationship with her sister, Grace, is more one of mentorship. Towards the beginning of the series, Maggie is shy and awkward but, with Fran's influence, she becomes a somewhat popular young woman. Upon meeting Fran Fine, the two bond almost instantly.

'''Brighton Sheffield''' is the middle child of the family and the only son of Maxwell Sheffield. Due to being the only son, he often feels left out. This causes him to purposely bring about trouble for his two sisters. He doesn't bond with Fran Fine at first, having disliked all his previous nannies, but eventually becomes close with her as well. He plans to become a Broadway producer, like his father.

'''Grace Sheffield''' is the youngest child in the Sheffield family. She has a habit of naming medical conditions and complicated words. When Fran first became her nanny, Grace was in therapy. But, under Fran Fine's influence and guidance, she eventually doesn't need therapy any more. As the two became close to one another Grace started picking up some of Fran's Jewish slang and dressing habits, eventually thinking of Fran as a mother to her.

'''C.C. Babcock''' is the egocentric business partner of Maxwell Sheffield, with whom she has been working for almost 20 years. She clearly wants him as more than a business partner. Maxwell, however, appears oblivious and Babcock has yet to make a serious move on him. She never seems to be able to remember the names of Maxwell's three children. From her first meeting with Fran Fine, she accurately views the newly hired nanny as a threat and tries to undermine her. Fran is not C.C.'s only enemy in the Sheffield house, as she has an even more contentious relationship with his longtime butler Niles (who hates her just as much as she hates him).

'''Niles''' is the loyal butler and chauffeur for the Sheffield family. He and Maxwell have known each other their whole lives. He bonds with Fran Fine immediately, viewing her as the breath of fresh air that the Sheffield family needs. Niles is known as the household snoop as he is constantly seen listening in on conversations via intercoms, keyholes, and even in the very rooms where the conversations are taking place. He tends to manipulate events in Fran's favor to undermine C.C., his nemesis.  In spite of this, over time it becomes clear that Niles has himself fallen for C.C. and their contentious relationship is a cover for mutual lust.

===Main cast===
{{Main|List of The Nanny characters}}

''The Nanny'' maintained an [[ensemble cast]], keeping the same set of characters for its entire six-season run. Renée Taylor, Ann Morgan Guilbert, and Rachel Chagall were only given starring credit for their roles in the final season, even though they appeared in most episodes of the series, particularly in seasons where the role of the Sheffield children was somewhat reduced.

===Guest stars===
Although largely operating around the main ensemble cast, ''The Nanny'' featured an enormous number of guest stars over the years. Notable repeat guests included [[Lainie Kazan]] as Fran's paternal aunt Freida Fine,&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for "The Nanny" (1993)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106080/fullcredits#cast|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Lawrence]] as Fran's never before seen father Morty Fine,&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt; [[Pamela Anderson]] as Fran's nemesis Heather Biblow,&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt; [[Ray Charles]] as Yetta's fiancé Sammy,&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt; [[Spalding Gray]] as Dr. Jack Miller,&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt; [[Fred Stoller]] for the frequently featured pharmacist Fred,&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt; and [[Andrew Levitas]] as Maggie's boyfriend Michael.&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt;

Some celebrities guested as characters in single episodes, such as [[John Astin]], [[Roseanne Barr|Roseanne]] as Fran's cousin Sheila, [[Joan Collins]] as Maxwell's stepmother, [[Robert Vaughn]] as Maxwell's father, and [[Dina Merrill]] as his mother. Others appeared as themselves, primarily in connection with Maxwell's business relations, such as [[Bob Barker]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Robert Culp]], [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]], [[Erik Estrada]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Joe Lando]], [[Richard Kline]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Eydie Gormé]], [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Elton John]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Lamb Chop (puppet)|Lamb Chop]] and [[Shari Lewis]], [[Andrew Dice Clay]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Hugh Grant]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Jeanne Cooper]], [[Melody Thomas Scott]], [[Eric Braeden]], [[Shemar Moore]], [[Joshua Morrow]], [[Hunter Tylo]]; media personalities [[Roger Clinton, Jr.|Roger Clinton]], [[Alicia Machado]], [[Rita Moreno]] (who would later play Fran's mother, Dori, on her later series, ''[[Happily Divorced]]''), [[Jay Leno]], [[David Letterman]], [[Sally Jessy Raphael]] and [[Donald Trump]]; and musicians [[Ray Charles]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Brian Setzer]], [[Celine Dion]], Rapper [[Coolio]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Steve Lawrence]], and [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. [[Jonathan Penner]] appeared as Fran's former fiancé, Danny Imperialli. [[James Marsden]] appeared as Maggie's boyfriend, Eddie, and [[Telma Hopkins]] appeared as Fran's "mother" in the episode "Fran's Roots". [[Scott Baio]] made an appearance as a rookie doctor who was Fran's former schoolmate. [[Jon Stewart]] portrayed a Jewish love interest of Fran's until it was discovered at a family wedding that the two were cousins; on the June 29, 2011 airing of ''The Daily Show'', Stewart stated he agreed to make an appearance after receiving a personal call from Fran Drescher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tom Hanks |series=The Daily Show |date=June 29, 2011 |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-june-29-2011/tom-hanks?xrs=share_copy |network=Comedy Central |last=Stewart |first=Jon (host)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marvin Hamlisch]] appeared as Fran's former high school music teacher, a Marvin Hamlisch look-alike. Fran Drescher also reprised her role of Bobbi Fleckman from the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and made a [[cameo appearance]] as herself in the third to last episode. Charles Shaughnessy had a double role as a foreign sultan in one episode. Drescher's real-life parents, Morty and Sylvia, initially appeared as a couple in the waiting room of Grace's therapist and made subsequent appearances as Fran's Uncle Stanley and Aunt Rose; her [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] [[Chester Drescher|Chester]] appeared as C.C.'s pet in more than a dozen episodes. Renée Taylor's husband, actor [[Joseph Bologna]], and their son Gabriel Bologna, had minor roles as doctors on the show. [[Ray Romano]] appeared as Fran's former high school classmate [[Ray Barone]], linking ''The Nanny'' with his comedy ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''. Romano and Drescher actually did know each other in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|last2=Tomashoff|first2=Craig|title=Home Truths|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20142516,00.html|accessdate=December 29, 2014|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 14, 1996|quote=While a student at Hillcrest High (where The Nanny's Fran Drescher was a classmate), he performed in a comedy troupe at church.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528005204/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20142516,00.html|archivedate=May 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Bergeron]] appeared as himself, the host of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', in an episode in which Maxwell appeared as a star on the show's board as a replacement for [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. [[Tyne Daly]] appeared as a fellow nanny facing forced retirement. [[David Letterman]] made an uncredited appearance during a fantasy sequence, where Fran describes how she exaggerated her fame to impress a pen pal.

==Theme song==
The theme song featured in the pilot was a version of "[[If My Friends Could See Me Now]]", performed by [[Gwen Verdon]] from the 1966 Broadway musical ''[[Sweet Charity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Nanny Intro from the Pilot episode|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvhjX7AUIwk|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the pilot, the theme changed to "The Nanny Named Fran", written by [[Ann Hampton Callaway]] and performed by her and her sister [[Liz Callaway]].&lt;ref name="Communications2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Los Angeles Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=August 2, 2013|date=February 2001|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=138|issn=1522-9149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits: one that is a direct instrumental version of the theme (used only in a few season one episodes), and another with a slightly different arrangement.

==Opening credits==
The opening sequence for the pilot featured Fran in front of a white background, getting herself made up going to work as the nanny; at the end of the sequence, it shows Fran heading toward a stroller and a lipstick print appears to the above right.

Along with the change of the theme song from "If My Friends Could See Me Now" to "The Nanny Named Fran" came the change of the opening sequence, which like the theme, describes (with the main characters in animated form) the story of how Fran Fine went from being fired from the bridal shop by Danny Imperiali to becoming the nanny of the Sheffield children. The opening sequence remained the same even though Renée Taylor, Ann Guilbert and Rachel Chagall began to be credited as "starring" in the in-show credits beginning in season five. The only change to the sequence was in season six when producer Kathy Landsberg was promoted to co-executive producer of the series as her producer credit was moved to the in-show credits, while the creator credits of Drescher and Jacobson, and the developer credits of Sternin and Fraser were added in its place.

The animated opening sequence begins with Fran Fine walking into the bridal shop, only to be kicked out by Danny Imperalli. Then, she hitches a ride in a cab, crosses the bridge from [[Queens]], New York to [[Manhattan]] and arrives at the Sheffield mansion. Maxwell Sheffield opens the door and observes Fran. Then, he pulls her inside and she falls into the flower pot. Niles dusts her off and puts a cap on her head that reads ''Nanny''. Fran whistles for Maggie, Brighton and Gracie and the four of them form a [[conga line]]. C. C. arrives at the door and Fran bumps the door with her hip to close it in her face. Finally, the Sheffields, Niles and Fran gather on the couch for a group picture similar to that of the ''[[One Day at a Time]]'' series opening. However, when Fran presses the camera's button, smoke emits from the camera, covering the entire group in dust and messing up their best clothes.

Rosie O'Donnell employed the same team that created the Nanny's opening credits to do the opening credits for her popular daytime talk show.
O'Donnell mentioned this in an interview with Drescher on that show.

==Closing Credits==
In the background is the picture of the family as if the camera incident never happened.

==Production==

===Development===
''The Nanny'' began in 1991 with a chance meeting on a transatlantic flight between Drescher and Jeff Sagansky, at the time president of [[CBS Corporation]], for whom she had starred in the short-lived TV series ''[[Princesses (TV series)|Princesses]]''. Drescher persuaded Sagansky to let her and her then-husband Jacobson pitch an idea for a sitcom to CBS. Sagansky agreed to a future meeting once all of the parties were back in Los Angeles; however, neither Drescher nor Jacobson had any idea what to pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil|last=Rosenthal|title=''The Nanny'' Finds A Home With Viewers|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=Chicago Tribune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-28/features/9410280002_1_nanny-fran-drescher-liz-smith|accessdate=June 6, 2011| date=October 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, while in London, Drescher was visiting friend [[Twiggy|Twiggy Lawson]] and her family in London, England, where she went on a culture-clash shopping tour with Lawson's then teenage daughter. Drescher was inspired by her behavior towards the teenage daughter on the shopping trip as functioning in a less parental but "humorous [...] kind of Queens logic, self-serving advice" mode.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"&gt;{{cite web | title=Enter Winning | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | url=http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrenterwinning.htm | accessdate=June 16, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823140259/http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrenterwinning.htm | archivedate=August 23, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drescher immediately called her husband in Los Angeles with her sitcom idea, which she pitched as a spin on ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', except, in Drescher's words: "Instead of [[Julie Andrews]], '''I''' come to the door." Jacobson replied: "That could be it" and the idea for ''The Nanny'' was spawned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drescher|first=Fran|authorlink=Fran Drescher|title=Enter Whining|year=1996|publisher=[[Regan Books]]|isbn=978-0-06-039155-3|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Los Angeles, the pair pitched their idea to Tim Flack and Joe Voci, both in comedy development at CBS.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; Sagansky brought in experienced producers Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser,&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; another husband-and-wife team with whom Drescher had worked before while guesting on ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'' in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse David|title=Comedy Undercard: Who's the Boss? vs. The Nanny|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/the-nanny-vs-whos-the-boss-sitcom-smackdown.html|accessdate=January 13, 2016|work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested, both couples teamed up to write the script for the pilot together, creating a character with the intention to build off Drescher's image. "Our business strategy was to create a show that was going to complement our writing, complement me as a talent," Drescher said in a 1997 interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; As a result, the characters draw deeply on the Drescher family, including [[Fran Fine]]'s parents, Sylvia and Morty, and grandmother Yetta, who all were named after their real-life counterparts.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; Drescher also drew from her own life in creating her character. Like the character in ''The Nanny'', Drescher was born and raised in [[Flushing, Queens]], and attended [[beauty school]]. However, unlike her on-screen counterpart, Drescher never worked in a bridal shop; Drescher wrote that into the character as a tribute to her mother, who did work in a bridal shop.&lt;ref name="Communications1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Belson|first=Eve|title=Orange Coast Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=October 1994|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=46|issn=0279-0483}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting with his relatives in [[Fort Lauderdale]] around the holidays, Sagansky watched a few episodes with his relatives, realized that he had a hit, and ordered a full 22 episodes for [[List of The Nanny episodes#Season 1 (1993/94)|the first season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Hal Boedeker |publication-date=March 2, 1994 |title=Nanny Loves South Florida, And So Does Fran Drescher |work= [[Miami Herald]] |page= |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_multi=MH&amp;p_product=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_site=miami&amp;s_trackval=MH&amp;s_search_type=keyword&amp;s_dispstring=NANNY%20LOVES%20SOUTH%20FLORIDA,%20AND%20SO%20DOES%20FRAN%20DRESCHER%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(NANNY%20LOVES%20SOUTH%20FLORIDA,%20AND%20SO%20DOES%20FRAN%20DRESCHER)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=_rank_:D&amp;xcal_ranksort=4&amp;xcal_useweights=yes|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew===
[[File:7 East 75th Street 001.JPG|thumb|7 East 75th Street on the [[Upper East Side]] of New York City was used for the exterior shots of the Sheffield townhouse.]]
Most of the early episodes of ''The Nanny'' were shot in front of a live studio audience on Stage 6 at the [[Culver Studios]]. During later seasons the taping was no longer performed before an audience due to the complexities of the [[fantasy]] sequences, costume changes, etc. On Mondays, the cast went through the script as a [[table read]]. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they rehearsed before the series' producers and executives. And, on Thursdays and Fridays, the series was shot using a multi-camera set up in front of a live studio audience.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=Denise|title=Nanny on the Spot|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrnannyonthespot.htm|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=May 21, 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703043754/http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrnannyonthespot.htm|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 100 crew members were involved in the shooting of a single episode.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=Denise|title=In A Family Way|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrinafamilyway.htm|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=May 21, 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703072610/http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrinafamilyway.htm|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Drescher, Fraser, Jacobson and Sternin, the show's only executive producers for the first four seasons, coordinated "pretty much everything" at the beginning,&lt;ref name="hw-reporter4"/&gt; according to Sternin, they eventually found their niche and in the following years, Drescher and Sternin decided to focus on writing story outlines along with Timothy Kavanagh of Montreal. Kavanagh, known mainly for his writing with Fraser, added a recognizable dry humor to the show. Jacobson presided over the writing team, and Fraser observed the run-throughs.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter4"/&gt; The four of them were later joined by Frank Lombardi, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk, who served as the series' executive producer throughout the fifth and sixth season respectively.&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt;

===Professional laughers===
Stemming from a [[home invasion]] and attack she experienced in 1985, [[Fran Drescher]] requested the show to provide [[prescreened]] [[studio audience|audiences]], based fear of having random strangers invited to the productions. The show hired [[Central Casting]] to gather a cast of "laughers" who would be recorded during taping. The audio track of the laughers would then be added to the episodes in post-production. [[Casting director]] Lisette St. Claire became the world’s first "laugher wrangler" for new type of service, which would continue to be used on other shows.&lt;ref name="Laughers"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joel Warner|author2=Peter McGraw|title=The Humor Code: Professional Laughers, Straight Out of Central Casting|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/01/humor-code-professional-laughers/|accessdate=30 May 2018|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Julie|title=Look Busy, Feign Interest and Be Paid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/06/jobs/look-busy-feign-interest-and-be-paid.html|accessdate=30 May 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humor==
The comedy in ''The Nanny'' was formulated with many [[running gag]]s, which contributed heavily to the success of the series. Much of this formula was character-based, with all major characters possessing a specific trait or quirks that provided a source of parody for other characters. The conflicting elements of each character's own comedy were often played off against one another ([[Fran Fine|Fran]] and [[Maxwell Sheffield|Maxwell]], [[Niles (The Nanny)|Niles]] and [[C.C. Babcock|C.C.]], [[Maggie Sheffield|Maggie]] and [[Brighton Sheffield|Brighton]]). Occasionally the characters would break the [[fourth wall]] and comment on the situations themselves, or Fran would comment to the audience or look into the camera. Other running gags are the many references to [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs and the musicals ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Most of the humor Fran uses is aimed toward a Jewish audience. She makes references to Yiddish words and teaches the Sheffield children to be stereotypical Jews (to never pay retail price, to go after men like doctors, etc.) Much of this humor is featured in scenes including her mother Sylvia.

At times, they would also make humorous references to the stars' previous careers or real life off-screen time. This was noticeable when Yetta saw her reflection in the mirror and thought she was seeing Millie Helper from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (the role that Guilbert played on that long-running show), Maxwell remembering how he wanted to hire a former cast member from ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' but thought he wasn't "British" enough (a reference to Charles Shaughnessy's former series), C.C. using props to hide Lauren Lane's real-life pregnancy at the time,&lt;ref name=peoplemagazine&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Nanny'': 1993–1999|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131614,00.html|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=June 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fran meeting her idol—Fran Drescher—who gave her a hint on what she (the TV Fran) was going to do in the next scene in the second-to-last episode in the last season. Drescher also appeared in the series as tough-talking music publicist Bobbi Fleckman, reprising her role from the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', setting up an obvious visual gag where Drescher (as the Nanny) would disguise herself as Fleckman in order to get Mr. Sheffield's attention.

More running gags include Fran's frequent references to classic TV sitcoms (such as ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' and ''[[Bewitched]]'') and her many eccentric family members (some never shown, most of them dying); Fran lying about her age—especially to men; Maxwell fighting through his rivalry with actual Broadway producer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]; Maxwell's physical resemblance to [[Pierce Brosnan]]; Maxwell's fondness of [[Kaye Ballard]]; Sylvia loving food in excess;&lt;ref name="peoplemagazine"/&gt; Niles delivering sharp one-liners, often aimed at C.C.; C.C. cold-heartedly reacting to situations that are usually sentimental to others (e.g. the death of [[Bambi]]'s mother); Gracie psychologically analyzing various situations; Niles getting fired because he embarrasses Maxwell or gives Fran ideas that Maxwell extremely dislikes (such as suggesting that Max, C.C. and Fran go to Barbra Streisand's house); Fran and Val lacking intelligence and obsessing over material possessions (e.g. clothes); frequent references to Fran's flamboyant wardrobe and her "big hair"; Fran frequently mentioning shopping at [[Loehmann's]];  Yetta making disconnected comments revealing her [[senility]]; Fran criticizing Maxwell's and Niles' reserved and inhibited British nature; Brighton morphing into a hopeless dork; Fran's attraction to Jewish males; Maxwell passing up the incredibly popular musical, ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', then becoming upset when such an idiotic idea became a success; Niles' last name never being revealed; C.C. covering her long-unrevealed name (finally given as Chastity Claire in the series finale); C.C. failing to remember the names of the Sheffield children (even convinced by [[Niles (The Nanny)|Niles]] in one episode that there was a fourth child named Sydney; note: she didn't have trouble remembering in the early seasons); Sylvia constantly nagging Fran to get married; Fran finding solace in food when she's depressed;  Fran's father, Morty, often featured in the series but never actually seen (until portrayed by [[Steve Lawrence]] in a few later episodes); Morty's only physical trait being the fact that he is bald, in which he is always comically losing his wig, and has several head mannequins to hold different wigs; Niles offering obvious hints to Maxwell and Fran about them realizing they should be together and hints from each other; C.C. pining over her unrequited romantic interest in Maxwell; C.C. developing a nervous [[tic]] and eventually ending up in a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]]; Fran obsessing with [[Barbra Streisand]]. There was also the occasional tryst between Niles and C.C., contrasting with their typical open disdain for each other, which was actually love. Season 4 featured a running gag where both Fran and Maxwell kept secret from the other household members "The Thing" (the fact that in the season 3 finale Maxwell tells Fran he loves her, but then in the Season 4 premiere he takes it back). It's also following "The Thing" that whenever Maxwell makes comments denying he has feelings for Fran, she is temporary "paralyzed" (she can't feel her arm, her entire left side shuts down, etc.).

In addition, there is also a great deal of [[physical comedy]] in ''The Nanny'' including exaggerated falls and chases. Drescher's facial expressions, when shocked or surprised, can also be seen as reminiscent of [[Lucille Ball]]'s portrayals of [[Lucy Ricardo]] and [[Lucy Carmichael]].&lt;ref name=EWReview&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Ken|title=The Nanny Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291309,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=February 9, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallels were suggested in a few episodes, where an exasperated Mr. Sheffield refers to Fran as "Mrs. Carmichael", and asks in another: "Mr. Mooney fire you from the bank again?" Another Lucy reference (in which the family travels to Hollywood) is when he alludes to Fran and "Ethel" stealing John Wayne's footprints, and again when Maxwell says "Miss Fine, you got' some 'splaining to do!" like Ricky Ricardo often said to Lucy Ricardo. The episode that featured a visit from Elizabeth Taylor (who also appeared on ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' as a guest star) began with Maxwell and Niles trying to hide the visit from Fran ("Boys, boys, boys. Now do you think my mother gave birth to a dummy 25 years ago?") followed by her gripe "You never introduce me to any of the stars that you know; I've got a good mind to take Little Ricky and... oh. Never mind." Also, there was a reference from the episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' called "Ricky has Labor Pains" where Lucy and Ethel dress up like men and go to Ricky's daddy shower. In an episode of ''The Nanny'', Fran sees a man watching ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' on TV and as the theme song plays she gets a sneaky look on her face and gets the idea to gain entry into Mr. Sheffield's men's only club dressed as a man. Viewers for [[Quality Television]] called ''The Nanny'' "the '90s version of ''[[I Love Lucy]]''. It was well written and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenannytv.com/about2.html The Nanny – Official Site – About the Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Reception===
The show performed poorly in its first year. When it was nearly canceled, Sagansky stepped in as its champion. According to Jacobson: "At all those affiliate meetings, he used to say, 'Stick by ''The Nanny''!' He knew it was something special."&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; The sitcom was the first new show delivered to CBS for the 1993 season and the highest-tested pilot at the network in years.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; The series was also hugely successful internationally, especially in Australia,&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; where it was one of the highest-rated programs during the mid-to-late 1990s.

Although soon emerging as a favorite among the company, sponsors questioned whether the writers had ventured too far in terms of ethnicity and Drescher acted too obviously Jewish.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; The actress, however, declined to change Fran Fine into an Italian American: "On TV, you have to work fast, and the most real, the most rooted in reality to me is Jewish. I wanted to do it closest to what I knew."&lt;ref name="jewishjournal"&gt;{{cite web | title=I'm a Survivor! | work=Jewish Journal | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8435 | accessdate=June 18, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708040707/http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8435 | archivedate=July 8, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the producers came to the conclusion that to oppose her should be a family of British origin, so "she wouldn't come across as Jewish so much as the American you were rooting for," Sternin explained. "The idea was to make her the American girl who happens to be Jewish rather than the Jewish girl working for the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]]s."&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt;

===Possible Reboot===
In June 2018 Dresher said, "We’re talking about it. Peter and I are talking about it," Drescher told ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', referencing her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, who co-created the series with her. "She would’ve maybe gotten involved in more things [that] Fran Drescher is involved with," the actress told ''Entertainment Tonight''. "All kinds of things from environmental issues, to health, to civil liberties, that’s what I think Fran [Fine] would be doing now — opening her big Queens mouth for the greater good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Augusta Statz |url=https://helenair.com/lifestyles/simplemost/fran-drescher-says-the-nanny-reboot-is-possible/article_b2904cfb-c312-5e9c-b315-d39a241e65b4.html |title=Fran Drescher Says ‘The Nanny’ Reboot Is Possible &amp;#124; Simplemost |publisher=helenair.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bacardi |first=Francesca |url=https://pagesix.com/2018/06/19/fran-drescher-teases-the-nanny-reboot/ |title=Fran Drescher teases 'The Nanny' reboot |publisher=Pagesix.com |date=2018-06-19 |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of foreign adaptations of The Nanny}}
''The Nanny'' was shown in more than eighty countries worldwide.  In addition, several local versions of the show have been produced in other countries.  These shows follow the original scripts very closely, but with minor alterations in order to adapt to their respective country's culture. The remake in Russia was so popular that some original American writers of the show were commissioned to write new scripts after all original episodes were remade.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | title=Still Married, With Children, But in Russian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/world/europe/10sitcom.html | accessdate=February 2, 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=September 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''WWE United Kingdom Championship''' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling championship#Location-specific championships|championship]] created and promoted by the American [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[WWE]] for their [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]]. It is the brand's top championship. The current champion is [[Pete Dunne (wrestler)|Pete Dunne]], who is in his first reign and is the longest reigning champion.

Unveiled on December 15, 2016, the title was first awarded to [[Tyler Bate]], who won the inaugural [[WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament]] on [[United Kingdom Championship Tournament (2017)|January 15, 2017]]. The brand's show, also titled ''[[NXT UK]]'', had its first tapings in August 2018, which began [[Broadcast delay|airing]] on October 17, 2018 on the [[WWE Network]]. From its inception up until the debut of ''NXT UK'', the title was defended on the [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] brand, as well as at shows produced by independent wrestling promotions in the United Kingdom.

== History==
In a press conference at [[The O2 Arena]] on December 15, 2016, [[Triple H]] revealed that there would be a [[WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament (2017)|16-man tournament]] to crown the inaugural WWE United Kingdom Champion. The tournament was held over a two-day period, January 14 and 15, 2017, and aired exclusively on the [[WWE Network]]. [[Tyler Bate]] won the inaugural tournament to become the first WWE United Kingdom Champion.&lt;ref name="UKTitle01152017"/&gt;

Following the inaugural tournament in 2017, the title began being featured on WWE's [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]] when Bate debuted during the January 28, 2017, tapings of ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'' in [[San Antonio, Texas]], which aired February 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-results/nxt-takeover-pre-show-tv-taping-dark-match-results-229191|title=NXT TakeOver pre-show TV taping &amp; dark match results|date=January 28, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the February 1 tapings at the brand's home base of [[Full Sail University]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]], the title's very first defense took place, where Bate defeated [[Trent Seven]] (aired February 15).&lt;ref name="2/1 NXT TV Review"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2017/02/01/21-nxt-tv-review-nxt-takeover-fallout-roode-reacts-victory-ceremony-departing-corey-graves-moon-vs-alijah-bate-vs-lorcan/|title= 2/1 NXT TV Review|website=PWTorch.com|accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was defended for the first time outside of WWE when Bate retained the title against [[Mark Andrews (wrestler)|Mark Andrews]] on a show for the London-based promotion, [[Progress Wrestling]]; the show took place in [[Orlando, Florida]] on March 31 as part of [[WrestleMania Axxess]].&lt;ref name="ProOrlando"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2017/03/31/331-progress-wrestling-orlando-results-tyler-bate-vs-mark-andrews-wwe-uk-championship-pete-dunne-vs-mark-haskins-progress-championship-zack-sabre-jr-vs-jimmy-havoc/|title=3/31 Progress Wrestling in Orlando results: Tyler Bate vs. Mark Andrews for the WWE UK Championship, Pete Dunne vs. Mark Haskins for the Progress Championship, Zack Sabre Jr. vs. Jimmy Havoc|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first title change, as well as the first defense to air live, took place on May 20, 2017, at [[NXT TakeOver: Chicago]], where [[Pete Dunne (wrestler)|Pete Dunne]] defeated Bate to become champion.&lt;ref name="NXTChicago"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Zack|title=5/20 Zim’s NXT Takeover: Chicago live review – Bobby Roode vs. Hideo Itami for the NXT Title, Authors of Pain vs. Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa in a ladder match for the NXT Tag Titles, Asuka vs. Nikki Cross vs. Ruby Riot for the NXT Women’s Title|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2017/05/20/520-zims-nxt-takeover-toronto-live-review-bobby-roode-vs-hideo-itami-nxt-title-authors-pain-vs-johnny-gargano-tommaso-ciampa-ladder-match-nxt-tag-tit/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2017/02/15/22704454.html|title=NXT: Bate retains UK title against Moustache Mountain partner Seven|last=Howell|first=Nolan|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=Slam!

== Championship belt design ==
[[File:Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.svg|upright|thumb|The championship's center plate is inspired by the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom's royal coat of arms]]]]
As with some other championship belts unveiled in 2016, the base design is [[WWE Championship#Current design|similar]] to the [[WWE Championship]], with notable differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/superstars WWE Superstars - WWE.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo, the center plate is modeled after the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom's royal coat of arms]], featuring a lion and a horse (instead of the traditional unicorn) on either side of the arms, while the center of the shield has been replaced with the WWE logo; atop the shield are the [[crown jewels]]. The banner atop the arms reads "United Kingdom" while the banner below reads "Champion". Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced in 2016, the United Kingdom Championship belt features two side plates, both separated by gold divider bars, with removable round sections that can be replaced with the current champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo on the globe. The plates are on a black leather strap.

==Reigns==
As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been two reigns. The inaugural  champion was [[Tyler Bate]], who won the inaugural tournament. Bate is also the youngest champion, winning the title at 19 years old, while the oldest champion is [[Pete Dunne (wrestler)|Pete Dunne]], winning the title at 23. Dunne has the longest reign at {{age in days nts|month1=05|day1=20|year1=2017}}+ days, while Bate has the shortest at 125 days (126 days as recognized by WWE).

The current champion is Pete Dunne. He defeated Tyler Bate at [[NXT TakeOver: Chicago]] on May 20, 2017.
