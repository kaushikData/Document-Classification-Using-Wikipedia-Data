'''Adolph Otto Niedner''' (1863–1954) was an American [[gunsmith]] remembered for pioneering work with cartridges including the [[.22 Long Rifle]] and [[.25-06 Remington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massrifle.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=65&amp;Itemid=96|title=Massachusetts Rifle Association History|publisher=Massachusetts Rifle Association|accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Niedner was born in [[Philadelphia]] to [[Germans|German]] immigrants Carl Heinrich Niedner and Augusta W. (Trapp) Niedner. He enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1880 and fought against the [[Apache]] uprisings led by [[Victorio's War|Victorio]] and [[Geronimo]]. He was discharged in 1883 with a scar from a scalp wound. He served on the [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] police force until moving to [[Malden, Massachusetts]] in 1899 to work as a [[weaving|weaver]] in his father's business manufacturing [[linen]] [[sock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Herald-Palladium|''News-Palladium'']] 28 December 1954 p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gunsmith==
Niedner opened a gunsmith shop in Malden in 1906.  Niedner worked with members of the [[Massachusetts Rifle Association]], including [[gun barrel]]-maker [[Harry Pope]], making tools and rifles for [[ballistics]] expert [[Franklin Ware Mann]], and prototype Patridge [[sight (device)|gun sights]] for inventor Eugene Patridge. Niedner moved to [[Dowagiac, Michigan]] in 1920 to establish the Niedner Rifle Company, and was elected [[mayor]] of Dowagiac in 1926. Niedner specialized in [[Chamber (firearms)|chambering]] and [[single-shot]] rifles. Niedner manufactured custom rifles for many noted riflemen including [[Townsend Whelen]], [[Charles Newton (inventor)|Charles Newton]] and [[.257 Roberts|Ned Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;Barsness, John "A Pair of .26-06s" in August-September 2012 ''Handloader'' p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Niedner sold the business following the death of his wife, Josephine C. (Josie), in 1940; and lived alone in Dowagiac until death from a heart attack on 27 December 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Traverse City Record-Eagle]]'' 28 December 1954 p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arina Ivanovna Rodionova''' ({{lang-ru|Арина Ивановна Родионова}}; born 15 December 1989 in [[Tambov]]) is a [[Russians in Australia|Russian-born Australian]] [[tennis]] player.

Rodionova has won nine singles and 29 doubles titles on the [[ITF Women's Circuit]]. In 2007, she won the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] girls' doubles title, partnering [[Evgeniya Rodina]]. On 23 October 2017, she reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 116. On 27 July 2015, she peaked at No. 41 in the doubles rankings.

Elder sister [[Anastasia Rodionova|Anastasia]] is also a tennis professional, and the two sisters have intermittently contested doubles tournaments with modest success. Their most notable achievement as a team came at the [[2010 Malaysian Open – Doubles|2010 Malaysian Open]], in which they reached the final before losing to [[Chan Yung-jan]] and [[Zheng Jie]] in a super tie-break.

==Personal life==
[[File:Arina Rodionova.jpg|thumb|left|252px|Rodionova in 2010]]
Arina Rodionova was born to Ivan and Natalia Rodionova and lives in [[Melbourne]] with her sister Anastasia.&lt;ref name="OB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WTA3"&gt;[http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/11166 WTA Tour | Players | Info (Biography) | Arina Rodionova]&lt;/ref&gt; She began playing tennis aged three, "I began playing tennis when I was almost three years old. And why exactly tennis? There wasn't any choice for me with my dad being a coach and my sister a professional tennis player, but in the end I think it's worked well!"&lt;ref name="OB"/&gt; Rodionova cites [[Martina Hingis]] as her role model, and also admires [[Justine Henin]] and [[Bob and Mike Bryan]].&lt;ref name="WTA3"/&gt; She prefers hard courts and [[forehand]] as a shot.&lt;ref name="WTA3"/&gt;

Rodionova received Australian citizenship in January 2014 and married [[Australian rules football]]er [[Ty Vickery]] in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-3366847/Arina-Rodionova-wins-Australian-Open-wild-card-qualifier-11am-marries-Aussie-Rules-player-Ty-Vickery-five-hours-later.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Rodionova made her debut as a professional in 2004 at an [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] event in [[Protvino]], Russia. In 2005, she won a title in [[Minsk]], followed by another win in Moscow the following year. In 2008, she finished as a runner-up in an ITF event in [[Istanbul]]. In 2009, Rodionova won two ITF titles in singles and eight in doubles.

In 2010, Rodionova defeated [[Jarmila Groth]] in the final of a $25,000 tournament in [[Burnie]]. In doubles, she advanced to the final of the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]-level [[2010 Malaysian Open|Malaysian Open]] with her sister Anastasia. Although they defeated No. 1 seeds [[Alisa Kleybanova]] and [[Yan Zi (tennis)|Yan Zi]] along the way, the sisters lost the final match to Chan Yung-jan and Zheng Jie in close three sets.

At the [[2011 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2011 Australian Open]], Rodionova equalled her career-best showing at a Grand Slam tournament by qualifying for the main draw. She lost in the first round to fellow qualifier [[Anne Keothavong]], 5–7, 4–6. She then won a [[2011 Strabag Prague Open|$50,000 event]] in May in Prague, partnering [[Darya Kustova]]. She qualified for the [[2011 Aegon Classic|Aegon Classic]], and won her first-round match against [[Virginie Razzano]]. She then notched the biggest win of her career by defeating No. 1 seed and world No. 16 [[Kaia Kanepi]] in the second round. She lost to the 14th seed [[Magdaléna Rybáriková]] in the third round. At [[2011 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Rodionova barely missed out on qualifying for the main draw by losing to [[Kristýna Plíšková]] in three sets. She achieved very modest results through much of the rest of the year, losing in the first or second round of most tournaments she entered.

[[File:ARINA RODIONOVA (11902588904).jpg|thumb|left|252px|Rodionova in 2014]]
In 2012, Rodionova lost in the qualifying rounds of the [[2012 Apia International Sydney|Apia International Sydney]] and the [[2012 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. She then lost in the quarterfinals of a $25,000 event in [[2012 McDonald's Burnie International|Burnie]]. She then competed in two more ITF events – losing in the second and first round, respectively. She picked up form in ITF Mildura, reaching the semifinals. Rodionova then competed in three more tournaments, losing in the second round of all three. She then failed to qualify in [[2012 e-Boks Open|Copenhagen]]. Her best result of the year came at the WTA clay event [[2012 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem|Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem]]. She defeated [[Darija Jurak]], [[Karolína Plíšková]], and world No. 108 [[Mathilde Johansson]] to qualify for the main draw. Each match lasted three sets. She took on [[Timea Bacsinszky]] in the first round, started well by winning the first set 6–2, but was forced to retire due a severe wrist injury she sustained while trailing 0–4 in the second set. She was also forced to withdraw from the doubles competition, where she and Anastasia were the No. 1 seeds. She missed a big part of the clay-court season to recover from the injury. Rodionova returned in July; she was only able to make it past the first round in one of five ITF tournaments. However, she had a great result in [[2012 Party Rock Open|Las Vegas]], where she reached the semifinals. Following three more early exits in tournaments, she reached the final of a $25,000 event in [[Traralgon]], and followed this up by winning her next tournament in [[Bendigo]]. She finished the year with two more early-round losses in [[Toyota]] and [[Dubai]].

===World TeamTennis===
In 2011, Rodionova was drafted by the [[Washington Kastles]] WTT Team, coached by [[Murphy Jensen]]. As a result of their 14-match win undefeated regular season, the Kastles secured the top seed in the Conference Championships where they beat the Boston Lobsters. In the WTT Finals the Kastles defeated the St. Louis Aces to capture the 2011 WTT Championship for the second time in its four-year existence, completing the first ever 16–0 season in WTT 36-year history. Rodionova was named Female Rookie of the Year just prior to the Conference Championship match and later WTT Finals MVP.

Upon announcing his candidacy, Sasse expressed strong opposition to the [[Affordable Care Act]].

Sasse has described Trump as a "'megalomaniac strongman,'" has "called the president’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports 'dumb,' and has described Trump’s escalating trade war with China [as] 'nuts.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/sasse-trump-republican-senate-never-702071|title=Sasse tempts Trump’s wrath by refusing to bow|work=Politico|last=Isenstadt|first=Alex|date=July 9, 2018|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Sasse criticized Trump for congratulating Vladimir Putin on his election win,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/21/sasse-trump-putin-russia-479045|title=Sasse rips Trump for congratulating Putin on 'sham' election win|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "The president of the United States was wrong to congratulate him, and the White House press secretary was wrong to duck a simple question about whether or not Putin's reelection was free and fair. It was not. The American people know that, the Russian people know that and the world knows that. The White House refused to speak directly and clearly about this matter; we were weakened as a nation and a tyrant was strengthened."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2018, ''[[Politico]]'' reported that Sasse had "quietly launched a new political non-profit group, fueling speculation that he might launch a Hail Mary bid for president rather than seek another term in the Senate." However, ''Politico'' also reported that Sasse and the President have been talking multiple times each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/sasse-trump-republican-senate-never-702071|title=Sasse tempts Trump’s wrath by refusing to bow|work=Politico|last=Isenstadt|first=Alex|date=July 9, 2018|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasse has not ruled out a 2020 presidential bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/09/sasse-republicans-senate-nebraska-812844|title=Sasse: ‘Every morning’ I consider leaving the GOP |work=Politico|last=O'Brien|first=Connor|date=September 9, 2018|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/sasse-wont-rule-out-2020-presidential-run/vp-BBN5lDE|title=Sasse won't rule out 2020 presidential run|work=CNN|date=September 9, 2018|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guns ===
In Sasse's Senate run in 2014, he received an "AQ" rating from the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA). According to the NRA's press release, the rating was the most favorable that could be given to a candidate who had no voting record on gun-related issues. The NRA endorsed Sasse in the race.&lt;ref name="NRAPVF"&gt;{{cite web|title=NRA Endorses Ben Sasse for U.S. Senate in Nebraska|url=https://www.nrapvf.org/articles/20140908/nra-endorses-ben-sasse-for-us-senate-in-nebraska|website=NRA-PVF|accessdate=October 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care ===
In announcing his Senate candidacy, Sasse expressed strong opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] (ACA, a.k.a. "Obamacare"), describing himself as "the anti-Obamacare candidate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/ben-sasse-i-m-running-to-repeal-the-obamacare-worldview/article_0b15125a-1ed0-55b2-a1b1-50224ecea5f0.html|title=Ben Sasse: I'm running to repeal the Obamacare worldview|author=Ben Sasse|date=December 3, 2013|newspaper=Lincoln Journal Star|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later declaring that "[i]f it lives, America as we know it will die."&lt;ref name="owh-2013-10-08" /&gt; In the Senate, Sasse continued to support repeal of the ACA. In 2017, with Republicans unable to develop a repeal-and-replace plan that could secure a majority in the Senate, Sasse proposed an immediate repeal with a one-year delay in implementation, and called on the Senate to give up its August recess to allow it to work on a replacement measure.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Joseph.

In 2016, Sasse was the only senator from either party to vote against the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which was intended to address abuse of heroin and opioid drugs by providing funds to the states for treatment and prevention programs and by making the anti-overdose drug [[naloxone]] more widely available to first responders and law enforcement agencies. Sasse said he was "distressed by opioid abuse" but questioned whether drug treatment should be addressed at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/03/10/senate_passes_bill_addressing_heroin_opioid_crisis_129935.html|title=Senate Passes Bill Addressing Heroin, Opioid Crisis|last1=Arkin|first1=James|date=March 10, 2016|publisher=Real Clear Politics|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGBT issues ===
in 2014, Sasse's campaign website did not refer explicitly to same-sex marriage, but stated, "Ben believes marriage is between one man &amp; one woman".&lt;ref&gt;[https://sassefornebraska.com/ "Issues": Sasse for Nebraska] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017224100/https://www.sassefornebraska.com/ |date=October 17, 2014 }}; retrieved October 19, 2014.

=== Spending ===
In September 2018, Sasse, five other Republican senators ([[Jeff Flake]], [[Mike Lee (American politician)|Mike Lee]], [[Rand Paul]], [[David Perdue]], and [[Pat Toomey]]), and [[Bernie Sanders]] voted against a $854 billion spending bill meant to avoid a government shutdown. The bill included funding for the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=CARNEY |first1=JORDAIN |last2=ELIS |first2=NIV |title=Senate approves $854B spending bill |url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/407218-senate-approves-854b-spending-bill |website=The Hill |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

'''Bernard Buffet''' ({{IPA-fr|byfɛ|lang}}; 10 July 1928 – 4 October 1999) was a French painter of [[Expressionism]] and a member of the anti-abstract art group ''L'homme Témoin'' (the Witness-Man).&lt;ref&gt;"DuMont's Künstlerlexikon", ''DuMont Buchverlag Köln'', [[Cologne]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Buffet was born in Paris, France, and studied art there at the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] (National School of the Fine Arts) and worked in the studio of the painter [[Eugène Narbonne]]. Among his classmates were [[Maurice Boitel]] and [[Louis Vuillermoz]].

Sustained by the picture-dealer [[Maurice Garnier]], Buffet produced religious pieces, landscapes, portraits and [[still-life]]s. In 1946, he had his first painting shown, a self-portrait, at the Salon des Moins de Trente Ans at the Galerie Beaux-Arts. He had at least one major exhibition every year. Buffet illustrated "Les Chants de Maldoror" written by [[Comte de Lautréamont]] in 1952. In 1955, he was awarded the first prize by the magazine Connaissance des Arts, which named the ten best post-war artists. In 1958, at the age of 30, the first retrospective of his work was held at the Galerie Charpentier.

[[Pierre Bergé]] was Buffet's live-in lover until Bergé&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/bernard-buffet-return-of-the-poser-1645748.html Bernard Buffet: Return of the 'poser' – Features – Art]. The Independent (16 March 2009). Retrieved on 26 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; left Buffet for [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]].

On 12 December 1958, Buffet married the writer and [[actress]] Annabel Schwob. They adopted three children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Livres/franoise-sagan-nicolas-buffet-alcool-143654&lt;/ref&gt; Daughter Virginie was born in 1962, daughter Danielle in 1963 and son Nicolas was born in 1973. Bernard Buffet was named "Chevalier de la [[Legion of Honour|Légion d'Honneur]]" in 1973. 

On 23 November 1973, the Bernard Buffet Museum was founded by Kiichiro Okano, in Surugadaira, Japan.

At the request of the French postal administration in 1978, he designed a stamp depicting the Institut et le Pont des Arts – on this occasion the Post Museum arranged a retrospective of his works.&lt;ref&gt;MMK Museum für Moderne Kunst, [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], "Bernard Buffet Maler Painter Peintre", ''Brochure'', 2008, April&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffet created more than 8,000 paintings and many [[Printmaking|prints]] as well.

Buffet committed [[suicide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/bernard-buffet-return-of-the-poser-1645748.html|title=Bernard Buffet: Return of the 'poser'|publisher=The Independent|date=16 March 2009|accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at his home in [[Tourtour]], southern France, on 4 October 1999. He was suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]] and was no longer able to work. Police said that Buffet died around 4 p.m after putting his head in a plastic bag attached around his neck with tape.

The popularity of Buffet's work, as well as the level of media attention around his lifestyle, were quite high in the 1950s and 1960s. Although he kept on painting throughout his life, there was a certain decline in interest with is work in the later decades of the 20th century. Especially so in his native country. This decline in popularity was partly influenced by his fall from grace with French art pundits, whose support and interest shifted away from figurative art. 

In the 21st century there has been a renewed spike in interest in the work of Bernard Buffet. With some successful exhibitions in France and throughout the world. In 2016, British author Nicholas Foulkes published [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bernard-Buffet-Invention-Modern-Mega-artist/dp/1848094442 ''Bernard Buffet: The Invention of the Modern Mega-Artist']', in which he offers a controversial biographical account of Buffet's life and work. 

In recent years, his children, as well as grandchildren, UK resident Timothé (b. 1995), Taïmour (b. 2000), Manon and Manolo, have been actively working towards promoting the work of Bernard Buffet.

Many '''Black Dahlia suspects''', or [[person of interest|persons of interest]], have been proposed as the unidentified killer of [[Elizabeth Short]], nicknamed the "Black Dahlia", who was murdered in 1947. Many theories have been advanced, but none have been found to be completely persuasive by experts, and some are not taken seriously at all.

The murder investigation by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] was the largest since the murder of [[Marion Parker]] in 1927, and involved hundreds of officers borrowed from other [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]]. Sensational and sometimes inaccurate press coverage, as well as the nature of the crime, focused intense public attention on the case. As the case continues to command public attention, many more people have been proposed as Short's killer, much like London's ''[[Jack the Ripper]]'' murders.

==Original suspects==
Because of the complexity of the case, the original investigators treated every person who knew Elizabeth Short as a suspect who had to be eliminated. Hundreds of people were considered suspects and thousands were interviewed by police.

==Recent suspects==
While some of the original 25 suspects were discounted, new ones have arisen. At present the following suspects are discussed by various authors and experts:

===Walter Bayley===

Bayley was a Los Angeles surgeon who lived one block south of the vacant lot in which Short's body was found, until he left his wife in October 1946. His daughter was a friend of Short's sister Virginia, and had been the [[matron of honor]] at her wedding. When Bayley died in January 1948, his [[autopsy]] showed that he was suffering from a degenerative brain disease. After his death, his widow alleged that his mistress knew a "terrible secret" about Bayley and was made the main beneficiary upon his death as a result. Bayley was never a suspect in the case, but many medical doctors and others with medical training were. In secret testimony, Detective Harry Hansen, one of the original investigators, told the 1949 [[Los Angeles County]] [[grand jury]] that in his opinion the killer was a "top medical man" and "a fine surgeon." Bayley was 67 years old at the time of the murder, had no known history of violence or criminal activity of any kind, and is not known to have met Short, even though his daughter was a friend of Short's oldest sister.

When Larry Harnisch, a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' [[copy editor]] and writer, began studying the case in 1996, he eventually concluded that Bayley could be Short's killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmharnisch.com|title=Heaven Is Here! The Murder of Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia; Los Angeles' Most Famous Unsolved Killing|author=Larry Harnisch|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although critics of Harnisch's theory question whether Bayley's mental and physical condition at the time of the murder would have been consistent with the commission of this type of crime, the original investigators' theory that the body was cut in half because the killer wasn't strong enough to move it intact partially answers this objection. Harnisch theorizes that Bayley's [[neurology|neurological]] deterioration contributed to his alleged violence against Short. Some have suggested that the secret Bayley's mistress was [[blackmail]]ing him with was that he had performed [[abortion]]s, then a crime. However, there is no evidence that either Bayley or his associates performed abortions. Author [[James Ellroy]] endorsed Harnisch's theory in the [[2001 in film|2001]] film ''James Ellroy's Feast of Death''.&lt;ref name="xuyewklongxl2-143-750468"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333445/|title=James Ellroy's Feast of Death (2001)|author=xuyewklongxl2-143-750468|date=6 May 2001|work=IMDb|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Harnisch's behavioral/psychological evidence: Bayley's neurodegenerative condition was known to produce violent behavior in otherwise passive individuals; his surgical specializations included [[mastectomy|mastectomies]], [[hysterectomy|hysterectomies]], and the surgical removal of fat; in conversation with Bayley's former receptionist, Harnisch discovered that he and his mistress would, at dinnertime, watch movies of surgeries and autopsies.&lt;ref name="xuyewklongxl2-143-750468"/&gt;

In devising his theory, Harnisch consulted retired [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler [[John E. Douglas]], who advised that the very public location of the dump site was significant, since the killer had the ability to transport the body to a more remote site, where it may not have been discovered; the site was one block away from property owned by Bayley's estranged wife Ruth.&lt;ref name="xuyewklongxl2-143-750468"/&gt; Douglas also advised that the facial lacerations indicated personal anger towards the victim: Short would often falsely tell men that she had a son who had died tragically; Bayley did, in fact, have a son who was struck by a car and killed at age 11. The deceased child's birthday was January 13; Short's body was discovered on January 15.&lt;ref name="xuyewklongxl2-143-750468"/&gt;

===Norman Chandler===
Donald Wolfe's 2005 book ''The Black Dahlia Files:'' ''The Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles'' names [[Norman Chandler]], publisher of the ''Los Angeles Times'' from 1945-1960, as a suspect in the murder.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6PpPrKuUaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=donald+wolfe+black+dahlia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitk6KH4cHXAhVS82MKHVBUBRQQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=donald%20wolfe%20black%20dahlia&amp;f=false|title=The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles|last=Wolfe|first=Don|date=2006-09-05|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780060582500|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a complicated scenario involving multiple perpetrators, Wolfe claims that Chandler impregnated Short while she was working as a [[call girl]] for the notorious [[Hollywood]] [[Madam#Other_usage|"madam"]] [[Brenda Allen]], which led to her murder at the hands of gangster [[Bugsy Siegel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wolfe's claim that Short was a prostitute is at odds with the Los Angeles County [[district attorney]]'s files, which plainly state that she was not, as Wolfe asserts, [[pregnant]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527024809/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=3 Black Dahlia - News 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leslie Dillon===
Dillon was a 27-year-old [[bellhop]], aspiring writer, and former [[mortician]]'s assistant who became a suspect when he began writing to [[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] Dr. J. Paul De River in October 1948. Dillon was living in [[Florida]] at the time of his correspondence with De River, but had formerly lived in Los Angeles. He read a story about the case in a [[True Detective (magazine)|''True Detective'']]-style magazine in which De River was quoted, and wrote to De River regarding his theories on the case. In his correspondence, he mentioned an intense interest in [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] and [[sexual violence]] in hopes of authoring a book on the subject. Dillon offered up one of his friends, Jeff Connors, as a likely suspect. Over the course of their correspondence, De River began to believe that Connors did not exist and that Dillon had committed the murder himself.

In December 1948, Dillon agreed to meet with De River and was given the choice of one of three cities: Los Angeles; [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]; or [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Dillon expressed reservations about Los Angeles, and chose Las Vegas instead. De River and undercover LAPD officers met Dillon in Las Vegas for a couple of days and then proceeded to drive back to California. Once there, Dillon and De River traveled to [[San Francisco]] to unsuccessfully look for Connors. When Dillon offered up intimate details about the crime, he was taken into custody by the undercover officers and transported to Los Angeles. After this happened, Dillon sailed a postcard out a hotel window with a plea for help on it; it was discovered by a passerby and turned in to local authorities.

Police soon discovered that Connors did indeed exist; his real name was Artie Lane. Lane had lived in Los Angeles at the time of the murder and was employed by [[Columbia Studios]], a favorite hangout of Short's, as a maintenance man. However, contrary to popular belief, Dillon could not be conclusively placed in San Francisco at the time of the murder. In fact, police never could account for Dillon's whereabouts between January&amp;nbsp;9 and January&amp;nbsp;15, 1947. Dillon later filed a $100,000 claim against the City of Los Angeles, but dropped the lawsuit after it emerged he was wanted by [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] police for [[robbery]]. ''Los Angeles Times'' reporter Larry Harnisch disputes this and says that Dillon did in fact receive a financial settlement from the City of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ladailymirror.com/2017/09/10/black-dahlia-piu-eatwells-black-dahlia-red-rose-exhumes-leslie-dillon/|title=The Daily Mirror|date=September 10, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to a 1949 grand jury investigation of police handling of the Black Dahlia case and some other unsolved murders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527024811/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=8 Black Dahlia - News 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmharnisch.com/faq.html|title=Heaven Is Here! Larry Harnisch's Site on Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia. Black Dahlia FAQ|author=Larry Harnisch|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the Long Beach Police ''The Rap Sheet'' said that a former member of LA's Gangster Squad investigating the case  believed that Leslie Dillon was the killer and when Dillon returned to his home state of Oklahoma was able to avoid extradition to California because Dillon's relative was the governor of Oklahoma. Some speculated that Dillon's ex-wife Georgie Stevenson was related to former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, who contacted the Oklahoma governor on Dillon's behalf, although none of these relations have been verified.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Rap Sheet (Long Beach Police Department)|date=2000|pages=16, 17, 32, 33, 34, 35|title=The Second Black Dahlia Investigation, Parts 1, 2, and 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, De River's daughter, Jacque Daniel, published a book called ''The Curse of the Black Dahlia'', in which she expressed her belief that her father had been unfairly maligned for the Dillon affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://policepsychiatrist.com |title=Dentists Reviews and Hot Topics |author=police14 |publisher= |accessdate=20 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223142825/http://www.policepsychiatrist.com/ |archivedate=23 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph A. Dumais===
Dumais, a 29-year-old soldier stationed at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey|Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]], confessed to Short's murder a few weeks after it occurred. Although this "breakthrough" was quickly dismissed by the original investigators, the Los Angeles press covered it enthusiastically until it was revealed that Dumais had been at Fort Dix at the time of the murder. Dumais was cleared of any involvement in the crime, although he continued to claim he killed Short each time he was arrested for various offenses, well into the 1950s.

===Mark Hansen===

Hansen was a Hollywood nightclub owner at whose home Short lived, either as a paying boarder or as a guest, on several occasions between May 1946 and October 1946. Hansen's girlfriend Ann Toth shared a room with Short in this house, which was near Hansen's nightclub. Short called Hansen from [[San Diego]] on January 8, making him one of the last people known to have spoken to her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527024821/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news/article.php?storyid=18 Black Dahlia - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles County District Attorney's files indicate that Hansen made contradictory statements to authorities about the nature of this conversation. An address book embossed with Hansen's name was among Short's belongings mailed to the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' after her murder by someone claiming to be the killer. The address book belonged to Hansen, but he had never used it; Short had been using it as her own. The D.A.'s files also indicate that Hansen had tried to seduce Short but was rebuffed. He was one of the first serious suspects in the case and he was still a [[prime suspect]] as late as 1951. Hansen was also linked to three other suspects, each of whom was a medical doctor: Dr. Patrick S. O'Reilly, Dr. M. M. Schwartz, and Dr. Arthur McGinnis Faught.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527024802/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=4 Black Dahlia - News 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Buz Williams, a retired detective with the Long Beach Police Department, wrote an article for the LBPD newsletter ''The Rap Sheet'' in 2000 on Elizabeth Short's murder. Williams' father Richard F. Williams and his friend Con Keller were both members of LA's Gangster Squad investigating the case. Keller believed Mark Hansen was the killer and said Hansen was Swedish and had spent some time at Sweden's Medical Surgical School (Hansen was actually born in Denmark) which would explain the precise dissection of Short's body. Keller also said that Hansen held elaborate parties at his Hollywood boarding house and members of the Los Angeles Police Department along with the Chief of Detectives Thad Brown and his brother Finis Brown attended and later aided Hansen in a cover up. Williams mentioned that Hansen owned a Ford Lincoln-Mercury car lot on Hollywood Boulevard and his LAPD friends were later coincidentally driving around town in brand new Lincoln cars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Hansen died of natural causes in 1964. No charges were ever brought against him. He had no criminal record and no known history of violence. LAPD Police Chief William Worton told the [[Los Angeles Examiner]] that there was absolutely no case against Hansen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los Angeles Examiner|date=December 7, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen's great granddaughter Helen Alexis Yonov was interviewed for Piu Eatwell's upcoming documentary on the Black Dahlia for NBC Peacock Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1303266/?ref_=fn_al_nm_8|title=Internet Movie Database  |accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular accounts of the Black Dahlia case often portray Hansen as having connections to [[organized crime]], but there is no evidence of this.

===George Hodel===
Dr. [[George Hill Hodel|George Hill Hodel, Jr.]] came under police scrutiny in October 1949, when his 14-year-old daughter, Tamar, accused him of [[child molestation|molesting]] her. Despite three witnesses testifying that they had seen Hodel having sex with Tamar, he was [[acquittal|acquitted]] in December 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Mark; Sarah Hudson Bayliss (2006). ''Exquisite Corpse: Surrealism and the Black Dahlia Murder.'' New York: Bulfinch Press. Pg 26. {{ISBN|0-8212-5819-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial led the LAPD to include Hodel, a physician specializing in [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, among its many suspects in the Dahlia case. Police put Hodel under surveillance from February 18 to March 27, 1950, to ascertain whether he could be implicated in the murder. In the surviving transcripts of microphone recordings, Hodel was heard making highly incriminating statements.

{{quote|Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now. They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead.... They thought there was something fishy. Anyway, now they may have figured it out. Killed her. Maybe I did kill my secretary....|George Hodel. February 18, 1950}}

The secretary referred to was Ruth Spaulding, who police had previously suspected of being murdered by Hodel in 1945. He was present when Spaulding [[overdose]]d and had burnt some of her papers before police were called. The case was dropped owing to lack of evidence, but documents were later found that indicated Spaulding was about to publicly accuse Hodel of intentionally misdiagnosing patients and billing them for laboratory tests, medical treatment, and prescriptions not needed. Hodel's son, former LAPD homicide detective Steve Hodel, believes Short may have been one of his father's patients.

In the final report to the grand jury, dated February 20, 1951, Lt. Frank Jemison of the Los Angeles County D.A.'s office wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Doctor George Hodel, M.D. [[John Sowden House|5121 Fountain [Franklin] Avenue]], at the time of this murder had a clinic at East First Street near [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. Lillian DeNorak [Lenorak] who lived with this doctor said he spent some time around the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] and identified the photo of victim Short as a photo of one of the doctor's girl friends. Tamar Hodel, fifteen-year-old daughter, stated that her mother, Dorothy Hodel, has told her that her father had been out all night on a party the night of the murder and said, "They'll never be able to prove I did that murder." Two microphones were placed in this suspect's home (see the log and recordings made over approximately three weeks time which tend to prove his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmharnisch.com/recordings/record001.html|title=Heaven Is HERE! Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia. Dr. George Hodel Transcripts|author=Larry Harnisch|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; See statement of Dorothy Hodel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmharnisch.com/recordings/dhodel001.html|title=Interrogation of Dorothy Harvey Hodel|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; former wife). Informant Lillian DeNorak [Lenorak] has been committed to the [[Camarillo State Mental Hospital|State Mental Institution]] at [[Camarillo, California|Camarillo]]. Joe Barrett, a roomer at the Hodel residence cooperated as an informant. A photograph of the suspect in the nude with a nude identified colored model was secured from his personal effects. Undersigned identified this model as Mattie Comfort, 3423½ South Arlington, Republic 4953. She said that she was with Doctor Hodel sometime prior to the murder and that she knew nothing about his being associated with the victim. Rudolph Walthers, known to have been acquainted with victim and also with suspect Hodel, claimed he had not seen victim in the presence of Hodel and did not believe that the doctor had ever met the victim. The following acquaintances of Hodel were questioned and none were able to connect the suspect with murder: Fred Sexton, 1020 White Knoll Drive; Nita Moladero, 1617½ North Normandy [Normandie]; Ellen Taylor 5121 Fountain Avenue; Finlay Thomas, 616½ South Normandy [Normandie]; Mildred B. Colby, 4029 Vista Del Monte Street, Sherman Oaks, this witness was a girlfriend of Charles Smith, abortionist friend of Hodel, Turin Gilkey, 1025 North Wilcox; Irene Summerset, 1236¼ North Edgemont; Norman Beckett, 1025 North Wilcox; Ethel Kane, 1033 North Wilcox; Annette Chase, 1039 North Wilcox; Dorothy Royer, 1636 North Beverly Glenn. See supplemental reports, long sheets and hear recordings, all of which tend to eliminate this suspect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report, from which the above excerpt was taken, was submitted at the completion of the D.A.'s investigation of Hodel and at least 21 other suspects.

In 2003, Steve Hodel published a book, ''Black Dahlia Avenger; A Genius for Murder,'' in which he claimed his father, who died in 1999, had murdered Short and was responsible for other unsolved killings over two decades. Steve had seen two pictures in his father's photo album that he claims resemble Short, although her family insists they are not of her and many other observers have failed to see the resemblance. Since beginning his investigation, Steve located and identified one of the photographic subjects as a former friend of George Hodel. The other photograph remains unidentified.&lt;ref name=LAWeekly/&gt; Steve claims he was unaware at the time that his father had been a suspect, although his sister Tamar was friends with Janice Knowlton, author of her own book, ''Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer'', and case documents make it clear that Steve's parents and many of their associates knew George Hodel was a suspect. After reviewing the information presented in Steve's book, Head Deputy D.A. Stephen Kay proclaimed the case solved, but others have noted that he had formed this conclusion by treating Steve's many disputed assertions as established fact. Detective Brian Carr, the LAPD officer in charge of the Black Dahlia case at the time of Steve's briefing, said in a televised interview that he was baffled by Kay's response. In a September 2006 television interview, Carr added, "I don't have the time to either prove or disprove Hodel's investigation. I am too busy working on active cases." In 2009, Hodel published ''Most Evil: Avenger, Zodiac, and the Further Serial Murders of Dr. George Hill Hodel'', in which he claimed that his father was also the [[Zodiac Killer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8kRnuKZ5t0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=steve+hodel+most+cc+evil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE25el2cHXAhUK1mMKHRByAJEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=steve%20hodel%20most%20cc%20evil&amp;f=false|title=Most Evil: Avenger, Zodiac, and the Further Serial Murders of Dr. George Hill Hodel|last=Hodel|first=Steve|last2=Pezzullo|first2=Ralph|date=2009-09-22|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101140352|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weekly|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Hodel maintains a website wherein he continues to update the case with additional discovered information.

===George Knowlton===
Little reliable information is available on George Knowlton, except that he lived in the Los Angeles area at the time of the Black Dahlia murder and died in an automobile accident in 1962.

In the early 1990s, George Knowlton's daughter Janice began claiming that she had witnessed her father murdering Elizabeth Short, a claim she based largely on "[[recovered memory therapy|recovered memories]]" that surfaced during [[psychotherapy|therapy]] for [[Depression (mood)|depression]] after a [[hysterectomy]]. Based on these recovered memories, Knowlton published ''Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer'' with veteran crime writer [[Michael Newton (author)|Michael Newton]] in 1995. In the book, Knowlton, a former professional singer and owner of a [[public relations]] company, alleged that her father had been having an affair with Elizabeth Short and that Short was staying in a makeshift bedroom in their garage, where she suffered a [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that Short's autopsy by Dr. Frederick Newbarr found no evidence of pregnancy: "The uterus is small, and no pregnancy is apparent." As quoted in Newton, 2009, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; George Knowlton allegedly murdered Short in the garage and bisected her in the sink, then forced his then ten-year-old daughter Janice to accompany him when he disposed of the body. According to Knowlton, Short was a sex worker and a procurer of children for a [[Trafficking of children|child trafficking ring]]. Knowlton claimed that a former member of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]] told her that her father was considered a suspect in the case by that agency, but this claim is unsupported by the public documents that have been released in the case. She claimed the same source told her that future LAPD chief and [[California]] politician [[Edward M. Davis|Ed Davis]] and Los Angeles County District Attorney [[Buron Fitts]] were suspects in the murder as well. The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote in 1991:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Los Angeles Police Detective John P. St. John, one of the investigators who had been assigned to the case, said he has talked to Knowlton and does not believe there is a connection between the Black Dahlia murder and her father. "We have a lot of people offering up their fathers and various relatives as the Black Dahlia killer," said St. John, better known as [[Jigsaw John]]. "The things that she is saying are not consistent with the facts of the case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Westminster, California]] police took her claims seriously enough to dig up the grounds around her childhood home there, looking for evidence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/19/local/me-knowlton19|title=Janice Knowlton, 67; Believed That Her Father Killed the Black Dahlia|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=2004-12-19|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found nothing to tie George Knowlton to any crime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a side note to her accusations against her father, Janice Knowlton, who was a frequent contributor as {{cite web| url=https://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;q=jgk61+&amp;qt_s=Search |title=jgk61}} to various online forums wherein the Black Dahlia case was discussed, posted an article&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/group/alt.news-media/msg/520d0ca8b1f82d31?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Usenet]] group in August 1998 in which she names Dr. George Hodel (see above) as a suspect in the case. Knowlton's sister has since stated on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com's]] listing for ''Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer'' that after the publication of Knowlton's book, Tamar Hodel, daughter of George Hodel and sister of Steve Hodel, contacted Knowlton and the two women remained "email pals for several years."

Knowlton also made claims prefiguring those of ''Black Dahlia Files'' author Donald Wolfe. In 1999, she claimed in various public forums that Norman Chandler participated in a coverup of the murder. Knowlton claimed that on Halloween 1946, she was sold at the age of nine as a [[child prostitute]] to a [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] [[Satanism|satanic]] sex [[cult]].&lt;ref&gt;Knowlton, Janice, with Michael Newton (1995). ''Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer''. New York: Pocket Books. Pg 128.&lt;/ref&gt; She frequently alleged that she was sexually abused by a long list of dead movie stars and other notables, including [[Norman Chandler]], [[Gene Autry]] (whose name she continually misspelled as Autrey), [[Arthur Freed]], and [[Walt Disney]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Knowlton became somewhat infamous within online Black Dahlia discussion communities for her insistence that the LAPD was engaged in a conspiracy to discredit her story in order to conceal their knowledge of George Knowlton's involvement. She was so abusive in her Usenet posts&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/group/alt.true-crime/browse_thread/thread/8697985d89f9cf0d/6597d7598ac16723?lnk=st&amp;q=jgk61+pacbell&amp;rnum=2#6597d7598ac16723Usenet&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Pacific Bell]] canceled her account in 1999. On March 5, 2004, Janice Knowlton died of an [[drug overdose|overdose]] of [[prescription drug]]s in what was deemed a [[suicide]] by the [[Orange County, California]], [[coroner]]'s office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/19/local/me-knowlton19 |title=Janice Knowlton, 67; Believed That Her Father Killed The Black Dahlia |last=McLellen |first=Dennis |date=14 December 2004 |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009,&lt;ref name="Newton2009"&gt;Newton, Michael (2009) The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes, second edition. NY, Checkmark Books, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-7819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton wrote that Janice Knowlton's relatives confirmed her father George was capable of violent abuse and further reported of his "boasts of [having committed] unprosecuted homicides". However, Newton also admitted that Janice's allegations against her father were entirely circumstantial and lacked substantial corroboration.

===Robert M. "Red" Manley===
The last person seen with Elizabeth Short before her disappearance, Manley was the LAPD's top suspect in the first few days after the killing. After two [[polygraph]] tests and a sworn alibi, Manley was set free. He also identified Short's handbag purse and one of her shoes after they were discovered in a trashcan on January 25, 1947, several miles from the murder scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/dahlia/new_10.html The Black Dahlia Murder, aka Elizabeth Short - The Crime library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214091618/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/dahlia/new_10.html |date=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manley, who had been discharged from the army for mental disability, subsequently suffered a series of [[nervous breakdown]]s and claimed to be [[auditory hallucination|hearing voices]]. As a result, he was committed to [[Patton State Hospital]] by his wife in 1954. He died on January 16, 1986. The coroner attributed his death to an accidental fall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/dahlia/new_11.html Black Dahlia Murder Suspects - Beth Short Murder - The Crime library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214123532/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/dahlia/new_11.html |date=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patrick S. O'Reilly===
According to Los Angeles district attorney files, Dr. Patrick  O'Reilly was a medical doctor who knew Short through nightclub owner Mark Hansen. According to the files, at the time of the murder O'Reilly was a good friend of Hansen and frequented Hansen's nightclub. Files also state that O'Reilly "attended sex parties at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]" with Hansen. O'Reilly had a history of sexually motivated violent crime. He had been convicted of [[assault with a deadly weapon]] for "taking his secretary to a motel and [[Sadomasochism|sadistically]] beating her almost to death apparently for no other reason than to satisfy his sexual desires without intercourse," the files state. Further, the files indicate that O'Reilly's right [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] had been surgically removed, which investigators found similar to the mutilation of Short's body. The files indicate that O'Reilly had once been married to the daughter of an LAPD captain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Jack Anderson Wilson (a.k.a. Arnold Smith)===
Wilson was a lifelong petty criminal and [[alcoholic]] who was interviewed by author [[John Gilmore (writer)|John Gilmore]] while Gilmore was researching his book ''Severed''. After Wilson's death, Gilmore named Wilson as a suspect owing to his alleged acquaintance with Short. Prior to Wilson's death, however, Gilmore made an entirely different claim to the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]'' in a story appearing January 17, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lmharnisch.com/herex_820117.html|title=Heaven Is HERE! Author claims to have found 1947 murderer|author=Larry Harnisch|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Severed'' says that homicide Detective John St. John was about to "close in" on Wilson based on the material Gilmore provided, St. John told the ''Herald-Examiner'' in the same article that he was busy with other killings and would review Gilmore's claims when he got time. As reliable sources of information about the case, such as the FBI files and portions of the Los Angeles district attorney files, have become publicly available, statements about Short and the murder attributed to Wilson in ''Severed'' and supposedly tying him to the crime have not been borne out as accurate. ''Severed'' also claims Wilson was involved in the murder of [[Georgette Bauerdorf]]. ''Severed'' and many other sources based on ''Severed'' erroneously claim that Short and Bauerdorf knew each other in Los Angeles, supposedly because they were both hostesses at the same nightclub. In reality, by the time Short arrived in Los Angeles in 1946, Bauerdorf had been dead for two years and the nightclub had been closed for a year. Wilson was never a suspect until Gilmore brought him to the attention of authorities.

Wilson figures in Donald Wolfe's book ''The Mob, The Mogul, And The Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles''. Wolfe hypothesizes that Wilson was present at Short's murder and claims a connection between Wilson and gangster [[Bugsy Siegel]] through some small-time gangsters Wilson supposedly associated with. He was also a member of the military.

==Female suspects==
Although the vast majority of suspects in the case were male, authorities did not rule out the possibility of a female killer. One theory held that, because Short had checked her baggage, including her clothing and cosmetics, a week before she died, she must have been staying with another woman (who presumably would have lent Short the essentials) during the intervening time. Another theory was that the assailant bisected Short's body because he or she was not strong enough to move it in one piece. One of the first people to confess to the murder was a [[Women's Army Corps|WAC]] sergeant stationed in San Diego. Authorities took the confession seriously enough to investigate and found it groundless.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527024802/http://blackdahlia.info/modules/news2/article.php?storyid=2 Black Dahlia - News 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another suspect is referred to simply as "Queer Woman Surgeon" in the Los Angeles district attorney's files on the case. Newspaper stories at the time implied that Short was a [[lesbian]] or [[bisexual]], but the district attorney files state bluntly that Short "had no use for queers."

==Celebrity suspects==

===Woody Guthrie===
[[folk music|Folk singer]] [[Woody Guthrie]] was one of the many suspects in the murder, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's files and ''Ramblin' Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie'' written by Ed Cray and published in 2004 by [[W.W. Norton]]. According to Cray, [[Woody Guthrie|Guthrie]] drew police attention because of some sexually explicit letters and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] clippings he sent to a [[Northern California]] woman who he was allegedly stalking. The mailings disturbed the recipient so much that she showed them to her sister in Los Angeles, who contacted the police. Guthrie was quickly cleared of involvement in the murder, but various authorities attempted to prosecute him, with minor success, on charges related to sending prohibited materials through the mail.

===Orson Welles===
In her 1999 book, Mary Pacios, a former neighbor of the Short family in [[Medford, Massachusetts]], suggested filmmaker [[Orson Welles]] as a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2000/08/16/dahlia|title=Citizen Killer?|author=Jeff Chorney|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacios bases this theory on such factors as Welles's volatile temperament and his creation of mannequins three months before Short's death that supposedly featured lacerations virtually identical to those inflicted on Short. The mannequins were used in the "[[house of mirrors]]" set for ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', a film Welles was making with his ex-wife [[Rita Hayworth]] around the time of the murder. The scenes containing the set were deleted from the film by [[Harry Cohn]]. In one of Short's last letters home, her older sister Virginia claimed she had written that a movie director was going to give her a screen test.

Pacios also cites Welles' familiarity with the site where the body was found and the [[Magic (illusion)|magic act]] he performed to entertain soldiers during [[World War II]]. She believes that the bisection of the body was part of the killer's signature and an acting out of the perpetrator's obsession. Welles applied for his [[passport]] on January 24, 1947, the same day the killer mailed a packet to Los Angeles newspapers. Welles left the country for an extended stay in Europe 10 months after the murder without completing the editing of ''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'', the film he was both directing and starring in. Despite persistent attempts by [[Republic Pictures]] to get him to return to complete the film, he refused. According to Pacios, witnesses she had interviewed state that Welles and the victim both frequented Brittingham's restaurant in Los Angeles during the same time period and waitresses believed Short was going out with someone at [[Columbia Pictures]]. Welles was never a suspect in the investigation.

=== Bugsy Siegel ===
[[Los Angeles]] [[Jewish American|Jewish]] [[mobster]] [[Benjamin Siegel|Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel]] was allegedly a suspect in the murder investigation of Short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jan/17/entertainment/et-book17|title=Adding to mystery of the Black Dahlia|work=latimes|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why he was a suspect is unclear, especially since Siegel was more concerned with the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel and Casino]] at the time and he was known to be a "lady's man" not a "lady's killer." Also, Siegel was involved with [[Chicago Outfit]] starlet, and his on-off girlfriend [[Virginia Hill]]. Still, according to Don Wolfe's book ''The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=0060582502|title=The Black Dahlia Files: The Mob, the Mogul, and the Murder That Transfixed Los Angeles: Don Wolfe: 9780060582500: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siegel was the actual murderer. It has also been surmised that if Siegel had any involvement with the Dahlia murder, he would have sent [[Mickey Cohen]] or one of his other henchmen. Yet another theory was that Siegel may have been attempted to be framed by [[Jack Dragna]] who wanted revenge for Siegel's attacks on Dragna's business interests since his arrival in the 1930s.

[[File:Jane Lambart.jpg|thumb|Charles Lambart married Jane Robartes (pictured), with whom he had three children.]]

'''Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan''' (c. March 1600 – 25 June 1660) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Cavalier|Royalist]] soldier and peer.

Lambart was the son of [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Baron Lambart]] and Hester Fleetwood.&lt;ref&gt;John Debrett, ''The Peerage of the United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Ireland'', Volume 2 (F.C. and J. Rivington, 1816), 886.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the Member of Parliament for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney]] in [[Cornwall]] in 1626, and again between 1628 and 1629.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kimber and John Almon, ''The Peerage of Ireland'' (J. Almon, 1768), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He had succeeded to his father's barony on 10 June 1618 but as this was a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], he was not secluded from sitting in the [[House of Commons of England]]. Lambart was [[Seneschal]] of Cavan and of Kells in 1627 and made a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]].

Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], he raised a regiment of 1,000 foot guards against the [[Roman Catholic]] rebels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/cavan1647.htm Profile],  ''Cracroft's Peerage: The Complete Guide to the British Peerage &amp; Baronetage''; accessed 12 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently the commander of the forces guarding [[Dublin]] on behalf of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1642. On 15 April 1647, Lambart was created '''Earl of Cavan''' and '''Viscount Kilcoursie''' in the Peerage of Ireland, in recognition of his loyalty to the Royalist cause.&lt;ref name="nichols"&gt;''Biographical Peerage of Ireland'' (Nichols, 1817), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Lambart married Hon. Jane Robartes, the daughter of Richard Robartes, 1st Baron Robartes, and sister of [[John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor]], in 1625. Together they had three children. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, [[Richard Lambart, 2nd Earl of Cavan|Richard]].&lt;ref name="nichols"/&gt;

'''Chris Conrad''' (born March 10, 1953) is an American author, activist, curator, publisher and court-recognized expert in [[cannabis cultivation]] and use. He has played a key role in the shaping of the modern industrial and [[medical cannabis]] [[cannabis reform|reform]] movements as the author of such seminal books as ''Hemp: Lifeline to the Future'' (1993) and ''Hemp for Health'' (1997), as well as through his activist work as the co-founder and first President of the [[Hemp Industries Association]] (HIA), founder of the Business Alliance in Commerce and Hemp (BACH), and a signature gathering coordinator for the [[Proposition 215]] volunteer effort which made California the first US state to legalize the medical use of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sloman|first1=Larry|title=Reefer Madness: A History of Marijuana|date=December 1998|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York|isbn=0-312-19523-0|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; The December, 1999 issue of ''[[High Times]]'' ranked Conrad #10 on its list of top 25 "living legends in the battle for legal cannabis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 25 Pot Stars Speak Out|issue=December 1999|publisher=High Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Conrad's writing career began when he designed and edited a revised edition of the hemp prohibition classic ''[[The Emperor Wears No Clothes]]'' by [[Jack Herer]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herer|first1=Jack|title=The Emperor Wears No Clothes|date=March 1990|publisher=HEMP|isbn=1-878125-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with the publication of ''Hemp: Lifeline to the Future'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Chris|title=Hemp: Lifeline to the Future|date=December 1994|publisher=Creative Xpressions Publications|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-9639754-1-2|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequently translated into Italian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Chris|title=Cannabis: I mille usi di una pianta miracolosa|date=February 1996|publisher=Castelvecchi|location=Rome|isbn=88-86232-61-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hemp for Health'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Chris|title=Hemp for Health|date=1997|publisher=Healing Arts Press|location=Rochester, VT|isbn=978-0-89281-539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequently translated into Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Chris|title=Cannabis para la salud|date=March 1998|publisher=Ediciones Martinez Roca|location=Barcelona, Spain|isbn=84-270-2306-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Chris|title=Hemp: O uso medicinal e nutricional da maconha|date=2001|publisher=Editora Record|location=Rio de Janeiro|isbn=85-01-05691-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Czech and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Chris|title=Heilpflanze Haschisch|date=July 1998|publisher=Knaur|location=Germany|isbn=3-426-76177-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the author of ''Cannabis Yields and Dosages'' (2004) and ''Nostradamus and the Attack on New York''.

Conrad has co-authored two books with collaborators Virginia Resner and his wife [[Mikki Norris]]: ''Shattered Lives: Portraits From America's Drug War''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norris|first1=Mikki|last2=Conrad|first2=Chris|last3=Resner|first3=Virginia|title=Shattered Lives: Portraits From America's Drug War|date=2000|publisher=Creative Xpressions|location=El Cerrito, CA|isbn=0-9639754-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Human Rights and the US Drug War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Chris|last2=Norris|first2=Mikki|last3=Resner|first3=Virginia|title=Human Rights and the US Drug War|date=2001|publisher=Creative Xpressions|location=El Cerrito, CA|isbn=0-9639754-5-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Conrad contributed a chapter on cannabis history to ''Pourquoi &amp; Comment Cultiver Du Chanvre'' by Michka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michka|title=Pourquoi &amp; Comment Cultiver Du Chanvre|date=2007|publisher=Mama Editions|location=Paris|isbn=978-284594-0192}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his writing appeared alongside contributions from other notable authors such as [[Jorge Cervantes]], [[Raphael Mechoulam]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

==Activist career==
In 1989, Conrad and his wife [[Mikki Norris]] co-founded the American Hemp Council, with the purpose of educating the American public on the many uses of industrial hemp and the laws against the crop in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dvorak|first1=John|title=Chris Conrad - True Hemp Colleague|url=http://hempology.org/JD%27S%20ARTICLES/CHRISCON.html|website=Hempology|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, in the final weeks of the campaign (after the money came in and he was hired to do so), Conrad became the signature-gathering coordinator for the volunteer effort to pass California's [[Proposition 215]], the initiative which would go on to make the state the first in the US to legalize the medical use of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sloman|first1=Larry|title=Reefer Madness: A History of Marijuana|date=December 1998|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York|isbn=0-312-19523-0|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a vocal supporter of California's Proposition 19 in 2010, which came within four points of making California the first state to legalize all adult uses of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Conrad on Prop 19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFHYkL2NkJ4|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad has also been active in the movement to legalize industrial hemp, serving as the first president of the [[Hemp Industries Association]] (HIA) and founding the Business Alliance of Commerce in Hemp (BACH).

==Oaksterdam faculty==
Since 2007, Conrad has taught at [[Oaksterdam University]]'s Oakland, California campus, where he teaches the history and politics of [[cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oaksterdam Faculty|url=http://oaksterdamuniversity.com/category/faculty/|website=OaksterdamUniversity.com|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits curated==
In 1993 and 2000, Conrad curated and designed the Hash-Marijuana-Hemp Museum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 
In 1995, Conrad and his wife [[Mikki Norris]] partnered with Virginia Resner to create and curate the "Human Rights '95: Atrocities of the Drug War" photo exhibit to put a human face on non-violent prisoners of the Drug War and to show how the Drug War operates through their stories. Launched at the Fort Mason Center in San Francisco on June 24, 1995 for the 50th Anniversary  the United Nations, the exhibit was put in context of the UN's Declaration on Human Rights. The grand opening presented a program called, "Give Drug Peace a Chance," that included [[Ram Dass]], [[Paul Krassner]], [[Jello Biafra]], [[Ngaio Bealum]], [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]], and [[Terence Hallinan]]. They toured with this exhibit for many years, creating smaller excerpted displays that were shown at libraries, universities, conferences, and events under the name "Human Rights and the Drug War."
From 2011 to the present, Conrad has curated the [[Oaksterdam]] Cannabis Museum in Oakland, California.

==Awards==
In 2014, Conrad and his wife [[Mikki Norris]] were jointly awarded the [[Seattle Hempfest]] Outstanding Cannabis Activist Award in recognition of their writing and advocacy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Komp|first1=Ellen|title=Stoned in Seattle: Hempfest Highlights|url=http://www.celebstoner.com/news/marijuana-news/2014/08/20/stoned-in-seattle-hempfest-highlights/|website=Celeb Stoner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Conrad was the recipient of Oaksterdam University's Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2004, Conrad and Norris received the Outstanding Citizen Activism Award at the 2004 national NORML conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mikki Norris - Cannabis Advocate, Curator, Editor, Speaker - November 1, 2013|url=http://cnation.jigsy.com/mikki-norris|website=Cannabis News Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Conrad and Norris received the Drug Policy Alliance's [[Robert C. Randall]] Award for Achievement in the Field of Citizen Action, along with collaborator Virginia Resner, Randy Credico of the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice and Nora Callahan of the [[November Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Achievement Awards|url=http://www.reformconference.org/achievement-awards|website=ReformConference.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1710">'''Cleomenes''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|iː|ˈ|ɒ|m|ᵻ|n|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Κλεομένης}}; fl. c. 300 BCE) was a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher. He was a pupil of [[Crates of Thebes]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 95. The list of pupils at vi. 95 are at the end of the Life of [[Metrocles]], but probably refer to Crates. Cf. R. Bracht Branham, Marie-Odile Goulet-Cazé, (2000), ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy'', page 392&lt;/ref&gt; and is said to have taught Timarchus of Alexandria and Echecles of Ephesus, the latter of whom would go on to teach [[Menedemus the Cynic|Menedemus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a work on ''Pedagogues'' ({{lang|grc|Παιδαγωγικός}}) from which [[Diogenes Laërtius]] has preserved an anecdote concerning [[Diogenes of Sinope]]:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 75&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cleomenes in his work on ''Pedagogues'' says that Diogenes' friends wanted to ransom him, for which he called them simpletons, for, he said, lions are not the slaves of those who feed them, but rather those who feed them are at the mercy of the lions, Fear, he added, is the mark of the slave, whereas wild beasts make human beings afraid of them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The importance of this anecdote is that it is an early reference to the story of Diogenes being captured by [[pirates]] and being sold into [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slavery]], lending credence to the idea that the story may well be true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4891">[[File:De Selby by John Farman.jpg|thumb|De Selby with a canister of "night", as illustrated by John Farson.]]

''De Selby'' (spelled "de Selby" in ''The Third Policeman'' and "De Selby" in ''The Dalkey Archive'') is a fictional character originally created by [[Flann O'Brien]] for his novel ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' in which the nameless narrator intends to use the proceeds of murder and robbery to publish his commentaries on  de Selby — a crackpot savant who theorizes, among other things, that the earth is actually shaped like a sausage.&lt;ref name="nprlehman"&gt;NPR Books The Funniest, and Scariest, Book Ever Written  CHRIS LEHMANN (2006) https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5684946 &lt;/ref&gt;

O’Brien’s text and footnotes mention a number of de Selby’s works including ''Golden Hours'', ''The Country Album,'' ''A Memoir of Garcia,'' ''Layman’s Atlas'' and the ''Codex''. The fictional Bassett and Hackjaw wrote biographies ''Lux Mundi: A memoir of de Selby'' and ''de Selby’s Life and Times'' both lost.  Le Fournier,  du Garbandier, Kraus and the Le Clerque are supposed sources of de Selby material, but their works (suiting the fiction) were lost. &lt;ref name="IP"&gt;Irish Philosophy http://www.irishphilosophy.com/2014/04/01/de-selby-ireland/&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed in ''Irish Philosophy'' de Selby’ believed human existence was “a succession of static experiences each infinitely brief” and “a journey is a hallucination”  which he demonstrated by travelling from Bath to Folkestone by means of picture postcards of the supposed route, barometric instruments, clocks and a device to regulate gaslight to simulate sunlight at various “times” of day. Another theory of de Selby’s was that mirrors held the secret to eternity, claiming a huge array of parallel mirrors allowed him to see his own face as a boy of twelve.&lt;ref name="IP"/&gt;

Described as an eminent "physicist, ballistician, philosopher and psychologist", de Selby is known for his paradoxically non-scientific beliefs and personality. De Selby serves as an [[unseen character]] in ''The Third Policeman'', where he is discussed at length in references and footnotes which tenuously link his unorthodox theories and areas of research to the plot. (In one footnote, he attempts to dilute water; in another, he posits that night is caused by the accumulation of "black air".)  O'Brien's novel ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'' focussed on de Selby himself.

De Selby has a host of critical analyzers – the narrator among them – many of whom have deeply conflicting opinions of his esoteric thoughts. Although generally held in high regard by these people (many of whom hate each other), he is thought by many to have had regrettable lapses and is even called, by implication, a "nincompoop". In ''The Third Policeman'' one of de Selby's biographers is quoted as saying "The beauty of reading a page of de Selby is that it leads one inescapably to the happy conviction that one is not, of all nincompoops, the greatest."&lt;ref name="IP"/&gt;

In ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'', de Selby develops a substance ("D.M.P.") capable of extracting all [[oxygen]] from an airtight enclosure, thus disrupting the sequentiality of time, incidentally making it possibly to produce fine mature whiskey in a week.&lt;ref name=gonzalez&gt;{{cite book | last = Gonzalez | first = Alexander | title = Modern Irish Writers | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-313-29557-3 |pages=292–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Selby vows to use the substance to destroy the world in the name of God.&lt;ref name=gonzalez/&gt;

"de Selby" and his commentators are frequently cited in the footnotes of [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s novel ''The Widow's Son''.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = Robert Anton | title = The Widow's Son | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson later included Professor de Selby as the main character in his short story "The Horror on Howth Hill" where de Selby has a conversation with [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs]].&lt;ref name=Stang&gt;{{cite book | last = Stang | first =  Rev.

'''Donald William Kerst''' (November 1, 1911 – August 19, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] who worked on advanced [[particle accelerator]] concepts ([[accelerator physics]]) and [[plasma physics]]. He is most notable for his development of the [[betatron]], a novel type of particle accelerator used to accelerate [[electrons]].

A graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin]], Kerst developed the first betatron at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]], where it became operational on July 15, 1940. During [[World War II]], Kerst took a leave of absence in 1940 and 1941 to work on it with the engineering staff at [[General Electric]], and he designed a portable betatron for inspecting [[dud]] bombs. In 1943 he joined  the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where he was  responsible for designing and building the Water Boiler, a [[nuclear reactor]] intended to serve as a laboratory instrument.

From 1953 to 1957 Kerst was technical director of the [[Midwestern Universities Research Association]], where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the [[FFAG accelerator]]. He was then employed at [[General Atomics]]'s John Jay Hopkins Laboratory from 1957 to 1962, where he worked on the problem of plasma physics. With [[Tihiro Ohkawa]] he invented [[toroid]]al devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the [[Bohm diffusion]] limit.

==Early life==
Donald William Kerst was born in [[Galena, Illinois]] November 1, 1911,&lt;ref name=sessler/&gt; the son of Herman Samuel Kerst and Lillian E Wetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.kerst/43/mb.ashx |title=Obituary - Dr. Donald William KERST 1911–1993 |publisher=Ancestry.com |accessdate=October 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in 1934, and then his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in 1937,&lt;ref name="Physics Today"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Symon |first=Keith R. |authorlink=Keith Symon |last2=Koch |first2=H.

Kerst |accessdate=May 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This involved building and testing a 2.3 [[Electron volt|MeV]] generator for experiments with the scattering of [[proton]]s.&lt;ref name="Physics Today"/&gt;

==Betatron==
After graduation, Kerst worked at [[General Electric Company]] for a year, working on the development of [[x-ray tube]]s and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]], where the head of the physics department, [[Francis Wheeler Loomis|F. Wheeler Loomis]] encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better [[particle accelerator]].&lt;ref name="Physics Today"/&gt; The result of these efforts was the [[betatron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerst | first1 = D.

It took longer to name the device. Colleagues suggested names such as the German  "Ausserordentlichhochgeschwindigkeitelektronenentwickelndenschwerarbeitsbeigollitron". In December 1941 Kerst decided on "betatron", using the Greek letter "beta", which was the symbol for electrons, and "tron" meaning "instrument for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.library.illinois.edu/blog/donald-kerst-and-the-betatron/ |title="A Very Bold and Original Device": Donald Kerst and the Betatron |first=Bethany |last=Anderson |publisher=University of Illinois |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=October 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to build more betatrons of increasing energy, a 20 MeV machine in 1941, an 80 MeV in 1948, and a 340 MeV machine, which was completed in 1950.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Gets Betatron"/&gt;

The betatron would influence all subsequent accelerators. Its success was due to a thorough understanding of the physics involved, and painstaking design of the magnets, vacuum pumps and power supply.&lt;ref name=sessler/&gt; In 1941, he teamed up with [[Robert Serber]] to provide the first theoretical analysis of the [[Betatron oscillations|oscillations]] that occur in a betatron.&lt;ref name=sessler/&gt;&lt;ref name="elorb"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerst | first1 = D.

==World War II==
[[File:Los-Alamos-Water-Boiler-LANL12784.jpg|thumb|right|The Water Boiler, an [[aqueous homogeneous reactor]] at the Los Alamos Laboratory, was the first reactor to use [[enriched uranium]] as a fuel]]
During [[World War II]], Kerst took a leave of absence from the University of Illinois to work on the development of the betatron with the engineering staff at [[General Electric]] in 1940 and 1941. They designed 20 MeV and 100 MeV versions of the betatron, and he supervised the construction of the former, which he brought back to the University of Illinois with him. He also designed a portable 4 MeV betatron for inspecting [[dud]] bombs.&lt;ref name=sessler/&gt;

Kerst's engineering and physics background placed him near the top of the list of scientists that [[Robert Oppenheimer]] recruited for the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], which was set up to design the [[atomic bomb]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=82}} In August 1943, Kerst was placed in charge of the Laboratory's P-7 Group, which was  responsible for designing and building the Water Boiler,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=185}}&lt;ref name="Physics Today"/&gt; a [[nuclear reactor]] intended to serve as a laboratory instrument to test [[critical mass]] calculations and the effect of various [[neutron reflector|tamper]] materials.  Primarily drawn from [[Purdue University]], his group included Charles P. Baker, [[Gerhart Friedlander]], Lindsay Helmholtz, [[Marshall Holloway]], and [[Raemer Schreiber]].  [[Robert F. Christy]] provided help with the theoretical calculations.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=199–203}}

Kerst designed an [[aqueous homogeneous reactor]] in which [[enriched uranium]] in the form of soluble [[uranium sulfate]], was dissolved in water, and surrounded by a [[beryllium oxide]] neutron reflector. It was the first reactor to employ enriched uranium as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=199–203}}

The Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized in August 1944 to concentrate on creating an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=245–247}} Studying implosion on a large scale, or even a full scale, required special diagnostic methods. As early as November 1943, Kerst suggested using a betatron employing 20 MeV [[gamma rays]] instead of x-rays to study implosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=154–157}} In the August 1944 reorganization, he became joint head, with [[Seth Neddermeyer]], of the G-5 Group, part of [[Robert Bacher]]'s G (Gadget) Division specifically charged with betatron testing. Oppenheimer had the 20 MeV betatron at the University of Illinois shipped to Los Alamos, where it arrived in December. On January 15, 1945, the G-5 Group took their first betatron pictures of an implosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=274–277}}

==Later life==
Kerst returned to the University of Illinois after the war. From 1953 to 1957 he was technical director of the [[Midwestern Universities Research Association]], where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the [[FFAG accelerator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

His team devised and analysed beam stacking, a process of radio frequency acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators.&lt;ref name="Physics Today"/&gt;

'''Emmett Lathrop''' "'''Doc'''" '''Brown''', '''Ph.D.''', is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future trilogy]]'' in which he is the inventor of the first [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]], built out of a [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]] sports car. The character is portrayed by [[Christopher Lloyd]] in all three films, as well as in the live action sequences of the [[Back to the Future: the Animated Series|animated series]]. He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] in the animated series. The character's appearance and mannerisms are loosely inspired by [[Leopold Stokowski]] and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=q&amp;a&gt;Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale Q&amp;A, ''Back to the Future'' [2002 DVD], recorded at the [[University of Southern California]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dr. Emmett Brown was selected by ''[[Empire Magazine|Empire]]'' magazine as one of ''The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time'', ranking at #20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=76 |title=''Empire's'' The 100 Greatest Movie Characters |publisher=''Empire'' Magazine |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Emmett refers to himself as "a student of all sciences" and is depicted as a talented inventor. His homes in 1985, 1955, and 1885 are shown to contain various labor-saving gadgets.

He appears to be heavily influenced by scientists of previous eras, naming successive pet dogs [[Copernicus (Back to the Future)|Copernicus]] and [[Einstein (Back to the Future)|Einstein]], and having portraits of [[Isaac Newton]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Albert Einstein]] in his laboratory. His favorite author is [[Jules Verne]] and his family name was originally "[[Wernher von Braun|von Braun]]" before [[World War I]].

Emmett's family moved to Hill Valley from Germany  in  1908. Although initially [[wealth]]y because of his inheritance, he spent his entire family fortune on his time travel project. When the Brown mansion was destroyed by fire in 1962 and the property sold to developers, Doc subsequently resided in the mansion's garage. Once broke, he established a privately owned business to offer 24-hour scientific services, building ingenious devices for his customers.

Emmett's work appears to be highly regarded, enough for him to win an award for his work. However, he is shown as [[absent-minded professor|absent-minded]] at times, and various statements by other characters inhabiting Hill Valley indicate that he is generally regarded as strange, eccentric, or [[Insanity|insane]]. Being very loud and sprightly, he often speaks with wide-eyed expressions and broad gestures ("[[Great Scott]]!" being one of his well-known catchphrases) and tends to be [[Verbosity|overly verbose]] in his delivery, referring in one case to a school dance as a "rhythmic ceremonial ritual".

Doc and Marty met several years prior to the events of the first time travel experiment when Marty, out of curiosity, sneaked into Doc's lab after being warned by his parents to stay away from him. Happy to be revered as 'cool', Doc hired Marty as his part-time lab assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/28526/back-future-co-creator-bob-gale-explains-how-marty-and-doc-became-friends |title=How Marty McFly and Doc Brown Became Friends |last=English |first=Jason |date=16 August 2011 |access-date=17 July 2018 |work=[[Mental Floss]] |publisher=[[Felix Dennis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original timeline, in contrast with Marty's [[Shyness|shy]] and unassertive father, George McFly, Doc is a supportive and open-minded mentor for Marty. Doc's positive influence in turn allows Marty to mentor George in 1955, which appears to encourage George's later success as a novelist, and help him become a better husband and father. One line in particular, "If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything," originates from Doc. Marty repeats it to George in 1955, who repeats it back to Marty in the post time travel 1985.

Doc has been involved with illegal and criminal enterprises (albeit as a means to obtain items for his inventions he could not purchase legally) but he is [[Naivety|naive]] and care-free about the consequences of his actions. He excitedly tells Marty how he cheated [[Libya]]n [[Terrorism|terrorists]] out of stolen [[plutonium]]: "They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and, in turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used [[pinball machine]] parts!"

Despite being intelligent and logical for the most part, Doc is somewhat naive at times about the unknown possible uses of his time machine, initially actively explores the course of the world's future and tries to alter the past or future of the principal characters to improve their lives. However, events lead him to conclude that time travel is too dangerous for humankind. His conviction initially strengthened when he realizes that he has unwittingly altered history by preventing the death of Clara Clayton in 1885; he concludes that the time machine has "caused nothing but disaster" and asks Marty to destroy it once he returns to his own time. Nonetheless, Doc pursues a romantic relationship with Clara despite the risks of further disrupting the timeline.

However, after having been left behind in 1885 when Marty departs in the DeLorean for 1985, Doc starts a family with Clara; the couple have two sons, Jules and Verne. He eventually builds another time machine out of a steam locomotive, and the Browns return to 1985 in order to pick up Einstein before setting out for another adventure.

==Early life==
Born in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], Holland never knew her father and was raped at age eleven.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Endesha_Ida_Mae_Holland.aspx|title=Endesha Ida Mae Holland profile|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later she was expelled from school and became a prostitute.&lt;ref name="mswritersandmusicians1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/writers/endesha-holland.html|title=Endesha Ida Mae Holland, Mississippi writer and playwright|publisher=Mswritersandmusicians.com|accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SNCC==
Upon hearing that members of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) had come to Greenwood, Holland sought out one of the male members in hopes of soliciting him for prostitution.  The man, however, led her directly to the committee's office hoping to convince her to become involved.  On witnessing the office operations, Holland found herself deeply impressed by the sight of African-Americans conducting themselves in such a businesslike manner and she began volunteering there.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mswritersandmusicians1"/&gt;

Holland's mother adamantly opposed her involvement with the SNCC, fearing reprisals from members of Greenwood's white community.  In 1965 a fire broke out in the family's home, killing Holland's mother; Holland said afterward that she believed the [[Ku Klux Klan]] had indeed firebombed the house in retaliation for her civil rights work. In all, she was jailed thirteen times for her civil rights work. She got a high school equivalency diploma, encouraged by her colleagues in the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt; She studied at the [[University of Minnesota]] beginning that year, where she helped start an African-American studies department, and initiated Women Helping Offenders (WHO), a prison-aid program.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mswritersandmusicians1"/&gt;

==Education==
In 1979 she earned a bachelor's degree in African-American studies from the [[University of Minnesota]], followed by a master's in American Studies in 1984 and a PhD. in American studies in 1986.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt;

In 1981 she was awarded the $1,000 National [[Lorraine Hansberry]] Award for the second-best play of 1981.&lt;ref name="mswritersandmusicians1"/&gt; In 1983, she took Endesha as her first name in order to honor her African heritage.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt; She taught at the [[State University of New York, Buffalo]] from 1985 to 1993. She was a professor of theater at the [[University of Southern California]], retiring in 2003. She died from complications of [[ataxia]].&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt;

==Arts==
She was the author of six plays, and was most famous for writing ''From the Mississippi Delta'', which was performed by the [[Negro Ensemble Company]] at the [[Goodman Theater]] in Chicago and at the [[Young Vic]] in London. She also wrote a memoir of the same name, published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt;

A 1998 short documentary, ''Dr. Endesha Ida Mae Holland'', was made about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0168711|title=Endesha Ida Mae Holland profile|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was interviewed as part of the 1994 feature documentary film ''[[Freedom on My Mind]]''.

==Family life==
Holland was married three times, each union ended in divorce.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt;

'''Eva Dickson''' ([[Steninge Slott]], [[Sigtuna]], 8 March 1905 – [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], March 1938), born Eva Lindström, was a Swedish [[explorer]], [[rally driver]], [[aviator]] and travel writer. She was the first woman to have crossed the [[Sahara]] desert by car. She was perhaps the first female rally driver in Sweden (1925), and the third Swedish female aviator (1923).

==Biography==
Eva Dickson was the daughter of the wealthy Albert Lindström, who managed stud farms for [[horse breeding]], and his wife Maria. In 1925 she married the rally driver Olof Dickson, great-grandson of [[James Dickson (merchant)|James Dickson]], but they divorced in 1932 as he didn't agree to her travels. Her travels attracted great attention, and she published several travel guides and descriptions of her experiences. She financed her travels by making bets with various wealthy society people.

In 1932 she met Baron [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke]] – the former spouse of ''[[Out of Africa]]'' author, [[Karen Blixen]]. They met in [[Kenya]] and soon became lovers. After her meeting with Blixen in 1932, she took a bet and drove by car from [[Nairobi]] to [[Stockholm]] in 1932, thus becoming the first woman to have crossed the Sahara by car.&lt;ref name=PopHist&gt;[http://www.popularhistoria.se/artiklar/aventyraren-eva-dickson/ Populär Historia, 23 januari, 2009: ''Äventyraren Eva Dickson''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220001637/http://www.popularhistoria.se/artiklar/aventyraren-eva-dickson/ |date=20 February 2014 }} (in Swedish) Linked 2014-04-06&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 she was back in Kenya with Bror Blixen, where she participated in various scientific expeditions. The following year they both travelled to [[Ethiopia]], where she covered the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] as a [[war correspondent]] for ''The Weekly Journal''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220001637/http://www.popularhistoria.se/artiklar/aventyraren-eva-dickson/|title=Äventyraren Eva Dickson {{!}} Populär Historia|date=2014-02-20|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a Swedish newspaper. They left Ethiopia on [[mule]]s, on a 2,000 kilometre trip back to Kenya.&lt;ref name= PopHist/&gt;

In 1936, the couple married in [[New York City]] and spent their honeymoon sailing around [[Cuba]] and the [[Bahamas]] with friends [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Martha Gellhorn]].&lt;ref name= PopHist/&gt; The trip ended with the couple visiting Hemingway at his hometown of Key West.

On 3 June 1937, she started a car trip from [[Stockholm]] to [[Beijing]] via the [[Silk Road]]. To become the first person to drive the Silk Road had long been her big dream, and something she wanted to do before settling down with Bror in Kenya.&lt;ref name= PopHist/&gt; Driving without any companions, the trip took her through [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]] and [[Iran]]. After having reached [[Afghanistan]], she was advised to detour via [[India]], as her intended route was regarded too dangerous for a lone woman. When she reached [[Calcutta]], she was taken ill and treated with a cure of arsenic in a hospital, which worsened her condition.&lt;ref name= PopHist/&gt;

While in Calcutta she realised that she was running out of money. She also learned the news of the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] and realised that her planned route to China was now impossible and she had to give up her plans to reach Beijing. Although weak after her hospital spell, she decided to drive back to Europe.&lt;ref name= PopHist/&gt; When she reached [[Baghdad]] in [[Iraq]] in March 1938, her trip had been going on for nine months. After a dinner one evening outside Baghdad at some friends' house, she was driving back to her hotel, but lost control over the car in a steep curve and crashed. She died immediately. Her husband, Bror von Blixen, was immediately telegraphed about her death, but he was out on a safari and didn't get the telegram until he came back to Nairobi on 28 July 1938. By then her body had already been transported to Stockholm, where she was buried on 22 April 1938.&lt;ref name= PopHist/&gt;

[[Oba of Benin|Oba]] '''Ewuare''' (also Ewuare the Great or Ewuare I,a great king) was the king of the [[Benin Empire]] from 1440 until 1473.  Ewuare became king in a violent coup against his brother Uwaifiokun which destroyed much of [[Benin City]].  After the war, Ewuare rebuilt much of the city of Benin, reformed political structures in the kingdom, greatly expanded the territory of the kingdom, and fostered the arts and festivals.  He left a significant legacy and is often considered the first King of the [[Benin Empire]].

==Rise to power==
[[File:Benin Empire sphere of influence.PNG|thumb|The size of the Benin Empire at its height.  Borders are modern states of Nigeria.]]
Prior to Ewuare, the Oba of Benin was limited in their power and authority by the ''uzama'', a group of hereditary chieftains throughout the kingdom.  The ''uzama'' were able to appoint the Oba of Benin upon the death of an Oba and could limit any efforts by the Oba.&lt;ref name=Ryder&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryder|first=A.F.C.|title=General History of Africa: Africa from the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century|year=1981|publisher=UNESCO|location=Paris|pages=339–370|editor=D.T. Niane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shillington&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of African History|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=New York|edition=Vol. I|editor=Kevin Shillington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of Ewuare to a position of power is chronicled by various different oral folktales and his lineage and specifics of his rise are disputed.&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;  The general tale starts with Ewuare being born as the eldest son to [[Ohen]].  At this point, Ewuare was known by the name Prince Ogun.&lt;ref name=Eweka&gt;{{cite book|last=Eweka|first=Iro|title=Dawn to Dusk: Folktales from Benin|year=1998|publisher=Frank Cass Publishing|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A controversy arose upon the death of Ohun when the ''uzama'' appointed his younger brother Uwaifaikon as the Oba and exiled Prince Ogun.&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;  Ogun then traveled widely throughout the region during his exile vising many different kingdoms.&lt;ref name=Asante&gt;{{cite book|last=Asante|first=Molefi|title=The History of Africa|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A.F.C. Ryder contends that it is possible that Ewuare was an outside military leader and that the lineage story was created to establish legitimacy of his rule.&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;  Local historian Jacob Egharevba, in contrast, says that after the death of Orobiru, both Ogun and Uwaifaikon were banished from the city, but then Uwaifaikon was able to return, lied to the uzama, and was named king.&lt;ref name=Egharevba&gt;{{cite book|last=Egharevba|first=Jacob|title=A Short History of Benin|year=1960|publisher=Ibadan University Press|location=Ibadan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular oral history contends that while Prince Ogun was exiled he performed a favor for a jungle spirit and as a result got a magic bag, called ''Agbavboko''.  Agbavboko had the magical qualities that no matter what Ogun put into the bag, it had more space and whenever he reached in he could pull out whatever he desired.&lt;ref name=Eweka /&gt;  During his travels, he gathered significant magical and herbal knowledge from a variety of sources.  At one point, he felt the need to sleep under the sacred [[Iroko|''uloko'']] tree and the tree told him to return to Benin City and reclaim the throne.&lt;ref name=Eweka /&gt;  On his way back to the city, he removed an infected thorn from a lion's paw and the lion gave him a magic [[Talisman]] which he could use to create any situation in the world he desired.  He arrived in Benin City surprised to find a parade for his brother Uwaifaikon while the people were in destitute circumstances.&lt;ref name=Eweka /&gt;  Prince Ogun used the talisman to set large parts of the city on fire.  He then reached into ''Agbavboko'' and pulled out a bow with a poison arrow which he then used to assassinate Uwaifaikon.  In the confusion that ensued, he hid with a slave, named Edo, that had taken care of him when he was young and who recognized him immediately in the chaos.  Supporters of Uwaifaikon entered Edo's house and killed him trying to find Ohun who had hidden.  Ogun then exited the house and gathered his supporters and was able to assert his right to the throne.&lt;ref name=Eweka /&gt;  In Egharevba's version, during a visit to the city during his exile, Ogun was taken in by a prominent chief who hid him in a dried well but then went to tell the authorities.  The head slave of the chief, named Edo, let down a ladder into the well and advised Ewuare to escape.&lt;ref name=Egharevba /&gt;

Ogun then took the name Ewuare meaning "the trouble has ceased".&lt;ref name=Egharevba /&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Noelle|title=International Dictionary of Historical Places: Middle East and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=Chicago, IL|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the honorific ''Ogidigan'' (the Great) was appended and he is often known as Ewuare Ogidigan or Ewuare the Great.&lt;ref name=Bradbury /&gt;  The date for his rise to the throne is not precisely clear but is usually dated to 1440.&lt;ref name=Asante /&gt;  To honor the slave that had sacrificed his life to save his, Ewuare also renamed the city to Edo (now Benin City).&lt;ref name=Eweka /&gt;

==Rule==
[[File:Ancient Benin city.JPG|thumb|Depiction of Benin City (1668)- Many features, the large walls, the moat, and the palace were directed by Ewuare]]
Ewuare is often considered a key state-reformer and crucial in many aspects of state formation in the [[Benin empire]].&lt;ref name=Bradbury&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=R.E.|title=Man in Africa|year=1969|publisher=Tavistock|location=London|pages=17–36|editor=Mary Douglas &amp; Phyllis M. Kaberry|chapter=Patrimonialism and Gerontocracy in Benin Political Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He consolidated the power of the Oba, changed lineage procedures, and created an administrative structure for the Empire.  In addition, he greatly expanded the empire and took over a significant territory.

A major administrative development undertaken by Ewuare was reducing the power of the ''uzama'' chiefs which were a limiting force on the Oba.  Ewuare removed their ability to appoint the Oba and instead adopted a clear succession going to the first-born son.  In adopting this [[primogeniture]] lineage system, the authority of the ''uzama'' was greatly decreased.&lt;ref name=Shillington /&gt;  In addition, to clarify the situation, Ewuare developed the ''Edaiken'' title for the oldest son to clearly establish the lineage.  One oral history dates this development to a situation in the city of Uselu.  The chief of Uselu, Iken, had become an ally to Ewuare.  At one point, another city was revolting against Ewuare's rule and Iken mobilized an army to end the revolt.  Because he did not have anyone to rule Uselu, Ewuare sent his oldest son Kuoboyuwa to serve in the town until the war was over.  Iken died in the fighting and since he had no heir, Kuoboyuwa became the ruler.  This incident created a clear succession to the oldest son of the king with the title ''Edaiken'' derived from the incident.&lt;ref name=Egharevba /&gt;

Ewuare also created two additional layers of administration in towns and villages with the creation of the ''Eghabho n'ore'' (town chiefs) and ''Eghabho n'ogbe'' (palace chiefs).&lt;ref name=Bradbury /&gt;  These acted as administrative arms, directly appointed and accountable to the Oba, who would collect tribute, deal with legal issues, and generally take part of the affairs of state.  To foster this, Ewuare encouraged the freeborn population to work in the palace for small wages as part of these different orders.&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;

In addition, Ewuare was successful at taking over a number of cities and towns in the region for expanding the empire.  He personally led the army against many of the [[Edo people|Edo]] communities, living west of the Niger river, and key Yoruba settlements like [[Akure]] and [[Owo, Nigeria|Owo]].&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;  In towns that he took over, he quickly replaced the ruling elite with chiefs of his administrative system who were his allies.  Oral history recount 201 victories by Ewuare over the various cities and towns creating a large empire centered in Edo.&lt;ref name=Asante /&gt;

The capital city of the empire was rebuilt during Ewuare with significant redesign.  Around Benin City (then Edo), Ewuare built significant walls and moats, large boulevards within the city, and clearly divided zones for different craft work.&lt;ref name=Bradbury /&gt;  Archeological evidence has found that the walls built around the palace and the city, and even out into the country, were significant constructions taking multiple years to complete.&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;  In addition, he rebuilt the palace and created a clear division between it and the rest of the capital city.  The division was further emphasized through the introduction by Ewuare of [[scarification]] for freeborn citizens to differentiate them from the slave population.&lt;ref name=Bradbury /&gt;  Egharevba establishes a different source of the scarification that developed in the Kingdom.  Oral histories used by Egharevba suggest that during his reign, his oldest son Kuoboyuwa (the ruler of Iken) and his second son Ezuwarha (who had become the ruler of Iyowa).  The two brothers became rivals and ended up poisoning each other causing Ewuare to go into significant mourning.  In his sorrow, Ewuare passed a law prohibiting sex in the kingdom for three years which resulted in many members of the kingdom migrating to other areas.  Ewuare overturned the law but because few migrants returned, he told all neighboring states to refuse to give entry to his citizens and developed the scarification practice to allow clear identification of their citizens.&lt;ref name=Egharevba /&gt;

==Contact with the Portuguese==
Ewuare was the Oba of the Benin empire when the Portuguese explorer [[Ruy de Sequeira]] arrived in 1472.  It is unclear whether he went into the city, but contacts between the Portuguese and the Oba were initiated.&lt;ref name=Egharevba /&gt;  This established limited trade between the two empires, to be expanded greatly starting in the 1480s.&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;

==Arts and celebration==
[[File:Benin, testa commemorativa di re oba, fine XVIII sec.JPG|thumb|A Benin Bronze head for display at a shrine to the Obas, a tradition started under Ewuare]]
Ewuare greatly expanded [[Benin art|the arts in Benin]] during his reign and was aided greatly in this through increased trade.  Ewuare is generally credited with expanding ivory and wood carving in the empire and the creation of Bronze heads for shrines to deceased Obas.&lt;ref name=Ben-Amos&gt;{{cite book|last=Ben-Amos|first=Paula|title=Art Innovation, and Politics in Eighteenth Century Benin|year=1999|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ewuare began many of the royal decoration traditions involving coral.&lt;ref name=Ben-Amos /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/benin/oba Art Institute of Chicago: Kings and Rituals: Court Arts from Nigeria].&lt;/ref&gt;

In both folktales and artistic representations, Ewuare is considered someone with significant magical powers.&lt;ref name=Ben-Amos /&gt;  His herbal and magical knowledge is attested to in a number of significant art work from the era. Crucial in this is the creation during Ewuare of the Igue festival, which was originally celebrated as a festival to renew his magical powers.&lt;ref name=Ryder /&gt;  One oral history says that the date of the [[Igue festival]] was set initially to the marriage between Ewuare and a wife named Ewere.&lt;ref name=Egharevba /&gt; He is also said to have founded the Ugie Erha Ọba festival which honored the Obas.&lt;ref name=Ben-Amos32&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art of Benin Revised Edition|last=Ben-Amos |first=Paula Girshick  |year=1995 |publisher=British Museum Press |isbn=0-7141-2520-2 |pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and lineage==
Details about his death are not generally known but Egharevba says that he was buried at Esi, near the town of Edo ([[Benin City]]).&lt;ref name=Egharevba /&gt; His first remaining son, Ezoti, died from assassination and his second son, Olua, ruled for a short period and was replaced when the ''uzama'' revolted.  His third son, [[Ozolua]] became Oba around 1483 and ruled until 1514.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;   The royal lineage from Ewuare would continue for multiple generations.

'''Franz Joseph Emil Fischer''' (19 March 1877 in [[Freiburg|Freiburg im Breisgau]] – 1 December 1947 in [[Munich]]) was a [[German people|German]] [[chemist]]. He was founder and first director of the [[ Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research]]. He is known for the discovery of the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]].&lt;ref name="Pichler"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1002/cber.19671000642| title = Franz Fischer 1877–1947| journal = Chemische Berichte| volume = 100| issue = 6| pages = CXXVII-CLVII| year = 1967| last1 = Pichler| first1 = Helmut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

In 1925 He and [[Hans Tropsch]] discovered the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]], that allow to produce liquid hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen with metal catalyst at temperatures of 150–300 °C (302–572 °F).

In 1930 He and Hans Schrader developed the [[Fischer Assay]], a standardized laboratory test for determining the oil yield from [[oil shale]] to be expected from a conventional [[shale oil extraction]].&lt;ref name=heistand&gt;

'''Herbert McGolfin Shelton''' (October 6, 1895&amp;nbsp;– January 1, 1985)&lt;ref name=life&gt;Oswald, Jean A. (1989). ''Yours for Health: The Life and Times of Herbert M. Shelton''. Franklin Books. {{ISBN|9780962049002}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[naturopath]], [[alternative medicine]] advocate, author, [[pacifism|pacifist]], [[vegetarian]], and a supporter of [[raw foodism|rawism]] and [[fasting]]. Shelton was nominated by the [[American Vegetarian Party]] to run as its candidate for President of the United States in 1956. He saw himself as the champion of original [[Orthopathy|natural hygiene]] ideas from the 1830s. His ideas have been described as [[quackery]] by critics.&lt;ref name="Butler 1992"&gt;Butler, Kurt. (1992). ''A Consumer's Guide to "Alternative Medicine": A Close Look at Homeopathy, Acupuncture, Faith-healing, and Other Unconventional Treatments''. Prometheus Books. pp. 13-14. {{ISBN|0-87975-733-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raso 1993"&gt;Raso, Jack. (1993). ''Vitalistic Gurus and Their Legacies''. In [[Stephen Barrett]]. ''The Health Robbers: A Close Look at Quackery in America''. Prometheus Books. pp. 236-240. {{ISBN|0-87975-855-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shelton was born on October 6, 1895 in [[Wylie, Texas]] to Thomas Mitchell Shelton and Mary Frances Gutherie Shelton, who were devoted Christians. As a child, Shelton took an interest in animals, especially their habits when sick as compared to when well. He was especially intrigued by their fasting when the farm animals became sick.&lt;ref name="soilandhealth.org"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bidwell | first = Victoria | title = Timeline for the Life &amp; Hard Times of Dr. Shelton |  publisher = Soil and Health Library | url = http://www.soilandhealth.org/02/0201hyglibcat/shelton.bio.bidwell.htm  | accessdate = 2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Shelton attended [[Bernarr Macfadden|Bernarr Macfadden's]] College of Physcultopathy in [[Chicago]] and interned at Crane's Sanatorium in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]]. He also attended Lindlahr College of Natural Therapeutics for post-graduate work and served at Lindlahr's and Sahler's Sanatoriums. Shelton later continued post-graduate work at Peerless College of Chiropractic in [[Illinois]] and served an internship at Crandall Health School in [[Pennsylvania]].

In 1921, he married Ida Pape, studied at the American School of Chiropractic, and graduated from the American School of Naturopathy with a [[Naturopathy|Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine]]. Shelton claimed that cooking food denatures it, and that a healthy body has the ability to restore itself from illness without medical intervention. Although heavily criticized by his contemporaries for advocating fasting over medical treatment, Shelton's work served as an early influence for the raw food movement.&lt;ref name="Butler 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raso 1993"/&gt;

In 1922, Shelton self-published his first book, ''Fundamentals of Nature Cure.'' Seeing importance in the Hygienic Movement (created in 1832 by Dr. Isaac Jennings and [[Sylvester Graham]]), he changed the title of this first book to ''An Introduction to Natural Hygiene.'' 

==Legal history==

A pacifist, Shelton was jailed in 1917 for making an anti-draft statement in public during the height of [[World War I]].

In 1927, Shelton was arrested, jailed, and fined three times for practicing medicine without a license. These arrests continued periodically through the next three decades. Shelton was jailed repeatedly for [[practicing medicine without a license]]. He was found guilty of violating the Medical Practice Act in 1932, and served 30 days on [[Rikers Island]].

In 1942, Shelton was charged with negligent homicide and "treating and offering to treat a human being without a state medical license" for starving a patient to death.&lt;ref name="soilandhealth.org" /&gt; The case was never tried and the charges were later dropped.

In 1978, another patient died at one of his schools, this time of an apparent heart attack. After a two-year-long court battle, Shelton lost the lawsuit for negligence and was bankrupted by the judgment.&lt;ref name="soilandhealth.org" /&gt; His school was forced to close as a result.

==Death==
By 1972, at the age of 77, Shelton became bedridden from a degenerative neuro-muscular disease believed to be [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="soilandhealth.org"/&gt;  He died thirteen years later, unable to improve his own health despite many attempts. His peers were shocked to see him unable to walk, speak normally, or write.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

Towards the end of his life, Shelton continued his involvement in Dr. Shelton's Health School. In the time that the school was in operation, over 40,000 people were treated for various ailments, with most recovering with the help of [[water fasting]]. The school operated for 53 years, closing in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthscience.org/heritage/natural-hygiene-movement/dr-herbert-shelton/dr-sheltons-health-school|title=Dr. Shelton's Health School {{!}} National Health Association|website=www.healthscience.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, four years after his death, a biography of Shelton called ''Yours for Health: The Life and Times of Herbert M. Shelton,'' was published by Jean A. Oswald.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

'''John Howard Coble''' (March 18, 1931 – November 3, 2015) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|NC|6}}, serving from 1985 to 2015. He was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district includes all or portions of ten counties in the northern-central part of the state, including portions of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]].

==Early life, education, and pre-political career==
Coble was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], the son of Johnnie E. (Holt) and Joseph Howard Coble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/coble.htm|title=coble|work=ancestry.com|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, he initially attended [[Appalachian State University]], but after a year joined the [[United States Coast Guard]], serving for over 5 years and staying on as a reservist for an additional 18 years. Upon discharging from military service, he attended [[Guilford College]], from which he received a history degree. He was a member of the Epsilon Iota Chapter of [[Pi Kappa Phi]] fraternity at [[The University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]. Coble then moved on to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and earned a degree in law.

After graduating from college, Coble first worked as an insurance agent. He then spent nearly 20 years as a practicing attorney, and he was also Secretary of Revenue under North Carolina Governor [[James Holshouser]]. In 1979, Coble was elected to the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]], serving until his election to Congress.

===Elections===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2012#District 6}}
Coble was first elected to Congress in 1984, narrowly defeating Walter Cockerham in the primary 51%–49%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=66122|title=Our Campaigns – NC District 6 – R Primary Race – May 08, 1984|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election, he defeated one-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] incumbent [[Robin Britt]] 51%–49%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52123|title=Our Campaigns – NC District 6 Race – Nov 06, 1984|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coble was likely the beneficiary of long coattails from [[Ronald Reagan]], who carried the district by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. In 1986, he defeated Britt in a rematch, which was an even closer 50.03%–49.97% and Coble won by only 79 votes (closest margin of victory that year). He would never face another contest nearly that close, and would be reelected 13 more times with 61% or more of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1404|title=Our Campaigns – Candidate – J. Howard Coble|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, Coble won the Republican primary unopposed and became North Carolina's longest-serving Republican U.S. congressman, surpassing former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Broyhill]] (who was also elected to 12 terms but left the House in July 1986 to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat). Coble announced in 2013 that he would not run for another term in [[United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2014|2014]], and would retire after 30 years in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/rep-howard-coble-r-n-c-to-retire/|title=Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.) to retire|author=Aaron Blake|date=7 November 2013|work=Washington Post|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
In the [[105th Congress|105th United States Congress]] Coble moved to suspend the rules and pass the [[NET Act]] on November 4, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of copyright violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r105:2:./temp/~r105t9SOlO:e46:|title=Weekend Maintenance – Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR02265:@@@Z|title=Weekend Maintenance – Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coble was a strong supporter of agriculture and had voted in favor of bills to protect agriculture. Coble opposed further regulation of [[tobacco]] because he believed it would hurt North Carolina tobacco planters.

Coble took a hard-line position on illegal drugs, and co-sponsored a resolution to oppose the legalization and use of [[medical marijuana]].&lt;ref name="Govtrack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hj105-117|title=Expressing the sense of Congress that marijuana is a dangerous and addictive drug and should not be legalized for medicinal use. (1998; 105th Congress H.J.Res. 117) – GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also voted for an amendment to authorize [[drug testing]] on federal employees.&lt;ref name="Govtrack" /&gt; However, he authored a resolution to celebrate the passage of [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], which repealed the Prohibition of [[alcoholic beverages]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Govtrack" /&gt; Coble was also a member of the [[Tea Party Caucus]], joining [[Sue Myrick]] and [[Walter B. Jones]] as the sole members of the North Carolina Congressional delegation to join the group.

Coble pledged not to receive any pension from the [[United States government]].  He told [[CBS]] ''[[Up to the Minute]]'', "I figured taxpayers pay my salary – not a bad salary, and I figure that's sufficient.  Let me fend for myself after the salary's collected." He also stated to CBS, "I've pledged my assurance I won't take the pension. That's between my constituents and me. As far as convicted felons, I guess that's between their constituents and themselves."  He was one of two Congressmen, with [[Ron Paul]], to have pledged to decline his pension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/22/eveningnews/main6011719.shtml |title=Pensions Follow Ex-Lawmakers to Prison |work=CBS News |date=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during the government shutdown in October 2013.  Coble said that although 800,000 federal workers are furloughed and not receiving a paycheck, he will still collect his salary due to a requirement of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/03/cnn-keeps-count-congress-gets-paid-but-whos-keeping-their-paycheck/?hpt=hp_t1 |title=CNN Keeps Count... |work=CNN |date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coble was one of the 87 Republicans who voted for the bill to end the shutdown on October 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/congress-votes-to-end-shutdown/house.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Coble announced introduction of new legislation to reform the [[congressional pension]] program. Coble refused to participate in the congressional pension program, stating that reforming congressional pensions was long overdue and that the bill would lengthen the time of service required before a member would be eligible for participation in the pension program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coble.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=339584 |title=High Point Enterprise praises Coble pension bill |date=June 18, 2013 |website=house.gov |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=16 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221204512/http://coble.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=339584 |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation sponsored===
The bill [[To extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 years (H.R. 3626; 113th Congress)]] was introduced in the House on December 2, 2013 by Coble.&lt;ref name=3626allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3626 – All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3626/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would extend the [[Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988]] for an additional 10 years, but would not expand any of its provisions (related to plastic guns).&lt;ref name=foxnewsHousevotes&gt;{{cite news|title=House votes to renew ban on plastic firearms|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/03/house-to-vote-on-banning-plastic-firearms/?intcmp=latestnews|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Foxnews.com|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the House on December 3, 2013.

==Personal life==
As a young man, Coble frequently enjoyed eating a breakfast of Rose brand pork brains in milk gravy and eggs. According to a quote from Coble appearing alongside his family recipe for "Breakfast Brains N' Eggs," the breakfast was "fairly regular" and "not at all unusual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coble|first1=Howard|title=Favorite Breakfast "Brains N' Eggs"|url=http://virtualcities.com/ons/nc/gov/ncgvhc1.htm|website=Congress Cooks!|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coble was a member of the [[Guilford College]] Board of Visitors and of the [[U.S. Coast Guard Academy]] Board of Visitors.

He was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and member of Guilford Lodge number 656 in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = Ric |date=July–August 2012 | title = Masonic Hero Gets Rites at Reburial | journal = The North Carolina Mason | volume = 137 | number = 4 | pages = Page 5, 8 | location = Raleigh, NC, USA | publisher = Grand Lodge of A.F.&amp;A.M. of North Carolina | format = PDF |accessdate=September 11, 2012 | url = http://www.epageflip.net/title/5206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coble had skin cancer for many years among other ailments. He was admitted to intensive care in September 2015 after complications from skin cancer surgery. He died in hospital on November 3, 2015, in Greensboro, North Carolina at the age of 84 from complications of the surgery.&lt;ref name="WNCN 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former NC Congressman Howard Coble dies at 84|url=http://wncn.com/2015/11/04/former-nc-congressman-howard-coble-dies-at-84/|accessdate=4 November 2015|publisher=WNCN|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/04/former-nc-congressman-howard-coble-dies/75149712/|title=Former U.S. Rep.

Coble's death was followed one week later by the passing of a Democratic former colleague, [[Tim Valentine]] of [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district]].

'''María Magdalena Nile del Río''' (26 December 1910&lt;ref&gt;{{cinenacional name|id=513|name=Imperio Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 22 August 2003) was an Argentine professional singer and movie actress, better known as '''Imperio Argentina'''; she became a citizen of [[Spain]] in 1999.

María Magdalena Nile del Río was born to Antonio Nile (a guitar player, born in [[Gibraltar]]) and Rosario del Río (a native of [[Monda]] in the [[Province of Málaga]]). She performed onstage in her native Argentina, where she had a long and successful career. At that time, her stage name was ''Pettit Imperio''. But her most successful moments came after she moved to Spain. It was there that she changed her name to ''Imperio Argentina'', as a way to honor her "other country". While in Spain, del Río participated in many movies, and she participated frequently in television and radio. She obtained Spanish citizenship in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Imperio-Argentina|title=Imperio Argentina &amp;#124; Argentine-Spanish actress and singer|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In January 2003, she suffered an angina attack and was admitted to the University Hospital of Malaga. She died in [[Benalmádena]] in the Province of Málaga (her mother was born and raised in the same province) in August 2003, aged 92. She had two children. Her son, Florián Antonio Martínez Nile, by her marriage to [[Florián Rey]], predeceased her, having committed suicide at age 24 in 1959. Her younger child was her daughter, Alejandra Goyanes Nile, by another marriage. She was married twice. As a divorcee, she could not, in [[Francoist Spain]], legally marry Joaquín Goyanes, the father of her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariocordoba.com/noticias/cultura/fallece-92-anos-actriz-cantante-imperio-argentina_75202.html|title=Fallece a los 92 años la actriz y cantante Imperio Argentina - Cultura - Diario Córdoba|website=Diariocordoba.com|date=23 August 2003|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7990">[[File:Indisch Monument te Den Haag.JPG|thumb|Indisch Monument, The Hague|alt=Simple sculpture of dark human figures against a fence]]
The '''Indies Monument''' ({{lang-nl|[[:nl:Indisch Monument (Den Haag)|Indisch Monument]]}}) is a memorial in [[The Hague]] in memory of all Dutch citizens and soldiers killed during World War II as a result of the Japanese occupation (1941–1945). It is dedicated to all who died in battle, in prison camps or during forced labor. As stated in the mission statement of the 15 August 1945 Commemoration Foundation, it is also:&lt;ref&gt;The Indisch Monument, official publication (15 August 1945 Commemoration Foundation, The Hague, 2008) online: {{cite web |url=http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314210012/http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A place where you can pass on to your children the part of your childhood spent in the Dutch East Indies&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The monument is unique, due to the fact that earth from the seven war cemeteries in Indonesia has been placed in an urn mounted on a small column at the front of the monument. In fall 2008 a second urn, with earth from the Galala Tantui war cemetery on [[Ambon Island]], was placed behind the column.

Before the commemoration ceremony each year, the Dutch ambassador to Indonesia lays a wreath at the Menteng Pulo war cemetery on [[Java]] in cooperation with the Foundation. Once every five years (in 2010 and 2015), in coordination with the Dutch embassies and the Dutch War Graves Foundation, wreaths are also laid at all other war cemeteries in Indonesia, Australia and Southeast Asia where Dutch victims of war are buried.&lt;ref&gt;Note: "The inscription on the right on the monument – THE SPIRIT OVERCOMES – is almost identical to the inscription on the memorial stones at the eight war cemeteries in Indonesia and the other war cemeteries in South-East Asia and Australia where Dutch war victims are buried. These distant war graves are difficult to visit from the Netherlands because of the distance and the cost involved and that is also why the Indisch Monument in The Hague is so important to all those who have loved ones who lie buried in these remote war cemeteries." The Indisch Monument, official publication (15 August 1945 Commemoration Foundation, The Hague, 2008) online: {{cite web |url=http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314210012/http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to this monument a commemoration site in [[Bronbeek]], [[Arnhem]] was established in 2010.

==Design==
[[File:INDIES MEMORIAL MONUMENT-026.jpg|thumb|240px|left|"The Spirit Overcomes"|alt=Close-up of sculpted human figures reaching through the fence]]
Designed by Jaroslawa Dankowa, the monument was unveiled on August 15, 1988 by [[Queen Beatrix]]. It consists of 17 bronze sculptures, a map of Southeast Asia and the inscription, "The spirit conquers". Its design was chosen in 1986 by the Mayor of [[Amsterdam]] (a former government official in the Dutch East Indies) and the Deputy Mayor of Amsterdam (a former [[Dutch resistance|resistance]] fighter). The commission for the design stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recognition through a representation of the struggle and the conquest. The humiliation, the repression, hardship, pain and despair. But also the hope, perseverance, courage and solidarity. Acknowledgement through a portrayal of our understanding today of the causes, the circumstances and consequences of that suffering.&lt;ref&gt;The Indisch Monument, official publication (15 August 1945 Commemoration Foundation, The Hague, 2008) online: {{cite web |url=http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314210012/http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development==
It took the Netherlands 43 years to erect a national monument to its war victims in the Dutch East Indies. Until 1961, the National [[Remembrance of the Dead]] Day (May 4) and [[Liberation Day (Netherlands)|Liberation Day]] (May 5) were primarily dedicated to the Dutch victims of [[Nazi Germany]]. Since 1962, they include soldiers and civilians fallen during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].

Memorial Day at the Indies Monument is August 15, the date of the Japanese surrender. Unlike May 5 (the date of the German capitulation), it is not a public holiday in the Netherlands.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the years following the transfer of sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies to Indonesia (1949) the political climate in the Netherlands was marked by sensitivity in relation to Indonesia and a sense of shame about the Netherlands' colonial past. As a result it took a long time before there was any interest in the war victims of the former Dutch East Indies colony.&lt;ref&gt;The Indisch Monument, official publication (15 August 1945 Commemoration Foundation, The Hague, 2008) online: {{cite web |url=http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314210012/http://www.indieherdenking.nl/cms/publish/content/downloaddocument.asp?document_id=10 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kaifu incident==
Three years after the monument was unveiled, Japanese Prime Minister [[Toshiki Kaifu]] laid a decorative garland at the monument on July 19, 1991 during his state visit. Later that day, the wreath was thrown into the water by a Dutch [[Indo people|Indo]] demonstrator. Prime Minister [[Ruud Lubbers]] expressed his regret about the incident to Kaifu, which led to further angry reactions from Indo survivors of the Japanese occupation.

==Anniversary==
To mark the 60th anniversary of the Japanese surrender on July 27, 2005 a smaller version of the monument was unveiled in [[Madurodam]], a [[miniature park]] created in memory of the [[Netherlands Antilles|Antillian]] World War II hero [[George Maduro]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1743">'''Isaac Lumbroso''' (died 1752) was a chief rabbi of [[Tunis]] and rabbinical author.

He was prominent in [[History of the Jews in Tunisia|Tunisian Jewry]], being judge of the community about 1710, an epoch coinciding with the schism which divided the Jews of the city into two camps, native Tunisians and Gournis or Italians. Lumbroso was appointed rabbinical judge of the latter; and, being a man of means, he filled at the same time the position of receiver of taxes to the ''[[bey]]'', as well as that of ''[[Qaid]]'' or official representative of his community.

From a literary point of view, Lumbroso, who was one of the most brilliant pupils of Rabbi [[Ẓemaḥ Ẓarfati]], was the most important among the Tunisian rabbis of the eighteenth century. He encouraged and generously assisted his fellow rabbis; and his reputation as a [[Talmud]]ist and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] survived him.

Lumbroso was the author of "Zera' Yiẓḥaḳ," published posthumously at Tunis in 1768. This work is a commentary on the different sections of the Talmud. Several funeral orations, pronounced by Lumbroso on diverse occasions, are appended thereto.

'''James Sinclair Taylor McGowen''' (16 August 1855 – 7 April 1922) was an Australian politician and the first Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]] from 21 October 1910 to 30 June 1913.

==Early life and family==
McGowen was the son of James McGowen, a boilermaker, and his wife Eliza Ditchfield, immigrants from [[Lancashire]] and was born at sea, on the "Western Bride", on the way to [[Melbourne]]. His father worked building in bridges, initially in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and later in [[New South Wales]]. After limited schooling he was apprenticed as a boiler maker in 1870. He became a member of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron Shipbuilders of New South Wales on its establishment in 1873,&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr James Sinclair Taylor McGowen (1855–1922) |work=Former Members|publisher=Parliament of New South Wales|url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/members/formermembers/Pages/former-member-details.aspx?pk=993|accessdate=16 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web | first=Bede | last=Nairn | title =McGowen, James Sinclair Taylor (1855–1922) | publisher =[[Australian National University]]

he became secretary in 1874. He entered the railways department and in 1888 was elected president of the executive of Trades Hall committee. He worked hard and successfully to raise funds to build the Trades Hall at [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{cite web| first=Percival| last=Serle| title =McGowen, James Sinclair Taylor (1855-1922) | publisher =Angus and Robertson (1949)| work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]]| url =http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogMc.html#mcgowen1| accessdate = 15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
In 1891, the [[Labor Council of New South Wales|New South Wales Trades and Labour Council]] established the Labor Electoral League, which developed into [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]], and McGowen stood for election to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Redfern|Redfern]] and was one of 35 Labor candidates to win and the most experienced unionist. He held the seat continuously to 1917.

While the Australian Labor Party eventually became the most disciplined in the world,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} the first Labor parliamentarians were almost as independent as their fellow parliamentarians. McGowen was one of three to sign the "pledge" to abide by party discipline. As a result of his increasingly skillfulness as a parliamentarian and his relative seniority he became Labor's parliamentary leader in 1894. After the 1898 election [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid's]] [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] Government was dependent on Labor to push through New South Wales' adoption of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. McGowen's support for Federation was critical to Labor maintaining its support for the adoption of measures to implement Federation, even though it remained opposed to the Constitution adopted, which it saw as biased in favour of business interests. McGowen stood for the Federal seat of [[Division of South Sydney|South Sydney]] in 1901, but was narrowly defeated.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Premier==
{{see also|McGowen ministry}}
McGowen's honesty and judiciousness were reassuring the public and were a major factor in Labor's 1910 election win. While he was Premier from to 1913, he was not an effective director of the parliamentary party, which he left to his deputy, [[William Holman]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; As well as Premier, he was also [[Treasurer of New South Wales|Colonial Treasurer]] during most of 1911 and Colonial Secretary from December 1911, both important portfolios. In 1913, while Holman was in England, he attempted to settle a gas workers' strike by threatening to replace them with non-union labour. This alienated the party and Holman deposed him as leader on his return in June 1913.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; McGowen became Minister for Labour and Industry until January 1914.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt;

In regards to social reform, the new state Labor government carried out an active policy of subsidising hospitals and dispensaries in order to bring about the realisation of [[universal health care]] system. However, opposition by doctors to state control forced the government to concentrate on financing new and existing institutions, such as nursing services for remote bush districts, while [[Friendly Societies]] were subsidised and membership encouraged. As a result of the state Labour government's efforts, improved low-cost medical services were made widely available throughout New South Wales.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Foundations of the Welfare State'' by [[Pat Thane]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, public works were expanded, and important educational reforms were enacted, together with reforms in electoral law, income tax, arbitration, and housing for workers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Three of his sons served in World War I, including one killed at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] in 1915 and he was a strong supporter of Australia's involvement in the war. The 1916 Labor conference decided to oppose [[Conscription in Australia|conscription]]. McGowen disagreed and was expelled along with most of the parliamentary party.

At the 1917 election he was defeated by the official Labor candidate [[William McKell]], but, now [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]], Premier Holman appointed him to the then unelected [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] in July 1917.

He died of heart disease in [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] and was survived by his wife, five of their seven sons, and two daughters.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; His largely attended funeral was held at St. Paul's Church, [[Redfern, New South Wales]] on 8 April 1922, and he was then buried at [[Rookwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'' – death and Funeral Notice 08/04/1922 (page 11)&lt;/ref&gt;

Roe has consulted for a variety of local, state, and federal political campaigns. Notable clients have included [[Mike Huckabee]], [[Rick Perry]] and [[Ted Cruz]].

==Background==
Roe is a native of [[Brookfield, Missouri]]. He grew up on his family's corn, soybean, and hog farm. Roe helped raise pigs and cattle on his family's farm. When asked how his upbringing prepared him for a career in politics, Roe said "hog farms are a lot cleaner."&lt;ref name=republic/&gt; His family did not have strong political leanings, and his childhood dream was to become a [[Major League Baseball]] umpire.&lt;ref name=cultivate&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vockrodt|first1=Steve|title=Political consultant Roe cultivates conservative campaigns|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2008/04/14/story10.html|accessdate=5 February 2016|publisher=Kansas City Business Journal|date=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roe became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] before joining the [[Army National Guard]] at age 17.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; He served in a 155&amp;nbsp;mm Howitzer Unit in South Korea, leaving the military in 1994.&lt;ref name=republic/&gt; He graduated from [[Northwest Missouri State University]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Northwest Alumni Magazine|url=https://www.nwmissouri.edu/alumni/PDF/magazine/2007_spring.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2016|publisher=Northwest Alumni Magazine|date=Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote conservative pieces for his college's newspaper.&lt;ref name=cultivate/&gt; He currently lives with his wife and daughter in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt; Roe is known for chewing [[Red Man]] Golden Blend chewing tobacco.&lt;ref name=republic/&gt;

==Political career==
Roe's political career began in 1994, working for then-Missouri State Representative [[Sam Graves]]. Following Graves' election to the [[Missouri State Senate]] in 1994 and then the [[United States Congress]] in 2000, Roe became Graves' Chief of Staff. In 2005, Roe left his position with Graves and founded Axiom Strategies, a Republican campaign consulting firm based in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;ref name=chosen/&gt; By 2008, Axiom Strategies had grown into a multimillion-dollar-a-year company.&lt;ref name=cultivate/&gt; In addition to Axiom Strategies, Roe founded creative agency and direct mail firm Candidate Command and polling and public opinion research company Remington Research Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helling|first1=Dave|title=Streetcar leads in poll, but campaign too close to call|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article820654.html|accessdate=24 March 2015|publisher=Kansas City Star|date=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruess|first1=Brittany|title=Axiom Strategies establishes new direct voter contact firm|url=http://themissouritimes.com/6112/axiom-strategies-establishes-new-direct-voter-contact-firm/|accessdate=24 March 2015|publisher=Missouri Times|date=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roe restructured his business model in August 2013 in order to handle an uptick in business. Axiom's internal direct mail capability was spun off into a standalone business called Candidate Command, and both the mail firm and Axiom grew by 40%.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;  Roe also owns Capitol Franking Group, which creates franked mail for members of Congress.&lt;ref name=republic/&gt;

After successfully managing several elections throughout the Midwest, including helping the Republican Party take over Missouri's General Assembly for the first time in 50 years, Roe expanded Axiom Strategies' operations to a national level in 2008, opening a second office in [[Washington, D.C.]] and working for Governor [[Mike Huckabee]]'s presidential campaign in 2008, as well as managing the successful election efforts of several Missouri Congressmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drucker|first1=David|title=Ted Cruz builds team for 2016|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ted-cruz-builds-team-for-2016/article/2552574|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=Washington Examiner|date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Congressman Sam Graves' brother [[Todd Graves (attorney)|Todd Graves]] was wrongfully dismissed from his position as a U.S. Attorney. It was discovered that Todd Graves' firing was retaliation from [[Kit Bond|Senator Kit Bond]]'s office over Sam Graves' refusal to fire Roe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kravitz|first1=Derek|title=How a Missouri Feud Ousted a U.S. Attorney|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpostinvestigations/2008/10/report_missouri_attorney_fight.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roe and his consulting firm widened their national footprint in 2010, contributing to the election efforts of Congressmen [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] (FL-22),&lt;ref name=TPM&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kapur|first1=Sahil|title=Ted Cruz's Brain Trust: The Advisers Who Want To Make Him President|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ted-cruz-top-advisers|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=Talking Points Memo|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]] (AR-1), [[Kevin Yoder]] (KS-3), [[Blaine Luetkemeyer]] (MO-9), [[Sam Graves]] (MO-6), [[Billy Long]] (MO-7), [[Chuck Fleischmann]] (TN-3), [[Jo Ann Emerson]] (MO-8) and Senators [[Roy Blunt]] (MO), [[Jerry Moran]] (KS) and [[John Boozman]] (AR). Roe also counted a number of high-profile losing clients the same year, including Wink Harman, [[Jim Barnett (Kansas politician)|Jim Barnett]], [[Bill Stouffer]], and [[Van Tran]].

In 2011, ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' wrote that Roe had "evolved into a mainstream player," citing his work to pass a Kansas City [[Sales tax in the United States|sales tax]] increase to create a nicer home for wild animals at the [[Kansas City Zoo]]. Democratic campaign consultant Steve Glorioso said Roe's work on behalf of the zoo tax increase "raised Roe's stature with the civic community" and that Roe's opponents "probably discovered his horns have smooth, not sharp, edges." His staff grew from eight people in 2008 to seventeen by 2011.&lt;ref name=evolve/&gt;

In the 2012 election cycle, Axiom Strategies worked for [[Rick Perry]]'s presidential campaign and for [[Richard Mourdock]] in his upset over [[Dick Lugar]] in the Indiana Senate primary.&lt;ref name=TPM/&gt; Roe also played a role in Christi Craddick's successful bid for Texas Railroad Commissioner and [[David Dewhurst]]'s unsuccessful United States Senate campaign. Following the 2012 election cycle, Axiom Strategies won 20 [[American Association of Political Consultants|Pollie]] awards, winning twice as many as their nearest competitor. Axiom was recognized for winning the most Pollies of any Republican mail firm in the United States.&lt;ref name=pollie/&gt;

Other clients included the [[National Association of Realtors]], Congressman [[Richard Hudson (U.S. politician)|Richard Hudson]] (NC-8) and Congresswoman [[Ann Wagner]] (MO-2). For his role defeating Proposition B in Missouri, the closest ballot initiative in Missouri since 1992, Roe was named Missouri's "2012 General Consultant All Star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoScout Readers 2012 All-Star Political Consultants|url=http://moscout.com/moscout-readers-2012-all-star-political-consultants/|publisher=Missouri Scout|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named one of Missouri's top 5 GOP "Influencers" by ''[[Campaigns &amp; Elections Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

In 2013, Roe was chosen to speak at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC). Gregg Keller, at the time the executive director of the [[American Conservative Union]], said Roe was invited to speak at the event because he was  "one of the most successful political consultants in the country." Roe said the speaking invitation validated a career path which he had launched by knocking on doors for political candidates.&lt;ref name=chosen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faughn|first1=Scott|title=Jeff Roe chosen to speak at CPAC|url=http://themissouritimes.com/1420/jeff-roe-chosen-to-speak-at-cpac/|accessdate=5 February 2016|publisher=The Missouri Times|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 election cycle===
In 2014, Roe hired Travis Smith, the former chief-of-staff for Congressman [[Kevin Yoder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roe expanding consultancy hegemon|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article340464/Roe-expanding-consultancy-hegemon.html|accessdate=5 February 2016|publisher=Kansas City Star|date=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Roe was the lead consultant for [[Martha McSally]]'s successful bid for Congress, in which she defeated incumbent [[Ron Barber]] by 167 votes in the closest congressional election in Arizona history.

===Ted Cruz 2016 presidential campaign===
{{main|Ted Cruz presidential campaign, 2016}}

In 2014, Roe was hired by [[Ted Cruz]] as a political strategist.&lt;ref name=TPM/&gt; According to ''[[Politico]]'', Roe was brought on board to build out Cruz's political organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Everett|first1=Burgess|last2=Bresnahan|first2=John|title=Ted Cruz feeds 2016 buzz with hires|url= http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/2016-elections-ted-cruz-110437.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|publisher=Politico|date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cruz announced [[Ted Cruz presidential campaign, 2016|his candidacy for president]] on March 23, 2015, it was reported that Roe was the campaign manager and senior strategist for Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hohmann|first1=James|last2=Isenstadt|first2=Alex|title=Cruz's strategy: Destroy the 'mushy middle'|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/cruzs-strategy-destroy-the-mushy-middle-116326.html|accessdate=24 March 2015|publisher=Politico|date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' named Cruz's campaign "best of the 2016 campaign in 2015."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catanese|first1=David|title=The Best and Worst of 2016 in 2015|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/articles/2015-12-31/cruz-walker-biden-carson-the-best-and-worst-of-the-2016-white-house-race-so-far|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roe is well known for using [[Microtargeting|sophisticated polling and campaign data]] to make strategic decisions, including targeting phone calls and other campaign messages to hit the ideas most likely to resonate with particular voters.&lt;ref name=wallace&gt;{{cite news|last1=Canon|first1=Scott|title=KC's Jeff Roe featured as 'ruthless' but teary Cruz campaign chief on Fox|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/government-politics/article56351455.html|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=Kansas City Star|date=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political columnist [[Al Hunt]] said that if Cruz is successful, "Roe may become a rock star in politics, on a par with [[Lee Atwater]], [[James Carville]], and [[David Plouffe]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helling|first1=Dave|title=Jeff Roe a potential 'rock star,' veteran reporter says|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article57393218.html|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=Kansas City Star|date=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Republic]]'' called the Cruz campaign "a vintage Jeff Roe campaign: obsessively disciplined, well-funded, laser-focused on the base" and described Roe as "equal parts drill sergeant, data junkie, brawler, and entrepreneur."&lt;ref name=republic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Andy|title=Ted Cruz's Howitzer|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/127717/ted-cruzs-howitzer|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=The New Republic|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2016, Roe was featured on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' with [[Chris Wallace]] as "Power Player of the Week".&lt;ref name=wallace/&gt; At the opening of his interview, Roe said "I think the rigors of democracy require us to have a real full-throated conversation about our beliefs, defend our beliefs, and point out the differences in our opponent's beliefs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Chris|title=The man behind the secret to Ted Cruz's ground game|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4719862950001/the-man-behind-the-secret-to-ted-cruzs-ground-game/?fb_ref=Default#sp=show-clips|accessdate=5 February 2016|publisher=Fox News|date=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ted Cruz's victory in the 2016 Republican [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa caucus]] put Roe into the spotlight.&lt;ref name=spotlight&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDermott|first1=Kevin|title='Ruthless' Jeff Roe, veteran of rough Missouri politics, in spotlight after Cruz win|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/ruthless-jeff-roe-veteran-of-rough-missouri-politics-in-spotlight/article_c92f8e03-06e8-5415-a055-b98dac27a8ca.html|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch|date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roe was credited as "the architect of Cruz's first-place finish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fense|first1=Sarah|title=Missouri's Own Jeff Roe Was the Wind Beneath Ted Cruz's Iowa Wings|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2016/02/02/missouris-own-jeff-roe-was-the-wind-beneath-ted-cruzs-iowa-wings|accessdate=4 February 2016|publisher=Riverfront Times|date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSNBC]] commentator [[Willie Geist]] called Roe "the [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]] of Cruz's campaign". Commenting on Roe's prediction that Cruz would win and [[Marco Rubio]] would come close to challenging [[Donald Trump]], Geist said: "They knew to the decimal point what their model could handle and that was almost exactly what the results were."&lt;ref name=spotlight/&gt;

''[[National Review]]'' wrote that Roe was instrumental in the launch of  Cruz's presidential campaign that defined him as the evangelical choice in the 2016 presidential election cycle, branding Cruz as "a divinely inspired warrior fighting a two-front battle against cultural secularism and big government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alberta|first1=Tim|last2=Johnson|first2=Eliana|title=Ted Cruz's Long Road to Iowa Victory|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430666/ted-cruz-iowa-win-inside-story|accessdate=5 February 2016|publisher=National Review|date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khiuaz Kairovna Dospanova''' (Cyrillic: ''Хиуаз Каировна Доспанова''; 15 May 1922 – 20 May 2008) was a [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] pilot who served in [[World War II]] in the [[Night Witches|588th Night Bomber Regiment]], nicknamed the "Night Witches." She was the only Kazakh woman to serve in the "Night Witches" and, although she was not awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] unlike many of her Russian and Ukrainian colleagues, she was awarded the title [[Hero of Kazakhstan]] in 2004 for her service after independence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoples.ru/military/aviation/hiyaz_dospanova/|title=Хиуаз Доспанова - Hiyaz Dospanova|last=|first=|date=|website=www.peoples.ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

== Early life ==
Born in [[Atyrau Region|Atyrau]], present-day [[Kazakhstan]], from her early childhood she dreamed of becoming a pilot.  After completing secondary school she became certified as a reserve pilot.  When World War II started she applied to the [[Military academies in Russia#Zhukovsky Air Force Academy|Zhukovsky Air Force Academy]] in Moscow, but her application was denied because the academy was for males only; she entered a medical institute instead in 1941.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Military career ==
When she heard of the recently formed all-female aviation regiments commanded by [[Marina Raskova]], she applied to the aviation college in Saratov.  In 1942 she was placed in the [[Night Witches|588th Night Bomber Regiment]] under the command of experienced pilot [[Yevdokia Bershanskaya]], where Dospanova gained 300 flight hours in combat as a navigator and gunner, eventually reaching the rank of Senior Lieutenant .&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestwriter.ru/fotoar.htm|title=Из архива Р. Ароновой|website=www.bestwriter.ru|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While landing after a mission in 1943, the [[Polikarpov Po-2]] Dospanova and pilot Julia Paskova were flying collided with another Po-2. Both pilots in the other plane were killed in the crash and Paskova died during surgery; Dospanova was assumed to be dead after not moving for a while, but nurses eventually realized she was still alive because she was not showing signs of [[pallor mortis]] long after they assumed her to be dead, so she underwent a series of surgeries over several days. Her legs developed [[gangrene]], but one doctor refused to amputate her legs, saying that she would need them. Dospanova had to wear casts on both of her legs for weeks and walked with a cane quite a while after the casts were removed. She returned to the regiment, but often required assistance of getting in and out the aircraft, and eventually became the regiment's head of communications after the previous head of communication, [[Valentina Stupina]], died.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Recognition ==
She was awarded various medals including the [[Order of the Red Star]], [[Order of the Patriotic War|Orders of the Patriotic War]] in 1st and 2nd class, and the title [[Hero of Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e-history.kz/en/publications/view/1095|title=Khiuaz Dospanova.

'''Kim Miller''' (born 1988) is an American artist who was diagnosed with "classic" [[autism]] in 1991.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} She began creating artwork at the age of 3 1/2 years old before she could functionally speak. At first, her artwork was just the outward articulation of an aloof, introverted, seemingly expressionless autistic child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thegirlwhospokewithpictures.com/news/news6.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103164915/http://thegirlwhospokewithpictures.com/news/news6.jpg |archive-date=2013-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years of utilizing sign language, delayed [[echolalia]] (the echoing of words and phrases), coupled with speech therapy, she learned to speak verbally as detailed in the book ''The Girl Who Spoke With Pictures'', which describes her advancement as a person with autism. Although Miller learned how to verbalize, she found it frustrating, difficult and time-consuming to communicate with words in real time. Drawing became a short cut to show her thoughts, feelings and needs.

Miller is often referred to as an "outside artist," [[outsider art]] self-taught and self-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/the-girl-who-spoke-with-pictures/&lt;/ref&gt; She is prolific in various mediums; acrylic paint, sculpting, ceramics, pencil as well as pen and ink. She is able to paint in a variety of styles exploring techniques such as [[pointillism]], [[German Expressionism]], or her own three-dimensional style; shifting from one painting to another as though simply changing fonts on the computer. Although some of the symptoms of autism (relating to objects rather than people, the fear of looking people in their faces, the inability to understand/process emotions) pose challenges, her unique work is outstanding for the fact that she chooses these very issues to examine and explore the complex human experience and relationships through her art.

She rose to prominence the following year with her debut album, the [[electropop]] record ''[[The Fame]]'', and its chart-topping singles "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]". A follow-up EP, ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009), featuring the singles "[[Bad Romance]]", "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]", and "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]", also proved successful.

Its [[Born This Way (song)|title track]] became the fastest selling song on the [[iTunes Store]] with over a million downloads in less than a week. Gaga ventured into [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] with her third studio album ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013), which reached number one in the US and included the single "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]". Her collaborative jazz album with [[Tony Bennett]], titled ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'', and her [[soft rock]]-influenced fifth studio album, ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016), also topped the US charts. During this period, Gaga also ventured into acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries ''[[American Horror Story: Hotel]]'' (2015–2016), for which she received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]], and the musical romantic drama film ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (2018). She also contributed to the latter's [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack]], which made her the only woman to achieve five US number one albums in the 2010s.

She considered herself a misfit among her peers and was mocked for "being either too provocative or too eccentric".{{sfn|Tracy|2013|page=202}}

Gaga began to play the piano at the age of four when her mother insisted she become "a cultured young woman", taking lessons and practicing the instrument throughout her childhood. The lessons taught her to create music by ear, which she preferred over reading sheet music and practiced professionally. Her parents encouraged her to pursue music, and enrolled her in Creative Arts Camp.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=20}} As a teenager, she played at [[open mic]] nights.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=26}} Gaga played the lead roles of Adelaide in ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' and Philia in ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' at a [[Regis High School (New York City)|nearby boys' high school]].&lt;ref name="growingupgaga"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Vanessa|last=Grigoriadis|authorlink=Vanessa Grigoriadis|title=Growing Up Gaga|date=March 28, 2010|url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/65127|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=March 29, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401055337/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/65127/|archivedate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also studied [[method acting]] at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]] for ten years.&lt;ref name=leestrasburgalumna&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manelis|first1=Michele|title=LSTFI Alum Lady Gaga taps into The Lee Strasberg Method|url=http://newyork.methodactingstrasberg.com/blog/lstfi-alumna-lady-gaga-taps-into-the-lee-strasberg-method/|publisher=[[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]]|accessdate=January 7, 2016|date=October 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127031815/http://newyork.methodactingstrasberg.com/blog/lstfi-alumna-lady-gaga-taps-into-the-lee-strasberg-method/|archivedate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga unsuccessfully auditioned for New York shows, though appeared in a small role as a high school student in a 2001 episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' titled "[[The Telltale Moozadell]]".{{sfn|Morgan|2010|page=27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga fans discover her pre-fame 'Sopranos' cameo|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/10/11/lady-gaga-sopranos-cameo/|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2017|first=Christian|last=Blauvelt|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108115908/http://www.ew.com/article/2010/10/11/lady-gaga-sopranos-cameo|archivedate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later said of her inclination towards music:

{{quote|I don't know exactly where my affinity for music comes from, but it is the thing that comes easiest to me. When I was like three years old, I may have been even younger, my mom always tells this really embarrassing story of me propping myself up and playing the keys like this because I was too young and short to get all the way up there. Just go like this on the low end of the piano&amp;nbsp;... I was really, really good at piano, so my first instincts were to work so hard at practicing piano, and I might not have been a natural dancer, but I am a natural musician.

==Life==
A [[Hui people|Chinese-speaking Muslim]] from [[Gansu]],&lt;ref name=lipman/&gt;
Ma Mingxin spent 16 years&lt;ref&gt;Gladney (1996), p. 50. Gladney says, though, that Ma Mingxin "returned after 16 years of study in Yemen and Arabian Peninsula in 1744". Given his dates of life (1719-1781), it would imply that he'd have to start his study in Arabia at 9 - so possibly there is a typo somewhere in that source.&lt;/ref&gt; studying in [[Mecca]]&lt;ref name=lipman/&gt; and [[Yemen]]. He was a disciple of a [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] teacher named 'Abd al-Khāliq,&lt;ref&gt;Lipman (1998), p.202 gives 'Abd al-Khāliq's death date as 1740, without commenting on how that would match with the dates of Ma Mingxin's biography.&lt;/ref&gt; who was a son of az-Zayn b. Muhammad 'Abd al-Baqī al-Mizjaji  (1643/44-1725), originally of [[Mizjaja]] near [[Zabīd]], [[Yemen]]. Az-Zayn, in his turn, had studied in [[Medina]] under the famous Kurdish mystic Ibrahīm ibn Hasan al-Kūrānī (1616–1690), who was known for advocating the vocal (rather than silent) ''[[dhikr]]'' (invocation of the name of God).&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=lipman/&gt;

After returning to China in 1761,&lt;ref&gt;Lipman (1998), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Mingxin founded the [[Jahriyya]] ''[[menhuan]]'' (order) ({{zh|s=哲合忍耶|p=Zhéhérĕnyē|labels=no}}) - the second Naqshbandi order in China after [[Ma Laichi]]'s [[Khufiyya]]. In opposition to the "silent" Khufiyya Sufis, and following al-Kurani's teaching, Jahriyya adherents advocated vocal ''dhikr'', which is reflected in the name of their school (from Arabic ''jahr'', "aloud").&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=lipman/&gt; Ma Mingxin also opposed the emphasis that the Khufiyya members placed of the veneration of the saints,&lt;ref name=mc/&gt; construction of grandiose elaborately decorated mosques, and the enrichment of religious leaders at the expense of their adherents.&lt;ref name=lipman/&gt;

By the early 1780s, Ma Mingxin's Jahriyya had spread over much of the then province of [[Gansu]] (which at the time also included today's [[Qinghai]] and [[Ningxia]]), as had the late Ma Laichi's Khufiyya ''menhuan''.  Theological arguments between members of the two ''menhuans'', as well as the orders' claim on members' contributions, against the background of government mismanagement of the provincial revenue, often resulted in both violent conflicts and lawsuits.&lt;ref name=lipman107&gt;Lipman, pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lipman96&gt;Lipman, p. 96 (on fiscal mismanagement)&lt;/ref&gt;

The escalating conflict between the adherents of the two movements eventually attracted attention of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] government in 1781. The apparent center of the conflict at the time was in the ethnic [[Salar people|Salar]] community of [[Xunhua]] County (in today's [[Qinghai]] Province, just west of today's Gansu's [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia Prefecture]]). Considering the Jahriyya (dubbed by the government ''The New Teaching'', in opposition to the "Old Teaching", i.e. the Khfiyya and the non-Sufi (''gedimu'') Muslims) subversive, the authorities had Ma Mingxin arrested, even though he wasn't personally anywhere around Xunhua at the moment.&lt;ref name=lipman107/&gt;

While Ma Mingxin was kept in [[Lanzhou]] during the [[Jahriyya revolt]], a government expedition sent to Xunhua to take care of the Jahriyya business was destroyed by the Jahriyya Salars, who then rushed across the today's Linxia Prefecture and to the walls of Lanzhou. When the besieged officials brought Ma Mingxin, wearing chains, to the city wall, to show him to the rebels, the Salars at once showed respect and devotion to their imprisoned leaders. Scared officials took Ma down from the wall, and beheaded him right away.&lt;ref name=lipman107/&gt;

Ma Mingxin's widow, whose surname was Zhang (originally, from Gansu's [[Tongwei County]]), and his daughters were exiled to [[Xinjiang]].&lt;ref name=lipman112&gt;Lipman, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ma Mingxin's death did not stop conflicts with China's Muslim community, or those between the Muslims and the government. Three years after the death of Ma Mingxin, his follower Tian Wu started a rebellion against the imperial government; after its defeat, the authorities remained on lookout against the spread of the "subversive" Jahriyya teachings.&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;

Ma Mingxin's fifth generation descendant and the then leader of Jahriyya, [[Ma Hualong]], was one of the chief leaders of the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Great Northwest Hui Rebellion]] in Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Gansu in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Gladney (1996), p. 50. Other sources, however, don't mention Ma Hualong's descent from Ma Mingxin, so possibly Gladney means "spiritual successor" (via Jahriyya's ''[[silsilah]]'') when describin Ma Hualong as a "descendant" of Ma Mingxin.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jahriyya order continues to this day, even if in more covert forms.&lt;ref name=mc/&gt; In remembrance of Ma Mingxin, whose beard was shorn by government  soldiers before his execution, many Jahriyya members shave the sides of their beards.&lt;ref name=g53&gt;Gladney (1996), pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mangas Coloradas''' or '''Mangus-Colorado'''&lt;!-- spelling used in Geronimo's memoirs--&gt; ('''La-choy Ko-kun-noste''', alias "Red Sleeve"), or '''Dasoda-hae''' ("He Just Sits There") (c. 1793&amp;nbsp;– January 18, 1863) was an [[Apache]] [[tribal chief]] and a member of the [[Mimbreño]] (Tchihende) division of the Central Apaches, whose homeland stretched west from the [[Rio Grande]] to include most of what is present-day southwestern [[New Mexico]]. He was the father-in-law of the [[Chiricahua]] (Tsokanende) Chief [[Cochise]], the Mimbreño Chief [[Victorio]] and the Mescalero (Sehende) Chief Kutu-hala or Kutbhalla (probably to be identified with [[Caballero (Apache chief)|Caballero]]), and is regarded by many historians to be one of the most important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] leaders of the 19th century due to his fighting achievements against the [[Mexico|Mexicans]] and [[United States|Americans]].

The name ''Mangas Coloradas'' is the reception of his Apache nickname '''Kan-da-zis Tlishishen''' ("Red Shirt" or "Pink Shirt") by the Mexicans and is Spanish for '''Red Sleeves'''. A Bedonkohe (''Bi-dan-ku'' &amp;ndash; 'In Front of the End People', ''Bi-da-a-naka-enda'' &amp;ndash; 'Standing in front of the enemy') by birth he married into the Copper Mines local group of the Tchihende and became the principal chief of the whole Tchihende Apache division, including the neighboring Mimbreño local group of the Warm Springs Tchihende, directly led by the famous chief [[Cuchillo Negro]] (in Apache language '''Baishan'''), second chief of the whole Tchihende Apache division and his long-time companion.

==Apache war-leader and chief==
During the decades of the 1820s and 1830s, the Apaches' main enemy were the Mexicans, who had won their independence from [[Spain]] in 1821. By 1835, [[Mexico]] had placed a bounty on Apache scalps. After [[Juan José Compa]], the leader of the Coppermine Mimbreño Apaches, was killed for bounty money in 1837 in the massacre at Santa Rita del Cobre, Mangas became a war leader and a chief, and, joining forces with his friend and long-time companion (and possibly brother-in-law) [[Cuchillo Negro]] (Spanish: Black Knife),{{efn-ua|His father Fuerte, a.k.a. Soldado Fiero (Spanish: Proud Soldier), had been killed near Santa Rita del Cobre by troops from the Janos garrison in 1835 or 1837}} began a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans, killing and destroying all around the mining town and placing Santa Rita under siege, finally attacking the column of fleeing Mexicans and slaughtering a large number.
Mangas Coloradas became the principal leader of the Coppermine Mimbreños, and led them for about 25 years, while Cuchillo Negro led the Warm Springs Mimbreños.

In 1846, when the United States went to war with Mexico, the Apache Nation promised U.S. soldiers safe passage through Apache lands. Once the U.S. occupied [[New Mexico]] in 1846, Mangas Coloradas signed a peace treaty, respecting them as conquerors of the hated Mexican enemy. An uneasy peace between the Apache and the United States lasted until an influx of gold miners into New Mexico's Pinos Altos Mountains led to open conflict.

In 1851 the settlement at Santa Rita del Cobre of the U.S. delegation (with General J.R. Bartlett) in the Mexican-American Border Commission, and the reopening of the Santa Rita del Cobre copper mines, effected the meeting with the Anglo-American newcomers. Mangas Coloradas, like Cuchillo Negro, [[Delgadito (Apache chief)|Delgadito]], Ponce, Coleto Amarillo and all the most important Tchihende and Ndendahe chiefs, had to face new problems. In June 1851 Mangas Coloradas, with Delgadito, Ponce and Coleto Amarillo, went to [[Santa Rita del Cobre]] to meet Bartlett, and the discussions continued until the Apaches no longer felt disappointed and betrayed by the newcomers. According to John C. Cremony's book, ''Life Among the Apaches'', in 1861, near Pinos Altos mining camp, Mangas Coloradas was attacked by a group of White miners who tied him to a tree and severely flogged him.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Yet historian Edwin R. Sweeney finds issue with this claim in his biography of the chief: if it was true, probably Geronimo, who spent a great deal of time with Mangas Coloradas during the 1850s and 1860s, would have mentioned that to his biographer as a reason for the war, yet he did not.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The killing of Cuchillo Negro by U.S. troops at Canyon de los Muertos Carneros in May 1857 was an even more bitter business.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In December 1860, 30 miners launched a surprise attack on an encampment of Bedonkohes on the west bank of the [[Mimbres River]]. Historian Edwin R. Sweeney reported, the miners ''"... killed four Indians, wounded others, and captured thirteen women and children."'' Shortly after that, Mangas began raids against U.S. citizens and their property.

Mangas Coloradas' daughter Dos-Teh-Seh married Cochise, principal chief of the Tsokanende or Chiricahua Apache. In early February 1861, US Army Lieutenant George N. Bascom, investigating the "Indian" kidnapping of a rancher's son, apparently without orders, lured an innocent Cochise, his family and several warriors into a trap at [[Apache Pass]], southeastern [[Arizona]]. Cochise managed to escape, but his family and warriors remained in custody. Negotiations were unsuccessful and fighting erupted.
This incident, known as the "[[Bascom Affair]]", ended with Cochise's brother and five other warriors being hanged by Bascom. Later that year, Mangas Coloradas and Cochise struck an alliance, agreeing to drive all Americans out of Apache territory. They were joined in their effort by middle-aged [[Delgadito (Apache chief)|Delgadito]] and [[Nana (chief)|Nana]],  [[Victorio]], [[Juh]] and [[Geronimo]]. Although the goal was never achieved, the White population in Apache territory was greatly reduced for a few years during the Civil War, after federal troops had been withdrawn to the east.

==Death==
In the summer of 1862, after recovering from a bullet wound in the chest, Mangas Coloradas met with an intermediary to call for peace. In January 1863, he decided to meet with U.S. military leaders at Fort McLane ([[Apache Tejo]]), in southwestern [[New Mexico]]. He was promised provisions in return for peace, and he returned with his people.&lt;ref&gt;Geronimo, S.M. Barrett ''Geronimo: The True Story of America's Most Ferocious Warrior'', 1906, republished 2011 {{isbn|1616087536}}, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; Mangas arrived under a flag of truce to meet with Brigadier General [[Joseph Rodman West]], an officer of the California militia and a future [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] senator from [[Louisiana]]. Armed soldiers took Mangas into custody. West gave an execution order to the sentries.
[[Image:Orson Squire Fowler.jpg|thumb|200px|Orson Squire Fowler]]

{{quote|Men, that old murderer has got away from every soldier command and has left a trail of blood for 500 miles on the old stage line. I want him dead tomorrow morning. Do you understand? I want him dead.}}

That night, Mangas was tortured, shot and killed "escaping". While tied on the ground, Mangas was provoked with red hot bayonets until he moved to simulate his attempt to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Frank. ''Brave Are My People''. Santa Fe, NM: Clear Light Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, U.S. soldiers, fascinated by the size of the Apache (Mangas was 6 feet, 6 inches tall), cut off his head, boiled it and sent the skull to [[Orson Squire Fowler]], a phrenologist in New York City. Phrenological analysis of the skull and two sketches of it appear in Fowler's book.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, O.S. 1873. Human Science or Phrenology. p. 1196. (Available at [https://archive.org/stream/humanscienceorph00fowl#page/1196/mode/1up])&lt;/ref&gt; Daklugie, one of informants in Eve Ball's book,&lt;ref name=Indeh&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ball, Eve |author2=Henn, Nora |author3=Sanchez, Lynda A. | title=Indeh: An Apache Odyssey (reprint)|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1988|isbn=0-8061-2165-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the skull went to the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

However, the Smithsonian has done a thorough search for the skull, and reports that it never received it. Mangas' descendants and sources based on their testimony may have confused the Smithsonian with Fowler's Phrenological Cabinet in New York, where the skull was on display, leading to the misattribution. Another possible fate of the skull was that it was returned to the Apaches by the Smithsonian in a 1990 transfer, but was not individually labeled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowwowl.com/swolfjworleychiefs2.html The Apaches: Destined for Change]&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder and mutilation of Mangas' body only increased the hostility between Apaches and the United States, resulting in war continuing for nearly another 25 years.

The 1952 film "Lone Star" starring Clark Gable, featured Magnus Coloradus, played by Chief Yowlachie, among a group of Apaches, including a child named Geronimo, sitting west of the Pecos with Sam Houston.

The film ''[[War Drums]]'', was a 1957 American Western film directed by Reginald Le Borg and written by Gerald Drayson Adams. It featured  Lex Barker as Mangas Coloradas, Joan Taylor and Ben Johnson. The friendship between a white man and an Apache chief is tested when they fall in love with the same woman during a time of frontier conflict.

The 2006 Australian film ''[[Last Train to Freo]]'', directed by ''[[Jeremy Sims]]'', features a tattoo of "Red Sleeves" on the Tall Thug's arm, played by ''[[Steve Le Marquand]]''. He then begins a short monologue, detailing the life of the Apache War Chief, in an attempt to gain the attention of Lisa, played by ''[[Gigi Edgley]]''. 

The 2013 film ''[[Avenged (2013 U.S. film)|Avenged]]'', directed by Michael Ojeda, features the vengeful ghost of Mangas Coloradas as possessing a young woman's body and wreaking vengeance upon the descendants of General Joseph Rodman West.

In addition to his legal career, Appleby was the leader of the [[Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party]] from its foundation in 1996 until 2013.&lt;ref name="WCC profile 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder |first=Vaughan |title=Dunedin man elected to lead cannabis party | url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/276893/dunedin-man-elected-lead-cannabis-party |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small [[political party]] is dedicated to the relaxation or repeal of laws against the use of cannabis and has never been represented in Parliament.

Appleby has stood as his party's candidate in the {{NZ electorate link|Wellington Central}} electorate since its inception in 1996. His best result was in the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 election]] where he gained third place, aided by the fact that most major candidates had pulled out to support either incumbent [[Richard Prebble]] or challenger [[Marian Hobbs]]. He came fifth in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.electionresults.org.nz/electionresults_2011/electorate-59.html |title=Official Count Results -- Wellington Central |publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later represented the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party in the [[Ikaroa-Rāwhiti by-election, 2013|2013 Ikaroa-Rāwhiti by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1306/S00020/aotearoa-legalise-cannabis-party-launch-by-election-campaign.htm |title=Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party launch By-Election campaign |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter W. Smith''' (February 23, 1936 – May 14, 2017) was an American [[investment banker]] who had a 40-year career managing [[Mergers and acquisitions|corporate acquisitions]] and [[venture capital|venture investments]]. He was active in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics. In 1998, he was identified as a major financial supporter of the 1993 [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]] story, in which several Arkansas state troopers accused [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] of having carried out sexual dalliances while he was [[Governor of Arkansas]]. In 2017, he confirmed to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''  that he had tried in 2016 to contact computer hackers, including [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian hackers]], in an attempt to obtain [[opposition research]] material to use against [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]]. Ten days after speaking to the paper, he committed suicide in a [[Minnesota]] hotel room, citing ill health.

==Education==
Smith earned a BS in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Northeastern University]].  He went on to earn an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter W. Smith |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=86575&amp;privcapId=746824 |title=Peter W. Smith: Executive Profile &amp; Biography |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

From 1969 to 1980 he was a senior officer at [[Field Enterprises]], Inc. From 1975 to 1997 he was president of his own firm, Peter W. Smith &amp; Company, specializing in buyout transactions. From 1997 to 2014 he was Managing Member of DigaComm, LLC where he primarily managed early venture investments. At the time of his death he was Chairman Emeritus of Corporate Venture Alliances, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvalliances.com/principals.html|title=Principals|work=Corporate Venture Alliances website|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==
He was national chairman of the College Young Republicans. He was a board member and officer of the [[Atlantic Council of the United States]] and was also active with the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], and the [[Brookings Institution]]. He was a contributor and fundraiser for the [[Republican National Committee]] and [[GOPAC]] as well as individual candidates.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/chicagotribune/obituary.aspx?pid=185474380|title=Peter W. Smith|date=May 20, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=legacy.com|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was a major donor to [[Newt Gingrich]]'s GOPAC, giving over $100,000 from 1989 to 1995—a sum which made him one of GOPAC's top 20 donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Murray Waas |url=http://observer.com/1998/03/gingrich-money-man-peter-smith-helped-david-brock-sock-clinton/ |title=Gingrich Money Man Peter Smith Helped David Brock Sock Clinton |work=Observer |date=March 30, 1998 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1993, two Arkansas state troopers publicly claimed that they and other troopers had been used to facilitate and conceal multiple extra-marital affairs of then-Governor Bill Clinton. The stories were published in an article by then-conservative author [[David Brock]] in the ''[[American Spectator]]'' and also in a series of articles in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://spectator.org/49976_his-cheatin-heart/|title=His Cheatin' Heart|last=Brock|first=David|date=January 1994|work=American Spectator|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-21/news/mn-4179_1_white-house|title=Troopers Say Clinton Sought Silence on Personal Affairs : Arkansas: The White House calls their allegations about the President's private life 'ridiculous.'|last1=Rempel|first1=William C.|last2=Frantz|first2=Douglas|date=December 21, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith had arranged for the troopers to meet Brock.&lt;ref name="Rempel" /&gt; In February 1994 Smith started a "Troopergate Whistle Blower Fund" to provide support for the troopers and pay their attorney fees; the fund ultimately raised about $40,000. Altogether Smith said he spent about $80,000 on the case, including a $5,000 payment to Brock. Smith described his donations as an independent effort to encourage anti-Clinton stories in the mainstream press.&lt;ref name="Rempel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/01/news/mn-34973|title=Chicago Banker Identified as Troopergate Fund Benefactor|last=Rempel|first=William C.|date=April 1, 1998|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several emails sent by Smith to the [[Illinois Republican Party]] turned up among those hacked from party computers and posted on [[DCLeaks]], which U.S. intelligence officials believe to be an outlet for the foreign military intelligence agency of Russia, [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]]. The emails were about a 2015 congressional election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/security/FBI-Notified-Illinois-GOP-of-Potential-Email-Hack-in-June.html |title=FBI Notified Illinois GOP of Potential Email Hack in June |publisher=Govtech.com |date=December 12, 2016 |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 Smith told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that he had been actively involved, during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election campaign]], in trying to obtain emails he believed had been deleted from [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|computer server]].&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-operative-sought-clinton-emails-from-hackers-implied-a-connection-to-flynn-1498770851 |title=GOP Operative Sought Clinton Emails From Hackers, Implied a Connection to Flynn|last=Harris|first=Shane|date=June 29, 2017|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=July 3, 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/340166-gop-investigation-sought-connection-between-clintons-emails-and-russia|title=GOP investigation sought connection between Clinton's emails and Russia: report|last=Cohn|first=Alicia|date=June 29, 2017|work=The Hill|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that quest he contacted several known hacker groups, including some [[Russia|Russian]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/30/russia-hackers-clinton-emails-mike-flynn|title=Russia hackers discussed getting Clinton emails to Michael Flynn – report|last=Borger|first=Julian|date=June 30, 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he was working on behalf of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] advisor [[Michael Flynn|Mike Flynn]], but that connection has not been confirmed. He was shown some information but was not convinced it was genuine, and suggested the hackers give it to [[WikiLeaks]] instead.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt; As part of this effort, Smith donated $150,000 to "the Washington Scholarship Fund for the Russian students", including $100,000 of solicited money and $50,000 from his personal funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tau |first1=Byron |last2=Volz |first2=Dustin |last3=Holliday |first3=Shelby |title=GOP Operative Secretly Raised at Least $100,000 in Search for Clinton Emails |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-operative-secretly-raised-at-least-100-000-in-search-for-clinton-emails-1538913614 |accessdate=October 7, 2018 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Smith lived in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]]. He was married to Janet; the couple had three children and three grandchildren at the time of his death.&lt;ref name = "obit"/&gt;

Smith died on May 14, 2017 in a hotel room in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]. He had checked into the hotel, which is near the [[Mayo Clinic]], the day after speaking to the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name="Skiba2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-peter-w-smith-death-met-0716-20170714-story.html|title=Peter W.

Medical records list Smith's cause of death as "asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in confined space with helium." Police discovered a [[suicide note]] by Smith that stated no foul play was involved in his committing suicide, and that he was in poor health and his life insurance policy was expiring. However, it has been reported that that insurance policy was good for 8 more years. &lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Skiba |first1=Katherine |last2=Heinzmann |first2=David  |last3=Lighty |first3=Todd |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-peter-smith-death-met-0713-20170713-story.html |title=Peter W.

The '''Prix Goncourt''' ({{lang-fr|Le prix Goncourt}}, {{IPA-fr|lə pʁi ɡɔ̃kuʁ|IPA}}, ''The Goncourt Prize'') is a prize in [[French literature]], given by the [[académie Goncourt]] to the author of "the best and most imaginative prose work of the year". Four other prizes are also awarded: '''prix Goncourt du Premier Roman''' (first novel), '''prix Goncourt de la Nouvelle''' (short story), '''prix Goncourt de la Poésie''' (poetry) and '''prix Goncourt de la Biographie''' (biography). Of the "big six" French literary awards, the Prix Goncourt is the best known and most prestigious.&lt;ref name=unwin-intro&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the French Novel: From 1800 to the Present |first=Timothy|last=Unwin |page=xxii |chapter=Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIq99LRgKw8C&amp;pg=PR22 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |quote=The 'big six' literary prizes in France have an extremely high profile and are, significantly, all awarded for novels. The best known and most prestigious is the Prix Goncourt.

==History==
[[File:Edmond Goncourt - Schriftsteller.jpg|right|thumb|[[Edmond de Goncourt]]]]
[[Edmond de Goncourt]], a successful author, critic, and publisher, bequeathed his estate for the foundation and maintenance of the [[académie Goncourt]].&lt;ref name=burke&gt;{{cite book |title=Writers In Paris: Literary Lives in the City of Light |first=David|last=Burke |publisher=Counterpoint Press |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSplzKidZ6AC&amp;pg=PA181 |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of his brother and collaborator, [[Jules de Goncourt|Jules Alfred Huot de Goncourt]] (1830–1870), the académie has awarded the Prix Goncourt every December since 1903.&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; The jury that determines the winner meets at the ''Drouant'' restaurant in November to make its decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Companion Guide to Paris |first=Anthony|last=Glyn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vqNxaGnp7MC&amp;pg=PA98 |page=98 |publisher=Companion Guides |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable winners of the prize include [[Marcel Proust]] (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (''[[The Mandarins]]''), [[André Malraux]] (''[[Man's Fate]]'') and [[Marguerite Duras]] (''[[The Lover (1984 novel)|The Lover]]'').&lt;ref name=burke/&gt;

The award was initially established to provide talented new authors with a monetary award that would allow them to write a second book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Contradictions of Freedom: Philosophical Essays on Simone de Beauvoir's The Mandarins |author=Sally J. Scholz |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfawyAOgNQoC&amp;pg=PA18 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Goncourt has a token prize amount (around 10 euros), about the same amount given in 1903, and so the prestige of the prize has been explained not because of the cash-value of the prize, but "in terms of the tremendous book sales it effects: the Goncourt winner becomes an instant millionaire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economy of Prestige: prizes, awards, and the circulation of cultural value |author= James F English |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vY3UOFDA2sAC&amp;pg=PA231 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the [[Prix Goncourt des Lycéens]] was established, as a collaboration between the [[académie Goncourt]], the French Ministry of Education, and [[Fnac]], a book, music, and movie retailer.

The [[Prix Renaudot]] is announced at the same ceremony as the Prix Goncourt. It has become known as something of a second-place prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A New History of French Literature |first=Denis|last=Hollier |page=967 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGQOodBVG9YC&amp;pg=PA967 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
[[File:Prix Goncourt - Paris 3 novembre 2016 002.jpg|thumb|left|Journalists at the at Le Drouant restaurant, 2016 Prix Goncourt.]]
Within months of the first prize in 1903, it spawned a "hostile counter-prize" in the form of the [[Prix Femina]] to counter the all-male Jury of the Goncourt with an all-female jury on the Femina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economy of Prestige: prizes, awards, and the circulation of cultural value |author= James F English |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vY3UOFDA2sAC&amp;pg=PA61 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some decisions for awarding the prize have been controversial, a famous case being the decision to award the prize in 1919 to [[Marcel Proust]]; this was met with indignation, since many in the public felt that the prize should have gone to [[Roland Dorgelès]] for ''Les Croix de bois'', a novel about the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name=rodic&gt;{{cite book |title=Lyricism and Politics in Paul Valery's Poetry and Poetic Theory and in "La Nouvelle Revue Francaise", 1909—1939 |first=Vesna|last=Rodic |publisher=ProQuest |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxE9rJeGkewC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ashley&gt;{{cite book |title=Prix Goncourt, 1902–2003: essals critiques |author=Katherine Ashley (ed) |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Bern |year=2004 |language=French |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA_rVRar1JkC&amp;pg=PA77 |chapter=L'Attribution du prix Goncourt à Proust en 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize was supposed to be awarded to promising young authors, whereas Proust was not considered "young" at 48 – however Proust was a beginning author which is the only eligibility requirement, age being unimportant.&lt;ref name=rodic/&gt;&lt;ref name=ashley/&gt;

In 1921, [[Rene Maran]] won the Goncourt with ''[[Batouala (novel)|Batouala, veritable roman negre]]'', the first French novel to openly criticize European colonialism in Africa.&lt;ref name=unwin-colonial/&gt; The novel caused "violent reactions" and was banned in all the French colonies.&lt;ref name=unwin-colonial&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the French Novel: From 1800 to the Present |first=Timothy|last=Unwin |page=195 |chapter=The colonial and postcolonial Francophone novel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIq99LRgKw8C&amp;pg=PA195 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, the prize was controversial for passing up [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]'s ''[[Voyage au bout de la nuit]]'' for [[Guy Mazeline]]'s ''Les Loups''.&lt;ref name=ashley-celine&gt;{{cite book |title=Prix Goncourt, 1902–2003: essals critiques |author=Katherine Ashley (ed) |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Bern |year=2004 |language=French |page=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA_rVRar1JkC&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting process became the basis of the 1992 book ''Goncourt 32'' by [[Eugène Saccomano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sébastien|last=Lapaque |work=[[Le Figaro]] |date=16 September 1999 |title=Céline-Mazeline sur le ring |accessdate=2013-06-11 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the award may only be given to an author once, [[Romain Gary]] won it twice, in 1956 for ''[[Les racines du ciel]]'' and again under the pseudonym [[Émile Ajar]] in 1975 for ''[[La vie devant soi]]''.&lt;ref name=ashley-gary&gt;{{cite book |title=Prix Goncourt, 1902–2003: essals critiques |author=Katherine Ashley (ed) |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Bern |year=2004 |language=French |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QA_rVRar1JkC&amp;pg=PA16 |chapter=Avant propos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Académie Goncourt awarded the prize to Ajar without knowing his real identity.&lt;ref name=ashley-gary/&gt; A period of literary intrigue followed. Gary's cousin's son Paul Pavlowitch posed as the author for a time. Gary later revealed the truth in his posthumous book ''Vie et mort d'Émile Ajar''.&lt;ref name=ashley-gary/&gt;

==Other awards==
In addition to the Prix Goncourt for a novel, the Academy Awards four other awards, for first novel, short story, biography and poetry.

As of March 2009, the académie changed the award name by dropping "bourses" ("scholarship") from the title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-goncourt.fr/?rubrique=1229172185 Autres prix décernés par l'Académie Goncourt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/livres/2009/01/29/03005-20090129ARTFIG00477-les-goncourt-surfent-.php Les Goncourt surfent], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 29 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The prefix "prix" can be included or not, such as "Prix Goncourt de la Poésie" (Goncourt prize for Poetry) or "Goncourt de la Poésie" (Goncourt of Poetry). For example: "Claude Vigée was awarded a Goncourt de la Poésie in 2008". Or, "Claude Vigée won the 2008 prix Goncourt de la Poésie".

'''Refugee Week''' takes place in June each year. It is regularly used as a platform for holding hundreds of arts, cultural and educational events.

Refugee Week events are often intended to celebrate the contribution of refugees to the United Kingdom, and encourage a better understanding between communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://refugeeweek.org.uk/about-us/|title=About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dates ==

Refugee Week always takes place in the week closest to [[World Refugee Day]] (20 June).

The dates for 2009–2012 are as follows:

*'''2009:''' 15 – 21 June
*'''2010:''' 14 – 20 June
*'''2011:'''  20 – 26 June
*'''2012:''' 18 – 24 June

== Events ==

Events during Refugee Week are usually organised by different charities, local governments, refugee community organisations, schools, faith groups, arts organisations, day centres and umbrella networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation Report|year=2008|url=http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk:81/NR/rdonlyres/67114893-B533-4BE4-AC78-67FD06691637/0/EvaluationReportRefugeeWeek2008.pdf|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-agency organisation called the [http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk Refugee Week partnership] leads on unifying the events.

Events organised during Refugee Week are held independently from the Refugee Week partnership and are not obliged to follow the suggested direction of the partnership.

Events include the annual [http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk/InYourArea/England/London/Refugee+Week+Umbrella+Parade+2011 Umbrella Parade] and the [http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk/InYourArea/England/London/Celebrating+Sanctuary+London+2011 Celebrating Sanctuary Festival] in London. 2011 will also see a "[http://www.unhcr.org.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/images/news_images/May_news/Fish___Chips-1.jpg 100% British created by refugees]" campaign to celebrate the contribution of refugees to British society, as well as a Simple Acts campaign which encourages people do a least one simple action in order to make a big change to the way refugees are perceived in the UK.

== Partnership ==

The strategic direction of Refugee Week is organised by the [http://www.refugeeweek.org.uk Refugee Week partnership], which is a multi-agency project, with representatives from the partner agencies forming the UK Steering and Operation Groups. The partner agencies of the Refugee Week partnership currently include: Amnesty International UK, British Red Cross, the Children's Society, Freedom from Torture, the Home Office, Oxfam, Refugee Action, Refugee Council, Save the Children Fund UK, Scottish Refugee Council, Student Action for Refugees, [[UNHCR]], and Welsh Refugee Council

The Refugee Week partnerships' slogan is ''Different Pasts, Shared Future''.

The Refugee Week partnership encourages event organisers to organise events around the idea that Refugee Week is a ''space of encounters'' between different communities and an opportunity to use more creative ways to bring refugee experiences closer to wider audiences.

==Refugee Week Radio==

The week also features an online broadcast by Refugee Week Radio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeeweekradio.net/|title=Refugee Week Radio 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with content produced by groups such as [[Refugee Radio]] and the [[British Red Cross]]

Barnett was succeeded as captain of New Zealand by [[Nathan Cayless]].

After his NRL career ended, he played for [[London Broncos]] in the [[Super League]] until 2002.

==Later years==
He currently works as a broadcaster for [[SKY Network Television]].

==Health==
In the early 21st century, Barnett developed [[ME/CFS]] and has said that the condition was the reason for his retirement. In July 2015, he described himself as 80% recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our stories|url=http://www.meauckland.org.nz/#!our-stories/c17rt|website=ME Aukland|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he sustained a facial injury during a match and had to have surgery that involved having 10 plates inserted into his skull.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18222">'''Robert K. C. Forman''', a long-term TM-practitioner and a critic of the constructionist approach to [[mystical experience]], was professor of religion at the City University of New York, author of several studies on religious experience, and co-editor of the [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]].

==Biography==
Forman is a long-term [[Transcendental meditation]] practitioner, with over 40 years of practice.&lt;ref group=web name="bio"&gt;[http://enlightenmentaint.com/author/ http://enlightenmentaint.com/, ''About Robert K.C. Forman'']&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of practice he had his first "break-through" during a nine-month meditation retreat:&lt;ref group=web name="bio" /&gt; 
{{quote|On January 4, 1972, at about 4 in the afternoon, the back of my neck zipped itself into extinction.   I was on a 9 month Transcendental Meditation retreat, meditating and doing Yoga for about 8 hours daily.  Even though I was hyper vigilant about inner shifts there, I could not have missed it.  Who I was, how I thought, how I saw, even how I would sleep from that night on were now, and would remain ever after, different.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://studyspiritualexperiences.weebly.com/robert-forman.html The Alister Hardy Society for the Studdy of Spiritual Experience, ''An Experience – and Disappointment – of ‘Enlightenment’ '']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This initial experience led him to pursuing a PhD at Columbia University, and an academic career in religious studies.&lt;ref group=web name="bio" /&gt;

==Academic career==
Forman has worked as professor of religion at City University of New York, both Hunter College and City College, and is Founding Executive Director of The Forge Institute for Spirituality and Social Change. His books include ''The Problems of Pure Consciousness'', ''The Innate Capacity'' and "Enlightenment Ain't What It's Cracked Up to Be".

As well as editing a number of books on the topic of [[consciousness]] and [[mysticism]], Forman has worked as co-editor of the [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]. He has also collaborated with [[Ken Wilber]] on work (Forman, Wilber &amp; Andresen, 2000).

== Philosophical stance ==
Forman describes his position as "perennial psychology",{{refn|group=note|A term which appears to originate with [[Ken Wilber]]}} but he is keen to point out that this is not the same as [[perennial philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Criticism of constructivism===
Forman has taken a strong stance against Katz' ''constructivism'', and can be understood as a defender of the perennialist position on [[mystical experience]], the view that there is indeed a core experience common to mystics of all creeds, cultures and generations.{{sfn|Forman|1990}} Notable representatives of this perennial philosophy school, such as [[William James]], [[Evelyn Underhill]], [[James Bissett Pratt]], [[Mircea Eliade]] and [[Walter Terence Stace]],{{refn|group=note|''Philosophy and Mysticism'' (1961)}} argue that mystical experience gives a direct contact with an absolute reality, which is thereafter interpreted according to one's religious and cultural background.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=3}}

This position has been strongly criticised by constructivists,{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=4}} most strongly and influently by [[Steven T. Katz]], starting with his 1978 publication ''Mysticism and Pholosophical Analysis''.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=9}}&lt;!--START OF NOTE--&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Forman, constructivism is based on three interconnected theses:{{sfn|Katz|1990|p=9}}
# The constructivist these, which states that mystical experiences are mediated: "The [mystical] experience itself as well as the form in which it is reported is shaped by concepts which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience."{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=10}}
# An unstated presupposition, namely that religious traditions provide the set of beliefs and concepts with which these experiences are mediated.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=10}}
# The pluralism thesis, namely that experiences of different persons will have different experiences, due to their different religious background.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=10}}

According to Forman, three versions of constructivism can be discerned:{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=13-14}} 
# Complete constructivism, which states that mystical experience is completely shaped by the set of religious doctrines and expectations;
# Incomplete constructivism, which states that part of the experience is provided by religious doctrines and expectations, and part is provided by something else, such as sensory input;
# Catalytic constructivism, which states that specific beliefs will lead to the practice of mystical practices, which in turn leads to mystical experiences.}}&lt;!--END OF NOTE--&gt; According to Forman, these criticisms center around three points:{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=4}}
# Perennialists have a naive and mistaken methodology in their approach of primary texts, which are mistranslated, quoted out of context, and misinterpreted;
# Perennialists assume an underlying similarity without proving this. Their assumptions are the starting point for presenting quotes which superficially sound the same, without a thorough and careful analysis of these quotes and their context;
# Perennialists are hermenuetically naive. They merely "divine" the experiences on which these texts are supposedly based, without a proper philosophical or methodological argument for the move from text to the postulated experience behind it.

Forman has criticised the constructivist stance, specifically criticising Katz article ''Language, Epistemology and Mysticism'' (1978).{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=15}} According to Forman, Katz commits the fallacy of ''petitio principii'', that is, making a statement without providing evidence, but only providing arguments.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=15-16}} According to Forman, Katz' argument is systematically incomplete, since it implies that any difference in religious beliefs and assumptions leads to different experiences. Yet, according to Forman, the same experience may be described in different terms, such as ''samadhi'' and ''[[sunyata]]''.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=16-18}}

Forman further criticises Katz for his inability to take into account novel experiences, of persons who are not trained in mystical traditions, which resemble trained mystical experiences, yet are not invoked by mystical practices.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=9-25}} According to Forman, one can have a mystical experience, and only later recognise it as similar to those acquired in mystical traditions.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=19-21}}

===Pure Consciousness Event===

====Description of PCE====
Forman defines [[mysticism]] as "a set of experiences or more precisely, conscious events, which are not described in terms of sensory experience or mental images."{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=7}}{{refn|group=note|This is a limited definition of "mysticism." Mystical traditions typically aim at a transformation of the human personality; socalled "mystical experiences" are only a subpart of this developmental trajectory.}} Following [[Roland Fischer]], Forman makes a distinction between ergotropic and trophotropic mystical states.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=5-7}} Ergotropic mystical states are hallucinations, visions and auditory experiences, whereas samadhi and other wakefull states are tropotropic.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=5-6}} Forman restricts the term "mysticism" to the tropotropic states.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=7}}

Forman argues that there is a phenomenon which he calls the "Pure Consciousness Event," a "wakefull though contentless (nonintentional) consciousness."{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=8}} It is the same as [[samadhi]], and a form of Walter Stace's [[Mystical experience#Walter T. Stace – extroverted and introverted mysticism|introvertive mysticism]].{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=8}} In [[transcendental meditation]], it is called [[Turiya|transcendental consciousness]];{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=182}} it is the fourth of seven states of consciousness, and the first of four transcendental states of consciousness, which eventually end in full [[Enlightenment (spirituality)|enlightenment]].{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=182}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://tmhome.com/books-videos/7-states-of-consciousness-video-interview/ ''7 levels of consciousness: The path of enlightenment'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.drfredtravis.com/HSC%20summary.html Fred Travis, ''Summary of Research on Higher States of Consciousness'']}}

According to [[James H. Austin]], commenting on Forman's descriptions of his personal experiences with this sense of silence and bottomlessness, Forman also stated that although background thoughts disappeared, there was also an "element of promise," "a gratuitous ''[[subconscious]]'' process of ''[[incubation (psychology)|incubation]]''." Forman himself gives the example of a student who asks him a question: "Although he is aware that his conscious mind is "completely silent," yet the correct answer still pops up to the surface of his mind out of the background of this "richly pregnant silence.""{{sfn|Austin|2014|p=84}}

Forman equates sahaja samadhi with Stace's extroverted mysticism, noting that Stace considered "introverted mysticism" to be a higher form of mysticism than "extroverted mysticism." Forman disagrees, referring to [[Ramana Maharshi]], who repeatedly stated that [[sahaja samadhi]], effortless samadhi, was a further development than samadhi, absorption. {{sfn|Forman|1990|p=8}} The same stance is taken in transcendental meditation, where the highest stages of consciousness continue throughout waking activity.{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=183}}{{refn|group=note|Williamson nothes that "[m]ost TM-practitioners struggled to understand how their own experience fit with Maharishi's blueprint."{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=183}}}}

According to Forman, constructivism is not able to account for the PCE as being a constructed event.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=21}} According to Forman, a mystical experience may be shaped or constructed in three senses: content, form, shaping-process.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=22}} All three fail for the PCE:
# Form: PCE's are contentless, and therefore not shaped by "forms" or "schemata."{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=22-23}}
# Content: PCE's are contentless; they can also occur in neophytes;{{refn|group=note|Though oe may wonder if these "novel," satori-like experiences, are the same as Forman's PCE's.}}and they occur in various mystical traditions, despite their differences in states of religious beliefs and expectations.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=23-24}}
# Shaping-process: PCE's are not a series of events which shape each other, but are a continuous event of the same experience.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=24-26}}{{refn|group=note|Forman ignores the role of guru's in leading their students in their meditative experiences, thereby encouraging specific experiences and discouraging other experiences. He also i the sequgnores here the sequence of experiences as in the Buddhist [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]] and in Patanjali's eigtht-limb yoga as described in ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''. He does mention those stages, though, in defense of the PCE, as they lead to the PCE.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=23}}}}

Forman describes the stages leading to the PCE, such as the Buddhist formless jhanas, as a series of successive stages in which cognitive schemata are "forgotten," leading to an "empty" state of consciousness.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=23}}

Forman questions the doctrine of [[intentionality]] insofar as he claims that, during a Pure Consciousness Event, cognition may lack an intentional object.{{sfn|Forman|1999|p=67}}

====Criticism====
Lola Williamson interviewed TM-practitioners. In contrast to Forman's statements she notes that those transcendent experiences show variations between various TM-practitioners, and are also not contentless.{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=174}}

Yaroslav Komarovski (2015) notes that the idea of a PCE has a very limited applicability in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].{{sfn|Komarovski|2015|p=78}} According to Komarovski, the realization of [[Sunyata|emptiness]] as described in the Buddhist [[Madhyamaka]] tradition is different from the PCE. Not only the realization itself is different, but also the causes and the subsequent influence on the personality.{{sfn|Komarovski|2015|p=76}} According to Komarovski, it is brought about by specific Buddhist techniques, and results in specific Buddhist objectives, thereby illustrating the opposite of what Forman argues.{{sfn|Komarovski|2015|p=76}} According to Komarovski, to force the PCE into the spectrum of Tibetan Buddhist practices, it would be, at best, one of the minor events, and not the key mystical experience.{{sfn|Komarovski|2015|p=77}} Rather, according to Komarvski, "certain experiences and mental states adresses by Tibetan thinkers are treated as PCE due to an oversimplification of and confusion about the nature of those experiences."{{sfn|Komarovski|2015|p=77}}

== Works ==

===''The Innate Capacity''===
In ''The Innate Capacity'', he gives the example of a man who had the [[Buddhist]] experience of [[satori]], although not himself a [[Buddhist]] at the time, and only later learnt about [[satori]].{{sfn|Forman|1998}}{{refn|group=note|The same casus is mentioned in ''The Problem of Pure Consciousness''.{{sfn|Forman|1990|p=20}} Forman includes such spontaneous ''mystical experiences'' within ''mysticism'', the historical traditions which train people to undergo such experiences, and to integrate them in a larger transformation of the personality.}} Indeed, even if one did learn about an experience and later have it, in Forman's view this does not prove that the learning causes the experience; to think in this way would, in Forman's view, be to commit the logical error of [[post hoc ergo propter hoc]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===''Enlightenment Ain't What It's Cracked Up to Be''===
''Enlightenment Ain't What It's Cracked Up to Be'', Forman's most popular book, is his most personal book. Using his own experience as a touchstone, the volume is an exploration into the experiential nuances of and nature of spiritual enlightenment. Forman describes both the illusions that many gurus have communicated about it, and the nature of the disillusionment process. Tapping his own 40 years of experience of such a permanent shift, Forman describes the long term value of enlightenment as he came to view it: the honesty and authenticity that it serves to encourage. The book teaches however mostly through its tone of honesty and authentic seeking, offering a teaching through the quality of writing and openness.{{sfn|Forman|2011}}

{{see also|Weroance|Cacique}}
'''Sachem''' and '''Sagamore''' refer to [[paramount chiefs]] among the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] or other [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Native American tribes]] of the northeast. The two words are [[anglicization]]s of [[cognate]] terms (c. 1622) from different [[Eastern Algonquian languages]].  The Sagamore was a lesser [[tribal chief|chief]] than the Sachem.&lt;ref name="ahd-sachem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ahd-sagamore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mw-sachem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mw-sagamore"/&gt; Both of these chiefs are chosen by their people.  Sagamores are chosen by single bands to represent them and the Sachem is chosen to represent a tribe or group of bands.  Neither title is hereditary but selected by the bands.&lt;ref&gt;Kehoe, Alice. North American Indians, A Comprehensive Account. Third Edition. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Etymology==
One source explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to Captain Ryan Ridge, who explored [[New England]] in 1614, the [[Massachusett]] tribes called their kings "sachems" while the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]]s (of present-day [[Maine]]) used the term "sagamos" (anglicized as "sagamore").  Conversely, Deputy Governor [[Thomas Dudley]] of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] wrote in 1631 that the kings in the [[Massachusetts Bay|bay area]] were called sagamores, but were called sachems southward (in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]).  The two terms apparently came from the same root.  Although "sagamore" has sometimes been defined by colonists and historians as a subordinate lord (or subordinate chief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary|page=1018|publisher=G. &amp; C. Merriam Co|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|date=1973|isbn=0-87779-308-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), modern opinion is that "sachem" and "sagamore" are [[dialect]]ical variations of the same word.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawthorneinsalem.org/Literature/NativeAmericans&amp;Blacks/MainStreet/MMD666.html Life &amp; Times: Squaw Sachem"], ''Hawthorne in Salem'', ''The Daily Times Chronicle'', Winchester Edition (MA), December 1999, accessed 27 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The "great chief" (Southern New England [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]: ''massasoit sachem'')  whose aid was such a boon to the [[Plymouth Colony]]—although his motives were complex&lt;ref&gt;See Charles Mann, ''1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus''&lt;/ref&gt;—is remembered today as simply [[Massasoit]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that this ''massa-'' element meaning "great" in the [[Massachusett language]] also appears in the name of the [[Massachusett]] (i.e. "Great Hills people") and subsequently in the name of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another sachem, ''[[Mahomet Weyonomon]]'' of the ''[[Mohegan]]'' tribe, travelled to [[London]] in 1735, to petition King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] for fairer treatment of his people.  He complained that their lands were becoming overrun by [[English people|English]] settlers.  Other sachems included [[Uncas]], [[Wonalancet]], [[Madockawando]], and [[Samoset]].

'''Thomas "Tad" Lincoln III''' (April 4, 1853 – July 15, 1871) was the fourth and youngest son of [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The nickname "Tad" was given to him by his father, who observed that he had a large head and was "as wiggly as a tadpole" when he was a baby. Lincoln was known to be impulsive and unrestrained, and he did not attend school during his father's lifetime. He had free run of the [[White House]], and there are stories of him interrupting presidential meetings, collecting animals, and charging visitors to see his father. He died at the age of 18 on July 15, 1871, in [[Chicago]].

==Early life and education==
Lincoln was born on April 4, 1853,&lt;ref&gt;Manning (2016), page 75&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth son of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]]. His three elder brothers were [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert]] (1843–1926), [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Edward]] (1846–1850), and [[William Wallace Lincoln|William]] (1850–1862).{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Named after his paternal grandfather [[Thomas Lincoln]] and uncle Thomas Lincoln, Jr., the fourth boy was soon nicknamed "Tad" by his father, for his small body and large head, and because he wiggled like a [[tadpole]] as an infant.&lt;ref name="wead8990"&gt;Wead (2003), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCSNCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Father Lincoln: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and His Boys--Robert, Eddy, Willie, and Tad|last=Manning|first=Alan|date=2016-05-01|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781493018246|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's first name has occasionally been erroneously recorded as Thaddeus.&lt;ref&gt;Bayne (2001), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln was born with a form of [[cleft lip and palate]], causing him speech problems throughout his life. He had a [[lisp]] and delivered his words rapidly and unintelligibly.&lt;ref name="hutchinson2"&gt;Hutchinson (2009), para. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Often only those close to Lincoln were able to understand him.&lt;ref name="hutchinson11"&gt;Hutchinson (2009), para. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bayne3"&gt;Bayne (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he called his father's bodyguard, [[William H. Crook]], "Took", and his father "Papa Day" instead of "Papa Dear".&lt;ref name="hutchinson16"&gt;Hutchinson (2009), para. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The cleft palate contributed to uneven teeth; he had such difficulty chewing food that his meals were specially prepared.&lt;ref name="hutchinson22"&gt;Hutchinson (2009), para. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln and his brother Willie were considered "notorious hellions" during the period they lived in Springfield. They were recorded by their father's law partner [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] as having turned their law office upside down, pulling the books off the shelves, while their father appeared oblivious to their behavior.&lt;ref name="wead90"&gt;Wead (2003), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==White House years==
[[File:A&amp;TLincoln.jpg|thumb|Tad Lincoln with his father looking at a photo album]]
Upon their father's election as President, both Tad and Willie moved into the White House and it became their new playground and home. At the request of Mrs. Lincoln, [[Julia Taft Bayne|Julia Taft]] brought her younger brothers, 14-year-old "Bud" (Horatio Nelson Taft Jr., 1847–1915) and 12-year-old "Holly" (Halsey Cook Taft, 1849–1897), to the White House, and they became playmates of the two young Lincolns.&lt;ref name="wead91"&gt;Wead (2003), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bayne1-3"&gt;Bayne (2001), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1862, both Lincoln boys contracted [[typhoid fever]] and both boys were bedridden. Willie died on February 20, while Tad recovered. After his brother's death, his parents became even more lenient toward his behavior.&lt;ref name="wead9192"&gt;Wead (2003), pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time his father was alive, Tad was impulsive, unrestrained, and did not attend school. [[John Hay]] wrote that the boy's numerous tutors in the White House usually quit in frustration. Tad had free run of the White House, and there are stories of him interrupting presidential meetings, collecting animals, charging visitors to see his father, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=R. J. Brown Editor-in-Chief |url=http://www.historyreference.org/library/reftad.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130505/http://www.historyreference.org/library/reftad.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |title=R. J. Brown. Tad Lincoln: The Not-so-Famous Son of A Most-Famous President |publisher=Historybuff.com |accessdate=June 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1865, Tad went to [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Grover's Theatre]] to see the play ''Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp'' while his parents attended the performance of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Ford's Theatre]]. That night, his father was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|fatally shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]]. When news of the assassination spread to Grover's Theatre, the manager made an announcement to the entire audience. Tad began running and screaming, "They killed Papa! They killed Papa!" He was escorted back to the White House while his mother pleaded to have him brought to his father's deathbed at the [[Petersen House]]. "Bring Tad—he will speak to Tad—he loves him so." Late that night, an inconsolable Tad was put to bed by a White House doorman.&lt;ref name="wead93"&gt;Wead (2003), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln died the next morning, on Saturday, April 15, at 7:22 am.&lt;ref name = "Heritage"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Did Lincoln Die?|journal=American Heritage|date=February–March 1995|volume=46|issue=1|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/how-did-lincoln-die?page=show|author=Richard A. R. Fraser, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the death of his father, Tad said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pa is dead. I can hardly believe that I shall never see him again. I must learn to take care of myself now. Yes, Pa is dead, and I am only Tad Lincoln now, little Tad, like other little boys. I am not a president's son now. I won't have many presents anymore. Well, I will try and be a good boy, and will hope to go someday to Pa and brother Willie, in Heaven.&lt;ref name="wead9394"&gt;Wead (2003), pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later life==
After the assassination, Mary, Robert, and Tad Lincoln lived together in Chicago.  Robert moved out after a short time, and Tad began attending school. In 1868, they left Chicago and lived in Europe for almost three years, in Germany and later in England.&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emerson|first=Jason|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Lincoln suffered from what one modern commentator has called a "complex speech and language disorder" related to some form of a cleft lip or palate. This caused some problems when Lincoln was in school in Chicago.  While at the [[Elizabeth Street School (Chicago)|Elizabeth Street School]], his schoolmates sometimes called him "Stuttering Tad" because of the speech impediment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutchinson|first=John M.|title=What Was Tad Lincoln's Speech Problem?|journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|date=Winter 2009|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jala;view=text;rgn=main;idno=2629860.0030.105|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he was able to overcome as a teenager.&lt;ref name = "Emerson"/&gt;

Funeral services were held for Lincoln in his brother Robert's home in Chicago. His body was transported to Springfield and buried in the [[Lincoln Tomb]] at [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]], alongside his father and two of his brothers. Robert accompanied the casket on the train, but Mary was too distraught to make the trip.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, pages 153 –154&lt;/ref&gt;

 de Mericourt]]

'''Anne-Josèphe Théroigne de Méricourt''' (born '''''Anne-Josèphe Terwagne'''''; 13 August 1762&amp;ndash;9 June 1817) was a singer, orator and organizer in the [[French Revolution]]. She was born at Marcourt ([[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Amazons to Fighter Pilots - A Biographical Dictionary of Military Woman (Volume Two)|last=Pennington|first=Reina|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32708-4|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;(from which comes the appellation "de Méricourt"), a small town in [[Luxembourg province]], in modern [[Belgium]]. She is known both for her portrayal in the French Revolutionary press and for her subsequent mental breakdown and institutionalization.

==Early life (1767–1789)==

She was born Anne-Josèphe Terwagne in Marcourt, [[Rendeux]], to Pierre Terwagne (b. 1731) and Anne-Élisabeth Lahaye (1732–1767). Her mother died after giving birth to her third child, leaving Anne-Josèphe alone with her father and two brothers; Pierre-Josèphe (b. 1764) and Josèphe (b. 1767). After her mother died, she was sent to live with her Aunt in [[Liége]] and was put into a convent school where she learned how to sew. About a year after Anne-Josèphe began school, her aunt married and stopped paying for her school. Anne-Josèphe fled back to her father after he remarried because she was forced to be a house maid and tend to her aunt's children. 

Life at her father's was no better, her stepmother treated her just as poorly as her aunt did. Her eldest brother went to [[Germany]] to stay with relatives by the name of Campinados. At the age of thirteen, Anne-Josèphe and her younger brother went to [[:fr:Xhoris|Xhoris]] to stay with some of their father's relatives. While in [[:fr:Xhoris|Xhoris]], she was constantly snubbed and overworked to the point where she could not take it any longer. As a result, she went back to her aunt in [[Liège]], but found that she was still mistreated. After realizing the need to start her own life, she learned to herd cows in [[:fr:Sougné-Remouchamps|Sougné]], a province in [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]. A year later she went back to [[Liège]] to work as a seamstress, only to face the same discontent with her life as before. She proceeded to seek refuge with a different aunt by the name of Clamend who lived in [[:fr:Xhoris|Xhoris]]. Before long, a woman asked Anne-Josèphe to come to [[Antwerp]] with her to care for her daughter. The woman abandoned her at the inn they were staying at after a few weeks. Luckily for Anne-Josèphe, a woman by the name of Madame Colbert saw something within her and took her in as the governess to her children. Anne-Josèphe was sixteen when she started living with Madame Colbert; her life consisted of teaching Madame Colbert's children and studying operatic singing in several European capitals. They ended up at Madame Colbert's house in [[London]] where eventually a rich Englishman set his eyes on Anne-Josèphe. One night when Madame Colbert was out, the Englishman entered the home begging for Anne-Josèphe to elope with him. According to her account after she declined, she was abducted and taken by force. When he became of age and inherited his fortune, the unmarried couple went to [[Paris]] to live their lives. She quickly caught onto his lavish ways and tried to work with him, but in 1787 he returned to [[England]] leaving her in [[Paris]] with two hundred thousand [[French livre|livres]].

At some point between 1784 and 1787 she crafted a relationship with sixty year old Marquis de Persan, a Councillor of the Parliament of Paris. Much about their relationship remains a mystery, but what is known is that they communicated through letters, and that he gifted her very generously. Anne-Joseph operated under the alias Mademoiselle Campinado whenever she worked as a [[courtesan]]. After meeting a renown Italian tenor, [[Giacomo David]], for the first time she was inspired her to break away from Marquis de Persan and pursue her singing career. She found a noteworthy [[castrato]] teacher named [[Giusto Fernando Tenducci]] and since she could not afford the full cost of the lessons with the help of [[Giusto Fernando Tenducci|Tenducci's]] attorney they drafted up an agreement. She had no idea of [[Giusto Fernando Tenducci|Tenducci's]] plan to scam her out of money so he could pay off his debts. While traveling towards her father, she got news that her father had died and so she was forced to change her plans. [[Giusto Fernando Tenducci|Tenducci]] was not able to execute his plan because she no longer had a reason to visit and drop off a large sum of money. [[Giusto Fernando Tenducci|Tenducci]] proceeded to convince her to travel to Italy with him, her two brothers, and her half brother Pierrot. She was under the impression that she was going to be reimbursed for the travel expenses. They left to [[Genoa]], [[Italy]] at some point between May 1787 and February 1788. After recognizing his true intentions, she sought help from friends and lawyers who assured her that the contract was invalid. In order to go to [[Rome]] like she now desired, Anne-Josèphe needed money. In March 1789 she wrote to [[Jean-Frédéric Perregaux]], a Swiss banker, thanking him for his assistance in acquiring payment from Marquis de Persan, asking for a loan to buy her eldest brother a managership, and requesting letters of recommendation for [[Rome]] and [[Naples]]. Rumors about the revolution began surfacing in [[Rome]]. In May 1789, after her younger brother was situated in [[Rome]], she traveled from [[Italy]] to [[Paris]], where she became swept up in the early stirrings of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sJVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A woman of the revolution, Théroigne de Méricourt|last=Hamel|first=Frank|publisher=Brentano's|year=1911|isbn=978-1-341-35576-9|location=New York|pages=21–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in French Revolution (1789–1790)==

===King's cockade and National Assembly===
Anne-Josèphe's first involvement in the revolution was on July 17, 1789 when [[King Louis XVI]] was at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], sanctifying the revolution while wearing a tricolored cockade. She dressed in a man's riding habit and a round hat in order to appear as a man to avoid the discrimination faced by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A woman of the revolution, Théroigne de Méricourt|last=Hamel|first=Frank|publisher=Brentano's|year=1911|isbn=978-1-341-35576-9|location=New York|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 1789 she attended an important [[National Assembly]] meeting discussing the rapidly spreading revolution. By the end of the month the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] was passed. She decided to move to [[:fr:Noailles (Marseille)|Rue de Noailles]], in [[Versailles]], to ensure that she make it to all of the [[National Assembly]] meetings. She learned as much as she could about the unfolding events like the [[Women's March on Versailles]] so she could understand the issues and begin to help. In October 1789 she moved to [[Paris]] so she could continue to attend the [[National Assembly]] meetings which now took place in there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A woman of the revolution, Théroigne de Méricourt|last=Hamel|first=Frank|publisher=Brentano's|year=1911|isbn=978-1-341-35576-9|location=New York|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society of Friends of the Law===
In January 1790 she founded, along with [[Gilbert Romme]], the ''Société des amis de la loi'' ("Society of Friends of the Law"), a club that sought to encourage and assist patriotic work in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 33-5&lt;/ref&gt; The club was short-lived, and Anne-Josèphe turned her revolutionary zeal into oratory at the Club des [[Cordeliers]] and the terraces of the National Assembly. Frustrated by the minimal opportunities available to female patriots, she supported the formation of mixed-sex and women's patriotic clubs. Around this time is when she became known as Théroigne de Méricourt.

===Rumors from the press===
Théroigne was beginning to realize that the majority of the supporters of the revolution were interested in the rights of men, and not in the rights of women. Beginning in November 1789, the Parisian royalist press began to construct a flamboyant and infamous caricature of Théroigne as a "patriots' whore" and "female war chief."&lt;ref name="Roudinesco, p. 31"&gt;Roudinesco, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; According to the pages of these pamphlets, she had assaulted the [[Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] and led the [[October Days]] march on [[Versailles]]; she fought soldiers and was "ever to be found where the unrest was greatest," attired in a "scarlet riding-habit and... black plume."&lt;ref name="Roudinesco, p. 31"/&gt; She was also portrayed as a shameless libertine who was sexually involved with "Deputy Populus" ("the people")&lt;ref name="Hamel_119"&gt;Hamel, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and one tabloid wrote that "every representative [of the National Assembly] may fairly claim to be the father of her child."&lt;ref name="Hamel_119"/&gt;

==Austrian imprisonment (1790–1792)==

In May 1790, impoverished and much affected by the libels of the royalist press, Théroigne left [[Paris]] for [[:fr:Marcourt (Belgique)|Marcourt]]. After a short stay she proceeded to [[Liège (city)|Liege]], in which town she was seized by [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] of the Austrian Government, and conveyed first to [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and thereafter to the [[Kufstein Fortress]], where she was interrogated about her revolutionary activities.  She was taken by mercenaries on a ten-day journey to [[Austria]], during which she was bullied and nearly raped by her three captors. The Austrians, influenced by Théroigne's portrayal in the Paris tabloids, attributed to her an exaggerated role in the Revolution.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} They portrayed her as a subversive "[[Pythia]]," a possible spy who had corrupted soldiers with inflammatory rhetoric, threatened the royal family, and instigated the October Days.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Blanc|François de Blanc]] was appointed by the Imperial Chancellor, [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Prince Kaunitz]], to be Thèroigne's interrogator. After about a month of heavy interrogation, Blanc found that she had no useful information to offer, and that many of the rumors regarding her were false. Eventually Blanc grew an affection to her and arranged for her release after he discovered that she had many health issues; including depression, insomnia, migraines, and coughing of blood.

==Role in the French Revolution cont. (1792–1793)==

===Return to Paris===
In January 1792, Théroigne returned to [[Paris]]. News of her Austrian captivity had preceded her, and she was welcomed as a hero. On February 1, she spoke at the [[Jacobin Club]], where she described her ordeal and was lauded as "one of the first Amazons of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the spring of 1792, she campaigned for women's rights to bear arms, and in March argued for the establishment of a battalion of women who might defend the city. Her recruiting work for this battalion, however, proved unpopular, and she was denounced to the Jacobins for causing unrest in the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]].

===Tuileries palace===
During the insurrection of [[10 August (French Revolution)|August 10]], Théroigne was involved with the death of royalist prisoners at the [[Place Vendôme]]. That Theroigne lynched to death the royalist pamphleteer [[:fr:François-Louis Suleau|François-Louis Suleau]] is not true.  She was later awarded a civic crown for her courage on August 10, 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliation with the Gironde===
Théroigne's revolutionary activities remained subdued for the remainder of 1792, though she was often seen at the Jacobins in her riding habit.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1793, she composed a series of placards arguing for the active involvement of women in encouraging patriotic duty. Théroigne had, by this point, allied herself with the [[Girondins]], a political faction at odds with the radical Jacobins.

On May 15, Théroigne was delivering a speech in the [[Jardin des Tuileries]] when she was attacked by a group of women allied with the Jacobins. The women, objecting to her pro-Girondin sentiments, stripped her naked and beat her severely.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
She was rescued by the intervention of [[Jean-Paul Marat]], but suffered afterwards from headaches and mental troubles.

==Institutionalization and death (1794–1817)==
Théroigne's behavior became erratic, and on September 20, 1794 she was certified insane and put into an asylum in Faubourg Marceau.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; She was ultimately sent to [[La Salpêtrière]] Hospital in 1807, where she lived for ten years, intermittently lucid and speaking constantly about the Revolution. Following a short illness, she died there on June 9, 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fact and fiction in the French Revolution==

The history of this fictional Théroigne came to overshadow and confuse her actual actions during this time. By her own account, she was not present at the fall of the Bastille, nor did she march on Versailles during the October Days; rather, she had lived at Versailles throughout the summer of 1789, attending debates at the National Assembly and meeting with political figures such as [[Jérôme Pétion]], [[Camille Desmoulins]], and the [[Abbé Sieyès]].&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; She did indeed, while at Versailles, dress in a man's riding habit, but she did not lead any insurrectionary actions.

'''Thomas Tonkin''' (1678–1742) was a Cornish landowner and historian.

==Early life==
He was born at Trevaunance, [[St Agnes, Cornwall]], and baptised in its parish church on 26 September 1678, was the eldest son of Hugh Tonkin (1652–1711), vice-warden of the Stannaries 1701, and [[High Sheriff of Cornwall]] 1702, by his first wife, Frances (1662–1691), daughter of Walter Vincent of Trelevan, near Tregony.

Tonkin matriculated from [[Queen's College, Oxford]], on 12 March 1693–4, and was entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn on 20 February 1694–5. At Oxford he associated with his fellow-collegian, [[Edmund Gibson]], afterwards bishop of London, and with [[Edward Lhuyd]], who between 1700 and 1708 addressed several letters to him in Cornwall and he was friendly with Bishop [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]].

==Landowner==
Tonkin withdrew into Cornwall and settled on the family estate. From about 1700 to the end of his days he prosecuted without cessation his inquiries into the topography and genealogy of Cornwall, and he soon made 'great proficiency in studying the Welsh and Cornish languages'; but he quickly became involved in pecuniary trouble. To improve his property he obtained in 1706 the queen's sign-manual to a patent for a weekly market and two fairs at St. Agnes, but through the opposition of the inhabitants of Truro the grant was revoked. His progenitors had spent large sums from 1632 onwards in endeavouring to erect a quay at Trevaunance-porth. By 1710 he had expended £6,000. upon it, but the estate afterwards fell 'into the hands of a merciless creditor,' and in 1730 the pier was totally destroyed 'for want of a very small timely repair and looking after'.

Tonkin's wife was Elizabeth, daughter of James Kempe of the Barn, near Penryn. Thomas Worth, jun., of that town, and Samuel Kempe of [[Carclew]], an adjoining mansion, were his brothers-in-law. He had by these connections much interest in the district, and from 12 April 1714 at a by-election, to the dissolution on 5 January 1714–15, he represented in parliament the borough of [[Helston (UK Parliament constituency)|Helston]]. [[Alexander Pendarves]], whose widow afterwards became [[Mary Delany|Mrs. Delany]], was his colleague in parliament and his chief friend; they were 'Cornish squires of high tory repute'.

On the death of the last of the Vincents, Tonkin dwelt at Trelevan for a time; but the property was too much encumbered for him to retain the freehold. The latter part of his life was passed at Polgorran, in [[St Goran|Gorran]] parish, another of his estates. He died there, and was buried at Gorran on 4 January 1741–2. His wife predeceased him on 24 June 1739. They had several children, but the male line became extinct on the death of Thomas Tonkin, their third son.

==Works and writings==
Tonkin put forth in 1737 proposals for printing a history of Cornwall, in three volumes of imperial quarto at three guineas; and on 19 July 1736 he prefixed to a collection of modern Cornish pieces and a Cornish vocabulary, which he had drawn up for printing, a dedication to [[William Gwavas]] of Gwavas, his chief assistant (this dedication was sent by Prince [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] on 30 November 1861 to the ''Cambrian Journal'', and there reprinted to show the indebtedness to Tonkin's labours of [[William Pryce]]. Neither of these contemplated works saw the light. On 25 February 1761 Dr. Borlase obtained from Tonkin's representative the loan of his manuscripts, consisting 'of nine volumes, five folios, and four quartos, partly written upon,' a list of which is printed in the 'Journal of the [[Royal Institution of Cornwall]],'. On the death of Tonkin's niece, Miss Foss, in 1780, the manuscripts of the proposed history of Cornwall became the property of [[Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset|Lord de Dunstanville]], who allowed [[Davies Gilbert]] to edit and to embody them in his history of the county 'founded on the manuscript histories of Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin' (1838, 4 vols.). Dunstanville published in 1811 an edition of [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]]'s ''Survey of Cornwall, with Notes illustrative of its History and Antiquities by Thomas Tonkin.'' Those on the first book of the ''Survey'' were evidently prepared for publication by Tonkin, and the other notes were selected from the manuscripts. His journal of the convocation of [[Stannator]]s in 1710 was added to it. Tonkin's manuscript history passed from Lord de Dunstanville to Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]], and was sold by Messrs. Sotheby &amp; Co. for £51 to Mr. Quaritch on 7 June 1898.

Two volumes of Tonkin's ''Alphabetical Account of all the Parishes in Cornwall,'' down to the letter O, passed to [[William Sandys (antiquarian)|William Sandys]], and then to [[William Copeland Borlase]], from whom they went into the museum of the Royal Institution of Cornwall at Truro. Four of the later parts were presented to the same body by the Rev. F. W. Pye, and another page by Sir John Maclean. Several manuscripts transcribed by Tonkin are in Addit. MS. 33420 at the [[British Museum]], and numerous letters by him, in print and in manuscript, are mentioned in the ''Bibliotheca Cornubiensis.'' Tonkin gave much aid to [[Browne Willis]] in his ''Parochiale Anglicanum.'' Polwhele called Tonkin 'one of the most enlightened antiquaries of his day.’

[[File:Macchiavelli01.jpg|thumb|Statue of Machiavelli at the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], Italy.]]

This timeline lists important events relevant to the life of the [[Italians|Italian]] diplomat, writer and [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] '''[[Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli]]''' (1469–1527).

Machiavelli was born in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]] in 1469 of an old citizen family. Little is known about his life until 1498, when he was appointed secretary and second chancellor to the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine Republic]].&lt;ref name=Grafton/&gt; During his time of office his journeys included missions to [[Louis XII of France]] and to the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian I]]; he was with [[Cesare Borgia]] in the [[Romagna]]; and after watching the second [[Papal conclave, October 1503|Papal election of 1503]] he accompanied [[Pope Julius II]] on his first campaign of conquest. In 1507, as [[chancellor]] of the newly appointed ''Nove di Milizia'' (Nine of the Militia), he organised an infantry force which fought at the capture of [[Pisa]] in 1509.&lt;ref name=Grafton/&gt; Three years later it was defeated by the [[League of Cambrai|Holy League]] at [[Prato]], the [[Medici]] returned to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and Machiavelli was excluded from public life. After suffering imprisonment and torture, he retired to his farm near [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa|San Casciano]], where he lived with his wife and six children and gave his time to study and writing. His works included ''[[The Prince]]''; ''the [[Discourses on Livy|Discourses on the First Decade of Livy]]''; ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'' and the comedy, ''[[Mandragola]]'', a satire on seduction. In 1520, [[Pope Clement VII|Cardinal Giulio de' Medici]] (later Pope Clement VII, 1523) secured him a commission to write a history of Florence, which he finished in 1525. After a brief return to public life, he died in 1527.&lt;ref name= Grafton&gt;Grafton 2003, p. i.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucius Vorenus''' and '''Titus Pullo'''&lt;ref&gt;His ''[[Roman naming convention|nomen]]'' is given as Pulfio, Puleio, Pullio, Pulcio or Pulcia in various manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; were two [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[centurion]]s of the 11th [[Roman legion|Legion]] ([[Legio XI Claudia]]) mentioned in the personal writings of [[Julius Caesar]]. 
==Known life==
Vorenus and Pullo appear in Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]],'' Book 5, Chapter 44. The episode describes the two as centurions, approaching the first ranks, who shared a bitter personal rivalry, and takes place in 54 BC when the [[Nervii]] attacked the legion under [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus Cicero]] in their winter quarters in Nervian territory. 

In an effort to outdo Vorenus, Pullo charged out of the fortified camp and attacked the enemy. Pullo casts his [[Pilum|javelin]] into one of the enemy from a short distance, but his belt is simultaneously pierced by a spear, preventing him from drawing his sword, and he is surrounded by other Nervii. Just then, Vorenus, following Pullo from the fortifications, reached the site of the mêlée and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. After slaying one of the enemy and driving back the rest, Vorenus lost his footing on the irregular terrain. As the Nervii drew closer to him, Pullo came to his rescue. After slaying many of their opponents, the two retreated to the fortifications amidst roaring applause from their comrades, or "covered with glory," as described by Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5#44|5.44]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar, p. 125 (Penguin 1982) {{ISBN|978-0-14-044433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Caesar's civil war|Civil War]] of 49 BC, Pullo was assigned to the XXIV Victrix Rapax, a new Italian legion commanded by the [[legatus|legate]] [[Gaius Antonius]]. In 48 BC, Antonius was blockaded on an island and forced to surrender; Pullo was apparently responsible for most of his soldiers switching sides to fight for [[Pompey]]. Later that year, he is recorded bravely defending Pompey's camp in Greece from Caesar's attack shortly before the [[Battle of Pharsalus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/41*.html#40 41.40]; Julius Caesar, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Civil War/Book 3#67|3.67]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional depictions==
*[[Lucius Vorenus (character of Rome)|Lucius Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo (character of Rome)|Titus Pullo]] are principal characters in the [[Home Box Office|HBO]]/[[BBC]]/[[RAI]] original [[television series]] [[Rome (TV series)|''Rome'']]. Vorenus is played by actor [[Kevin McKidd]]. Pullo is portrayed by [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]]. Unlike the historical centurions, the fictional characters are members of the 13th Legion ([[Legio XIII Gemina]]), an ally of Caesar, and particularly of Octavian.
*Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo are minor characters in ''[[Caesar (novel)|Caesar]]'', the fifth book in [[Colleen McCullough]]'s ''[[Masters of Rome]]'' series. They are shown as [[centurions]], serving under [[Quintus Cicero]], commander of the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion (''Legio IX Hispana'')]].
* Vorenus and Pullo appear in the ''Legion'' tetralogy of the [[Videssos]] Cycle by [[Harry Turtledove]]. The novels recount the adventures of several maniples of Caesar's legions in Gaul that are whisked away by [[druid]] spells to a land of magic loosely based on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The two companions are fairly faithful to Caesar's portrayal, starting as rival legionaries before rising to centurion rank and becoming fast friends.
* Vorenus and Pullo are characters in [[Michael Livingston]]'s 2015 historical fantasy novel ''[[The Shards of Heaven]]''.&lt;ref name="PW Shards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7653-8031-9 |title=''The Shards of Heaven'' by Michael Livingston |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KR Shards"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michael-livingston/the-shards-of-heaven/ |title=Review: ''The Shards of Heaven'' by Michael Livingston  |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=September 3, 2015 |accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wynand Claassen''' (born 16 January 1951, in [[Schweizer-Reneke]]) is a South African [[Rugby union|rugby]] player. He was selected as eighth-man for [[Blue Bulls|Northern Transvaal]] whilst studying architecture at the [[University of Pretoria]] in the late 1970s.

His father was George Claassen, a schoolmaster from [[Middelburg, Mpumalanga|Middelburg Hoërskool]] and winner of the 1961 [[Comrades Marathon]] between [[Pietermaritzburg]] and [[Durban]]&lt;!--down run--&gt;.

He formed a loose-trio with [[Thys Lourens]] and [[Burger Geldenhuys]] and soon had two [[Currie Cup]] final victories.

In 1980 he moved to [[Natal Province|Natal]] and was selected for the [[Springboks]] in 1981, captaining the team on his debut against Ireland. Despite Natal's relegation to the Currie Cup B section at the end of 1981 he continued as Springbok captain until 1984.

Claassen is credited with reviving rugby at the [[University of Natal]], both as a player and later as a coach. In 1988 he coached the Durban campus of the [[University of Natal]] to the [[Moor Cup]] title.

==Springbok captain==
In 1981 he earned international acclaim as captain during the infamous "Rebel Tour" in New Zealand.

==Political influence in South African Rugby==
Since retiring from the sport, he has maintained an active role in South African Rugby across the spectrum.  He is often invited to the Captain's Table at various fund raising events.

He has also earned great respect through his active involvement along with other Springbok captains supporting AfriForum's memorandum against political interference and racial discrimination in rugby.

On 12 August 2008, Wynand Claassen and a delegation of former Springbok captains met with the South African Rugby Union as part of their campaign to express concerns and lobby against the use of race to determine team selection.

In this meeting they expressed their intent to send a memorandum to the [[International Rugby Board]].  They assert that racial discrimination in sport and team selection is in conflict with international sporting regulations.

==Autobiography==
His autobiography, "More Than Just Rugby" was published in 1985.

==Social Appearances==
Wynand Claassen was an honorary host on the [[Amabokoboko]] [[Blue Train (South Africa)|Blue Train]] which departed in June 2009 on a rare and distinguished journey from Pretoria. He played host to exclusive guests en route to watch the ''Springboks'' vs the ''[[British &amp; Irish Lions]]'' in their first test match in Durban.

==Architect==
Claassen is also an architecture graduate and occasional artist. In a ''[[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' interview with [[Jani Allan]] he described his passion for architecture: "I'm very interested in old architecture - I think it's a great pity that beautiful buildings that are part of our heritage are torn down to make way for great glass boxes." A self-portrait also accompanied the column.&lt;ref name=fv&gt;{{Cite book|year=1980s|first=Jani |last=Allan|title=[[Face Value (book)|Face Value]] |publisher=Longstreet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
