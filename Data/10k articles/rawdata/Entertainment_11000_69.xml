      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2853">'''Anfani FM''' is a privately operated radio network in [[Niger]]. Based in the capital of [[Niamey]], Anfani also has stations in the regional centers of [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]], [[Zinder]], [[Birni Nkonni]], and [[Diffa]].

==History and content==
Founded by newspaper journalist Grémah Boucar as an offshoot of his ''[[Anfani]]'' print news weekly, Radio Anfani (FM 100&amp;nbsp;MHz) in Niamey was one of Niger's first non-governmental broadcasters.  Anfani was shut several times in the 1990s by the government of Col. [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpj.org/awards/1998/boucar-bio2.php 1998 Press Freedom Awards - Boucar], [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the return of civilian rule in 1999, Anfani FM journalists have faced arrest and government sanctions related to their reporting on a number of  occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/print.php3?id_article=10188  Niger - 2004 Annual Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031102132/http://www.rsf.org/print.php3?id_article=10188 |date=October 31, 2007 }}, [[Reporters Without Borders]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anfani provided access to the airways for opposition politicians during the military regime, and continues to broadcast domestic news in French, Hausa, Djerma, and other regional languages.  The station also rebroadcasts the  [[Voice of America]] and [[Deutsche Welle]] news.  While private, Anfani has previously received grants from the United States government, through the [[National Endowment for Democracy]].

==Stations==
Anfani broadcasts with transmitters of 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW based in [[Niamey]], [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]], [[Birni Nkonni]], [[Zinder]] and [[Diffa]], all on FM 100MHZ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ned.org/grantees/anfani/june99/fm100.html EN AVANT LES FM 100 Djibril A.

The '''Associazione Radioamatori Italiani''' ('''ARI'''; [[English language|English]]: '''Italian Amateur Radio Association''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Italy]].

==History==
The ARI was founded in 1927 as the '''Associazione Radiotecnica Italiana''' ('''Italian Radio Technology Association''') by Ernesto Montù, an early [[amateur radio operator]].  The organization recognized native Italian [[Guglielmo Marconi]] as the honorary President of the ARI until his death in 1937.&lt;ref name="ari_whatis"&gt;Associazione Radioamatori Italiani (2008). [http://www.associazioneradioamatoritaliani.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=64 "Cosa è l'A.R.I."].  Retrieved Jun. 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Key membership benefits of the ARI include a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for those amateur radio operators in regular communications with other amateur radio operators in foreign countries, and a monthly membership [[magazine]] called ''[[RadioRivista]]''. The ARI represents the interests of Italian amateur radio operators before Italian and international regulatory authorities.  ARI is the national member society representing Italy in the [[International Amateur Radio Union]].&lt;ref name="iaru"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union (2008). [http://www.iaru.org/iaru-soc.html "Member Societies"].  Retrieved Feb. 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Astate: La Malédiction des Templiers''''' is a 1990 adventure game developed by Calypso and published by New-Deal Productions for the Amiga and Atari ST. The game is notable for being a proto ''[[Myst]]''-clone, four year prior to the game being released.

==Plot and gameplay==
An archeologist is searching the French countryside and Templar ruins to find pieces of a statue.

The point-and-click adventure game has static screens and a icon-based interface. A proto Myst-clone, the game is a purely graphic adventure from the first person perspective, with no subtitles or voice over. The game has many death states, as well as unwinnable states by discarding important items.

==Critical reception==
''ACAR'' praised the game's graphics, plot, and potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_4500|title=Astate review from ACAR Vol 8 No 2 (Feb 1991) - Amiga Magazine Rack|website=amr.abime.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amiga Action'' felt the game was pretty slow and pointless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_26950|title=Astate review from Amiga Action 12 (Sep 1990) - Amiga Magazine Rack|website=amr.abime.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Games Machine'' described the experience as a "fruitless wander",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-33|title=The Games Machine Issue 33|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deemed the experience bizarre due to the game relying on graphics and abandoning text altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/the-games-machine-29|title=The Games Machine Issue 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Babe''''' is a 1995 Australian-American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Chris Noonan]], produced by [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]], and written by both. It is an adaptation of [[Dick King-Smith]]'s 1983 novel ''[[The Sheep-Pig]]'', also known as ''Babe: The Gallant Pig'' in the US, which tells the story of a [[Domestic pig|pig]] raised as [[livestock]] who wants to do the work of a [[Herding dog|sheepdog]]. The main animal characters are played by a combination of real and [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] pigs and [[Border Collie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chanko |first=Kenneth M. |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,298358,00.html |title=This Pig Just Might Fly &amp;#124; Movies |publisher=EW.com |date=August 18, 1995 |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven years of development,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Chris+Noonan&amp;bl "Interview with Chris Noonan", 9 September 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928054329/http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Chris+Noonan&amp;bl |date=September 28, 2013 }} accessed November 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Babe'' was filmed in [[Robertson, New South Wales|Robertson]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/new-south-wales/robertson/2005/02/17/1108500198901.html|title=Robertson&amp;nbsp;– New South Wales&amp;nbsp;– Australia |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=April 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2008 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talking-animal [[visual effects]] were done by [[Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios]] and [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]]. The film was both a box office and critical success, and in 1998 Miller went on to direct a [[sequel]], ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]''.

== Plot ==
Babe, an orphaned piglet, is chosen for a "guess the weight" contest at a [[county fair]]. The winning farmer, Arthur Hoggett, brings him home and allows him to stay with a [[Border Collie]] named Fly, her mate Rex and their puppies, in the barn.

A duck named Ferdinand, who crows as roosters are said to every morning to wake people so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten, persuades Babe to help him destroy the alarm clock that threatens his mission. Despite succeeding in this, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat, and in the confusion accidentally destroy the living room. Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand (now a fugitive) and the house. Sometime later, when Fly's puppies are put up for sale, Babe asks if he can call her "Mom".

Christmas brings a visit from the Hoggetts' relatives. Babe is almost chosen for [[Christmas dinner]] but a duck is picked instead after Hoggett remarks to his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize for ham at the next county fair. On Christmas Day, Babe justifies his existence by alerting Hoggett to sheep rustlers stealing sheep from one of the fields. The next day, Hoggett sees Babe sort the hens, separating the brown from the white ones. Impressed, he takes him to the fields and allows him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an elder ewe named Maa, the sheep cooperate, but Rex sees Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs and confronts Fly in a vicious fight for encouraging Babe. He injures her leg and accidentally bites Hoggett's hand when he tries to intervene. Rex is then chained to the dog house, muzzled and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe.

One morning, Babe is awakened by the sheep's cries and finds three dogs attacking them. Although he manages to scare them off, Maa is mortally injured and dies as a result. Hoggett arrives and, thinking that Babe killed her, prepares to shoot him. Fly is so anxious to find out whether he is guilty or innocent that, instead of barking orders at the sheep, she talks to them to find out what happened. Learning the truth, she barks to distract Hoggett, delaying him until Esme mentions that the police say [[feral dogs]] have been killing sheep on neighboring farms and asks him why he has taken his shotgun out.

When Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheepherding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house. However, Duchess scratches him when he tries to speak to her, so Hoggett immediately confines her outside. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans eat pigs. Horrified, he runs out to the barn and learns from Fly that this is true. The next morning, Fly discovers that Babe has run away. She and Rex alert Hoggett and they all search for him. Rex finds him in a cemetery and Hoggett brings him home. However, he is still demoralized and refuses to eat. Hoggett gives him a drink from a baby bottle, sings to him "[[If I Had Words]]" and dances a [[jig]] for him. This restores Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection and he begins eating again.

At the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. They give him a secret password, first extracting a promise that he will treat them better from now on. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's acclamation, he is unanimously given the highest score. While he sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him by saying, "That'll do, Pig. That'll do."

According to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Tasha |title=Interview: James Cromwell|url=https://film.avclub.com/james-cromwell-1798229824|website=AV Film|accessdate=December 31, 2017|date=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noonan later complained, "I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for ''Babe'', tried to exclude me from any credit, and it made me very insecure... It was like your guru has told you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/leap-of-faith/2007/01/24/1169594352749.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Leap of faith | date=January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller shot back, “Chris said something that is defamatory: that I took his name off the credits on internet sites, which is just absolutely untrue. You know, I’m sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my life than worry about that... when it comes to ''Babe'', the vision was handed to Chris on a plate.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Brook|title=Curious George|url=http://www.kythera-family.net/index.php?nav=117-121&amp;cid=193&amp;did=14114 |website=Kythera-Family.net|accessdate=December 31, 2017|date=September 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==

The [[Film score|musical score]] for ''Babe'' was composed by [[Nigel Westlake]] and performed by the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]. Classical orchestral music by 19th-century French composers is used throughout the film, but is disguised in a variety of ways and often integrated by Westlake into his score. The theme song "[[If I Had Words]]" (lyrics by Jonathan Hodge), sung by Hoggett near the film's conclusion, is an adaptation of the ''Maestoso'' final movement of the [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|''Organ Symphony'']] by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], and was originally performed in 1977 by [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Yvonne Keeley]]. This tune also recurs throughout the film's score.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' 53-64, Los Angeles CA 1995, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also brief quotations within the score from [[Edvard Grieg]]'s [[Peer Gynt (Grieg)#Suites|Peer Gynt Suite]]. Other music featured is by [[Leo Delibes]], [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Gabriel Fauré]], and [[Georges Bizet]].

==Reception==

The film was a box office success, grossing $36.7 million at the box office in [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria&amp;nbsp;– Australian Films at the Australian Box Office'']&lt;/ref&gt; and over $254 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=mojo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=babe.htm |title=Babe (1995) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also received critical acclaim and was ultimately nominated for seven [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Siskel &amp; Ebert]]'' week of February 16, 1996 {{YouTube|TfMZDZVAb1k|Part 1}} {{YouTube|yQT4ExNBAR8|Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950804/REVIEWS/508040301/1023 |title= Reviews:Babe  |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=August 4, 1995 |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]] and the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]]. At the [[APRA Music Awards of 1996]] it won Best Film Score for Westlake's work.&lt;ref name="APRAScreen Pre-2002"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140414234020/http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/APRAAwards/ScreenAwards/History/Winnerspriorto2002.aspx | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/APRAAwards/ScreenAwards/History/Winnerspriorto2002.aspx | title = Winners Prior to 2002 | publisher = [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) &amp;#124; [[Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society]] (AMCOS) | archivedate = 14 April 2014 | accessdate = 11 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[American Film Institute]] named ''Babe'' #80 on its list of [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers|America's Most Inspiring Movies]].&lt;ref name="cheers"&gt;[http://www.afi.com/100years/cheers.aspx ''AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers''.] [[American Film Institute]]. Retrieved March 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its subject being a piglet, ''Babe'' was initially banned from [[Malaysia]] in order to avoid upsetting or annoying [[Muslims]] (who view pigs as [[haram]]), although the ruling was overturned almost a year later and the film was released [[direct-to-video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gogoi |first=Pallavi |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/nov2006/db20061107_885480.htm |title=Banning Borat |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Babe'' was released in the US, it is reported that "activists around the country staked out movie theatres with flyers documenting the real life abuses of pigs".&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Laura Elaine (ed.) ''The Apocalyptic Animal of Late Capitalism'', [[University of California]] 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YUe4YuEYxRkC&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage p.108] {{ISBN|9781109061604}}. Retrieved March 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a marked effect on the growth of [[vegetarianism]], particularly among the young. It also promoted a more sympathetic view of the intellectual, emotional and social capacities of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Nobis, Nathan. "The Babe Vegetarians", in ''Bioethics at the Movies'', [[Johns Hopkins University]] 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ySGcwOW5xBsC&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage pp.56-70]. {{ISBN|9780801890789}}.Retrieved March 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; James Cromwell became an [[Veganism#Philosophy: ethical and environmental perspectives|ethical vegan]] as a result of starring as Farmer Hoggett, saying, "I decided that to be able to talk about this [movie] with conviction, I needed to become a vegetarian."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Scott, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAQAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage A Pig's Best Friend], ''[[Vegetarian Times]]'', November 1998, p.20.

[[File:Barney Fagan.jpg|thumb|Fagan in 1898]]
'''Barney Fagan''' (January 12, 1850 &amp;ndash; January 12, 1937) was an American performer, [[theatre director|director]], [[choreographer]], and [[composer]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He is recognized as being a progenitor of both music and dance genres, and is often referred to as the "Father of [[Tap Dance]]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3tap1.htm Dance History Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Barney Fagan was born as '''Bernard J. Fagan''' in Boston, son of Douglass and Ellen Fagan. His father was the deputy wharfinger (old term that today is called a harbormaster) at Battery Wharf.   He made his first professional appearance in [[Boston]] at the [[Howard Athenaeum]] in 1860, as the Cabin Boy in ''The Pilot of Brest''. He remained at this theatre several seasons until 1865 when he played his first minstrel engagement with the Morris Brothers in Boston.

In 1870, Fagan went to [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], Canada, and appeared with [[Pete Lee's Minstrels]]. In 1873 he joined [[Buckley's Serenaders]] in Boston, and took a fellow dancer, Joe Parks, as a partner. During the period 1873-1876, Fagan and Parks, known as the American Lads, played variety engagements. In 1876 he did the famous Heifer dance with Richard Golden in ''Evangeline''. Mr. Fagan next joined John Fenton in a dancing duet, and continued with him until 1878, when he formed a partnership with Lizzie Mulvey, which lasted one season. Fagan's specialty at that time was "[[clog dancing]]"—which was a dance performed while wearing wooden-soled shoes, a very popular form of stage entertainment in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigelgatherer.com/books/ryan/clogs.html Ryan's Mammoth Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1879, Mr. Fagan allied himself with [[Barlow, Wilson, Primrose and West's Minstrels]], and continued with them until the company's dissolution in June, 1882. During the three years with Barlow and Wilson, he was general producer and performed as a soloist. Possibly Mr. Fagan's greatest achievement was in organizing and producing [[Willis Sweatnam]], [[Billy Rice]] and [[Fagan's Minstrels]], which gave their first performance at [[Albany, New York]], July 25, 1887. This troupe was allegedly the largest [[minstrel]] company to travel America's entertainment circuit in the 19th century, featuring 105 performers on parade with 88 in the regular company.

In the following years, Fagan performed with various companies, including Thatcher, Primrose and West; [[Barlow, Wilson and Rankin's]]; and [[Cleveland's Minstrels]], where Fagan performed opposite to [[Luke Schoolcraft]].

Outside of minstrelsy, Fagan appeared in [[Blackface|whiteface]] in such plays as ''Paradise Alley'', and, in 1890, appeared in ''High Roller'', a production of his own company. At this time, Fagan's work drew praise for notable marches, including "[[West Point Cadets]]", the "[[Phantom Guards]]" and "[[The Dance of the Popinjays]]". During this same period, he was general producer for Corinne for several seasons.

As a songwriter he was no less prominent, penning: "Everybody Takes Their Hat Off to Me" and "[[My Gal is a High-Born Lady|My Gal is A High Born Lady]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dvautier.home.comcast.net/~dvautier/bkstories/high.htm |title=My Gal is  A High Born Lady, 1896 |access-date=2008-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930230612/http://dvautier.home.comcast.net/~dvautier/bkstories/high.htm |archive-date=2015-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His plays were popular, too: ''The Land of Fancy'' and ''The Game of Love''. Starting in 1895, Fagan performed regularly with Herietta Byron, of the [[Byron Sisters]].

In the opinion of [[Sigmund Spaeth]], Fagan's compositions were important in the development of [[ragtime]]. In his book ''[[A History of Popular Music in America]]'' (1948), Spaeth said:

{{quote|Fagan's lively '[[coon song]]', "My Gal Is a High-Born Lady" (1896), was definitely above the average in both words and music. Fagan was an Irishman, but familiar with minstrel technique and one of the great buck-and-wing dancers of his day. He was famous also as a stage director, creating many elaborate acts for Primrose and West, with a feeling for color and lighting far in advance of his time. There is a story (probably started by Fagan himself) that he wrote his great hit in [[Chicago]] one morning, when he found himself down to his last twenty-five cents, and on his wife's birthday at that. He took a bicycle ride along the Lake, broke a pedal and suddenly became conscious of a persistent rhythm as the dangling piece clicked against the wheel. The words ‘My gal is a high born lady’ fitted into the rhythm and suggested a rag-time melody. He stopped long enough to write down the main theme, then hurried home to complete the song, taking it immediately to a publisher and collecting $100.00 in cash, which he promptly spent on a birthday dress and a big party…(More important is the fact that the piano arrangement of 'My Gal Is a High-Born Lady' was made by a youngster named [[Gustav Luders]], of later operatic fame.)"  (pgs. 287-288). Dancers sometimes credit him with being the "Father of Tap"(Dancing), although that title has also been applied to others.  [[Frank Dumont]] in an article in the ''[[New York Clipper]]'' (March 27, 1915—"The Younger Generation in Minstrelsy and Reminiscences of the Past") remembers Fagan as "the greatest dancer and producer of dancing tableaux and novel groupings…He was a genuine ‘find’ to minstrelsy and his methods are copied to this day in all dancing numbers. He was especially attentive to the young element and made great dancers of them.}}

He was highly revered by the end of his career. On August 31, 1919, a testimonial dinner was given in his honor in Manhattan, attracting the theatrical luminaries of that era, including [[Irving Berlin]].

'''Belle Baker''' (December 25, 1893&lt;ref&gt;Although Baker shaved off as many as five years from her age (her gravestone cites 1898), she was born in 1893, as confirmed by the 1915 New York census, which required the censee's age as of June 1, 1915, and lists [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K9LH-L7V Belle Leslie], living with her husband Louis and his family, as 21 years of age. She would turn 22 in December 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City, New York]]&amp;nbsp;– April 29, 1957 in [[Los Angeles, California]]) was an American singer and actress. Popular throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Baker introduced a number of [[ragtime]] and [[torch song]]s including [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]" and "[[My Yiddishe Momme|My Yiddishe Mama]]". She performed in the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] and introduced a number of [[Irving Berlin]]'s songs. An early adapter to radio, Baker hosted her own radio show during the 1930s. [[Eddie Cantor]] called her “[[Dinah Shore]], [[Patti Page]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Judy Garland]] all rolled into one.”&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;[http://travsd.wordpress.com/2009/12/25/stars-of-vaudeville-96-97-98-belle-baker-fay-templeton-evelyn-nesbit Profile], travsd.wordpress.com; accessed August 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=Song%20of%20Love%2c%20The&amp;title2=&amp;reviewer=MORDAUNT%20HALL&amp;pdate=19291114&amp;v_id=111032 Mordaunt Hall review of ''Song of Love''], nytimes.com, November 14, 1929; accessed August 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Baker was born Bella Becker in 1893 to a [[Russian Jewish]] family. Baker started performing at the [[Lower East Side]]'s Cannon Street Music Hall at age 11, where she was discovered by the Yiddish Theatre manager [[Jacob Adler]]. She was managed in vaudeville by Lew Leslie, who would become Baker's first husband. She made her vaudeville debut in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] at the age of 15. She performed in [[Oscar Hammerstein I]]'s [[Victoria Theater (Hammerstein's)|Victoria Theatre]] in 1911, although her performance was panned, mainly for her song choices. By age 17, she was a headliner. One of her earliest hits was, "Cohen Owes Me $97".&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

[[File:ImSorryIMadeYouCryCover1916BelleBaker.jpg|thumb|Belle Baker on the sheet music cover of Nick Clesi's 1916 hit "I'm Sorry I Made You Cry"]] By 1917, she was a top headliner in New York. In the early 1920s, when she was well known as The Ragtime Singer, Baker took part in a Baltimore song competition with [[Catherine Calvert]], Pearl and Violet Hamilton, and Jessie Fordyce. She was the first artist to record "[[All of Me (Ruth Etting song)|All of Me]]", one of the most recorded songs of its era, and she was also the first person in the United States to do a radio broadcast from a moving train. Baker became known for her ragtime and torch songs including, "Hard Hearted Hannah", "My Sin", "My Kid", "When the Black Sheep Returns to the Fold", and "I'll Pick Myself a California Rose". She made a handful of recordings, including "Hard Hearted Hannah" in 1924.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As Baker's fame rose as a vocalist, she became known for her Yiddish themed torch songs. In 1925, fellow vaudevillian [[Sophie Tucker]] gave Baker a song that had been sent to her for consideration. "[[My Yiddishe Momme|My Yiddishe Mama]]" was a blatant tearjerker, but it was immensely popular and became Baker’s signature song. Similar songs Baker recorded included, "My Man", "My Kid", "Baby Your Mother" and "My Sin".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Broadway and film==
In 1926, Baker had the title role in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s ''Betsy''. She introduced [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]" in the [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] production, which ran for 39 performances from December 28, 1926 to January 29, 1927. With music by [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyrics by [[Lorenz Hart]], the musical comedy had a book by [[Irving Caesar]] and [[David Freedman]]. Victor Baravelle was the musical director. Irving Berlin's "Blue Skies" was a last-minute addition to the show; Baker's performance of it went over so well that the audience demanded more than twenty encores of the tune.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Baker had a brief film career as [[silent film]] gave way to lavish [[technicolor]] [[musical film|musical]] [[sound film|talkies]]. She made her film debut starring in the 1929 talkie ''Song of Love''. The film survives and has been screened at film festivals but not released on DVD. ''Song of Love'' features two songs performed by Baker written by her husband, "I'm Walking with the Moonbeams (Talking to the Stars)" and "Take Everything But You". She made two more film appearances, in ''Charing Cross Road'' (1935) and ''Atlantic City'' (1944; in which she performed "Nobody's Sweetheart").

==Radio and television==
On radio, she was a guest performer on ''[[The Eveready Hour]]'', broadcasting's first major variety show, which featured Broadway's top headliners. Baker continued performing through the 1930s, but limited her performances to radio shows.

==Personal life==
Baker's first marriage was to producer and promoter [[Lew Leslie]]. The couple divorced in 1918. In 1919, she married [[Maurice Abrahams]], a successful [[Russian-American]] songwriter/composer, who wrote such songs as "[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]", "[[He'd Have to Get Under — Get Out and Get Under (to Fix Up His Automobile)]]", "I'm Walking with the Moonbeams (Talking to the Stars)", and "Take Everything But You". The couple had one child, [[Herbert Baker (screenwriter)|Herbert Joseph Abrahams, later known as Herbert Baker]], who became a screenwriter. After Abrahams' death in 1931, Baker restricted her performing to radio. On September 21, 1937, she remarried, to Elias Sugarman, editor of the theatrical trade magazine, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. The couple divorced in 1941. She made one final television appearance in ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' in 1955, just two years before her death.

==Death==
Baker died on April 25, 1957 at [[Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She is buried in the Abrahams family mausoleum in [[Ridgewood, Queens|Mount Judah Cemetery, Ridgewood, New York]].

'''Big Loo''' was a toy [[robot]] manufactured by [[Louis Marx and Company]] for the 1963 [[Christmas]] holiday season. It retailed for $9.99. The toy, primarily made of injection molded hi-impact [[polystyrene]] parts, stood three-feet tall (37-inches), a foot wide, and nine inches deep.

Its key features included a sight scope with cross-hairs, two flashing battery-powered red eyes with an on-off switch, a hand-cranked mechanical voice box that played ten messages, two rubber-tipped darts that were fired from triggers on the back, a left arm that held four red balls which were fired from a spring in the left elbow, and a right arm that had a grasping claw able to pick up objects.  One foot was equipped with a spring-powered rocket.  It could also squirt water from its navel and was equipped with a compass, whistle, bell, a Morse code clicker with chart, and could bend over at the waist .

In 2016, new record values were set on some of the original accessories, with an original instruction sheet selling for over $220., and an original whistle going for over $600., both on Ebay.  An average robot averages now at $600.+ with normal wear and imperfections (with no or very few accessories), and one that still "talks" with the original recorded voice and hand crank always commands more money.  Near mint condition Loo's sell for 2 to $3000. and more. If you're fortunate enough to still have the original BOX that the robot came in, depending upon the condition, it could add well over $1000. to the overall value of the toy, and of course the better the condition of the box, the higher the premium.   The best example (and most rare due to the dark green plastics and accessories included) of a mint-in-box Big Loo was sold in 2017 for a record $6495.00 on Ebay by the proprietor of BigLooRobot.com (also the exclusive supplier for exact high quality replicas of the original instruction sheets), and regularly offered museum quality robots with accessories are selling for $2500. to $4000. at Trademark Classics, the latter being one of the only toy shops in the USA that currently offers professional repair on the costly robots for individual clients and museum displays. 

Big Loo was featured on the cover of the [[Los Lobos]] album [[Colossal Head]].

'''''Call of Cthulhu''''' is a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[survival horror]] video game developed by [[Cyanide (company)|Cyanide]] and published by [[Focus Home Interactive]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. The game features a [[Open world|semi-open world]] environment and incorporates themes of [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] and [[psychological horror]] into a story which includes elements of investigation and [[Stealth game|stealth]]. It is inspired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]", while also being an adaptation of the 1981 role-playing game [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|of the same title]].

==Plot==
''Call of Cthulhu'' follows investigator and war veteran Edward Pierce, a private detective experiencing an existential crisis. As the setting of 1924 Boston does not provide him with any cases, Pierce stoops to consuming alcohol and pills to satisfy his mind. A glimmer of hope shines when a mysterious case one day lands on his desk. Pierce is asked to solve the death of the Hawkins family, who mysteriously died in a fire. As the only clue is a strange picture painted by the supposedly crazy mother shortly before her death, Edward has to set out to Darkwater Island near [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to find out more about the matter. In the process, he discovers the impending revival of the [[Cthulhu Mythos deities#Great Old Ones|Great Old One]] [[Cthulhu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gamegator.net/blog/article/call-of-cthulhu-mind|title=Call of Cthulhu: A mind that can't be trusted|website=GameGator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
On 16 January 2014, publisher [[Focus Home Interactive]] announced via [[Twitter]] that video game developer [[Frogwares]] was working on developing the game.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-17-call-of-cthulhu-game-announced-by-sherlock-developer-frogwares |title=Call of Cthulhu game announced by Sherlock developer Frogwares |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |date=17 January 2014 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2014/01/17/call-of-cthulhu-inbound-from-sherlock-holmes-developer-frogwares/ |title=Call of Cthulhu inbound from Sherlock Holmes developer Frogwares |last=Hillier |first=Brenna |date=17 January 2014 |website=[[VG247]] |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.videogamer.com/news/sherlock-holmes-dev-working-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-call-of-cthulhu-game |title=Sherlock Holmes dev working on PS4 &amp; Xbox One Call of Cthulhu game |last=Scammel |first=David |date=17 January 2014 |website=[[Videogamer.com]] |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also announced that the game would be released on [[Microsoft Windows]] and "next-gen consoles".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer announce" /&gt; Later that month, a Frogwares spokesperson said that the game was still in "early development". They noted that the game would have a focus on investigations in a horror setting and that they would be using the experience from developing their ''[[Sherlock Holmes (video game series)|Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' series. They also revealed that they were working with multiple writers who had written scenarios for the 1981 [[role-playing game]] ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a546210/call-of-cthulhu-will-be-dark-and-creepy-says-sherlock-holmes-studio/ |title=Call of Cthulhu will be 'dark and creepy', says Sherlock Holmes studio |last=Lee |first=Ben |date=24 January 2014 |website=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/09/survive-call-of-cthulhu-by-slowing-down-and-understanding-your-world |title=Survive Call of Cthulhu by Slowing Down and Understanding Your World |last=Robertson |first=John |date=9 February 2017 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of inactivity on the title, prompting concerns that the game might have been canceled, Focus Home announced the game again in February 2016, in development for release in 2017 by studio [[Cyanide (company)|Cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/154451/call-cthulhu-game-switches-developers/ |title=Call of Cthulhu Game Switches Developers |last=Gelmini |first=David |date=4 March 2016 |website=[[Dread Central]] |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer resurrection"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-02-26-call-of-cthulhu-back-from-the-dead |title=Call of Cthulhu back from the dead |last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |date=26 February 2016 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/cyanide-takes-over-call-of-cthulhu-development-from-frogwares/0217126 |title=Cyanide takes over Call of Cthulhu development from Frogwares |last=Jarvis |first=Matthew |date=26 February 2016 |website=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They revealed that the game would be a semi-[[open world]] investigative [[role-playing game]] with elements of [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[psychological horror]].

'''Cecilia Loftus''' (born '''Marie Cecilia Loftus Brown''', 22 October 1876 – 12 July 1943) was a Scottish actress, singer, [[Mimic (entertainment)|mimic]], [[vaudevillian]], and [[music hall]] performer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Family==
Loftus was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Her father, Ben Brown (1848–1926), was part of the successful variety group, Brown, Newland &amp; Le Clerc.&lt;ref name=cullen&gt;Frank Cullen (2004) ''Vaudeville Old &amp; New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America'', Routledge, Taylor and French, New York {{ISBN|0-415-93853-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother, Marie Loftus (1857–1940), an actress, [[pantomimic]], and music hall performer, who was only 18 years old when Cecilia was born, later became a star of [[burlesque]], billed as "The Sarah Bernhardt of the Halls".&lt;ref&gt;Commire, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She was given an education at the Convent of the Holy Child, Raikes Parade, [[Blackpool, England|Blackpool]], England which moved in 1890 to the premises at [[Layton Hill Convent, Blackpool]] which it still occupies although now, after various name changes, splits and mergers, it is known as [[St. Mary's Catholic College (Blackpool)|St. Mary's Catholic College]]. In July 1893, 17-year-old Cissy Loftus made her [[wikt:debut|début]] at the [[Oxford Music Hall]] in London, followed by an appearance at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre of Varieties]].&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Loftus and the Palace Theatre of Varieties" (12 May 1893) ''Western Times'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; After an early career in [[music hall]] and variety performing impersonations of well-known actresses of the day, such as [[Yvette Guilbert]], she appeared at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in musical comedy for one season.&lt;ref&gt;Commire, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
In 1894, she appeared in [[vaudeville]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre (New York, 1885-1902)|Lyceum Theatre]] in New York City. Loftus toured with the [[Ada Rehan]] Company and the [[Augustin Daly]] Company before she first appeared at Koster &amp; Bial's on 21 January 1895.&lt;ref name=briscoe/&gt; With the Rehan troupe she played Washington, DC, [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Chicago, Illinois]] as "Miss Cecile" in a playbill. Her exit from Daly's organisation occurred after Loftus was offered larger salaries in New York City. Other roles she played prior to 1895 were "Winnie" in ''The Last Word'' and "Audrey" in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''. Critics did not speak kindly of her work in these parts, to her dismay.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Cissy Loftus Resigned", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 January 1895, pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus became an international favourite in vaudeville along with [[Vesta Tilley]] and [[Harry Lauder]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vaudeville" (16 January 1944) ''The New York Times'' pg. SM16.&lt;/ref&gt;

She then began to appear in the legitimate theatre, appearing in ''The Children of the King'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], in 1898.&lt;ref name=briscoe&gt;Johnson Briscoe (1909) ''The Actors' Birthday Book'', Moffat, Yard and Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she returned to the United States to tour in vaudeville and was seen by Sir [[Henry Irving]] in 1901 at the [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Broadway)|Knickerbocker Theatre]]. He was so impressed that he engaged her to appear with him in the roles that Dame [[Ellen Terry]] could no longer play. She later toured with Irving, although the earnings were not as great as those on the music hall circuit. In 1905, she successfully essayed the very serious role of Nora in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]''. Later that year she played [[Peter Pan]] to considerable acclaim in the second British production of Barrie's play. The next year she toured with ''The Diamond Express'' and appeared at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in 1912. In 1914, Loftus played the part of [[Desdemona]] in ''[[Othello]]'' at the [[Lyric Theatre (1903 New York City)|Lyric Theatre (New York)]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gossip of the Rialto" (5 December 1943) ''The New York Times'' pg. X5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burlesque, Broadway, and lyricist==
[[File:Cissy Loftus 1.jpg|225px|thumb|right|upright|The Era Almanack 1894]]
She had a successful career both in [[burlesque]], as an accomplished mimic, and on Broadway. Some of the productions she appeared in are ''The Man of Forty'' (1900), ''If I Were King'' (1901) by her husband [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]], ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1903) with [[E.H. Sothern]], the [[Victor Herbert]] [[operetta]] ''[[Dream City]]'' (1906), ''Venus'' (1927) with [[Tyrone Power, Sr.]], ''Three-Cornered Moon'' (1933) with [[Ruth Gordon]], [[Clare Boothe Luce]]'s ''[[Abide With Me (play)|Abide With Me]]'' (1935), and ''Little Dark Horse'' (1941).  As Cissie Loftus, she wrote lyrics and music for songs in a number of productions, including ''The Belle of Bridgeport'' (1900)&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB title | id=5404 | title=The Belle of Bridgeport ''(1900 production)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Lancers'' (1907).

==Personal life==
When she was seventeen, she eloped with [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] (1859–1936), an Irish writer, and associate of her friend and admirer [[Max Beerbohm]]. They married in [[Blackburn]], Lancashire in 1893. The groom was twice as old as the bride. The marriage failed, and the couple divorced.

In 1908, she married Alonzo Higbee Waterman, an American doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1909/07/02/archives/cecilia-loftus-married-wedded-at-registry-office-london-to.html?sq=Cecilia+Loftus+Married&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p "Cecilia Loftus Married, Wedded at Registry Office, London, to Physician Who Has Been Attentive."

Her health and the premature birth of their son, Peter, had made her increasingly dependent on alcohol and painkillers. In November 1922, she was arrested for possession of morphine and atropine.

Her fellow actress, [[Eva Moore]] bailed her for a surety of £100, and she was put on probation for twelve months at the [[Great Marlborough Street]] Magistrates Court. In 1923, she left Great Britain for good, and sailed to New York City to return to Broadway and pursue a career in Hollywood.

'''''Comus''''' ('''''A Masque Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634''''') is a [[masque]] in honour of [[chastity]], written by [[John Milton]]. It was first presented on [[Michaelmas]], 1634, before [[John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater]], at [[Ludlow Castle]] in celebration of the Earl's new post as [[Lord President of Wales]].

Known colloquially as ''Comus'', the masque's actual full title is ''A Mask presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634: on Michelmas night, before the Rt Hon. Iohn Earl of Bridgewater, Viscount Brackly, Lord President of Wales, and one of His Maiesties most honorable privie councill''. ''Comus'' was printed anonymously in 1637, in a [[book size|quarto]] issued by bookseller [[Humphrey Robinson]]; Milton included the work in his ''Poems'' of [[Milton's 1645 Poems|1645]] and [[Milton's 1645 Poems|1673]]. Milton's text was later used for a [[Comus (Arne)|highly successful masque]] by the musician [[Thomas Arne]] in 1738, which then ran for more than seventy years in London.

==Plot==
The plot concerns two brothers and their sister, simply called "the Lady", lost in a journey through the woods. The Lady becomes fatigued, and the brothers wander off in search of sustenance.

While alone, she encounters the debauched ''[[Comus]]'', a character inspired by the god of revelry (Ancient Greek: Κῶμος), who is disguised as a villager and claims he will lead her to her brothers. Deceived by his amiable countenance, the Lady follows him, only to be captured, brought to his pleasure palace and victimised by his [[necromancy]]. Seated on an enchanted chair, with "gums of glutinous heat", she is immobilised, and Comus accosts her while with one hand he holds a necromancer's wand and with the other he offers a vessel with a drink that would overpower her. Comus urges the Lady to "be not coy" and drink from his magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), but she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]]. Within view at his palace is an array of cuisine intended to arouse the Lady's appetites and desires. Despite being restrained against her will, she continues to exercise right reason (recta ratio) in her disputation with Comus, thereby manifesting her [[freewill|freedom of mind]]. Whereas the would-be seducer argues appetites and desires issuing from one's nature are "natural" and therefore licit, the Lady contends that only rational self-control is enlightened and virtuous. To be self-indulgent and intemperate, she adds, is to forfeit one's higher nature and to yield to baser impulses. In this debate the Lady and Comus signify, respectively, soul and body, ratio and libido, sublimation and sensuality, virtue and vice, moral rectitude and immoral depravity. In line with the theme of the journey that distinguishes Comus, the Lady has been deceived by the guile of a treacherous character, temporarily waylaid, and besieged by [[sophistry]] that is disguised as wisdom.

Meanwhile, her brothers, searching for her, come across the ''Attendant Spirit'', an angelic figure sent to aid them, who takes the form of a shepherd and tells them how to defeat Comus. As the Lady continues to assert her freedom of mind and to exercise her free will by resistance and even defiance, she is rescued by the ''Attendant Spirit'' along with her brothers, who chase off Comus. The Lady remains magically bound to her chair. With a song, the Spirit conjures the water [[nymph]] ''Sabrina'' who frees the Lady on account of her steadfast virtue. She and her brothers are reunited with their parents in a triumphal celebration, which signifies the heavenly bliss awaiting the wayfaring soul that prevails over trials and travails, whether these are the threats posed by overt evil or the blandishments of temptation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383113/John-Milton John Milton]." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 21 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The original music, in a [[baroque]] style, was composed by [[Henry Lawes]], who also played the part of The Attendant Spirit. Generally, masques were not dramas; they could be viewed as pre-figuring the [[recitative]] of opera.

In 1745 [[George Frideric Handel]] composed [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel#Incidental music|three songs and a trio]] as part of a private arrangement of the masque which was first performed, in June 1745, also at Ludlow Castle.&lt;ref name="Grove2001Vol10Page783"&gt;{{NewGrove2001|article=Handel, George Frideric|last=Hicks|first=Anthony|vol=x|pages=783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Comus'' and the masque genre==
Masques were a favourite court celebration dating from at least the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but became very popular under the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]]. The main parts were often played by courtiers, nobles and sometimes even the royals. In fact, [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] masques (of which ''Comus'' is an example) frequently featured the King and Queen ([[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]]), as they were far more interested in becoming involved than [[James VI and I|King James]] and his [[Anne of Denmark|queen Anne]] had been.

This masque was not performed at the court, however, but at the home of Lord Bridgewater, Ludlow Castle. It was commissioned to celebrate the appointment of Lord Bridgewater to the post of Lord President of Wales. References to this are clearly evident in the text, such as the Attendant Spirit's reference to the children's father's "new-entrusted sceptre" in his opening speech.

Bridgewater's own children were the principal actors in this masque. The [[Puritan]] Milton's use of the genre, however, may be seen as an attempt for him to "reclaim" masque, which was associated with the perceived debauchery of the royal court, for godly or virtuous purposes. Rather than praising an aristocrat, the famous concluding lines of the masque, recited by the Attendant Spirit, urge

:Mortals that would follow me,
:Love virtue, she alone is free,
:She can teach ye how to climb
:Higher than the Sphery chime;
:Or if Virtue feeble were,
:Heav'n itself would stoop to her (ll. 1018–1023).

''Comus'' was influenced by a prior masque, [[Aurelian Townshend]]'s ''[[Tempe Restored]]'', which had been staged at [[Whitehall Palace]] in London in February 1632. Both Henry Lawes and [[Alice Vaughan, Countess of Carbery|Alice Egerton]], the Earl's daughter who played the Lady, had performed in Townshend's masque.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Demaray, "Milton's ''Comus'': the Sequel to a Masque of Circe", ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 29 (1966), pp. 245–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton's title for the masque was not ''Comus'' (this was imposed later by scholars), but ''A Mask, Presented at Ludlow Castle''. Creaser notes that it had become old-fashioned by the 1630s to use an occasional title such as this (consider other masque titles of the time such as [[Thomas Carew|Carew]]'s ''Coelum Britanicum'' and ''Tempe Restored'', etc.) This shows that Milton wanted to specifically draw attention to his work as a masque, asking the reader to hold in their minds all that this signified, as he consciously used and twisted the conventions of the genre to put across his particular message.&lt;ref&gt;John Creaser. "'The Present Aid of this Occasion': the Setting of ''Comus''". ''The Court Masque''. Ed. David Lindley. Manchester: MUP, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, his audience would have been expecting, based on other masques of this time, that the antimasque would be dispelled by virtue (usually embodied by the King and Queen). Yet in Comus the Lady's virtue is not enough to save her: she is unable to dismiss Comus on her own. Even the heroic virtue of her brothers is not enough. Comus escapes rather than actually being defeated.

Many have read the intervention of Sabrina as divine assistance being sent, showing that earthly virtue is relatively weak, and certainly not worthy of the exaltation given it in contemporary masques. [[Barbara Lewalski]] comments that the character of Sabrina was apparently not played by a noble, but by one of the actors (we can assume this because no-one is listed as playing this character in the dramatis personae), so it is actually a commoner who holds the position of most power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara K. Lewalski]], "Milton's ''Comus'' and the Politics of Masquing." The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque. David Bevington and Peter Holbrook (eds). pp. 296–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castlehaven scandal==
An air of controversy surrounds this masque, as the [[Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven|Earl of Castlehaven]], Bridgewater's brother-in-law, was the subject of a sordid sodomy and rape scandal for which he was executed. Some critics have conjectured that the masque, with its focus on chastity, was designed to "cleanse" the Egerton family.&lt;ref&gt; Brested, Barbara. "''Comus'' and the Castlehaven Scandal" ''Milton Studies'' 3 (1971), 201–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concussion Anatomy.png|right|thumb|316x316px]]
[[Head injury|Head injuries]] in sports of any level (junior, amateur, professional) are the most dangerous and sickening kind of injuries that can occur in sport, and are becoming more common in [[Australian sport]]. [[Concussion]]s are the most common side effect of a head injury and are defined as "temporary unconsciousness or confusion and other symptoms caused by a blow to the head." A concussion also falls under the category of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.informit.com.au.ipacez.nd.edu.au/documentSummary;dn=969182034362508;res=IELHEA|title = Sports Related Concussion – Management in General Practice|last = Makdissi|first = Michael|date = 2010|journal = Australian Family Physician|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in contact sports like [[Australian rules football]] and [[Rugby football|Rugby]] issues with concussions are prevalent, and methods to deal with, prevent and treat concussions are continuously being updated and researched to deal with the issue. Concussions pose a serious threat to the patients’ mental and physical health, as well as their playing career, and can result in lasting brain damage especially if left untreated. The signs that a player may have a concussion are: loss of consciousness or non-responsiveness, balance problems (unsteadiness on feet, poor co-ordination), a dazed, blank or vacant look and/or confusion and unawareness of their surroundings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Management of Concussion in Rugby League|url = http://www.nrl.com/About/ReferenceCentre/ManagementofConcussioninRugbyLeague/tabid/10798/Default.aspx|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course the signs are relevant only after the player experiences a blow to the head.

== Dangers of concussion ==
In the short term, concussions do not pose a serious problem and a player suffering may experience: headache, dizziness, loss of memory, blurred vision, confusion, disorientation and /or sensitiveness to bright light and loud noises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is concussion?|url = http://www.concussioninsportproject.com.au/concussioninsportproject.com.au/Concussion_in_Sport.html|website = www.concussioninsportproject.com.au|accessdate = 1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the real danger occurs after repeated concussions suffered by the same player, if the player returns to play immediately after contracting a concussion or too soon after suffering one. If the player returns to play immediately or too soon after, there is an increased risk of another concussion (which is much more serious) as well as to the rest of the body due to a slower reaction time. The player can also suffer from a number of psychological issues like depression, as well as permanent brain damage and severe brain swelling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A player, regardless of age or level of competition, should not return to play or training following a concussion, without a medical clearance from a registered medical doctor.

== AFL ==
[[File:Jonathan Brown.jpg|thumb|One of the all-time great AFL players, Jonathon Brown's career was cut short after a series of life-threatening head knocks.]]
In a high-impact game like Australian Rules Football, head injuries and concussions have always been common, but public awareness has risen over the last decade towards the dangers of continuing to play while suffering from a concussion. It is estimated that there are 5–6 players who suffer a concussion for every 1000 hours spent on the field, meaning there are 6–7 concussions per team during one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An overview of concussion in sport|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0967586811004413|journal = Journal of Clinical Neuroscience|date = 1 January 2012|volume = 19|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jocn.2011.08.002|first = Vini G.|last = Khurana|first2 = Andrew H.|last2 = Kaye}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, players at the elite level, either realised they would be pulled out of the game if they were identified as concussed hid the fact from coaches and continued to play, but recently the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] released new concussion management guidelines to combat the issue. Now, only a medical officer with previous experience in the subject may declare the player fit to play, also the coaches are warned against rushing their players back into the team after suffering a concussion. The guidelines also dictate that immediately, or as soon as possible, after a player suffers a concussion, or is suspected of suffering from one, they must be subjected to a medical assessment after which they may or may not be allowed to return to the field depending on the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AFL Community: Concussion|url = http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/index.php?id=66|website = www.aflcommunityclub.com.au|accessdate = 1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in 2013 in the AFL, the 'concussion sub' can be used when a player suffers a concussion or is suspected of having one, the player in question is substituted out of the game for at least 20 minutes, during which a test takes place to evaluate the players psychological well-being.

The occurrence of concussions in amateur leagues are less common because of the lower impact intensity. However, concussions suffered at amateur levels can at times be more dangerous then those suffered in the AFL because of the inferior resources possessed and in some cases the coaches are not willing to pull a player out of the game, or rest them if they are suffering from a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Intention to use sport concussion guidelines among community-level coaches and sports trainers|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1440244013004714|journal = Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date = 1 January 2014|volume = 17|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jsams.2013.10.240|first = Joshua D.|last = Newton|first2 = Peta E.|last2 = White|first3 = Michael T.|last3 = Ewing|first4 = Michael|last4 = Makdissi|first5 = Gavin A.|last5 = Davis|first6 = Alex|last6 = Donaldson|first7 = S. John|last7 = Sullivan|first8 = Hugh|last8 = Seward|first9 = Caroline F.|last9 = Finch}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the Australian Football Injury Prevention Project (AFIPP) in 2002 showed that out of 301 players (who play for amateur clubs in the [[Melbourne]] [[metropolitan area]]), 14 suffered from a form of head knock, 7 of which resulted in concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The incidence of head/neck/orofacial injuries in non-elite Australian Football|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1440244004802639|journal = Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date = 1 January 2004|volume = 7|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/s1440-2440(04)80263-9|first = R|last = Braham|first2 = CF|last2 = Finch|first3 = P|last3 = McCrory}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18.9% of players participating in the test suffered from concussion, bearing in mind that the sample size is also small.

A separate study showed that out of 1015 Australian Rules Football players tested, 78 of them were concussed, 9 of which were concussed multiple times. The players mental functions were tested at controlled intervals with 38.6% of players still displaying symptoms at 48 hours after being concussed but after 96 hours, only 1.1% displayed any symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Natural History of Concussion in Sport Markers of Severity and Implications for Management|url = http://ajs.sagepub.com/content/38/3/464|journal = The American Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 1 March 2010|issn = 0363-5465|pmid = 20194953|pages = 464–471|volume = 38|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0363546509349491|first = Michael|last = Makdissi|first2 = David|last2 = Darby|first3 = Paul|last3 = Maruff|first4 = Antony|last4 = Ugoni|first5 = Peter|last5 = Brukner|first6 = Paul R.|last6 = McCrory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cricket ==
[[Cricket]] is classified differently to high intensity sports like Australian rules football and rugby, due to the stop-start nature of the game rather than continuous flowing play. However, due to the speed of fast bowlers and the hardness of cricket balls, cricket is still very much a high impact sport. Out of all Australian sporting codes, cricket requires the most protective gear to properly guard batsmen from a variety of injuries that can be afflicted all over the body. The most important piece of protective gear is the helmet, which includes a grill covering the face, to protect batsmen from head injuries. In the most recent Australian tour of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], now former Australian batsmen [[Chris Rogers (cricketer)|Chris Rogers]] suffered a concussion during training and was ruled out of the [[test cricket|test series]] without playing a match. This has led [[Cricket Australia]] to plan out an updated concussion policy and guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cricket Australia to roll out new concussion policy across country this summer|url = http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-australia-to-roll-out-new-concussion-policy-across-country-this-summer-20150603-ghfis9.html|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles are based on the International Consensus Conferences on Concussion in Sport (the Zurich Guidelines) and involve the player suspected of being concussed answering a set of questions to determine whether he has to leave the field. While concussion in cricket is considered quite rare due to increasingly safer helmets, the effects can be quite severe. NSW batsmen Ben Rohrer was struck in the head by a cricket ball during a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in November last year, he recalls his legs feeling like jelly and falling over on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cricket Australia trialling 'very conservative' guidelines on concussion|url = http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-australia-trialling-very-conservative-guidelines-on-concussion-20141112-11lewy.html|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely known case is the death of NSW batsmen [[Phillip Hughes]] who died after being receiving a cricket ball to the head in 2014.

A study conducted with 542 junior cricket players revealed only 13% of injuries were limited to the facial region, and none of them suffered a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fielders and batters are injured too: A prospective cohort study of injuries in junior club cricket|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1440244009007142|journal = Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date = 1 January 2010|volume = 13|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jsams.2009.10.489|first = Caroline F.|last = Finch|first2 = Peta|last2 = White|first3 = Rebecca|last3 = Dennis|first4 = Dara|last4 = Twomey|first5 = Andrew|last5 = Hayen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rugby ==
[[File:Brisbane Broncos vs Bulldogs 1.jpg|left|thumb|High intensity, high impact and played by men with big bodies, rugby is an extremely physical game where concussions are common.]]
Most popular in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]], rugby can be classified into two different codes, [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]. Both are played at a very high level of intensity with full contact allowed, and as such has one of the highest concussion rates in the world, let alone Australia. Studies conducted into the incidence of concussion in professional and amateur levels of rugby have revealed that approximately 3.9 concussions per 1000 hours of play occur in professional rugby (1 concussion in every 6 games). Playing at the amateur level, concussion rates are much lower measured at 1 in every 21 matches (1.2 per 1000 hours). This amounts to roughly 5–7 concussions per team per season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Concussion in Rugby Union|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-014-0233-3|journal = Sports Medicine|date = 20 August 2014|issn = 0112-1642|pages = 1717–1731|volume = 44|issue = 12|doi = 10.1007/s40279-014-0233-3|first = Andrew J.|last = Gardner|first2 = Grant L.|last2 = Iverson|first3 = W. Huw|last3 = Williams|first4 = Stephanie|last4 = Baker|first5 = Peter|last5 = Stanwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Rugby League]] released a 4 step set of guidelines, in 2012, for all coaches to follow in the case one of their players suffering a concussion during a game. The guidelines detail that the player be given basic first aid before being assessed by a medical officer, they also stress heavily that if the player is determined to be concussed there is no way the player should return to the field. if the concussion is serious, the player should be sent as soon as possible to hospital for medical treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Wearing protective gear, such as a helmet and mouthguard, can reduce the chances of sustaining a concussion.

== Concussions in children ==
The occurrence of concussion in children during sport is significantly more likely compared to other levels of athletes. Roughly 20% of children playing sport are diagnosed with concussion. Despite the lower level of impact compared to the professional or amateur levels, children's neck muscles are quite weak and most lack the awareness and skill level to cushion or prepare themselves for a blow leading to a high concussion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Management of Concussion in Children|url = http://www.concussioninsportproject.com.au/concussioninsportproject.com.au/Management_of_Children.html|website = www.concussioninsportproject.com.au|accessdate = 2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines and protocols for a child suffering a concussion are basically the same as if an adult received one.

For a child diagnosed with a concussion, the real issue is returning to school rather than the sporting field, as a concussion can affect a child's learning ability. A medical clearance is required before a return to school is possible and parents are recommended to properly manage their child through the first 72 hours after experiencing a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Concussion in Sport: Conceptual and Ethical Issues|author1=McNamee, M.J. |author2=Partridge, B. |author3= Anderson, L |last-author-amp=yes |date = 2015|journal = Kinesiology Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |edition = 4|volume = 2|pages = 190–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">'''Constitutive rhetoric''' is a theory of [[discourse]] devised by [[James Boyd White]] about the capacity of [[language]] or [[symbols]] to create a collective [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] for an [[audience]], especially by means of [[condensation symbols]], [[literature]], and [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Thomas, ed. “Constitutive Rhetoric” Encyclopedia of Rhetoric (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 616.&lt;/ref&gt; Such discourse often demands that action be taken to reinforce the identity and the beliefs of that identity. White explains that it denotes “the art of constituting character, community and culture in language.”&lt;ref&gt;James Boyd White, ''Heracles’ Bow'' (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1985), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Constitutive Rhetorical Theory==

The constitutive model of [[rhetoric]] dates back to the ancient Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], with theories that speech moved audiences to action based on a contingent, shared knowledge.  [[Kenneth Burke]] contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric by highlighting identification, rather than persuasion, as the major means by which language functioned. Burke contended that social identity is founded “spontaneously, intuitively, even unconsciously.”&lt;ref&gt;Charland, Maurice. “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.” (The Quarterly Journal of Speech 73.2 1987), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black's]] theory of the [[second persona]] also aided scholars in rhetoric to analyze the imagined shared values and beliefs between speaker and audience through [[textual analysis]]. Audience must adopt a particular [[ethos]] prior to being persuaded by constitutive rhetoric, thus the ethos of the subject of discourse can be critically studied and interpreted through a text.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these theorists all contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric, [[James Boyd White]] was the first to coin the term. In 1985, he explained that the term “constitutive rhetoric” described [[rhetoric]] that called a common, collective identity into existence. White wrote that persuasion and identification occur only when audiences already understand and relate to method and content. Thus, speech happens within [[culture]], and speakers adapt messages to reflect the ideas and views of a community. When speeches address a diverse crowd as though they are of one community, White describes this as “calling [identity] into being” through [[material culture|material]] [[identification (psychology)|identification]].

According to White, there are two methods of convincing an audience that they belong to an identity. The first is ''peithõ'', persuasion, and the second is deceitful manipulation, or ''dolos''. Using ''peithõ'', speakers convince audiences of shared identity openly and honestly. ''Dolos'' creates belonging through deceit.&lt;ref&gt;White, Heracles’ Bow, 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Maurice Charland further emphasized the importance of the [[narrative]] and [[Marxist theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 616.&lt;/ref&gt;  He observed, “While classical narratives have an ending, constitutive rhetorics leave the task of narrative closure to their constituted subjects”.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, James. “Narrative” Sourcebook on Rhetoric (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2001), 403.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charland’s theory draws from Burke and the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]. Althusser explained [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]], or "hailing," as the social phenomenon of a mass audience having already been “recruited” by an [[ideology]]. Ideologies create subjects of discourse for persuasion by further discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis. “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses.” The Anthropology of the State (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, “the very existence of social subjects (who would become audience members) is already a rhetorical effect.” &lt;ref&gt;Charland, “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.”,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political speeches, manifestos, and resistance movements participate in this type of discourse, to establish an identity and a call to action within that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;  A leader’s speech calling a “nation” to war establishes a national identity within the discourse or text. A feminist speaking on women’s right establishes the identity of the “woman”. An African-American protesting during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] established an “African-American” identity. Every audience member may take part in shared identity because of common symbolic resources, even as the text may especially [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellate]] a smaller sub-group of the [[audience]]. An identity must be established in contrast to another identity. This creates divisions between “us” and “them,” sometimes creating extreme divisions between different identifications.

In 2015, Halstrøm and Galle picked up on constitutive rhetoric within the field of design studies. They explained how it may provide useful concepts for analysing designed artefacts. Design may be said to aim at providing an audience with a subject position, which it is to confirm. Thus, it aims at persuading by seeking to constitute its audience.&lt;ref&gt;Halstrøm, P. L. &amp; P. Galle. “Design as co-evolution of problem, solution, and audience.” Artifact 3(4), (2015): 3.1-3.13. {{DOI|10.14434/artifact.v3i4.12815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Constitutive rhetoric and theories of logical persuasion (such as [[New Criticism]] or [[Neo-Aristotelianism]]) can be used together, but constitutive rhetoric presumes that belief and identity always precedes logical persuasion. Thus, constitutive rhetoric must address the previous identity and must either coincide with it, or change it.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized the paradox of constitutive rhetoric when he analyzed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. He explained that the men signing the Declaration claimed to be representatives of “the people,” but the people were not yet defined as a nation until that Declaration was signed. His criticism explains that an identity must be established before that identity exists in order for the speaker to represent the ideals of that identity, thus creating a paradoxical relationship in which only a third perspective can truly analyze the identity of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of the Savoy, Somerset House and the Water Entrance to Cuper's Garden.jpg|thumb|View of the Savoy, Somerset House and the Water Entrance to Cuper's Garden, 1808]]
'''Cuper's Gardens''' were 17–18th century [[pleasure gardens]] (or [[tea garden]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://storyoflondon.com/print.php?sid=446 London's Lost Tea-Gardens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716150925/http://storyoflondon.com/print.php?sid=446 |date=2011-07-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;) on the south side of the [[River Thames]] in [[Lambeth]], [[London]]. The gardens looked over to [[Somerset House]] near [[Waterloo Bridge]], and were centered on what is now the north end of [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]].

In 1643, [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]] bought three acres of land which he leased to his gardener [[Abraham Boydell Cuper]].&lt;ref name="weinreb"&gt;{{cite book| chapter=Cuper's Gardens | first1=Ben | last1=Weinreb | authorlink1 = Ben Weinreb | first2=Christopher | last2=Hibbert | authorlink2=Christopher Hibbert | title=[[The London Encyclopædia]] | year=1983 | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | page=217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gardens opened in the 1680s and were named after the original proprietor. They were also known as '''Cupid's Gardens'''. In 1686, seven acres of adjoining land was bought from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Sancroft]], and added to the gardens. A long landing stage in the river known as Cuper's Bridge acted as a popular entrance for the gardens.

In 1736, an orchestra was included among the attractions. It also became known for its [[firework display]]s. However, it lost its license in 1753 due to the loose morals of its visitors.

'''Dangdut''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɑː|ŋ|'|d|uː|t}}) is a genre of [[Indonesia]]n [[Folk music|folk]] and [[traditional]] [[popular music]] that is partly derived from [[Hindustani Classical Music|Hindustani]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] music. Dangdut is a very popular genre in Indonesia because of its melodious instrumentation and vocals. Indonesians dance in somewhat similar to the [[ghoomar]] while listening to dangdut music, but in a much slower version.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Dangdut features a [[tabla]] and [[gendang]] beat.&lt;ref name="billboard1998"&gt;{{Citation | last=Campbell | first=Debe | date=18 April 1998 | periodical=Billboard | title=The 'Billboard' report: Dangdut thrives in SE Asia—music rules Indonesia | volume=110 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard1998B"&gt;{{Citation | last=Nuvich | first=Alexandra | date=18 April 1998 | periodical=Billboard | title=Dangdut thrives in SE Asia--Malaysia embraces genre | volume=110 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular Dangdut musicians and singers such as [[Rhoma Irama]], known as the "King of Dangdut"; [[Mansyur S.]]; [[Meggy Z]]; and [[Ellya Khadam]] include strong Indian-music influence in the basis of harmony, theme, and beat to their songs and also by other popular dangdut singers also.

Dangdut is very popular throughout [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], and other [[Malay language|Malay-speaking]] lands.

A dangdut band typically consists of a lead singer, male or female, backed by four to eight musicians. Instruments usually include a [[tabla]], [[gendang]], [[flute]], [[mandolin]], [[guitar]]s, [[sitar]], [[drum machine]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"No Money, No Honey: a Study of Street Traders and Prostitutes in Jakarta" by Alison Murray. Oxford University Press, 1992. Glossary page xii&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been expanded from the desert-style music to embrace other musical styles.&lt;ref name="billboard1998"/&gt; Modern dangdut incorporates influences from Middle Eastern pop music, Western rock, [[house music]], [[hip hop music]], [[contemporary R&amp;B]], and [[reggae]].&lt;ref name="billboard1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vv1992"&gt;{{Citation | last=Gehr | first=Richard | date=10 December 1991 | newspaper=The Village Voice | title=Dawn of Dangdut | volume=36 | page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Dangdut peaked in the 1990s. By 2012, it was mostly popular in the western parts of Indonesia and not in the eastern parts, apart from [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/25/dangdut-no-longer-most-popular-indonesian-music-expert.html |title=‘Dangdut’ loses appeal in Indonesia: Expert |date=April 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506234029/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/25/dangdut-no-longer-most-popular-indonesian-music-expert.html |archivedate=2012-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Prop._Tabla.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The [[tabla]] is one of the most important and main percussion instrument in Dangdut]]
The term ''dangdut'' is a [[Javanese language]] [[onomatopoeia]] for the sound of the ''[[tabla]]'' (also known as ''[[gendang]]'') drum, which is written ''dang'' and ''ndut''. It was reportedly coined by music magazine ''[[Aktuil]]'', although [[Rhoma Irama]] stated that it was coined as a term of derision by the rich to the music of the poor. Despite its derogatory intent, it was seized upon by those playing it, and the term appears in Rhoma's 1973 dangdut classic ''Terajana'':

:''Sulingnya suling bambu'' - The flute, a bamboo flute
:''Gendangnya kulit lembu'' - The drum, from cow hide
:''Dangdut suara gendang rasa ingin berdendang'' - Dangdut's drum sound makes you want to sing

Dangdut as a term distinguished the music of Javanese from the [[Orkes Melayu]] of North Sumatran Malays.

Besides orkes Melayu, the primary musical influence on dangdut was Indian [[Bollywood]] music. The song "Terajana" pays homage to the 1959 Bollywood hit "Tera Jana Ke," and though dangdut is primarily written in the Indonesian language, respect was paid to the Indian influence. The next verse of "Terajana" is as follows:

:''Terajana... Terajana'' - Terajana, Terajana
:''Ini lagunya... lagu India'' - This is the song, song of India

Orkes Melayu singer [[Ellya Khadam]] switched to dangdut in the 1970s, and, by 1972, she was the number-one artist in Indonesia. Her success, with that of [[Rhoma Irama]], meant that by 1975, 75 percent of all recorded music in Indonesia was of the dangdut genre, with pop bands such as [[Koes Plus]] adopting the style.

== Culture ==
[[File:Dangdut singer Yogyakarta.jpg|thumb|Koplo dangdut singer in [[Yogyakarta]]]]
Most major cities, especially on [[Java]], have one or more venues that have a dangdut show several times a week. The concerts of major dangdut stars are also broadcast on television.

Beginning in 2003, certain dangdut musicians became the focus of a national controversy in Indonesia regarding performances by singer [[Inul Daratista]], which religious conservatives described as pornography. Protests led by dangdut megastar and devout Muslim [[Rhoma Irama]] called for Daratista to be banned from television, and legislation was passed in 2008 by the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] that introduced a broad range of activities described as [[pornography]].&lt;ref name="Indonesia passes broad anti-pornography bill"&gt;{{Citation | first=Peter | last=Gelling | title=Indonesia passes broad anti-pornography bill | date=30 October 2008 | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flamboyant performances at some dangdut shows also attracted collateral attention in May 2012 when a row broke out in Indonesia over a planned performance by international star [[Lady Gaga]] in [[Jakarta]] due to be held in early June 2012. In the face of opposition from conservative Muslim groups in Indonesia, the planned show was canceled. This cancelation led numerous commentators to note that opposition to Lady Gaga's performances was surprising given the nature of some dangdut shows.&lt;ref&gt;M. Taufiqurrahman, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/08/dangdut-collateral-damage-gaga-saga.html 'Dangdut' the collateral damage in the Gaga saga'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangdut remains an integral part of Indonesian life and [[popular culture|pop culture]] despite conservative Muslim concerns over the supposed vulgarity of some performances (such as by [[Julia Perez]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17520726 | work=BBC News | title=Raunchy dangdut music stirs debate in Indonesia | date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the popularity of the genre, some movies and TV show have dangdut-centered themes, such as Rhoma Irama's movies and [[Rudy Soedjarwo]]'s ''[[Mendadak Dangdut]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5505">The [[digital terrestrial television]] system was launched in [[Thailand]] in 2014. it employs [[DVB-T2]] as its digital encoding standard.

The Broadcast Commission (BC) under the National Broadcast &amp; Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) announced in the last quarter of 2013 that it plans to give DTTV license through open auction within December 2013. The prospectus has been priced at 1 million baht and many of the incumbent content owners providers as well as studios bought the prospectus.  If all goes well, the auction will result in 4 categories of licenses: High Definition TV, Standard Definition TV, Children TV and Digital News TV.  The number of provider who will survive the auction is still unknown.

Prior to the auction announcement, BC quietly granted a bottleneck "network" license to existing government incumbent which means that all the new DTTV providers have to send DTTV signal to these governmental MUX providers at the price fixed by the providers themselves.  In response to claim of uncertainty and in order to lessen financial risk to potential bidders might face after the granting of license, BC came out to state that it encouraged the "potential" bidders to "negotiate" MUX price/charge before going into the bidding room.

'''Elvis sightings''' are reported sightings of singer [[Elvis Presley]] following his death in 1977. The [[conspiracy theory]] that Presley did not die and instead went into hiding was popularized by [[Gail Brewer-Giorgio]] and other authors.

== Notable sighting claims ==
The earliest known alleged sighting was at the [[Memphis International Airport]] where a man resembling Presley gave the name "Jon Burrows", which was the same name Presley used when booking hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Partridge|first1=Kenneth|title=Suspicious Minds: The Bizarre, 40-Year History of Elvis Presley Sightings|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/503466/suspicious-minds-bizarre-40-year-history-elvis-presley-sightings|accessdate=January 6, 2018|date=August 14, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of alleged sightings took place in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], in the late 1980s. Such reports encountered much public ridicule and became fodder for humorous publications like the ''[[Weekly World News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmidt|first1=William E.|title=Vicksburg Journal; Someplace for the King to Call Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/17/us/vicksburg-journal-someplace-for-the-king-to-call-home.html|accessdate=January 6, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=October 17, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presley was rumored to have appeared in the background of an airport scene in the 1990 film ''[[Home Alone]]''. It was alleged that a bearded man wearing a turtleneck and a sports jacket could be seen over the left shoulder of [[Catherine O'Hara]]'s character while she is arguing with an airline employee. Paranormal researcher [[Ben Radford]] responded to Elvis sighting believers with "Why fake your death and then turn up as an extra in a popular movie? How could the cast and crew have failed to notice the presence of one of the most famous figures in the world? Even if he looked very different could he have disguised his voice and mannerisms?". Radford was challenged to find the actor who played that part to prove it was not Presley. He explained that the burden of proof was on the person making the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=Ben |authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Is Elvis Presley in Home Alone? |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=26–27 |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'', director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] responded "If Elvis was on the set, I would have known".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title='Home Alone': Still a scream 25 years later|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/05/home-alone-turns-25-macaulay-culkin/73290704/|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=USA Today|date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being challenged by Radford to locate the true identity of this extra, Kenny Biddle investigated and found the man to be Gary Richard Grott, who passed away of a heart attack in February 2016. Biddle located Grott's son, Roman, who explained that his father was indeed the extra in the airport scene of ''Home Alone'', and that he had known director Chris Columbus personally. Because of this he appeared in a number of his movies as an extra, including ''Home Alone''.&lt;ref name="Biddle"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Biddle |first1=Kenny |title=Busting the ‘Elvis Presley in Home Alone’ Movie Myth |website=csicop.org |publisher=CFI |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/busting_the_lsquoelvis_presley_in_home_alonersquo_movie_myth|accessdate=October 25, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025035243/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/busting_the_lsquoelvis_presley_in_home_alonersquo_movie_myth |archivedate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Bixby]], who co-starred with Presley in ''[[Clambake (film)|Clambake]]'' and ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'', hosted two [[television special]]s investigating the conspiracy: ''The Elvis Files'' (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kogan|first1=Rick|title=The Once And Future King|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-08-13/features/9103280328_1_graceland-bathroom-elvis-files-future-king|accessdate=January 6, 2018|work=Chicago Tribune|date=August 13, 1991|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Elvis Conspiracy'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kogan|first1=Rick|title=`Anything But Love` Axed By Studio And Abc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-01-22/features/9201070160_1_show-syndication-studio-and-abc|accessdate=January 6, 2018|work=Evening: Best on TV|date=January 22, 1992|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy was also featured in the 1990 video game, ''[[Les Manley in: Search for the King]]'', where the titular hero attempts to find Presley (known in the game as "the King") to win a million-dollar contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cobbett|first1=Richard|title=Crap Shoot: Les Manley: Search For THE KING|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/crap-shoot-les-manley-search-for-the-king/|accessdate=January 14, 2018|work=PC Gamer|date=December 24, 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos''' ('''FIQ''') is a [[comic convention]] held in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]], every two years.

== History ==

In 1997, the third edition of Bienal Internacional de Quadrinhos (''International Comics Biennial'') was held in [[Belo Horizonte]]. This was an annual comic event held previously in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1991 and 1993 (the 1995 edition didn't happen because it lost the financial support of the Rio de Janeiro City Hall, which made the event change to Belo Horizonte). With the definitive cancellation of Bienal after the 1997 edition, the Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos (''International Comics Festival'') was created in 1999, with the same proposal of the previous event that was to present exhibitions of comic artists from all over the world and give the opportunity for independent Brazilian authors to present their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/ilustrad/fq031128.htm |title=Bienal Internacional passa a ser itinerante |publisher=[[Folha de S. Paulo]] |date=November 3, 1997 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of FIQ was organized by the Belo Horizonte City Hall and had exhibitions, debates, conferences and a comic book fair. The event took place mainly in the Cultural Center of [[UFMG]], besides having exhibitions in libraries over the city. [[France]] was the first honored country, counting on special exhibitions, including one in honor of the artist [[François Boucq]]. The guest of honor of this edition was the cartoonist [[Angeli (cartoonist)|Angeli]].&lt;ref name="1FIQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgabc.com.br/Noticia/447395/bh-tem-o-1-festival-internacional-de-quadrinhos |title=BH tem o 1º Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos |publisher=Diário do Grande ABC |date=November 30, 1999 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the event maintained the biennial periodicity. By 2011, in addition to the guest of honor, there was also a country honored. As of the 2013 edition, the event didn't have honored countries, having instead exhibitions and guests from many different countries. In every edition, a Brazilian artist is chosen as a guest of honor, with exhibitions about his work. This guest, generally, is also responsible for the illustration of the event's poster.&lt;ref name="7FIQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.select.art.br/7o-festival-internacional-de-quadrinhos-de-bh/ |title=7º Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos de BH |publisher=Select |date=November 3, 2011 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="8FIQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.terra.com.br/diversao/arte-e-cultura/festival-internacional-de-quadrinhos-comeca-hoje-em-bh,e4d08470c5152410VgnVCM3000009af154d0RCRD.html |title=Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos começa hoje em BH |publisher=[[Terra (company)|Terra]] |date=November 13, 2013 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the event was not held due to lack of money from the city of Belo Horizonte. The edition of that year was transferred to the first semester of 2018, happening to be realized biennial in the even years from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universohq.com/noticias/fiq-e-adiado-para-2018/ |title=FIQ é adiado para 2018 |publisher=[[Universo HQ]] |date=July 10, 2017 |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First Leisure Corporation''' plc was a leisure operator in the United Kingdom between the years 1981 and 2004.

Originally based in Soho Square, London, and with other offices in Blackpool and Leicester, its operations included Blackpool Tower, the WinterGardens and all three of Blackpool's piers, as well as five other piers, health and fitness clubs, nightclubs and bars, tenpin bowling centres and other mainstream UK high street entertainment venues.

In 2000 a management buyout (MBO) financed by 3i and PPM Holdings saw First Leisure shed all but its Nightclubs and Bars division, which retained the First Leisure brand and consisted of approximately fifty mainstream high street venues. The MBO saw the company de-listing from the stock exchange (whilst retaining its plc status) and moving its operations to [[Leicester]].

At that time, the Health and Fitness chain was spun off as [[Esporta Health Clubs|Esporta]].

By 2004, the company had shrunk its operations from 50 to 25 nightclubs; in so doing, it had sold its premises leases to rival operators. A clause of such sales mandated that should those new operators be unable to meet their obligations under the leases that they would be automatically reassigned to First Leisure with little warning or ceremony.

At the end of 2004, such an automatic reassignment took place following competitors' defaults on a number of previously sold leases. Unable to meet the dramatically increased month-to-month obligations brought about by this mandatory re-acquisition, the company was subject to a Winding Up Order by a trade creditor and hence placed into Compulsory Liquidation by the Official Receiver.

A 'Phoenix' company, named The Nightclub Company, was formed virtually immediately by the incumbent management team. Such an operation was short-lived, however, and it too was placed into administration in 2005. The precise circumstances regarding the collapse of TNC are unclear.

The remaining leases were sold, mostly to long-time rival [[Luminar Leisure]].

All that remains of the corporation as of 2007 is the Esporta health and fitness chain.

'''''Gangland''''' is a video game created by Danish studio Mediamobsters. It has the premise of mixing [[real-time strategy]], [[role-playing video game]] and [[simulation game]].

==Story==
The player takes the role of Mario Mangano, whose four brothers, Romano, Angelo, Sonny, and the eldest Chico, are caporegime of the Mangano crime family based in Palermo. When their father, the Don of the Borgata, dies, a power struggle hits the family and ends with Chico being nominated as the new boss. Romano, Angelo, and Sonny murder Chico after his promotion and flip away from Italy to the new world, escaping the police manhunt meant to capture them. Two years later, Mario's uncle Vincenzo Mangano calls Mario's grandfather and says that the three brothers are in his city, Paradise City. The single-player campaign begins when Mario is sent to Paradise City by his grandfather to work under Vincenzo until he is powerful enough to hunt down and kill the three murderous brothers.

}}

The game received "mixed" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

A common criticism of ''Gangland'' was its repetitive gameplay.  The game also suffered from a poorly implemented checkpoint saving system, as well as game mechanics that would discourage the use of certain units because of future penalties. Some of the actions a player could perform could be considered game breaking actions (such as the permanent destruction of vital resources) that could ruin multiplayer games.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying, "It ain't pretty, but it's business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Steinberg |first=Scott |date=February 14, 2004 |url=http://www.maximonline.com/entertainment/reviews/review_games_6939.html |title=Gangland |publisher=''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040301004555/http://www.maximonline.com/entertainment/reviews/review_games_6939.html |archivedate=March 1, 2004 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Playboy]]'' gave it 75%, saying, "Think of this strategy game as ''[[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]]'' meets ''[[The Sopranos]]''."&lt;ref name=Playboy/&gt;  However, ''[[The Times]]'' gave it three stars out of five, saying, "Releasing a game without a save mode is a brave move; releasing a game without a save mode because you forgot is just worrying. For those of you hoping to play ''Gangland'' and complete it, my advice is to wait until a save patch becomes available, supposedly in the next month or so."&lt;ref name=TheTimes/&gt;

'''Gurglin Gutz''' was a toy consisting of a colorful, stylized, rubber human organ, either a [[brain]], [[heart]], [[stomach]], or [[eyeball]], immersed in a red fluid and enclosed in a thin latex ball film. The toy produced guttural gurgling and bubbling noises when squeezed, as the liquid pulsated in the rubber organ's many cavities and orifices. ''Gugling Gutz'' also came in a smaller, keychain size.

The toy was created by [[Jimmy Diresta|Jimmy DiResta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donovan|first=Aaron|title=NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.; Toys and Items That Began As Found Objects|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-toys-and-items-that-began-as-found-objects.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manufactured by 4Kidz, Inc.

The '''Gym Dandies''' is the largest children's [[circus]] in [[New England]].  Located in [[Scarborough, Maine]], the program is an [[extracurricular activity]] for any children in grades three through twelve who wish to participate.

== Mission statement ==
This is the Gym Dandies' [[mission statement]], according to their [http://gymdandies.org/show.php?page=display&amp;category=3 website]:&lt;br /&gt;
"'The Gym Dandies' is not about winning or [losing].  The primary goal of this program is to help children develop motor skills, confidence, and self-esteem in a noncompetitive atmosphere.  Ultimately, participants will apply their skills cooperatively in performances for the purpose of entertainment.

== Performances ==
=== Parades ===
The group generally only does performances around New England, especially in the states of [[Maine]] and [[New Hampshire]], however they have also been to the National Independence Day Parade three times (2000 2004,2006 and 2011),  the [[Montreal]] Bicycle Festival (2002), the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] (2005), the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade (2008 and 2012). Most recently the group was invited to participate in the 2013 Presidential Inaugural Day Parade in Washington D.C. (2013). The Gym Dandies were also an annual participant in the Maine State Parade until it was cancelled.  The children's circus has also been featured twice on the [[PBS]] show, ''[[Zoom (1999 TV series)|Zoom]]''.

=== Community performances ===
Many times, the Gym Dandies will visit other schools around New England to give lessons and community performances. They often leave a lasting impression, and many schools are motivated to start their own circus arts program. In addition to this, there is an annual performance for the town of Scarborough.

=== Equipment ===
A list of the circus arts equipment that the group uses in its performances:
*[[Unicycle]]s
*"Giraffes" ({{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} unicycles)
*[[Juggling ball]]s, [[juggling club|clubs]], and [[juggling ring|rings]]
*[[Diabolo]]s
*[[Yo-yo]]s
*[[Devil sticks]]
* Walking Globes, 24" to 30" high, on which children balance, walk, while jumping rope/juggling)
*[[Spinning plate]]s
* Chinese Stilts
* Slack hope

== History ==
The Gym Dandies" Children’s Circus of Scarborough, Maine came into existence when Jon Cahill, the director of this group, began incorporating [[circus skills]] into the [[physical education]] program.  Mr. Cahill soon realized that circus arts had the potential to be much more than just an alternate activity in the physical education curriculum.  There were numerous potential benefits that could be realized by children as a result of participating in this unusual, challenging, and exciting endeavor.  But, something was missing.  The children loved to demonstrate their skills. They wanted to perform, and this was the birth of "The Gym Dandies".

In 1981, "The Gym Dandies", the little "Big Top" of Scarborough, consisted of ten enthusiastic fifth and sixth grade boys and girls and a box full of [[tennis balls]].  Circus arts are naturally motivating for children at this age and soon it became obvious that [[juggling]], although challenging, was not enough.  "The Gym Dandies" held what might have been the "World’s First Juggle -A-Thon" in the spring of 1981.  Funds raised from the Juggle-A-Thon went toward the purchase of unicycles.  By the spring of 1982, after a great deal of hard work,  “The Gym Dandies" had evolved into a stylized unicycling and juggling group normally found only in professional circuses.

Approximately 230 children now participate each school year. There are beginner and advanced groups and each member meets once a week to practice. The age range of participants is 8 to 18 hears years old.  Well over 4,000
Scarborough, Maine school children have participated in the Gym Dandies circus arts program since 1981.

Originally a means of winter transport between the islands and shores of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], '''ice canoeing''' is now a sport. Crews of five athletes alternately push their canoe across the ice on the frozen parts of the river, and paddle in a river with currents of four knots, tides of over 15 feet, and ice blocks weighing a few tonnes blown by the wind.&lt;ref name="demotix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice canoe race growing in popularity|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/584113/ice-canoe-race-growing-popularity#media-584097|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoes with bolts screwed to the bottom are worn to keep their traction on the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rick Mercer Report|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/The+Rick+Mercer+Report/Season+9/ID/2199954603/|work=Season 9 - Episode 16|publisher=CBC|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Northumberland Strait iceboat.png|right|frame|Two [[Northumberland Strait iceboat]]s being hauled over ice during their crossing on [[Northumberland Strait]] (date unknown).]] --&gt;

Ice canoeing has been practised since the beginnings of [[New France]] in the 1600s, as the only way to cross the [[Saint Lawrence River]] when there is too much ice for ferries, but not enough to form an [[ice bridge]].  In the 1860s more than 200 canoers, mostly at [[Lévis]] provided transportation for passengers and goods. Ice canoeing was practised in [[Montreal]] from the early 1800s. The advent of [[steamboat]]s capable of breaking through the ice put an end to icecanoeing as a means of transportation in the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="defi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tout sur le canot à glace|url=http://deficanotaglace.ca/|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1894, the first race was organised between Lévis and  the [[Port of Quebec]] at the first [[Quebec Winter Carnival]].&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://canotaglace.com/nexttoutsur|publisher=Association des coureurs en canot à glace|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Montreal races were held during the Fête des Neiges de Montréal from 1988 to 1992. In 2013,  Héritage Maritime Canada relaunched the race as the Défi canot à glace Bota Bota.&lt;ref name="defi"/&gt; Since the 1990s races have also been held at [[Toronto]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Gatineau]], [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Chicoutimi]] and the [[Isle-aux-Coudres]].

Women have competed since 1987.&lt;ref name="demotix"/&gt;

==Competition==
[[File:Ice canoe racing.jpg|thumb|Défi canot à glace Bota Bota 2014]]
The Association des Coureurs en Canot à Glace du Québec (ACCGQ) was formed in 1984 to organise and standardise races. Six races are accredited by the ACCGQ: La Grande Traversée Casino de Charlevoix, La Course en canot du Carnaval, La course de la banquise de Portneuf, Trois-Rivières Extrême, le Défi Canot à Glace Montréal, and le Grand Défi des Glaces. The latter is the biggest event. It is run during the [[Quebec Winter Carnival]], at [[Quebec City]] every February. More than 40 teams compete, struggling with the powerful current, large chunks of ice and cold water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Canoe Racing across St Lawrence River in Quebec City|url=http://race.fit2paddle.com/C2047168441/E20070131131733/index.html|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quebec City area is the centre of ice canoeing activity, but there are teams elsewhere in the province of [[Quebec]]. A crew from [[Calgary]] has competed in the race for at least 41 years. The race has also seen teams from [[Chicago]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

Athletes compete in three classes: elite men, elite women, and sport, the latter comprising crews of men, and crews of mixed men and women.

Originally wooden, canoes are now made with [[epoxy]] and [[fibreglass]] with an internal metal frame.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; The minimum weight of a canoe is {{convert|250|lb|kg}} for the sport and elite men classes, and {{convert|225|lb|kg}} for elite women. The length of the boat must be between {{convert|6|m|ft}} and {{convert|28|ft|2|in|m}}. Boats must contain 100 litres of flotation material, and it must be possible to float the boat with 700 litres of water on board. Canoes must be brightly-coloured and not painted white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RÈGLEMENT DES COURSES DE LA COUPE DES GLACES SAISON 2014|url=http://canotaglace.com/components/com_courses/pdf/090214221458reglementcdg%202014_5%20courses.pdf|publisher=ACCGQ|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located within the [[Singapore Sports Hub]], beside [[Leisure Park Kallang]] and [[Stadium MRT Station]], Kallang Theatre is managed by [[Sport Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/kallang-theatre-to-be-run-by-sport-singapore-arts-groups-hope-it-stays-a&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally opened on February 23, 1970 as the "Kallang Cinema", it was the largest cinema in [[Singapore]] at the time. The venue was later transformed into a live performance theatre in the wake of the [[Singapore National Theatre|National Theatre]] closure. In March 1986, the National Theatre Trust relocated to Kallang Theatre.

Aside from hosting cultural events, Kallang Theatre also became the venue of the annual [[Singapore National Day Rally|National Day Rally]].

The film's [[soundtrack album]] and [[background music|background score]] are composed by [[M. Jayachandran]]. The lyrics for the songs were written by [[ONV Kurup]], [[Vinod Mankara]] and [[Gopalakrishna Bharathi]]. The album was released on 5 September 2016 at Hycinth hotel in Trivandrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/Kamboji/photos/a.233898173644176.1073741828.203292343371426/298538853846774/?type=3&amp;theater |title=Kamboji audio release |work=facebook|date=5 September 2016 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album marks Jayachandran's re-collaboration with Vinod Mankara after their successful film ''[[Karayilekku Oru Kadal Dooram]]'' (2010) for which the former won Kerala State Award for best music director.

'''Maria Amalia''' "'''Melina'''" '''Mercouri''' (18 October 1920 – 6 March 1994) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] actress, singer, and politician. She received an [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Oscar]] nomination and won a [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Cannes Film Festival Award]] for her performance in the 1960 film ''[[Never on Sunday]]''. Mercouri was also nominated for three [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] in her acting career.

As a politician, she was a member of the [[PASOK]] and the [[Hellenic Parliament]]. In October 1981, Mercouri became the first female [[Ministry of Culture and Sports (Greece)|Minister of Culture and Sports]].

==Early life==
Mercouri was born in 1920 to a former [[cavalry officer]] and member of the Greek parliament, [[Stamatis Mercouris]], and his wife, Eirini Lappa. When she completed her secondary education, she attended the National Theatre's Drama School, graduating in 1944. Mercouri's first husband was a wealthy landowner, Panos Harokopos; the couple divorced in 1962. 

As an actress, Mercouri made her film debut in ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955) and met international success with her performances in ''[[Never on Sunday]]'' (1960, with future husband [[Jules Dassin]]), ''[[Phaedra (film)|Phaedra]]'', ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'', and ''[[Promise at Dawn]]''. She won the award for [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]] at the [[1960 Cannes Film Festival]]. She was nominated for an [[Academy Award]], a [[Tony Award]], three [[Golden Globe Awards]], and two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Awards]].

A political [[Activism|activist]] during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]], Mercouri became a member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in 1977 and became the first female [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister for Culture of Greece]] in 1981. In 1983, Mercouri proposed the programme of the [[European Capital of Culture]], which was established by the [[European Union]] in 1985.

Mercouri was a strong advocate for the return to [[Athens]] of the [[Parthenon Marbles]], which were removed from the [[Parthenon]], and are now displayed in the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Casey |first=Christopher |date=October 30, 2008 |title="Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism |work=Foundations.

==Acting career==

===Early years on stage===
After her graduation, Mercouri joined the [[National Theatre of Greece]] and played the role of [[Electra]] in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s play ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' in 1945. In 1949, she had her first major success in the theatre playing [[Blanche DuBois]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', written by [[Tennessee Williams]] and staged by [[Karolos Koun]]'s Art Theatre. Until 1950, she also worked in the same theatre in other plays by [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Arthur Miller]] and [[André Roussin]].

Mercouri then moved to [[Paris]], where she appeared in boulevard plays by [[Jacques Deval]] and [[Marcel Achard]], and met famous [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s and [[novelist]]s such as [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Colette]] and [[Françoise Sagan]]. In 1953, Mercouri received the [[Marika Kotopouli]] Prize.

Mercouri returned to Greece in 1955. At the Kotopouli-Rex Theatre, Mercouri starred in ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and ''[[L'Alouette (The Lark)|L'Alouette]]'' by [[Jean Anouilh]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===International success===
[[File:Μελίνα Μερκούρη.jpg|thumb|Melina Mercouri in ''[[Phaedra (film)|Phaedra]]'', 1962]]

Mercouri's first movie was the [[Greek language]] film ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955), directed by ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' director [[Michael Cacoyannis]]. The film received special praise at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]], where she met [[United States|American]] [[film director]] [[Jules Dassin]], with whom she would share not only her career but also her life. Their first professional pairing was 1957's ''[[He Who Must Die]]''. Other films by Dassin and featuring Mercouri followed, such as ''[[The Law (1959 film)|The Law]]'' (1959).

Mercouri became well-known to international audiences when she starred in ''[[Never on Sunday]]'' (1960), in which Dassin was the director and co-star. For this film, she earned the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] at the [[1960 Cannes Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bafta.org Profile], bafta.org; accessed 6 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her first major international success, Mercouri went on to star in ''[[Phaedra (film)|Phaedra]]'' (1962), for which she was nominated again for the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Award]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Drama]]. The recognition of her acting talent did not stop though, as her role in ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'' (1964) granted her one more nomination, this time for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]. Mercouri worked with such directors as [[Joseph Losey]], [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Ronald Neame]], [[Carl Foreman]], [[Norman Jewison]], and starred in films like [[Spanish language]] ''[[The Uninhibited]]'' by [[Juan Antonio Bardem]].

Mercouri continued her stage career in the Greek production of [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' (1960), under the direction of [[Karolos Koun]]. In 1967, she played the leading role in ''[[Illya Darling]]'' (from 11 April 1967 to 13 January 1968) on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]],&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{iBDB name|52785}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]. Mercouri's performance in ''[[Promise at Dawn]]'' (1970) earned her another [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination.

On 8 October 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2FteAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AmENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2957,4135065&amp;dq=host-john-daly-seated-the-actress&amp;hl=en ''What's My Line'' incident of 8 October 1962]; accessed 6 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercouri appeared on the American TV show ''[[What's My Line]]''. After the panel were blindfolded, a strange man appeared on-stage and proclaimed himself "the second mystery guest". Host [[John Charles Daly]] quickly called for "the relieving unit" and said "schedule two" (a coded phrase used on live broadcasts in case of an emergency: the cameras are turned to a neutral position and the sound is cut off). The man talked a bit about a dating service he apparently owned before being hustled off the stage by announcer [[Johnny Olson]] and [[executive producer]] [[Gil Fates]]. Daly apologized to the panel and the program continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|YW8qFj1G5j0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercouri concentrated on her stage career for the following years, playing in the Greek productions of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' and, for a second time, ''Sweet Bird of Youth'', in addition to the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Tragedy|tragedies]] ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' and ''[[Oresteia]]''. She retired from film acting in 1978, when she played in her last film, ''[[A Dream of Passion]]'', directed by her husband, [[Jules Dassin]]. Mercouri's last performance on stage was in the opera ''Pylades'' at the [[Athens Concert Hall]] in 1992, portraying [[Clytemnestra]].

==As singer==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
One of her first songs was by [[Manos Hadjidakis]] and [[Nikos Gatsos]]. It was titled ''Hartino to Fengaraki'' ("Papermoon") and was a part of the Greek production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' in 1949, in which she starred as [[Blanche DuBois]]. The first official recording of this, now-legendary song was made by [[Nana Mouskouri]] in 1960, although the company Sirius, created by [[Manos Hadjidakis]], issued, in 2004, a recording Melina had made for [[France|French]] television during the 1960s. Her recordings of "Athenes, ma Ville", a collaboration with [[Vangelis]], and "Melinaki", were popular in France. Her recording of "Feggari mou, Agapi mou" (Phaedra) was quite popular and was later covered by [[Marinella]] in 1965.

==Political career==

===Activism against the Greek junta===
At the time of the [[coup d'état]] in [[Greece]] by a group of colonels of the [[Military of Greece|Greek military]] on 21 April 1967, she was in the [[United States]], playing in ''[[Illya Darling]]''. She immediately joined the struggle against the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek Military Junta]] and started an international campaign, travelling all over the world to inform the public and contribute to the isolation and fall of the colonels. As a result, the dictatorial regime revoked her [[Greek nationality law|Greek citizenship]] and confiscated her property.&lt;ref name="Newsweek2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Newsweek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRHkAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 March 2013|year=1967|publisher=Newsweek|quote=Greek word for honey (rneli), but there was acid in her throaty voice last week as vibrant Melina Mercouri condemned Brig.

===Involvement in politics===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
After the fall of the Junta and during the ''[[metapolitefsi]]'' in 1974, Mercouri settled in Greece and was one of the founding members of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK), a [[centre-left]] [[political party]]. She was a member of the party's Central Committee and a rapporteur for the Culture Section, while being involved in the women's movement as well.

In the [[Greek legislative election, 1974|Greek legislative elections of 1974]], she was a PASOK candidate in the [[Piraeus Prefecture|Piraeus B]] [[List of parliamentary constituencies of Greece|constituency]], but the 7,500 votes were not enough to secure a seat for her in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] (she needed 33 more votes), something that came true in the [[Greek legislative election, 1977|elections of 1977]], in which she obtained the highest number of votes in the whole of Greece. {{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Minister for Culture: 1981–1989===
{{One source|section|date=December 2014}}
[[File:Melina Mercouri (1985).jpg|thumb|Melina Mercouri (1985)]]
When PASOK won the elections of 1981, Mercouri was appointed [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister for Culture of Greece]], being the first female in that post. She would serve in that position for two terms until 1989, when PASOK lost the elections and [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] formed a cabinet. As Minister for Culture, Mercouri took advantage of her fame abroad and got in contact with great European leaders in order to promote Greece. She strongly advocated the return to [[Athens]] of the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles]], that were removed from [[Parthenon]] and other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens]] by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]], and are now part of the [[British Museum]] collection in [[London]]. In anticipation of the return of the marbles, she held an international competition for the construction of the [[New Acropolis Museum]], designated to display them and finally established in 2008.&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

One of her greatest achievements was the establishment of the institution of the [[European Capital of Culture]] within the framework of cultural policy of the [[European Union]], that she had conceived and proposed in 1983, with Athens inaugurating this institution being the first title-holder in 1985, while she was a devoted supporter of the [[1996 Summer Olympics bids|Athens bid]] to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Centennial Olympic Games]]. In 1983, during the first Greek [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], Mercouri invited the Ministers for Culture of the other nine [[Member State of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] at [[Zappeion]], in order to increase the people's cultural awareness, since there was not any reference to cultural questions in the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which led to the establishment of formal sessions between the Ministers of Culture of the European Union. During the second presidency of Greece in 1988, she supported the cooperation between [[Eastern Europe]] and the European Union, which was finally implemented one year later with the celebration of the Month of Culture in Eastern countries. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Mercouri commissioned a study for the integration of all the archaeological sites of Athens to create a traffic-free archaeological park to promote the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]. She introduced free access to museums and archaeological sites for Greek citizens, organized a series of exhibitions of Greek cultural heritage and [[modern Greek art]] worldwide, supported the restoration of buildings of special architectural interest and the completion of the [[Athens Concert Hall]], backed the project of the [[Museum of Byzantine culture]] in [[Thessaloniki]] and established annual literary pizes. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In June 1986 Melina Mercouri spoke at the Oxford Union, a world-famous debating society, on the matter of the Parthenon Marbles and whether they should remain in London or be returned to Greece. She argued passionately for the Marble's reunification. As she explains, the Marbles are more to Greece than just works of art: they are an essential element of Greek heritage, which ties directly into cultural identity. She said: "You must understand what the Parthenon Marbles mean to us. They are our pride. They are our sacrifices. They are our noblest symbol of excellence. They are a tribute to the democratic philosophy. They are our aspirations and our name. They are the essence of Greekness."&lt;ref&gt;Mercouri, Melina. “Melina's Speech to the Oxford Union.” The Parthenon Marbles, Ian Swindale, 9 Feb. 1997, www.parthenon.newmentor.net/speech.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Her stance on the matter has inspired a new wave of activism on the issue, and inspired pride in Greek culture and history.

===Minister for Culture: 1993–1994===
{{One source|section|date=December 2014}}
In the [[Greek legislative election, November 1989|legislative elections of November 1989]], PASOK lost and Mercouri was elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament and remained a member of the party's Executive Bureau. In 1990, she was a candidate for [[List of mayors of Athens|Mayor of Athens]] but she was defeated by [[Antonis Tritsis]].

After PASOK's win in the [[Greek legislative election, 1993|election of 1993]], she was back at the Ministry for Culture.&lt;ref name="yppo"&gt;[http://www.yppo.gr/1/e1120.jsp?person=6 Melina Mercouri profile], Hellenic Ministry of Culture website; accessed 6 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her major goals in this second term in office were: to create a cultural park in the [[Aegean Sea]] in order to protect and enhance the environment and civilization of the [[Aegean Islands]], and to link culture with education at all [[Education in Greece|education levels]], introducing a system of post-training of teachers.

==Death==
Mercouri died on 6 March 1994 at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]], [[New York City]], from [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/07/obituaries/melina-mercouri-actress-and-politician-is-dead.html Melina Mercouri, Actress and Politician, Is Dead]&lt;/ref&gt; She was survived by her husband, [[Jules Dassin]]. She had no children. She received a [[state funeral]] with [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]]'s honors at the [[First Cemetery of Athens]] four days later. '''The Melina Mercouri Foundation''' was founded by her widower. After her death, UNESCO established the ‘Melina Mercouri International Prize for the Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes (UNESCO-Greece)' which rewards outstanding examples of action to safeguard and enhance the world's major cultural landscapes.&lt;ref name="yppo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.melinamercourifoundation.org.gr Foundation Melina Mercouri] {{el icon}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Night in the Woods''''' (abbreviated as '''NITW''') is a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] [[adventure game]] released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[ Nintendo Switch]]. The game released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and PlayStation 4 on February 21, 2017. A Version for Xbox One was released on December 13, 2017, while a version for the Nintendo Switch was released on February 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twinfinite.net/2018/01/night-in-the-woods-is-coming-to-switch-this-week/ |title=Night in the Woods Is Coming to Switch This Week |website=twinfinite.net |language=en-US |access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions for [[iOS]] and [[Android (OS)|Android]] will arrive in 2018. ''Night in the Woods'' is developed by Infinite Fall, a studio founded by [[Video game developer|game designer]] [[Alec Holowka]], and [[animator]]/[[Game art design|illustrator]] Scott Benson. [[Secret Lab]], an Australian studio, built the game's narrative engine, and are creating the mobile version of the game using their sprite compression systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.secretlab.com.au/blog/2017/11/14/how-night-in-the-woods-uses-yarn-spinner|title=How Night in the Woods Uses Yarn Spinner|work=Secret Lab|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.secretlab.com.au/blog/2017/10/24/small-towns-small-screens-night-in-the-woods-is-coming-to-mobile|title=Small Towns, Small Screens: Night in the Woods is coming to mobile|work=Secret Lab|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a story-focused [[exploration game]] in which [[Player (game)|players]] control a young woman named Mae, who recently dropped out of college and has returned to her hometown to find unexpected changes. The game was funded via the [[Crowdfunding in video games|crowdfunding]] platform [[Kickstarter]], where it eventually earned over 400% of its {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} funding goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1307515311/night-in-the-woods/|title=Kickstarter, Night in the Woods project page|publisher=Kickstarter|date = November 22, 2013|accessdate = February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A companion game titled ''Longest Night'' was released in December 2013 by Holowka and Benson, along with co-[[Video game writer|writer]] Bethany Hockenberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finji.itch.io/longest-night|title=Longest Night|work=[[itch.io]]|date=December 21, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, a second supplemental game was released, titled ''Lost Constellation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://finji.itch.io/lost-constellation | title = Lost Constellation | date = December 31, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2015 | work = [[itch.io]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended version of the game, titled the ''Weird Autumn'' edition, was released for PC, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on December 13, 2017 and for Nintendo Switch on February 1, 2018. It features new content not seen in the original game, as well as the supplemental games. ''Night in the Woods'' received notable critical praise, mostly for its story, dialogue and characters.

==Overview==
Mae, an only child, has returned home to Possum Springs—a town populated by [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiouscat.me/bombsfall/post/127359166|title=Developer Scott Benson on Characters' Identity|last=Benson|first=Scott|date=March 30, 2017|website=curiouscat.me|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now living in her parents' attic, she discovers how much times have changed since the closing of the town's coal mines, uncovering a dark mystery that leads her into the nearby woods. She is forced to confront a horrible secret the town has hidden for decades involving not only the town's mine, but also the recent disappearance of her longtime friend Casey. Mae's friends also include Bea, a cigarette-smoking alligator and Mae's childhood friend; Gregg, a hyperactive fox; and his boyfriend, a bear named Angus. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' describes the themes covered as "mental illness, depression, the stagnancy of the middle and lower classes, and the slow death of small town America."&lt;ref name="PasteT10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/06/the-10-best-videogames-we-played-at-e3-2015.html|title=The 10 Best Videogames We Played at E3 2015|last2=Irwin|first2=Jon|date=June 22, 2015|last1=Martin|first1=Garrett|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mae, players run, jump, and learn other [[Game mechanics|mechanics]] that allow them to explore Possum Springs. Benson describes the key actions for the player as "explore, converse, see and touch", while Holowka describes their approach as "narrative-focused" rather than "[[gameplay]]-first".&lt;ref name="KillScreen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://killscreendaily.com/articles/charming-melancholy-night-woods-picks-where-gone-home-left/|title=The charming, melancholy Night in the Woods picks up where Gone Home left off|last=Cox|first=Davis|date=May 1, 2014|work=[[Kill Screen]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908221108/http://killscreendaily.com/articles/charming-melancholy-night-woods-picks-where-gone-home-left/|archivedate=September 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 5, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players make [[Interactive storytelling|decisions]] that affect the course of the story, though Benson has said, "it's more like 'do you hang out with this person?' Okay, cool. That person might not know you as well by the end of the game, but this person you hung out with, you're going to get to see their storyline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-22-games-they-are-achangin-a-look-at-nostalgic-adventure-night-in-the-woods | title = Night in the Woods is like Gone Home, in third-person, with talking animals | work = [[Eurogamer]]|date= June 25, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Margaret "Mae" Borowski is a 20-year-old college dropout, who relocates back to her hometown of Possum Springs, which has been struck by the closure of the coal mines and the [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economy]]. She meets up with her old friends, including gloomy but intelligent Beatrice "Bea" Santello, hyperactive [[anarchist]] troublemaker Greggory "Gregg" Lee, and Gregg's quiet, modest boyfriend Angus Delaney. Mae also learns that another one of her old friends, Casey Hartley, has mysteriously disappeared.

Mae spends several days exploring Possum Springs and spending time with her friends, but she also begins to have strange and vivid dreams. At the town's [[Halloween]] festival, Mae witnesses a teenager being kidnapped by a mysterious figure. The four friends begin working together to figure out what is going on, with Mae's [[mental health]] slowly deteriorating with every one of her dreams. After intensive searching, the four stumble across a strange group of cloaked figures in the woods, who chase after them; Mae ends up falling and lapses into a coma.

Mae eventually wakes up and returns to her friends, and she reveals that the reason she dropped out was due to her increasing dissociation from people and the world (it is implied that Mae suffers from some sort of [[dissociative disorder]]), seeing everything as merely shapes. Mae's journal, in which she draws pictures for each major event in the game, was given to her by a doctor to write down her emotions after she bludgeoned a student with a softball bat six years ago as a result of a dissociative episode. Due to this incident, the townsfolk became wary of Mae and caused a financial and emotional strain in her family. As her dissociation worsened at college, Mae mustered up the strength to leave and return home, hoping that being back in Possum Springs would help her return to normal.

Still wounded, Mae decides to venture out into the woods alone to find the group who chased her and the others, only for Gregg, Bea, and Angus to refuse to let her go by herself. The group enter the old mines and meet the mysterious group, who are revealed to be a [[cult]]. The cult turns out to be behind the kidnappings of several residents, including Casey, taking those whom they deem useless to society and whom they say will "not be missed" into the mines to [[sacrifice]] them to a god-like [[chthonic]] entity called the Black Goat in exchange for keeping the economy of Possum Springs afloat. The cult's leader allows the group to leave, threatening them never to tell anyone about the cult - however while riding up the mine's elevator, a member of the group attempts to kill Mae. The others manage to save her and the elevator falls, collapsing the mine and presumably trapping the cult underground.

Depending on who the player interacted with the most throughout the course of the game, Mae will sit down with either Bea or Gregg and talk about the events of the previous night, and all the things that have happened in Possum Springs. The others join them shortly after, and Mae tells them that although they will all be forced to grow and adapt to life as it goes on for better and for worse, they can still enjoy their time together now. The game ends as the four decide to forget about their problems for the time being and have band practice.

==Development==
''Night in the Woods'' was announced on October 22, 2013, on Kickstarter. Holowka and Benson set a {{US$|50,000}} funding goal, which was reached in only 26 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1307515311/night-in-the-woods/posts/639908|title=FULLY FUNDED! Also, stretch goals? Consoles? Linux? |publisher=Kickstarter|date = October 24, 2013|accessdate = February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project eventually earned over {{US$|200,000}} in crowdfunding. The additional funding allowed Infinite Fall to hire animator Charles Huettner to create additional animations, and for Infinite Ammo and game developer [[Adam Saltsman]] to create a [[roguelike]] that is playable within ''Night in the Woods''. While Benson believed adding further stretch goals would result in additional backers, Infinite Fall limited the amount of stretch goals to avoid [[scope creep]].&lt;ref name=PAR&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Kuchera| url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/the-goals-that-refused-to-stretch-why-night-in-the-woods-said-no-to-kicksta| title=The goals that refused to stretch: Why Night in the Woods said no to Kickstarter tradition| work=[[The Penny Arcade Report]]| date=November 12, 2013| accessdate=September 5, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211184102/http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/the-goals-that-refused-to-stretch-why-night-in-the-woods-said-no-to-kicksta| archivedate=December 11, 2013| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson names [[Chris Ware]], [[Mike Mignola]], [[Mary Blair]], [[Flannery O’Connor]], and [[Richard Scarry]] as influences on his work on ''Night in the Woods''.&lt;ref name=Gamasutra&gt;{{cite web|last=Ligman|first=Kris|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/205993/QA_How_Night_in_the_Woods_taps_into_a_real_sense_of_community.php| title=Q&amp;A: How Night in the Woods taps into a real sense of community| work=[[Gamasutra]]| date=December 2, 2013| accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zam&gt;{{cite web|last=Ewert-Krocker|first=Nate|url=http://www.zam.com/article/1370/rust-belt-gothic-lead-writer-scott-benson-unpacks-the-art-that-inspired-night-in-the-woods| title='Rust Belt Gothic': lead writer Scott Benson unpacks the art that inspired Night in the Woods| work=[[ZAM Network]]| date=March 9, 2017| accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Night in the Woods'' received very favourable reviews. On [[Metacritic]], the PS4 version has an average score of 87 from 15 critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/night-in-the-woods | title = Night in the Woods for PlayStation 4 Reviews - Metacritic | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PC version has an average score of 88 from 30 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/night-in-the-woods | title = Night in the Woods for PC Reviews - Metacritic | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praise is mainly given to the writing and characters. In his review of both ''Night in the Woods'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands]]'', [[Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw]] of ''[[Zero Punctuation]]'' said that ''Night in the Woods'' somewhat reminded him of ''[[Gone Home]]'', "'cos it eschews core gameplay in favor of storytelling; it takes a while to figure out what it's going for, and the supernatural horror stuff feels a bit at odds with the rest of the overall tone, but I respect the game for drawing a line under itself design-wise and not getting bogged down shoving in standard gameplay bullshit until it ultimately forgets to add anything new and the bullshit is all there is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Croshaw |first=Ben |date=March 29, 2017 |url=https://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/117021-Tom-Clancy-Ghost-Recon-Wildlands-Review |title=Zero Punctuation: ''Ghost Recon Wildlands'' |publisher=''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' |accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ping pong show''' is a form of stage entertainment that takes place in [[strip club]]s. It is a type of [[sex show]] in which women use their [[Pubococcygeus|pelvic muscles]] to either hold, eject, or blow objects from their [[vagina|vaginal cavity]]. [[Ping pong#Ball|Ping pong balls]] are the most iconic objects used. The show has been popular in [[Southeast Asia]] (particularly [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]) for several decades, and is primarily performed for foreign tourists. The show is in many cases associated with [[sex tourism]] and [[human rights]] concerns have been raised regarding the performers.

==Description==
The show typically takes place on a stage or dance platform and often involves a single performer. Usually she performs while lying on her back, although some variations involve a standing performer.&lt;ref name=Steinfatt/&gt; The performer is commonly dressed in only a [[bikini]] top or [[bra]] and has her [[pubic hair]] shaved. Items can be inserted into the vagina either on stage as part of the performance or beforehand in preparation. As an alternative to ejecting the items using the pelvic muscles, objects are sometimes pulled out by hand.{{sfn|Sanders-McDonagh|2016|p=9}} The earliest versions of the show involved ping pong balls, but other diverse objects have since been used in the performance. They include eggs, bananas, long strings or ribbons, whistles, horns, pens, cigarettes, candles, darts, spinning tops, bottles, firecrackers, razor blades, and chopsticks. Another activity is the shooting of [[goldfish]] into a bowl, or stuffing a large frog inside to see how long she can keep it in. A male member of the audience may be brought onto the dance platform to hold a balloon while a dart is shot at it, or the performer may do a shoot around the table at balloons tied to each customer's chair.&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/price-sexual-torture-usd-181month |title=The Price of Sexual Torture?

==In Thailand==
The popularity of ping pong shows in Thailand dates back to the early 1980s and a show is featured in the 1976 [[sexploitation film]] ''[[Emanuelle in Bangkok]]''.&lt;ref name=Steinfatt/&gt; The shows are officially prohibited under the [[Obscenity|obscenity legislation]] of [[Law of Thailand|Thai law]], and in 2004 the government further limited what is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work: A-N.

Locations like [[Patpong]] in Bangkok, [[Walking Street, Pattaya]], Bangla Road in [[Phuket]] and Ta Pae Gate in [[Chiang Mai]] have numerous venues hosting ping-pong shows.{{sfn|Sanders-McDonagh|2016|p=9}} Customers are brought in by employees working for the ping-pong shows. They approach tourists and passers-by in streets such as Bangkok's [[Khaosan Road]] during the late evening and ask them if they want to see a show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Norn Lup? - A Journey of Railways, Roads and Wats|author=Rachel Beswetherick|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2013|ISBN=9781291324259|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UNCjBAAAQBAJ|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are frequently shown pictures of the show in a booklet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Miss Bangkok: Memoirs of a Thai Prostitute|author=Bua Boonmee|publisher=Maverick House|year=2015|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tkIYBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shows take place on the upper floors of bars and strip clubs in locations such as Bangkok's entertainment district [[Patpong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bangkok Encounter|author1=Austin Bush|author2=China Williams|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2009|ISBN=9781742205120|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AFwPgdKD6FEC|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; while bikini-clad women dance in the ground floor bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bangkok Boy: The story of a stolen childhood|author=Chai Pinit|publisher=Maverick House|year=2015|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9BkYBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; An entry fee is usually charged, often equivalent to around {{Currency|10|US}}, though typically nearer {{Currency|20|US}} in Bangkok.{{sfn|Sanders-McDonagh|2016|p=9}} In some cases, instead of a [[cover charge]], the drinks are priced 3–4 times higher than usual and a purchase is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bangkok for Shy Guys: No-nonsense Travel Guide for Shy Independent Male Travelers| publisher=Central Information Services LLC|year=2006|ISBN=9780978994303|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bn1a50rqhZsC|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible charges can include show fees and exit charges.

==In Laos==
The [[Laos|Laotian]] capital [[Vientiane]] was once famous for its brothels and ''ping-pong-show'' bars during the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the country's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=FandD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Laos/sub5_3b/entry-2961.html |title=Sex in Laos |author=Jeffrey Hays |date=2008 |website=Facts and Details |publisher= |access-date=21 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] described a bar in 1973 Vientiane thus: “Your eyes get accustomed to the dark and you see the waitress is naked. Without warning she jumps on the chair, pokes a cigarette into her vagina and lights it, puffing it by contracting her uterine lungs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Theroux |first= Paul |date=1975 |title=The Great Railway Bazaar |url= |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page= |isbn=978-0141189147}}&lt;/ref&gt; British journalist [[Christopher Robbins]] wrote that ''The White Rose'', a famous Vientiane bar during the war, featured floor shows in which women used their vaginas to smoke cigarettes and fling ping pong balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins |first= Christopher |date=1978 |title=Air America |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=978-1908059017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such shows have since disappeared and brothels are now prohibited by Laotian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retire-asia.com/laovientiane.shtml |title=Vientiane, Laos 2015 – City Nightlife, Clubs, Sex and Lao Family Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.retire-asia.com |publisher=Retire Asia |access-date=21 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==
In the [[red light district]] of [[De Wallen]] in [[Amsterdam]] the ''Moulin Rouge'' and ''Casa Rosso'' theatres feature on-stage sex shows including variations on the ping pong show.{{sfn|Sanders-McDonagh|2016|p=10}}

==Human rights concerns==
The ping pong show is designed to get people talking about it so that people will come to the bar to see it. Often customers come only to see the show and leave when it is over. This is good business for the bar, which makes much of its profits from drinks. However, the majority of the bar workers do not participate in the show. Research published in 2002 indicated that most bar workers regard the show as bad for business and do not like it. Many bar workers consider the show to be low-class and in bad taste, boring as it is the same every night, and liable to take attention away from the bar workers by focussing on the acts.&lt;ref name=Steinfatt/&gt; 

An article in 2009 described an example of the working conditions of women at ping pong shows. The employees arrived at 18:00 and left at daybreak. They stamped a time card and were penalized 5 baht (US$0.14) for every minute they were late.

Some human rights organizations (such as [[Not for Sale (organization)|Not For Sale]]) have denounced ping pong shows as inherently misogynistic. [[Taina Bien-Aimé]] of [[Equality Now]] commented that: "The attitude that [sex work in places like ping pong shows] is empowering gives a green light to traffickers. We're trying to fight the commercial sex trade, not empower the sex trade."&lt;ref name="economics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/economics-commercial-sexual-exploitation |title=The Economics of Commercial Sexual Exploitation |date=2009-08-25 |last=Guzder |first=Deena |work=Thailand: Sex Tourism, Exploited Women |publisher=[[Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the performers in ping pong shows in Thailand come from poorer neighbouring countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia, or Laos.&lt;ref name="price"/&gt; The closure of factories in Thailand during the [[Great Recession]] in the late 2000s led to an increase in unemployment in the country. Some women formerly engaged in factory work moved to Thailand's [[red-light district]]s and ended up working in ping pong shows. Bien-Aime commented: "Working 14 hours [a day] in a factory or blowing ping pong balls out of your vagina should not be a person's only choices in life."&lt;ref name="economics" /&gt; Although no pain or suffering is generally experienced by female performers during the show,&lt;ref name=Steinfatt&gt;{{cite book|pages=41–45|title=Working at the Bar: Sex Work and Health Communication in Thailand|author=Thomas M.

== History==
===Ancient Egypt===
Prostitutes in Ancient Egypt were respected and even considered sacred as the first institutions where prostitution flourished were the temples of the Gods.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web

As soon as they grew too old for the tastes of the priests they were allowed to leave. Many practised prostitution until they were married.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

Some of the prostitutes wore blue [[faïence]]-beaded fishnet dresses, had red-painted lips and tattoos on their breasts or thighs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Roman occupation===
As in the rest of the Roman Empire, prostitution was regulated. Prostitutes had to be registered&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions," p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; and taxes were collected from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McGinn |first=Thomas A. J. |authorlink= |date= |title=Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law in Ancient Rome |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmH31IK-OgEC |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780195161328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Prostitution was generally tolerated and taxed during this period,&lt;ref name="Gadelrab"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gadelrab |first=Sherry Sayed |authorlink= |year=2016 |title=Medicine and Morality in Egypt: Gender and Sexuality in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT5MDAAAQBAJ |publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857737724}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rulers taking the view that prohibition would not stop prostitution and that tax revenue would be lost.&lt;ref name="Gadelrab" /&gt;

There were periods when prostitution was prohibited following pressure on the rulers from Muslim clerics.&lt;ref name="Gadelrab" /&gt;

===Ottoman rule===
Under Ottoman rule, the regulation and taxation of prostitutes continued.&lt;ref name="semerdjian"&gt;{{cite book |last=Semerdjian |first=Elyse |authorlink= |date= |title="Off the Straight Path": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEAEnGz7CLAC |publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780815631736}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century two guilds for prostitutes were set up.&lt;ref name="semerdjian" /&gt;

===French occupation===
Prostitution flourished following the [[French invasion of Egypt]] in 1798. The French organised additional prostitutes brought over from Europe.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]]s spread rapidly through the brothels and this prompted the French authorities to introduce a law forbidding French troops from entering a brothel or having prostitutes in their rooms. Offenders received a death penalty.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

===Rule of Muhammad Ali===
In 1834 [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] outlawed prostitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ditmore |first=Melissa Hope |date= |title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work: A-N. Vol. 1 |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and female public dancing in Cairo. The prostitutes and dancers were sent to [[Upper Egypt]], especially [[Qena|Kena]], [[Esna]] and [[Aswan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dancer Of Esna |url=http://williamhpeck.org/the_dancer_of_esna |website=williamhpeck.org |accessdate=12 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837 he extended this to all of Egypt.&lt;ref name="semerdjian" /&gt;

Article 240 of the Mixed Penal Code of 1867 states: ''A pimp who incites young men or women below the age of 21 to evil practices leading to rape is to be punished by a period of imprisonment not less than one month and not more than one year''.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; Article 241 increases the penalty if the offence is committed by the father, mother or guardian of a minor.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

Following the abolition of slavery in 1877, many recently freed female slaves turned to prostitution to survive.&lt;ref name="Gadelrab" /&gt;

===British occupation===
[[File:Prostitute license 1885.jpg|220px|thumb|1885 prostitute license issued in the Cairo municipality]]
After the British occupation of 1882, the authorities were concerned about disease spreading amongst the troops. They made legal provisions to control prostitution and introduced a system of healthcare.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gadelrab" /&gt; In July 1885 Egypt's Ministry of the Interior introduced regulations for the health inspection of prostitutes.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; Further regulations were introduced in 1896 to control brothels.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bearman |first=Peri |last2=Weiss |first2=Bernard G. |author-link2= |last3=Heinrichs |first3=Wolfhart |author-link3= |year=2008 |title= The Law Applied: Contextualizing the Islamic Shari'a |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPEBAwAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=I.

In 1932 a Cabinet decree abolished licences for prostitution and established the 'Public Morals Police'.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

A new penal code was introduced in 1937 and included a section to punish men who lived off the earnings of prostitutes.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

In 1949 Military Order no. 76 was issued abolishing brothels.&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

Law No. 68, introduced in 1951, penalizing:&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;
* Acts of prostitution if carried out habitually
* Acts of prostitution whether carried out by males or females (The term 'prostitution' was used in regard to females, For males the term used was 'licentiousness')
* Acts inciting others to engage in prostitution
* International trading of prostitutes ([[white slave trade]]) 
* The provision of housing or other premises where prostitutes can carry on their trade
* The advertisement of prostitution whether in an open or disguised way.

== The prostitution system ==
The prostitution system in Egypt often depends on [[pimp]]ing, although women also work alone. Pimps in Egypt organize the work of a group of prostitutes and receive a percentage of their profits. This is called the network in Egypt. This system is mainly used in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]] and other big cities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Nikah mut‘ah==
[[Nikah mut‘ah]] is a temporary marriage allowed under Shia Islam Law. The 'marriage' may last for a term of one hour to one year. It is sometimes used to circumvent the prostitution laws.&lt;ref name="zocalo"&gt;{{cite web

===Summer marriages===
Wealthy men from the Gulf states often holiday in Egypt in the summer months. Whilst there they may take a young, temporary bride (often under-age) in a so-called ''summer marriage''. The marriages are arranged through a marriage broker and the girl's parents receive gifts and money as a 'dowry'. The marriage ends when the men return to their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Prostitution in the economy ==
As prostitution is illegal in Egypt, no taxes are paid. The law exposes people who practice [[adultery]] to a jail sentence up to six months. For prostitution, the sentence is up to 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Countries and Their Prostitution Policies|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772#egypt|website=ProCon.org|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Egypt}}
Egypt is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Egyptian children are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Individuals from the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait purchase Egyptian women and girls for "temporary" or "summer" marriages for the purpose of commercial sex, including cases of sex trafficking; these arrangements are often facilitated by the victims' parents and marriage brokers, who profit from the transaction. Child sex tourism occurs primarily in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Egypt 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282648.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=28 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and girls, including refugees and migrants, from Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East endure sex trafficking in Egypt. Syrian refugees who have settled in Egypt remain increasingly vulnerable to exploitation, including sex trafficking, and transactional marriages of girls—which can lead to sexual exploitation, including sex trafficking,&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Egypt as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

'''Rational ignorance''' is refraining from acquiring knowledge when the cost of educating oneself on an issue exceeds the potential benefit that the knowledge would provide.

[[Ignorance]] about an issue is said to be "rational" when the cost of educating oneself about the issue sufficiently to make an informed decision can outweigh any potential benefit one could reasonably expect to gain from that decision, and so it would be irrational to waste time doing so. This has consequences for the quality of decisions made by large numbers of people, such as in [[general election]]s, where the probability of any one [[vote]] changing the outcome is very small.

The term is most often found in [[economic]]s, particularly [[public choice theory]], but also used in other disciplines which study [[rationality]] and choice, including [[philosophy]] ([[epistemology]]) and [[game theory]].

The term was coined by [[Anthony Downs]] in ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Downs. (1957), ''An Economic Theory of Democracy;'' New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1957; p.&amp;nbsp;244–46, 266–71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider an employer attempting to choose between two candidates offering to complete a task at the cost of $10/hour. The length of time needed to complete the task may be longer or shorter depending on the skill of the person performing the task, so it is in the employer's best interests to find the fastest worker possible. Assume that the cost of another day of interviewing the candidates is $100. If the employer had deduced from the interviews so far that both candidates would complete the task in somewhere between 195 and 205 hours, it would be in the employer's best interests to choose one or the other by some easily  applied metric (for example, flipping a coin) rather than spend the $100 on determining the better candidate, saving at most $100 in labor.

In many cases, the decision may be made on the basis of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]; a simple decision model which may not be completely accurate.  For example, in deciding which brand of prepared food is most nutritious, a shopper might simply choose the one with (for example) the lowest amount of sugar, rather than conducting a research study of all the positive and negative factors in nutrition.

==Applications==

=== In marketing ===
Marketers can take advantage of rational ignorance by increasing the complexity of a decision.  If the difference in value between a quality product and a poor product is less than the cost to perform the research necessary to differentiate between them, then it is more rational for a consumer to just take his chances on whichever of the two is more convenient and available.  Thus, it is in the interest of the producer of a lower value product to proliferate features, options, and package combinations which will tend to increase the number of shoppers who decide it's too much trouble to make an informed decision.

=== In politics ===
Politics and elections especially display the same dynamic.  By increasing the number of issues that a person needs to consider to make a rational decision about candidates or policies, politicians and pundits encourage [[single-issue]] voting, [[Party-line vote|party-line]] voting, [[jingoism]], selling votes, or dart-throwing all of which may tip the playing field in favor of politicians who do not actually represent the electorate.

This does not mean that voters make poor and biased decisions: rather that in carrying out their everyday responsibilities (like working and taking care of a family), many people do not have the time to devote to researching every aspect of a candidate's policies. So many people find themselves making rational decisions meaning they let others who are more versed in the subject do the research and they form their opinion based on the evidence provided. They are being rationally ignorant not because they don't care but because they simply do not have the time.

Because the cost/benefit ratio increases with increasing costs '''or''' decreasing the benefit, the same effect can occur when politicians protect their policy decisions from the preferences of the public.  To the degree that the electorate perceives their individual votes to count for less, they will have less incentive to spend any time actually learning any details about the candidate(s).

A more nuanced example occurs when a voter identifies with a particular political party, akin to the adoption of a favorite movie critic. Based on prior experience a responsible voter will seek politicians or a political party that draws conclusions about social policy that are similar to what their own conclusions would have been had they done a complete analysis.  But when voters find themselves agreeing with the same party or politician across a number of election cycles, many voters simply trust that the same will continue to be true and "vote the ticket," also referred to as [[straight-ticket]] voting, instead of wasting time on a complete investigation.

==Criticisms==

Much of the empirical support for the idea of rational ignorance was drawn from studies of [[voter apathy]], which reached particularly strong conclusions in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, A., Converse, P., Miller, W. and Stokes. D. (1960), 'The American Voter', Wiley, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; However, apathy appeared to decline sharply in the 1960s as concern about issues such as the [[Vietnam War]] mounted, and political [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] increased.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, N., Verba, S. and Petrocik, J. (1976), 'The Changing American Voter', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with expectations from Public Choice Theory; as voters' interest in the results of policy decisions increase, the perceived benefit of the analysis (or the trip to the ballot box) increases, so more people will consider it rational to repair their ignorance.

Additionally, rational ignorance is scrutinized for its broadening effect on the decisions that individuals make in different matters. The investment of time and energy on learning about the specified subject has ramifications on other decision areas. Individuals sometimes ignore this when unconsciously assessing the investment cost versus payout. The external benefits of acquiring knowledge in one area—those benefits occurring in other decision areas—are therefore subject to being overlooked.

[[File:Shallow coghlan.jpg|thumb|Shallow and Silence by J. Coghlan, c.1820]]
'''Robert Shallow''' is a fictional character who appears in Shakespeare's plays ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''. He is a wealthy landowner and [[Justice of the Peace]] in Gloucestershire, who at the time of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' is said to be over 80 ("four score years and upward").

A thin, vain and often self-deluding individual, used to life in the provinces, Shallow functions as a [[Foil (literature)|dramatic foil]] to the rotund and worldly [[Sir John Falstaff]], who visits Shallow's lands on royal business, but later returns intending to fleece Shallow of his money. In the ''Merry Wives'' he visits Windsor with his relative Slender, encountering Falstaff once more.

It has long been speculated that Shallow is a satire of [[Thomas Lucy|Sir Thomas Lucy]], a local landowner near Stratford-upon-Avon, with whom Shakespeare is said to have got into trouble as a young man. Other real-life models have also been proposed.

==''Henry IV, Part 2''==
[[File:Cock and pie.jpg|thumb|Justice Shallow tries to get Falstaff to stay for the night]]
In ''Henry IV, Part 2'' Falstaff is commissioned to raise troops for the royal army to deal with a rebellion in the north. Shallow has been tasked to find suitable recruits in his locality. He tells his colleague Justice Silence that he looks forward to meeting Falstaff, who he hasn't seen for many years. He then reminisces about his youthful wild antics as a law student at [[Clement's Inn]] when Falstaff was a boy. When Falstaff arrives, Shallow is delighted by his witticisms, and invites him to stay longer.

In a soliloque after Shallow leaves, Falstaff tells the audience that Shallow's recollections of his supposedly wild student days are full of lies; that Shallow in those days was a skinny, feeble "cheese paring" of a man, noted only for his lechery. The local prostitutes called him "[[Mandrake (mythology)|mandrake]]" because he looked like a "forked radish" when naked. But now he's wealthy, he's ripe for exploitation.

After the defeat of the rebels, Falstaff visits Shallow, claiming that when the Prince becomes king, Falstaff will be in a position to give Shallow an important and remunerative post. He borrows £1000 from Shallow on this basis. The two get drunk and reminisce again. News arrives that the old king is dead, so they rush to London. When the new king rejects Falstaff, Shallow demands his money back. When it becomes obvious Falstaff can't pay him back, he says he'll settle for half, but Falstaff says that's not possible. Shallow is forced out of the king's presence along with the lowlife characters.

==''Merry Wives of Windsor''==
[[File:Charles Robert Leslie - Slender, with the Assistance of Shallow, Courting Anne Page, from "The Merry Wives of Windsor," Act ... - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Shallow (right) tries to push forward the timid Slender to talk to Anne Page, painting by [[Charles Robert Leslie]]]]
Shallow appears at the beginning of the play to complain that Falstaff has been poaching deer from his land, has broken into a lodge and has assaulted his servants. After Falstaff brazenly admits his actions, Shallow threatens to prosecute him, but Falstaff just dares him to try. Shallow's young cousin Abraham Slender adds that he was robbed by Falstaff's cronies [[Bardolph (Shakespeare character)|Bardolph]], [[Corporal Nym|Nym]] and [[Ancient Pistol|Pistol]]: "They carried me to the tavern and made me drunk, and afterward picked my pocket". They all deny it in extravagant terms.

Shallow is advised to take his mind off the matter by promoting the marriage of Slender to Anne Page, daughter of the well-off Thomas Page, who approves the match. For most of the rest of the play, Shallow simply encourages the oafish Slender's clumsy attempts to woo Anne.

==Character role==
G. Beiner argues Shallow's self-deceiving vanity provides a kind of "comic justification" for Falstaff's exploitation of him, since we feel more sympathy for "clever knave than a foolish citizen". In the ''Merry Wives'' Shallow is set up at the beginning as an impotent foil to the brazen and confident Falstaff, only to prepare the way for a reversal in which Falstaff himself is utterly outwitted and humiliated.&lt;ref&gt;Beiner, G., ''Shakespeare's Agonistic Comedy: Poetics, Analysis, Criticism'', Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1993, p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Kornstein says that in ''Henry IV, Part 2'' Shallow is set up as the antithesis of the firm and incorruptible [[William Gascoigne|Lord Chief Justice]], who is never deceived by Falstaff: the "contrast between the Lord Chief Justice and Shallow could not be greater". Shallow lives up to his name and is a "stupid gullible liar".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kornstein, ''Kill All the Lawyers?: Shakespeare's Legal Appeal'', University of Nebraska Press, 2005, p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have noted that Shakespeare gives Shallow a distinct style of speech, characterised by constant repetition with slight variation. A.R. Humphries described it as "babbling incoherence". Thus in ''Henry IV, Part 2'' he says to Falstaff, "I will not excuse you. You shall not be  excused. Excuses shall not be admitted. There is no  excuse shall serve. You shall not be excused.—".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the pathos and the comedy of the character derive from the contrast between the aged Shallow and the lusty, riotous figure he imagines himself to have been in his youth. Anthony Nuttall connects this to a much wider sense of the loss of a perhaps mythical ideal past that runs through the [[Henriad]] plays.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, Anthony, "Shallow's Orchard: Adam's Garden" in ''The Stoic in Love: Selected Essays on Literature and Ideas'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1989, pp.50–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parody of historical individual?==

===Thomas Lucy===

}}
It has been speculated that Shallow, at least as portrayed in ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', is a parody of [[Thomas Lucy|Sir Thomas Lucy]], a local landowner in [[Charlecote]], near [[Stratford upon Avon]], with whom Shakespeare is supposed to have had conflicts when he was young. [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] records a story that the young Shakespeare was prosecuted for poaching deer from Lucy's land.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbam, Samuel, ''Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life'', Oxford University Press, 1987, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to the accusation Shallow makes against Falstaff, but finds himself unable to follow up. The play also appears to contain a pun on the name "Lucy", similar to a ballad that circulated in Stratford, in which Lucy's name was altered to "lousy". When Shallow and his dim-witted relative Slender discuss their family coat of arms, they mention that it depicted "luces" (pike). Their family symbols unintentionally become literally lice-ridden when this is misinterpreted as a "dozen white louses". Thomas Lucy's coat of arms contained "luces".&lt;ref&gt;D.E Crane, (ed) Sahkespeare, ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that Shallow was a joke at Lucy's expense dates back to c.1688, when Archdeacon Richard Davies wrote that Shakespeare was "much given to all unluckiness in stealing venison and Rabbits particularly from Sr. Lucy,. . . his revenge is so great that he [Lucy] is his Justice Clodpate, and calls him a great man and that in allusion to his name bore three louses rampant for his Arms".&lt;ref&gt;George Van Santvoord (ed), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', Yale University Press, New Haven, CT., 1922, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Gardiner===
[[Leslie Hotson]] in his 1931 book ''Shakespeare versus Shallow'' argues that Shallow is a parody of William Gardiner (1531–97), a corrupt Justice of the Peace who had a long-running feud with the owner of the [[Swan theatre]], [[Francis Langley]]. Shakespeare had been drawn into this feud and had even had a [[writ of attachment]], a form of restraining order, taken out against him by Gardiner's stepson.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion, 1550–1950'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, New York, 1952, p.226.&lt;/ref&gt; Hotson argues that the joke about the "luces" in Shallow's coat of arms refers to Gardiner's wife, Frances Luce, whose family coat of arms bearing luces was incorporated into Gardiner's. Hotson says, "Could this be the true significance of the coat of arms passage in the Merry Wives? Was the Justice Shallow of the play a caricature of Justice Gardiner?"&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Hotson, ''Shakespeare Versus Shallow'', Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1931, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; Hotson proceeds to argue that most of Shallow's actions in the plays satirise corrupt deals in which Gardiner was involved, and that the dim-witted Slender is a parody of Gardiner's stepson, William Wayte, who was mercilessly exploited by Gardiner.&lt;ref name = "pete"&gt;Peter Quennell, ''Shakespeare: A Biography'', World Publishing, Cleveland, OH, 1963, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Other critics have argued that Shallow comes from a long theatrical tradition of depicting bumbling old men, derived ultimately from the Roman stock character of the [[senex amans]]. [[Samuel Schoenbaum]] says that a direct parody of Lucy is unlikely. Why should Shakespeare risk offending "well placed friends of a man who had done the state some service"?&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, Samuel, ''William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life'', Oxford University Press, 1987, pp.107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the evidence for the alleged parody of Lucy is confined to the ''Merry Wives'' suggests that the character was not invented as parody of Lucy, though Shakespeare may have remembered the luces/louses joke from his Stratford days. Certainly "Lucy was, in physical form, social condition and personality, nothing like Shallow".&lt;ref&gt;Madison Davis, J., (ed), ''The Shakespeare Name and Place Dictionary'', Routledge, 2012, p.448.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even if the character of Shallow in ''Henry IV, Part 2'' was not invented as a parody of either Lucy or Gardiner, it may have been adapted in the ''Merry Wives'' to become one. [[Peter Quennell]] argues that the portrayal of Shallow probably drew on both Lucy and Gardiner.&lt;ref name = "pete"/&gt;

==In other literature==
Shallow appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play ''[[Falstaff's Wedding]]'' (1766), a comedy by [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]], which is set in the period between the end of ''Henry IV, Part 2'' and the beginning of ''Henry V''. A subplot involves [[Mistress Quickly]] and [[Doll Tearsheet]] disguising themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting Shallow and Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so Quickly ends up married to Pistol and Doll is married to Nym.

[[James White (1775-1820)|James White]]'s book ''Falstaff's Letters'' purports to be letters written by Falstaff and his friends. It includes an affidavit deposited before Shallow about Falstaff's misdeeds, and letters between him and his servant Davy.

The modern Royal Hanneford Circus was formed in 1965, when Tommy Hanneford began producing shows featuring the family.

==History==
===Early origins===
Accounts of the early origins of the Hanneford family performances conflict. Some accounts claim that the Hanneford family began performing as early as 1690, when the [[Ireland|Irish]]-born Michael Hanneford entertained royalty with [[bareback riding]], [[acrobatics]], and [[juggling]].&lt;ref name=spt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19961011&amp;id=fdAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BF8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3808,1213402 |title=Royal Hanneford Circus rides into Tampa |first=Logan |last=Neill |publisher=''St. Petersburg Times'' |date=11 October 1996 |accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19951022&amp;id=DRQVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bAMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3950,7236924 |title=Rare white tigers and magic hoops |first=Natasha |last=Rafi |publisher=''Toledo Blade'' |date=22 October 1995 |accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family themselves claim their oldest involvement with the circus involved Edwin Hanneford, a juggler from [[London]]. In 1778, Edwin was summoned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to compete against Walter Scott to determine the best juggler in [[England]]. However, during the competition, King George became too preoccupied with [[American Revolutionary War|other issues]] and did not declare a winner.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hannefordcircus.com/page4.html |title=Historical Overview of the Royal Hanneford Circus |publisher=Royal Hanneford Circus |accessdate=17 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604100028/http://www.hannefordcircus.com/page4.html |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European traveling shows===
The Hanneford family first traveled as a [[:wikt:troupe|troupe]] in 1807. Successive generations of the family were involved in performances as well. By 1903, the family had their own circus production, the Hanneford Royal Canadian Circus. They performed under a [[canvas]] tent and traveled to cities and villages in the [[British Isles]] via horse-drawn wagons. During the winter months they performed with other acts indoors throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=sahib/&gt; In 1915 the family was performing in [[Spain]] while [[John Ringling]] of the [[Ringling Brothers Circus]] was in attendance. After seeing the production, Ringling wanted to bring the family to perform in the [[United States]]. In order to do so, Ringling purchased the entire circus. At that time, the family consisted of George Hanneford Sr. and his wife Catherine, Edwin "Poodles", George, Grace, and Elizabeth.&lt;ref name=cmu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/current_exhibit/major_circus_families.html |title=Michigan Circus Families |publisher=Clarke Historical Library |accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edwin "Poodles" Hanneford''' is considered amongst the greatest [[Horse riding stunts|trick riders]] in history. He was the first to perform a [[somersault]] from one running horse to another. Additionally, Poodles held a [[Guinness Book of World Records]] record for performing a running jump onto a horse and stepping off 26 times in a row. Poodles appeared in over 40 films. He retired in 1954, died in 1967, and was enshrined in the [[International Circus Hall of Fame]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=cmu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0360372/ |title=Poodles Hanneford |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===United States===
Upon coming to the United States, the Hannefords performed with various acts.  The family's first credited appearance in American film is ''[[When I Grow Up (film)|When I Grow Up]]'', released in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The next [[patriarch]] after Poodles was Tommy Hanneford, son of George Sr. and nephew of Poodles, who began performing as a clown in 1933 when he was five years old. He was called "The Funniest Man on Horseback" for his comic equestrian performances. He performed from the 1930s through the 1960s, except for a period beginning in 1946 when he served in the [[United States Army]]. Besides his circus performances he appeared on television, in films, and at most major [[Shrine Circus|Shrine circuses]] throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=cmu/&gt; The family was considered reunited in 1965 at [[Pleasure Island (Massachusetts amusement park)|Pleasure Island Park]] in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]]. Tommy organized the performance that featured his sister Kay with a dog act, his wife Struppi on a [[tightrope walking|high wire]], and was called the Hanneford Family Circus. Tommy later [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] the act in [[Macon, Georgia]] and it became the first time the family had owned their own circus since his father George Sr.&lt;ref name=sahib/&gt;

The family's first major production was in September 1966 in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]. Tommy's brother George Jr. was featured in a bareback riding act. The performance is considered the first of the "Royal Hanneford Circus". In 1968, Tommy joined producer Bill English, and in 1969 the two men were joined by Art Concello, formerly general manager of the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]]. The three men operated Circus Classics, Inc. until they separated in 1974. In 1975, Tommy reorganized the Royal Hanneford Circus.&lt;ref name=sahib/&gt;

George Sr. Hanneford was inducted into the Circus Hall of Fame in 1977, his wife Catherine in 1990, and Tommy posthumously in 2008, following his death in 2005.&lt;ref name=cmu/&gt; Tommy's wife Struppi was inducted into the Circus Hall of Fame in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circus Hall of Fame Inductees|url=http://visit.circushalloffame.com/circus-hall-of-fame-inductees/|website=Circus Hall of Fame|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop====
In 1989, the Royal Hanneford Circus began performing at the [[Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop]], performing every day of the week save for Tuesdays. Following the death of Tommy, his brother George Jr. and sister Catherine assumed control of the circus. In 1993, the Swap Shop owner Preston Henn had been sued over injury to a circus performer, leading him to require the circus to provide worker's compensation insurance to its employees. In July 2006, the circus was evicted from the Swap Shop for violating that agreement.&lt;ref name=sstl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/sfl-ccircus12aug12-story.html |title=Friday hearing delayed after Swap Shop owner closes curtain on circus |publisher=Sun Sentinel |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the eviction, the circus employed about a dozen performers and owned nine animals. The use of animals in the Hannefords' circus acts at the Swap Shop attracted the attention of animal rights activists, including the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida (ARFF), which had long accused the circus of animal cruelty. However, George Jr.'s son, George Hanneford III, denied these claims, as well as rebuffed an offer from ARFF to adopt and relocate the animals.&lt;ref name=sstl&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9428">'''Sarrasani''' is a German circus that reached world fame before [[World War II]] and was resident in [[Dresden]], but also became known as the national circus of [[Argentina]] during the years of German separation.

[[File:Zirkus Sarrasani - Vignette - Eröffnung 1912 Dresden.jpg|thumb|Opening in 1912]]
[[File:Dresden Zirkus Sarrasani Carolaplatz Neustadt 1914.jpg|thumb|Stationary circus building in Dresden]]

Sarrasani was founded by ''Hans Stosch'', a clown with the stage name ''Giovanni Sarrasani'', who was born 1873 in [[Poznań]]. Stosch came 1901 to [[Radebeul]] near Dresden and the circus had its official premiere 1902 in [[Meißen]]. In the year 1912 a stationary circus building opened, which was designed by [[Max Littmann]] for Sarrasani. The circus often performed abroad and reached world fame. Its well-known labels were the [[elephant]]s, but the circus was also known for the [[Sioux]], who were employed from the early years.

From 1923 to 1925 Sarrasani went on its first tour through South America. In these years, Stosch-Sarrasani also introduced innovative marketing concepts and wrote fictive adventure stories ''Fahrten und Abenteuer'', ''Mit Sarrasani in Südamerika''. Totally, about 10 million copies of these booklets were distributed. 

After the death of Hans Stosch-Sarrasani Sr., his son Hans Stosch-Sarrasani Jr. took directorship. He was followed by his widow, Trude Stosch-Sarrasani, in 1941. The Sarrasani theater was destroyed on 13 February 1945 during the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]]. Trude Stosch-Sarrasani emigrated to Argentina, where she reestablished the circus in Buenos Aires as the "Circo Nacional Argentino."

== History ==
The story has two basic topics. On one side, a tale about a family of circus directors struggling to remain at the top of show business in the social context of Europe and South-America during the last century. On the other side, the epical facts of a colossal enterprise that survived the most transcendental political crisis, dealing – voluntarily or by force – with political leaders, dictators, bankers or businessmen from both continents.

The Sarrasani Circus was founded in 1901, reaching a patrimony of 400 animals (not pets, precisely) and hiring a similar number of artists and technicians, hosting troupes from the most distant and exotic places: Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Moroccan, Hindus, Sioux, Ethiopians, Gauchos, Europeans, etc. Within this complex megalopolis, the Circus managed to sail through turbulent periods of this century emerging unharmed. Among them: [[World War I]], the 1930s crisis, the [[Nazism]], [[World War II]], [[Joseph Stalin]]'s troops arriving to Eastern Germany, the zenith of [[Peronism]] in Argentina and several coups d'état in different countries. During the second Peronist period in Argentina the circus even changed its name to "National Circus of Argentina". Only since Germany’s re-unification, Sarrasani's name was exalted again after almost a 50 year of proscription. The story is conceived as a road movie where the odyssey of an immense circus, a sort of Noah's Arc of people and animals, is an excuse to travel across two continents in different periods of the last century. A journey in space and time, this chronicle carries its own background of tango, epochal songs and circus orchestras.

Besides the profuse network of historic characters, the tale focuses on three main personalities that were in charge of the circus at different times: Hans Stosch-Sarrasani, alias Senior, Hans Stosch-Sarrasani (son), alias Junior, and Trude, Junior's young wife.

=== Senior ===
[[File:Mit-sarrasani-heft4.jpg|thumb|Booklet ''With Sarrasani in South America'' (graphics [[Friedrich Kurt Fiedler|Kurt Fiedler]])]]
Senior, the founder, was a dreamer, a visionary in show-biz obsessed with the idea of greatness, a megalomaniac who only conceived pharaonic projects that, incredibly, worked. His circus turned out to be a crossroad of cultures from all around the five continents and also the state-of-the-art in technology.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Sarranni based his circus in [[Dresden]] and it reached a height of popularity there in the late 1920's.  At around the same time, the [[Karl May Museum]] opened nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Jace|title=Other Words: American Indian Literature, Law, and Culture|date=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806133522|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQj_aQhYvfEC&amp;pg=PA84|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He toured not only around Europe, but also around [[South America]], where he also moved the zoo and all that megalopolis on three enormous ships. Due to his stubborn and independent character, he had several problems with bureaucrats in power and especially with the ascendant Nazi regime that pushed him to emigrate. He established the circus in 1901 and ran it until his death in [[Sao Paulo]], Brazil in 1934.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=== Junior ===
Junior, his son, inherited the great name but also a chaotic financial situation and, even worse, an awful relation with the political authorities of his country. He didn’t make big aesthetic changes on the scene but his pragmatic administration and a great sense of reality allowed the circus to cope with the worse crisis since its foundation. He had a special talent for diplomatic treatment with leaders in every country he arrived; he arranged with [[Joseph Goebbels]] the return of the circus to Germany for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]]. Junior would run the circus during seven years from 1934 to 1941.

=== Trude ===
Trude, Junior's wife, a lovely and angelic young woman, found herself in charge of the circus aged only 28 years, during the Nazi regime. Her approach to running it was notoriously different from her male predecessors: she never commanded or ordered; on the contrary, she always delicately suggested. Minister Goebbels recommended the use of her young and beautiful figure in the circus posters as an icon of the Arian era. In 1944, however, she was sent to prison accused of anti-Germanic behavior. Two weeks later, Trude was released to continue performing, while Germany was immersed in the open war. Her partner, the Hungarian acrobat Gabor Némedy, was kept prisoner as a way of persuasion. In 1945, during the show, she was caught in the bombing of Dresden, from which she fortunately emerged alive. 

After the war, she started over as an equestrian artist working for other circus. In 1948, an Argentine producer invited her to reestablish Sarrasani in [[Buenos Aires]] with the presence of President [[Juan Perón]] and his wife, [[Eva Perón|Evita]], and began a very close relationship with them. Trude ran the circus until the mid seventies, albeit as a smaller enterprise. The popularity of cinema and TV, together with new cultural codes for animal care and use, led the circus to adapt to modern times.

Trude Stosch-Sarrasani spent her last days in [[San Clemente del Tuyú]] (a seaside resort town south of Buenos Aires) with Kiki, a little dog picked up from the street. Ms. Stosch-Sarrasani died there on June 6, 2009, at the age of 96.

==History==
On 27 July 2001, Moneybookers Limited was [[Corporation|incorporated]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="ch_moneybookers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukdata.com/company/04260907/SKRILL-LIMITED|title=Company information for SKRILL LIMITED (04260907) incorporated 27-07-2001|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, Moneybookers was bought by [[Investcorp]] for [[Euro|€]]105 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/investcorp-technology-partners-undertakes-buyout-of-moneybookers-limited-for-eur105-million-153549825.html|title=Investcorp Technology Partners Undertakes Buyout of Moneybookers Limited for EUR105 Million|date=28 March 2007|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 9 March 2009, it was put up for sale by its owners for an estimated £365 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/4963091/Investcorp-to-sell-Moneybookers.html|title=Investcorp to sell Moneybookers|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music theory]], '''''Terzschritt''''' ([[German language|De]]: third step) is a dualistic [[major third]] relationship, in which the ascending [[chord progression|progression]] from a major [[tonic (music)|tonic]] triad to major [[mediant]] triad is equivalent to the descending one between a major tonic triad and a flat [[subdominant]] minor triad. The [[major chord]] on the mediant is itself the '''''Terzklang''''' (De: third chord).

"'Where is the E [[major chord]] in C major?'...a ''Terzschritt'' from the tonic....'What is the E major [[triad (music)|triad]] in C major?'...a ''Terzklang''....'How does the E major triad make sense in C major?'...it functions either as III+...or as {{bracket|[[dominant (music)|D]]}}([[parallel and counter parallel|SP]])."&lt;ref&gt;Kopp, David (2006). ''Chromatic Transformations in Nineteenth-Century Music'', p.99n98. {{ISBN|0-521-02849-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The subdominant parallel (Sp) of the dominant ([D]), G, is E ([D](Sp)).

In the work of [[Hugo Riemann]] (1849-1919), [[inversion (music)|inversionally]] related chord progressions are grouped together: the progressions C major-&gt;E major and C minor-&gt;Ab minor belong to the same category: "Terzschritt" (see [[counter parallel]]). The first of these moves a [[major triad]] up by [[major third]], while the second moves a [[minor triad]] down by major third, with the switch from ascending to descending motion accompanying the change from major to minor. In the context of [[neo-Riemannian theory]], this transformation is called "L-then-P". The basic transformations of neo-Riemannian theory, discussed below, all associate changes in direction with the switch from major to minor.

==Background==
On October 1, 2012, [[E-40]] announced the release of ''The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil'' 4, 5 and 6 for March 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Steven J. |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21369/title.e-40-the-block-brochure-welcome-to-the-soil-4-5-6-release-date |title=E-40 "The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil 4, 5 &amp; 6" Release Date |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 2013, the album covers were revealed for ''The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil'' 4, 5 and 6.&lt;ref name="xxlmag1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/06/e-40-reveals-cover-art-for-the-block-brochure-welcome-to-the-soil-parts-4-5-6-2/ |title=E-40 Reveals Cover Art For 'The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil' Parts 4, 5 &amp; 6' - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, E-40 explained why he was releasing three album's in one day, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I’m a score and a nickel deep in the game! That’s 25 years with real studio albums on the shelf. If an artist can release two and three mixtapes a year for free, I can release two or three official studio albums a year for money. As an independent artist I do what I want, not what I can. I’m putting out three albums because I’ve got 3 decades of fans that I gotta satisfy. I’ve been through hella different eras of music and I survived successfully! It took William Shakespeare 20 years of experience to write Hamlet! I make Slaps and paint pictures with my raps and I’m in my prime with 25 years of experience. You ain’t gotta like me but you gotta respect me!"&lt;ref name="xxlmag1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In a December 2013, interview with [[HipHopDX]], [[E-40]] spoke about the direction he went on the album, saying: "I just wanna keep it right in the pocket of what they been listening to with a new school twist, but keep the old school twist too. You feel me? So I want to make sure it's the right recipe. The right... When you dip your finger in that sauce, the seasoning is perfect."&lt;ref name="hiphopdx1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aguilar |first=Andrea |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.2236/title.e-40-considers-releasing-his-book-of-slang-as-a-software-app |title=E-40 Considers Releasing His "Book Of Slang" As A Software App |publisher=HipHop DX |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview he spoke about how he decided who he would collaborate with on the album, saying: "You know, a lot of times, we get the beats early. The beat is always first. Us as artists, we like, "This the perfect beat. Do you know who would sound good on here? Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro." And I rock with 'em. I got love for 'em, so let's see if they can get on this with me, and that's how it all unfolds."&lt;ref name="hiphopdx1"/&gt;

In a December 2013, interview with ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', E-40 spoke about the process of recording three albums, saying: "I’m not going to lie, this one was tough to do. To come back with 4, 5 and 6, three albums, it comes to a point where I can do one album standing on my head, easy. I’d probably have it done within three weeks or a month the way I work. ''The Block Brochure'' 4, 5 and 6, it was a trip because I did over a hundred songs and I shaved it all the way down to 42 songs. But I shaved it down because I wanted every song to poke out like nipples. And that’s what it’s doing. Just throw it in and just ride, just have a good time."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/12/e-40-says-nobody-tells-stories-in-hip-hop-anymore/ |title=E-40 Says Nobody Tells Stories In Hip-Hop Anymore - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to discuss how long it took to record, saying: "You know, guest appearances help a lot. When you do a song with other artists—’cause everybody wants to hear another artist with their favorite artist—one thing you got make sure is when you take that first verse and that second verse, you got to be a part of the whole song. Whether you on the hook on there talking or repeating the ad-libs, that’s one thing I learned to do over the years. Now just imagine, from March 2010 I dropped ''Revenue Retrievin’: Day Shift'' and ''Night Shift''. Here it is, December 2013. Within that amount of time—just to show you my work progress—within that amount of time I dropped 10 solos and two duos, with me and Too $hort. So that’s 12 albums [from] March 2010 to now when ''The Block Brochure'' 4, 5, and 6 comes out. That’s three and a half years."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"/&gt;

He also spoke about the deadline for the release date, saying: "You know what’s the trip about it? At the end, I was trying to reach deadline, [and] then I said fuck that, we coming out December 10. Then I finally got stressed out after things was done. Ain’t that a trip? Neck got tight and shit. I’m like, it’s done, it’s turned in, I got my release date. I got my album done and all the covers. Everything is in promotions. But I guess it just caught up with me. But I’m back."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"/&gt;

He also spoke about some of the features on the album, saying: "I try to do collaborations that a lot of people don’t do. When it’s already predictable it’s not so much of a special song. I got a song with me, Big K.R.I.T. and Z-Ro ["In Dat Cup"]; me, T.I., and Chris Brown ["Episode"]. I never did a song with T.I., I always had love for him. We both had mutual respect for each other but never did one. Never did a song with Chris Brown singing. We did a rap song remix with him with “Function” [and] he killed it, that’s a great song too. My son Droop-E and Work Dirty, first of all they [on] Sick Wid’ It Records—my label—and they also family and always in the studio with me. Decades produced the beat, he family too. That was just one of those moments where it’s, “Lets come with it.” My boy Stressmatic came with the hook, “Yellow Gold.” Soon as he did the hook we was on the case. But that’s what it’s about, doing songs with people like me, Danny Brown and ScHoolboy Q ["All My Niggas"]. Three unique different styles, unorthodox, different voices, doing what everybody else don’t."&lt;ref name="xxlmag2"/&gt;

==Singles==
On October 22, 2013, the album's first single "Episode" featuring [[T.I.]] and [[Chris Brown]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/episode-feat.-t.i.-chris-brown/id723173498 |title=iTunes - Music - Episode (feat.

''The Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil 4'' received generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. Ronald Grant of [[HipHopDX]] gave the album three out of five stars, saying "All in all, E-40 has built an entire career out of Hip Hop that’s relatable, yet adventurous, playful and entertainingly repetitious. ''The Block Brochure: Welcome To The Soil'' Parts 4, 5, &amp; 6 continues in that tradition. While it’s a lot to ask of today’s stunted attention spans and isn’t without lapses, ''The Block Brochure'' proves that E-40 is still more ahead of the curve at crafting imaginative Hip Hop music than many new artists can ever hope to be."&lt;ref name="hiphopdx2"/&gt; David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying "What makes Pt. 4 unique is that it is low on star power, and yet it features a fine selection of solo E-40 tracks along with some lesser-known features that surprise. Biggest surprise has to be Cousin Fik and Choose Up Cheese on "Tree in the Load," with the NhT Boyz and the infectious "Thirsty" running a close second. The rest of the highlights come from radio-friendly folks like Juicy J ("Chitty Bang"), T.I. ("Episode"), and Webbie ("By Any Means"), all in charge of hooky club cuts."&lt;ref name="allmusic1"/&gt;

{{Situationists |expanded=Works}}
'''''The Society of the Spectacle''''' ({{lang-fr|La société du spectacle}}) is a 1967 work of philosophy and Marxist critical theory by [[Guy Debord]], in which the author develops and presents the concept of the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]]. The book is considered a seminal text for the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement.  Debord published a follow-up book ''Comments on the Society of the Spectacle'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1988) Comments on the Society of the Spectacle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The work is a series of 221 short [[theses]] in the form of aphorisms. Each thesis contains one paragraph.

===Degradation of human life===
Debord traces the development of a modern society in which authentic [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]] has been replaced with its representation: "All that once was directly lived has become mere representation."&lt;ref name="Thesis1"/&gt; Debord argues that the history of social life can be understood as "the decline of ''being'' into ''having'', and ''having'' into merely ''appearing''."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 17&lt;/ref&gt; This condition, according to Debord, is the "historical moment at which the [[commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] completes its [[colonization]] of social life."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1994) thesis 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spectacle is the inverted image of society in which relations between commodities have supplanted relations between people, in which "passive identification with the spectacle supplants genuine activity". "The spectacle is not a collection of images," Debord writes, "rather, it is a social relation among people, mediated by images."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1994) thesis 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of the spectacular society, Debord notes that the [[quality of life]] is impoverished,&lt;ref name="examples" /&gt; with such a lack of authenticity that [[human perception]]s are affected, and an attendant degradation of knowledge, which in turn hinders [[critical thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1977) from thesis 25: "All community and all critical sense are dissolved"&lt;/ref&gt; Debord analyzes the use of knowledge to assuage reality: the spectacle obfuscates the past, imploding it with the future into an undifferentiated mass, a type of never-ending present; in this way the spectacle prevents individuals from realizing that the society of spectacle is only a moment in history, one that can be overturned through revolution.&lt;ref name="Thesis11"&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thesis143"&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord's aim and proposal is "to wake up the spectator who has been drugged by spectacular images...through radical action in the form of the construction of situations...situations that bring a revolutionary reordering of life, politics, and art". In the Situationist view, situations are actively created moments characterized by "a sense of self-consciousness of existence within a particular environment or ambience".&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord encouraged the use of [[détournement]], "which involves using spectacular images and language to disrupt the flow of the spectacle."

===Mass media and commodity fetishism===
''The Society of the Spectacle'' is a critique of contemporary consumer culture and [[commodity fetishism]], dealing with issues such as [[Marx's theory of alienation|class alienation]], [[cultural homogenization]], and [[mass media]].

When Debord says that "All that was once directly lived has become mere representation," he is referring to the central importance of the image in contemporary society. Images, Debord says, have supplanted genuine human interaction.&lt;ref name="Thesis1"&gt;Debord (1994) Thesis 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, [[Debord]]'s fourth thesis is: "The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1994) Thesis 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In a consumer society, social life is not about living, but about having; the spectacle uses the image to convey what people need and must have. Consequently, social life moves further, leaving a state of "having" and proceeding into a state of "appearing"; namely the appearance of the image.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1994) Thesis 17&lt;/ref&gt;

"In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1977) Thesis 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison between religion and marketing===
Debord also draws an equivalence between the role of mass media [[marketing]] in the present and the role of religions in the past.&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 20: "The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 25 on the spectacle and the [[sacred]]&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of commodity-images by the mass media, produces "waves of enthusiasm for a given product" resulting in "moments of fervent exaltation similar to the ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism".&lt;ref name="Thesis67"&gt;Debord (1977) Thesis 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 132: "The masters who make history their private property, under the protection of myth, possess first of all a private ownership of the mode of illusionn: in China and Egypt they long held a monopoly over the immortality of the soul ... The growth of their real historical power goes together with a popularization of the possession of myth and illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord contends further that "the remains of religion and of the [[family]] (the principal relic of the heritage of class power) and the moral repression they assure, merge whenever the enjoyment of this world is affirmed–this world being nothing other than repressive pseudo-enjoyment."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1977) Thesis 59&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[Abrahamic religion|monotheistic religions]] were a compromise between [[myth]] and history, ... These religions arose on the soil of history, and established themselves there. But there they still preserve themselves in radical opposition to history." Debord defines them as ''Semi-historical religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1994) thesis 136&lt;/ref&gt; "The growth of knowledge about society, which includes the understanding of history as the heart of culture, derives from itself an irreversible knowledge, which is expressed by the destruction of God."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1977) thesis 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of American sociology===
In Chapter 8, "Negation and Consumption Within Culture", Debord includes a critical analysis of the works of three American sociologists. Debord discusses at length [[Daniel J. Boorstin]]'s ''The Image'' (1961), arguing that Boorstin missed the concept of Spectacle. In thesis 192, Debord mentions some American sociologists who have described the general project of [[developed capitalism]] which "aims to recapture the fragmented worker as a personality well integrated in the group;" the examples mentioned by Debord are [[David Riesman]], author of ''[[The Lonely Crowd]]'' (1950), and [[William H. Whyte]], author of the 1956 bestseller ''[[The Organization Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1977) theses 192, 196-200,&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 1950s sociologists who are usually compared to Riesman and Whyte, is [[C. Wright Mills]], author of ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2710970 American Quarterly 1963]''&lt;/ref&gt; Riesman's "Lonely Crowd" term is also used in thesis 28.

===Authenticity, Plagiarism, and Lautréamont===

Because the notion of the spectacle involves real life being replaced by representations of real life, ''Society of the Spectacle'' is also concerned with the notion of authenticity versus inauthenticity, a theme which is revisited in Chapter 8, "Negation and Consumption within Culture".  In Debord's treatment, modern society forces culture to constantly re-appropriate or re-invent itself, copying and re-packaging old ideas.  Thesis 207 makes this point, rhetorically:

"Ideas improve.  The meaning of words participates in the improvement.  Plagiarism is necessary.  Progress implies it.  It embraces an author's phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea."&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1977) thesis 207&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage concerning plagiarism is itself directly lifted from [[Comte de Lautréamont#Poésies|''Poésies'']], a minor work of [[literary criticism]] by French-Uruguayan author Isidore Lucien Ducasse, better known as the [[Comte de Lautréamont]].  In particular, the original French text for both Debord and Lautréamont's versions of the passage are identical: "Les idées s'améliorent. Le sens des mots y participe. Le plagiat est nécessaire. Le progrès l'implique. Il serre de près la phrase d'un auteur, se sert de ses expressions, efface une idée fausse, la remplace par l'idée juste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://biblio.wiki/wiki/La_Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_du_spectacle/Chapitre_8 |title=La Société du spectacle (Chapitre 8) |last=Debord |first=Guy |website=Bibliowiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16989/16989-h/16989-h.htm |title=Poésies |last=Ducasse |first=Isidore |website=Gutenberg|date=2005-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983 edition===
[[File:Debord SocietyofSpectacle.jpg|thumb|180px|1983 edition of ''Society of the Spectacle'']]
The book cover of the 1983 edition is derived from a photograph by the ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine photographer, [[J. R. Eyerman]]. On November 26, 1952, at the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)]], the premiere screening of the film ''[[Bwana Devil]]'' by [[Arch Oboler]] took place as the first full-length, color 3-D (aka 'Natural Vision') motion picture. Eyerman took a series of photographs of the audience wearing [[3-D glasses]].

''Life'' magazine used one of the photographs as the cover of a brochure about the 1946-1955 decade.&lt;ref&gt;Cover of the brochure that accompanied an exhibition of photographs from ''Life'' magazine held at the International Center of Photography (New York) and entitled: ''The Second Decade, 1946-1955''. Image at Getty Images: [http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/2905087/Time-Life-Pictures#]&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph employed in the Black and Red edition shows the audience in "a virtually trance-like state of absorption, their faces grim, their lips pursed;" however, in the one chosen by ''Life'', "the spectators are laughing, their expressions of hilarity conveying the pleasure of an uproarious, active spectatorship."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Y. Levin ''[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/art_and_cinematography/debord/scroll/ Dismantling the Spectacle: The cinema of Guy Debord]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Black and Red version also is flipped left to right, and cropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/50611221/Time-Life-Pictures Eyerman original version].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite widespread association among English-speaking readers, Debord had nothing to do with this cover illustration, which was chosen by Black and Red.

==Notes==
{{Reflist|2|refs=
&lt;ref name="examples"&gt;For example: 
* from Debord (1977) thesis 19: "The concrete life of everyone has been degraded into a ''speculative'' universe."
* from thesis 17: "The first phase of the domination of the economy over social life brought into the definition of all human realization the obvious degradation of being into having" and now "of having into appearing"
* from thesis 10: The Spectacle is "affirmation of all [[Human condition|human life]], namely social life, as mere appearance"
* from thesis 6: "The spectacle ... occupies the main part of the time lived outside of modern production."
* thesis 30: "The alienation of the spectator to the profit of the contemplated object (which is the result of his own unconscious activity) is expressed in the following way: the more he contemplates the less he lives; the more he accepts recognizing himself in the dominant images of need, the less he understands his own existence and his own desires. The externality of the spectacle in relation to the active man appears in the fact that his own gestures are no longer his but those of another who represents them to him. This is why the spectator feels at home nowhere, because the spectacle is everywhere."
* from thesis 8: "Lived reality is materially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle"
* from thesis 16: "The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent that the economy has totally subjugated them."
* from thesis 134: "Only those who do not work live."
* from thesis 37: "the world of the commodity dominating all that is lived"
* from thesis 60: "The celebrity, the spectacular representation of a living human being, embodies this banality by embodying the image of a possible role. Being a star means specializing in the seemingly lived; the star is the object of identification with the shallow seeming life that has to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations which are actually lived."
* thesis 68
* from thesis 192: "The critical truth of this destruction the real life of modern poetry and art is obviously hidden, since the spectacle, whose function is to make history forgotten within culture"
* from thesis 114: in the "intensified alienation of modern capitalism", "the immense majority of workers" "have lost all power over the use of their lives

[[File:Tiger game.svg|thumb|The playing board of the Tiger game]]
The '''Tiger Game''' is a popular Chinese [[board game]]. It is a [[strategy game]] for two players. One player, who plays the tiger, has only one piece. The other player has 18 men. The tiger must eat the men, who must block the tiger so that he cannot move. The game can be played with any kind of pieces that can be distinguished from one another. The board is 8×8 squares, with the addition of a square of 2×2 squares, which is called the tiger’s lair.
[[File:台灣生產的虎棋.png|thumb|Another kind of the Tiger games in Taiwan]]

==Play==
The men cannot take the tiger, but can only block him. The Tiger, by jumping over a man, can take it, in which case the man is removed from play. The men must stay together 2 by 2 to block the tiger. In general, if a tiger eats more than three pieces, it is unlikely that men will have enough pieces to win the game. If the men do not make mistakes, but move cautiously, victory is likely.

[[File:William Horace Lingard.jpg|thumb|CDV of William Horace Lingard taken by J Gurney &amp; Son, 707 Broadway, NYC c. 1868]]
'''William Horace Lingard''' (1839–1927) was a [[Music history of the United States in the late 19th century|19th century]] [[English people|English]] comic singer.

==Immigration to America==
In 1868, Lingard immigrated to America (along with his wife, [[Alice Dunning Lingard]]).  He made his comic debut in [[New York City]] that year. After this debut—held at the [[Theatre Comique]], on 6 April 1868—Lingard became known as one of the funniest men of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Franceschina | first = John | title = David Braham | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-415-93769-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his career in New York, and later became manager of [[Wood's Theatre]] there.

[[File:William LIngard as a Lady.jpg|thumb|left|William Lingard, dressed as a woman on one of his song sheets. (circa ~1870)]]

==Style==
Lingard often appeared on stage in [[cross-dressing|drag]], in the high fashion style of the era. Additionally, he mastered the art of quick change, eventually becoming able to act the part of six characters, with only a few seconds for each costume change.

==Major role==
[[File:William Lingard as Captain Jinks.jpg|thumb|right|Song sheet for Lingard's "Captain Jinks" performance, circa 1868.]]
Lingard is chiefly remembered for the well-known vaudeville song, "[[Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines]]", sometimes shortened to simply "Captain Jinks." Lingard wrote the lyrics, and the music is attributed to T. Maclagan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/hasm_cM161C/ Captain Jinks&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at library.duke.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; It was a popular song of the 19th century, and is still sung to this day, having entered the country-western and bluegrass repertory. The song later became the basis of a stage comedy of the same title, written by [[Clyde Fitch]], and a 1975 [[opera]] by [[Jack Beeson]]. The song has various rendetions.

'''''Zen Bound''''' is a [[puzzle game]] for the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Maemo]] platforms ([[Nokia N900]]), developed by Secret Exit.  It was announced on September 5, 2008 via the company's [[Internet forum|discussion board]], and officially released via the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] on February 24, 2009, and via [[Ovi Store]] on June 16, 2010.  A port to Android was announced as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle#Humble Bundle for Android 2|Humble Bundle for Android 2]] on March 19, 2012. The game has received press attention for its unique gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28922265/ |title=iPhone lifts profile of on-the-go games |author=Benedetti, Winda |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lite version of the game was also released for free which featured 2 levels of the game.

== Gameplay ==
The goal of the game is to paint various objects. In each level the player is given an object with an attached rope which varies in length depending on the level. Using a mouse or touch screen and tilt controls, the player attempts to wrap the object with the rope. Each time the rope is laid down on the object, the area near the rope gets covered by paint. The challenge is getting the required percentage of an object painted with only a finite length of rope. There are three targets in each level - minimum, medium and maximum coverage.

Some levels require nails protruding from the objects to be entwined in rope rather than having to cover the object's surface.

==Awards==
5th IMGAwards (International Mobile Gaming Awards) (2008): Excellence in 3D
