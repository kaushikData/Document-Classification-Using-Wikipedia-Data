}}&lt;/ref&gt; (28 December 1882&amp;nbsp;– 22 November 1944) was an English astronomer, physicist, and mathematician of the early 20th century who did his greatest work in [[astrophysics]]. He was also a [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and a populariser of science. The [[Eddington limit]], the natural limit to the [[luminosity]] of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.

Around 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper "The Internal Constitution of the Stars".&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;The Internal Constitution of the Stars A. S.

S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium.

He is famous for his work concerning the [[theory of relativity]]. Eddington wrote a number of articles that announced and explained [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]] to the English-speaking world. [[World War I]] severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England.  He also conducted an expedition to observe the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] that provided one of the earliest confirmations of [[general relativity]], and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.

==Early years==
Eddington was born 28 December 1882 in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]] (now [[Cumbria]]), England, the son of [[Quaker]] parents, Arthur Henry Eddington, headmaster of the Quaker School, and Sarah Ann Shout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to Kendal to become headmaster of Stramongate School. He died in the [[typhoid]] epidemic which swept England in 1884. His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income. The family moved to [[Weston-super-Mare]] where at first Stanley (as his mother and sister always called Eddington) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.  The family lived at a house called Varzin, 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare.  There is a commemorative plaque on the building explaining Sir Arthur's contribution to science.

In 1893 Eddington entered Brynmelyn School. He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature. His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to [[physics]] for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers, [[Arthur Schuster]] and [[Horace Lamb]]. At Manchester, Eddington lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician J. W. Graham. His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.

Based on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1902. His tutor at Cambridge was [[Robert Alfred Herman]] and in 1904 Eddington became the first ever second-year student to be placed as [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]].  After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on [[thermionic emission]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students. This hiatus was brief. Through a recommendation by [[E. T. Whittaker]], his senior colleague at Trinity College, he secured a position at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich where he was to embark on his career in astronomy, a career whose seeds had been sown even as a young child when he would often "try to count the stars".&lt;ref name=Douglas1956 /&gt;
[[File:Arthur Eddington.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Plaque at 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare]]

==Astronomy==

In January 1906, Eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the [[Astronomer Royal]] at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month. He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the [[parallax]] of [[433 Eros]] on [[photographic plate]]s that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the [[Smith's Prize]] in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912 [[George Darwin]], son of [[Charles Darwin]], died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] in early 1913. Later that year, [[Robert Stawell Ball|Robert Ball]], holder of the theoretical [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry|Lowndean chair]] also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire [[Cambridge Observatory]] the next year. In May 1914 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]: he was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] in 1928 and delivered the [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27eddington%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society| accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddington also investigated the interior of [[star]]s through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes. He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for [[Cepheid variables|Cepheid variable stars]].  He began by extending [[Karl Schwarzschild]]'s earlier work on radiation pressure in [[Lane-Emden equation|Emden polytropic models]]. These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of Eddington's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere. He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior. However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, [[density]] and [[pressure]] at all points inside a star, and Eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics. [[James Jeans]] contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be [[Ionization|ionized]], but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.

Eddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important [[mass-luminosity relation]]. This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as [[ideal gases]].  In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy. Jeans and others defended the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]], which was based on classical mechanics, while Eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.

Around 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington/&gt;&lt;ref name=eddington2/&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:

:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.
:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. 
:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.
:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)
:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the "crucible" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.

All of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.

With these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. In 1924, he discovered the [[Main sequence|mass-luminosity relation]] for [[star]]s (see Lecchini in [[#External links and references]] ).  Despite some disagreement, Eddington's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.  The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by Michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to Eddington's intuitive, exploratory style. Eddington's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars'', which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.

Eddington's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and [[Edward Arthur Milne]]. An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in [[quantum physics]], including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.

===Dispute with Chandrasekhar on existence of black holes===

The topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], who was then a student at Cambridge. Chandrasekhar's work presaged the discovery of [[black hole]]s, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that Eddington refused to believe that Chandrasekhar's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world. History clearly proved Eddington wrong, but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy. Chandrasekhar's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays Eddington as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist.  Eddington's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Relativity==

During [[World War I]], Eddington was Secretary of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from [[Willem de Sitter]] regarding Einstein's theory of general relativity. Eddington was fortunate in being not only one of the few astronomers with the mathematical skills to understand general relativity, but owing to his internationalist and pacifist views inspired by his Quaker religious beliefs,&lt;ref name=Douglas1956&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Life of Arthur Eddington |first=A. Vibert |last=Douglas |pages=92–95 |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons  |year=1956 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bw0XAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar1983&gt;{{cite book|title=Eddington: The most distinguished astrophysicist of his time|first=Subrahmanyan|last=Chandrasekhar|pages=25–26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1983|isbn=0521257468}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the few at the time who was still interested in pursuing a theory developed by a German physicist. He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Frank Watson Dyson]] organized two expeditions to observe a [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse in 1919]] to make the first empirical test of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson's argument for the indispensability of Eddington's expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service.&lt;ref name=Douglas1956 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 /&gt;

When conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916, Eddington intended to apply for an exemption as a [[conscientious objector]].&lt;ref name=Douglas1956 /&gt; Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of Eddington's work being of national interest. In 1918, this was appealed against by the [[Ministry of National Service]]. Before the appeal tribunal in June, Eddington claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognized and would have ended his exemption in August 1918. A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively. Eddington's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record.&lt;ref name=Douglas1956 /&gt; [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Sir Frank Dyson]], supported Eddington at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising Eddington's essential role in the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse]] expedition to Principe in May 1919. Eddington made clear his willingness to serve in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]], under the jurisdiction of the British  [[Red Cross]], or as a harvest labourer. However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of Eddington continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Principe expedition.&lt;ref name=Douglas1956 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 /&gt; The war ended before the end of his exemption.

[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|260px|thumb|right|One of Eddington's photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, confirming [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory that light "bends"]]
After the war, Eddington travelled to the island of [[Príncipe]] off the west coast of Africa to watch the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars (several stars in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades cluster]] include [[Kappa Tauri]] of the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]) in the region around the Sun.&lt;ref name="Eddington1920"/&gt; According to the theory of [[general relativity]], stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field. This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars. Eddington showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by Einstein.

Eddington's observations published the next year&lt;ref name="Eddington1920"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dyson|author2=Eddington, A.S.|author3=Davidson, C.R. |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A]]|volume=220|issue=571-581|pages= 291–333|bibcode=1920RSPTA.220..291D|doi=10.1098/rsta.1920.0009|first =F.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Einstein's theory, and were hailed at the time as evidence of general relativity over the Newtonian model.  The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story. Afterward, Eddington embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations.

It has been claimed that Eddington's observations were of poor quality, and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at [[Sobral, Brazil]], which appeared closer to the Newtonian model, but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated Eddington's results and conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xxx.arxiv.org/abs/0709.0685 Not Only Because of Theory: Dyson, Eddington and the Competing Myths of the 1919 Eclipse Expedition by Daniel Kennewick, published in Einstein and the Changing Worldview of Physics, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers.  The rejection of the results from the Brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which, again, was completely accepted and well understood by contemporary astronomers.&lt;ref name="PhysToday"&gt;[http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.3099578 D. Kennefick, "Testing relativity from the 1919 eclipse&amp;nbsp;– a question of bias," ''Physics Today,'' March 2009, pp. 37–42.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the ''Mathematical Theory of Relativity'' in 1923, which [[Albert Einstein]] suggested was "the finest presentation of the subject in any language." He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: [[Ludwik Silberstein]], a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the [[Royal Society]]'s (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other). When Eddington refrained from replying, he insisted Arthur not be "so shy", whereupon Eddington replied, "Oh, no! I was wondering who the third one might be!"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;As related by Eddington to Chandrasekhar and quoted in Walter Isaacson "Einstein: His Life and Universe", page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
Eddington was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models. He had been investigating the instability of the Einstein universe when he learned of both [[Georges Lemaître|Lemaître's]] 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession of the spiral nebulae. He felt the [[cosmological constant]] must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.  In ''The Mathematical Theory of Relativity,'' Eddington interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is "self-gauging".

==Fundamental theory and the Eddington number==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Chandrasekhar limit]] &amp; redirect [[Fundamental theory (Eddington)]] --&gt;
During the 1920s until his death, Eddington increasingly concentrated on what he called "fundamental theory" which was intended to be a unification of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], cosmology, and [[gravitation]]. At first he progressed along "traditional" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost [[numerology|numerological]] analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.

His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the [[proton]] and the charge of the [[electron]] were a ''natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe'' and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, [[Paul Dirac]], also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]], and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.{{Citation needed|reason=Which scientists? What is the 'something'?|date=December 2016}}

A somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the [[fine structure constant]], α. At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons. Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the [[Eddington number]]. Wags at the time started calling him "Arthur Adding-one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kean, Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements|year=2010|location=New York|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cky2x4wWvEUC&amp;pg=PT241&amp;lpg=PT241}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}  This change of stance detracted from Eddington's credibility in the physics community. The [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?alphinv|search_for=fine+structure+constant current measured value] is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).

Eddington believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed "E-numbers" (representing a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]]&amp;nbsp;– a [[Clifford algebra]]). These in effect incorporated [[spacetime]] into a higher-dimensional structure. While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a [[grand unified theory]]. Moreover, Eddington's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics. In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 × 2&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=J.

==={{anchor|E_number}}Eddington number for cycling===
Eddington is credited with devising a measure of a [[Cycling|cyclist's]] long-distance riding achievements. The Eddington number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&amp;doc=18%2F11%2Fphwv18i11a30%40pwa-xml&amp;qt= PhysicsWorld Archive » Volume 18 » Cycling record&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlatet.blogspot.com/2008/03/eddington-number.html Tlatet: Eddington number&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an Eddington number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions. Achieving a high Eddington number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning. Eddington's own E-number was 84.&lt;ref&gt;Physics World (Institute of Physics) July 2012 page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eddington number for cycling is analogous to the [[h-index|''h''-index]] that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.

The Eddington Number for cycling has units (indeed applying it to any physical property will result in E having units).  For example, an E of 62 miles means a cyclist has covered 62 or more miles on 62 or more days.  However, in units of kilometers the 62 miles becomes 100&amp;nbsp;km. It is possible that the cyclist, while having covered 100&amp;nbsp;km on 62 days or more, may '''not''' have covered 100&amp;nbsp;km on 100 days or more. Thus the order of bicyclists may change depending on units used. Using the original miles, one cyclist may have an Eddington number of 60 – 60 miles (97&amp;nbsp;km) in 60 days, another of 50 (corresponding to 80&amp;nbsp;km). However, the latter may be a regular on a distance like this and get a km-Eddington of 80, while the former only had those 60 days riding, and thus stays at a km-Eddington of 60.

==Philosophy==

===Idealism===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Eddington wrote in his book ''The Nature of the Physical World'' that  "The stuff of the world is mind-stuff."
{{quote|The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds ... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 276–81.}}

The [[idealist]] conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.

The first derives directly from current physical theory. Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behaviour of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics. From this, Eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second, and more interesting argument, was based on Eddington's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is "mind-stuff". Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.

But, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.

[[Ian Barbour]], in his book ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966), p.&amp;nbsp;133, cites Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928) for a text that argues the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[Uncertainty principle|Uncertainty Principles]] provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his ''Science and the Unseen World'' (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".

[[Charles De Koninck]] points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase "mind-stuff" to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same "stuff" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.&lt;ref name="de Koninck"&gt;{{Cite book

{{quote|There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it. I will not discuss the doctrine since I have not the least idea what is the meaning of the word existence when used in this connection. At any rate the science of astronomy has not been based on this spasmodic kind of moon. In the scientific world (which has to fulfill functions less vague than merely existing) there is a moon which appeared on the scene before the astronomer; it reflects sunlight when no one sees it; it has mass when no one is measuring the mass; it is distant 240,000 miles from the earth when no one is surveying the distance; and it will eclipse the sun in 1999 even if the human race has succeeded in killing itself off before that date.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 226}}

===Indeterminism===
{{see also|Indeterminism|Indeterminism#Science|label 2=Indeterminism in science}}
Against [[Albert Einstein]] and others who advocated [[determinism]], indeterminism—championed by Eddington&lt;ref name="de Koninck"/&gt;—says that a physical object has an [[ontology|ontologically]] undetermined component that is not due to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limitations of physicists' understanding. The [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]], then, would not necessarily be due to [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] but to an indeterminism in nature itself.

==Popular and philosophical writings==

Eddington wrote a clever parody of ''[[The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See [[s:The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (tr. Fitzgerald, 5th edition)|''Rubaiyat'' version at Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; recounting his 1919 solar eclipse experiment. It contained the following [[quatrain]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life of Arthur Eddington |first=A. Vibert |last=Douglas |page=44 |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons |year=1956 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bw0XAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{{poemquote|
Oh leave the Wise our measures to collate
           One thing at least is certain, LIGHT has WEIGHT,
One thing is certain, and the rest debate—
Light-rays, when near the Sun, DO NOT GO STRAIGHT.}}
&lt;/center&gt;
During the 1920s and 30s, Eddington gave numerous lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook ''[[List of publications in physics#The Mathematical Theory of Relativity|The Mathematical Theory of Relativity]]'', and later, quantum mechanics. Many of these were gathered into books, including ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and ''New Pathways in Science''. His skillful use of literary allusions and humour helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.

Eddington's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of Eddington's clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics. He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will. Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.

He is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the [[infinite monkey theorem]] in his 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', with the phrase "If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the [[British Museum]]". It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a [[rhetorical]] illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term ''improbable'' is functionally equivalent to ''impossible''.

His popular writings made him a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.

==Death==
Eddington died of cancer in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 22 November 1944. He was unmarried. His body was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium (Cambridgeshire) on 27 November 1944; the cremated remains were buried in the grave of his mother in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground]] in Cambridge.

Cambridge University's [[North West Cambridge Development]] has been named "[[Eddington, Cambridge|Eddington]]" in his honour.

In [[chemistry]], the '''capped square antiprismatic molecular geometry''' describes the shape of compounds where nine atoms, groups of atoms, or [[ligand]]s are arranged around a central atom, defining the vertices of a [[gyroelongated square pyramid]].

The gyroelongated square pyramid is a [[square pyramid]] with a [[square antiprism]] connected to the square base. In this respect, it can be seen as a "capped" square antiprism (a square antiprism with a pyramid erected on one of the square faces).

It is very similar to the [[tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry]], and there is some dispute over the specific geometry exhibited by certain molecules.

==Examples==
*[[Potassium nonahydridorhenate|{{chem|ReH|9|2−}}]] is sometimes described as having a capped square antiprismatic geometry, although its geometry is most often described as tricapped trigonal prismatic.
*[{LaCl(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''compact finite difference (CTFD) formulation''', or '''Hermitian formulation''', is a [[numerical mathematics|numerical]] method to solve the compressible [[Navier–Stokes equation]]. This method is both accurate and numerically very stable (especially for high-order [[derivative (calculus)|derivatives]]).

The expression for [[partial derivative]]s is developed and expressed mainly on [[dependent variable]]s. An approach to increase accuracy of the estimates of the derivatives, in particular a problem involving shorter length scales or equivalently high frequencies, is to include the influence of the neighboring points in the calculations. This approach is analogous to the solution of a [[partial differential equation]] by an Implicit scheme to an explicit scheme. The resulting approximation is called a '''compact finite difference''' (CTFD) formulation or a Hermitian formulation.

Forward difference formulae and [[backward difference]] formulae are [[Ordinary differential equation|first order]] accurate, and central difference formula are [[Differential equation#second-order differential equation|second order]] accurate; compact finite difference formulae provide a more accurate method to solve [[equation]]s.

==Compact finite difference formulation==

===First order derivatives===

Consider a three-point Hermitian formula involving the [[first derivative]]:

: &lt;math&gt; H_{i+1}=\sum_{m=-1}^1 (a_m f_{i+m} + b_mf'_{i+m}) = 0. \qquad (1) &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Taylor series]] expansion of the terms f&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; results in:
[[File:Three point Hermitian formula extended.JPG|thumb|center|700px|Extended formula of a three-point Hermitian formula]]
In the above expression, only the first few terms are to be considered zero, and the rest of the higher order terms will be considered as the [[Truncation error (numerical integration)|truncation error]] (TE). To obtain a third-order scheme, the [[coefficient]]s of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; , ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; , ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; will be zero. If it is a fourth-order scheme, the coefficient of f’’’’&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; will also be zero.

[[File:Co-efficients.JPG|thumb|center|700px|Co-efficients of three point Hermitian formula.]]

From the above equations, one can solve for a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; , a&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the form of b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Final value of the co-efficients.JPG|thumb|center|700px|Final value of the co-efficients three point Hermitian formula.]]&lt;br /&gt;
The Truncation error will be:&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Truncation error.JPG|thumb|center|700px|Truncation error]]&lt;br /&gt;
Substituting (4) in the above equation results in: &lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Truncation error Extended.JPG|thumb|center|700px|Truncation error Extended]]&lt;br /&gt;
The standard compact finite difference formula for first order derivatives of f(x) has a 3-point formulation&lt;br /&gt;                                
[Δx/3] [f’&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; + 4f’&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;  + f’&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;] = -f&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br /&gt;                                                                          
where f’&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = df(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)/dx&lt;br /&gt;
Similarly, for a fifth point formulation, take m=2 in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;

===Second order derivatives===
Similar to the first order derivatives equation, i.e., eq. (5) the equation for a 2nd order derivative will be:&lt;br /&gt;

==Applications==
Compact finite difference formulation is very frequently used to solve problems based on the [[Navier–Stokes equation]], and is used extensively in solving hyperbolic equations.

[[Image:CubeChart.svg|thumb|280px|{{math|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for values of {{math|1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 25}}.]]
In [[arithmetic]] and [[algebra]], the '''cube''' of a number {{mvar|n}} is its third [[exponentiation|power]]: the result of the number multiplied by itself twice:

:{{math|size=120%|1=''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' × ''n'' × ''n''}}.

It is also the number multiplied by its [[square (algebra)|square]]:

:{{math|size=120%|1=''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' × ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

This is also the [[volume]] formula for a [[Cube (geometry)|geometric cube]] with sides of length {{mvar|n}}, giving rise to the name. The [[Inverse function|inverse]] operation of finding a number whose cube is {{mvar|n}} is called extracting the [[cube root]] of {{mvar|n}}. It determines the side of the cube of a given volume. It is also {{mvar|n}} raised to the one-third power.

Both cube and cube root are [[odd function]]s:

:{{math|size=120%|1=(−''n'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = −(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

The cube of a number or any other [[expression (mathematics)|mathematical expression]] is denoted by a [[superscript]] 3, for example {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 8}} or {{math|(''x'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The [[graph of a function|graph]] of the cube function f: ''x'' → ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or the equation ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is known as the '''cubic parabola'''. Because cube is an odd function, this curve has a [[Point reflection|point of symmetry]] in the origin, but no [[axis of symmetry]].

==In integers==
A '''cube number''', or a '''perfect cube''', or sometimes just a '''cube''', is a number which is the cube of an [[integer]].

Geometrically speaking, a positive integer {{mvar|m}} is a perfect cube [[if and only if]] one can arrange {{mvar|m}} solid unit cubes into a larger, solid cube. For example, 27 small cubes can be arranged into one larger one with the appearance of a [[Rubik's Cube]], since {{nowrap|3 × 3 × 3 {{=}} 27}}.

The difference between the cubes of consecutive integers can be expressed as follows:

:{{math|size=120%|1=''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − (''n'' − 1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 3(''n'' − 1)''n'' + 1}}.

or

:{{math|size=120%|1=(''n'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; =  3(''n'' + 1)''n'' + 1}}.

There is no minimum perfect cube, since the cube of a negative integer is negative. For example, {{nowrap|(−4) × (−4) × (−4) {{=}} −64}}.

===Base ten===

Unlike [[square number|perfect squares]], perfect cubes do not have a small number of possibilities for the last two digits. Except for cubes divisible by 5, where only '''25''', '''75''' and '''00''' can be the last two digits, ''any'' pair of digits with the last digit odd can be a perfect cube. With [[Even and odd numbers|even]] cubes, there is considerable restriction, for only '''00''', {{math|''o''}}'''2''', {{math|''e''}}'''4''', {{math|''o''}}'''6''' and {{math|''e''}}'''8''' can be the last two digits of a perfect cube (where {{math|''o''}} stands for any odd digit and {{math|''e''}} for any even digit). Some cube numbers are also square numbers; for example, 64 is a square number {{nowrap|(8 × 8)}} and a cube number {{nowrap|(4 × 4 × 4)}}. This happens if and only if the number is a perfect sixth power (in this case 2{{sup|6}}).

The last digits of each 3rd power are:

{| width="45%"
|| 0 || 1 || 8 || 7 || 4 || 5 || 6 ||3 ||2 ||9 ||
|}

It is, however, easy to show that most numbers are not perfect cubes because ''all'' perfect cubes must have [[digital root]] '''1''', '''8''' or '''9'''. That is their values [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 9 may be only −1, 1 and 0. Moreover, the digital root of any number's cube can be determined by the remainder the number gives when divided by 3:
* If the number ''x'' is divisible by 3, its cube has digital root 9; that is,

===Waring's problem for cubes===
{{main article|Waring's problem}}

Every positive integer can be written as the sum of nine (or fewer) positive cubes. This upper limit of nine cubes cannot be reduced because, for example, 23 cannot be written as the sum of fewer than nine positive cubes:

:23 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Fermat's last theorem for cubes===

{{main article|Fermat's last theorem}}

The equation {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} has no non-trivial (i.e. {{math|''xyz'' ≠ 0}}) solutions in integers. In fact, it has none in [[Eisenstein integers]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these statements are also true for the equation&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 232&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 3''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

===Sum of first ''n'' cubes===

The sum of the first {{mvar|n}} cubes is the {{mvar|n}}th [[triangle number]] squared:

:&lt;math&gt;1^3+2^3+\dots+n^3 = (1+2+\dots+n)^2=\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Nicomachus_theorem_3D.svg|thumb|Visual proof that {{nowrap|1{{sup|3}} + 2{{sup|3}} + 3{{sup|3}} + 4{{sup|3}} + 5{{sup|3}}}} = {{nowrap|(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5){{sup|2}}}}.]]

'''Proofs.'''
{{harvs|txt|first=Charles|last=Wheatstone|authorlink=Charles Wheatstone|year=1854}} gives a particularly simple derivation, by expanding each cube in the sum into a set of consecutive odd numbers. Indeed, he begins by giving the identity

:&lt;math&gt;n^3 = \underbrace{\left(n^2-n+1\right) + \left(n^2-n+1+2\right) + \left(n^2-n+1+4\right)+ \cdots + \left(n^2+n-1\right)}_{n \text{ consecutive odd numbers}}.&lt;/math&gt;

That identity is related to [[triangular numbers]] &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;n^3 =\sum _{k=T_{n-1}+1}^{T_{n}} (2 k-1),&lt;/math&gt;

and thus the summands forming &lt;math&gt;n^3&lt;/math&gt; start off just after those forming all previous values &lt;math&gt;1^3&lt;/math&gt; up to &lt;math&gt;(n-1)^3&lt;/math&gt;.
Applying this property, along with another well-known identity:

:&lt;math&gt;n^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n (2k-1),&lt;/math&gt;

we obtain the following derivation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 &amp;= 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 + \cdots + n^3 \\
&amp;= \underbrace{1}_{1^3} + \underbrace{3+5}_{2^3} + \underbrace{7 + 9 + 11}_{3^3} + \underbrace{13 + 15 + 17 + 19}_{4^3} + \cdots + \underbrace{\left(n^2-n+1\right) + \cdots + \left(n^2+n-1\right)}_{n^3} \\
&amp;= \underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{\underbrace{1}_{1^2} + 3}_{2^2} + 5}_{3^2} + \cdots + \left(n^2 + n - 1\right)}_{\left( \frac{n^{2}+n}{2} \right)^{2}} \\
&amp;= (1 + 2 + \cdots + n)^2 \\
&amp;= \bigg(\sum_{k=1}^n k\bigg)^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Sum of cubes2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Visual demonstration that the square of a triangular number equals a sum of cubes.]]
In the more recent mathematical literature, {{harvtxt|Stein|1971}} uses the rectangle-counting interpretation of these numbers to form a geometric proof of the identity (see also {{harvnb|Benjamin|Quinn|Wurtz|2006}}); he observes that it may also be proved easily (but uninformatively) by induction, and states that {{harvtxt|Toeplitz|1963}} provides "an interesting old Arabic proof". {{harvtxt|Kanim|2004}} provides a purely visual proof, {{harvtxt|Benjamin|Orrison|2002}} provide two additional proofs, and {{harvtxt|Nelsen|1993}} gives seven geometric proofs.

For example, the sum of the first 5 cubes is the square of the 5th triangular number,

:&lt;math&gt;1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+5^3 = 15^2 &lt;/math&gt;

A similar result can be given for the sum of the first {{mvar|y}} [[odd number|odd]] cubes,

:&lt;math&gt;1^3+3^3+\dots+(2y-1)^3 = (xy)^2&lt;/math&gt;

but {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} must satisfy the negative [[Pell equation]] {{math|''x''{{sup|2}} − 2''y''{{sup|2}} {{=}} −1}}. For example, for {{math|1=''y'' = 5}} and {{math|29}}, then,

:&lt;math&gt;1^3+3^3+\dots+9^3 = (7\cdot 5)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1^3+3^3+\dots+57^3 = (41\cdot 29)^2&lt;/math&gt;

and so on.  Also, every [[even number|even]] [[perfect number]], except the lowest, is the sum of the first [[power of two|{{math|2{{su|p={{sfrac|''p''−1|2}}}}}}]] odd cubes (''p'' = 3, 5, 7, ...):

:&lt;math&gt;28 = 2^2(2^3-1) = 1^3+3^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;496 = 2^4(2^5-1) = 1^3+3^3+5^3+7^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8128 = 2^6(2^7-1) = 1^3+3^3+5^3+7^3+9^3+11^3+13^3+15^3&lt;/math&gt;

===Sum of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression===
[[File:Plato_number.svg|thumb|One interpretation of Plato's number, {{nowrap|3&amp;#179; + 4&amp;#179; + 5&amp;#179; {{=}} 6&amp;#179;}}]]
There are examples of cubes of numbers in [[arithmetic progression]] whose sum is a cube:

:&lt;math&gt;3^3+4^3+5^3 = 6^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;11^3+12^3+13^3+14^3 = 20^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;31^3+33^3+35^3+37^3+39^3+41^3 = 66^3&lt;/math&gt;

with the first one also known as [[Plato's number]].  The formula {{mvar|F}} for finding the sum of  {{mvar|n}}
cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression with common difference {{mvar|d}} and initial cube {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}},

:&lt;math&gt;F(d,a,n) = a^3+(a+d)^3+(a+2d)^3+\cdots+(a+dn-d)^3&lt;/math&gt;

is given by

:&lt;math&gt;F(d,a,n) = (n/4)(2a-d+dn)(2a^2-2ad+2adn-d^2n+d^2n^2)&lt;/math&gt;

A parametric solution to

:&lt;math&gt;F(d,a,n) = y^3&lt;/math&gt;

is known for the special case of {{math|1=''d'' = 1}}, or consecutive cubes, but only sporadic solutions are known for integer {{math|''d'' &gt; 1}}, such as {{mvar|d}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 37, 39, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/tpiezas/update06|title=A Collection of Algebraic Identities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubes as sums of successive odd integers===

In the sequence of odd integers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, …, the first ''one'' is a cube ({{nowrap|1 {{=}} 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}); the sum of the next ''two'' is the next cube ({{nowrap|3 + 5 {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}); the sum of the next ''three'' is the next cube ({{nowrap|7 + 9 + 11 {{=}} 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}); and so forth.

==In rational numbers==

Every positive [[rational number]] is the sum of three positive rational cubes,&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 234&lt;/ref&gt; and there are rationals that are not the sum of two rational cubes.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

==In real numbers, other fields, and rings==
{{more information|cubic function}}
[[Image:X cubed plot.svg|thumb|right|{{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''{{sup|3}}}} plotted on a Cartesian plane]]
In [[real number]]s, the cube function preserves the order: larger numbers have larger cubes. In other words, cubes (strictly) [[monotonic function|monotonically increase]]. Also, its [[codomain]] is the entire [[real line]]: the function {{math|''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; : '''R''' → '''R'''}} is a [[surjection]] (takes all possible values). Only three numbers are equal to their own cubes: {{num|−1}}, {{num|0}}, and {{num|1}}. If {{math|−1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 0}} or {{math|1 &lt; ''x''}}, then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''x''}}. If {{math|''x'' &lt; −1}} or {{math|0 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 1}}, then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ''x''}}. All aforementioned properties pertain also to any higher odd power ({{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;}},&amp;nbsp;…) of real numbers. Equalities and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] are also true in any [[ordered ring]].

Volumes of [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] Euclidean [[solid geometry|solids]] are related as cubes of their linear sizes.

In [[complex number]]s, the cube of a [[imaginary number|purely imaginary]] number is also purely imaginary. For example, {{math|1=[[imaginary unit|''i'']]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = −''i''}}.

The [[derivative]] of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} equals {{math|3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Cubes ''occasionally'' have the surjective property in other [[field (mathematics)|fields]], such as in [[finite field|{{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}]] for such prime {{mvar|p}} that {{math|''p'' ≠ 1 (mod 3)}},&lt;ref&gt;The [[multiplicative group]] of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] of order {{math|''p'' − 1}}, and if it is not divisible by 3, then cubes define a [[group automorphism]].&lt;/ref&gt; but not necessarily: see the counterexample with rationals [[#In rational numbers|above]]. Also in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;}} only three elements 0, ±1 are perfect cubes, of seven total. −1, 0, and 1 are perfect cubes ''anywhere'' and the only elements of a field equal to the own cubes: {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' = [[factorization of polynomials|''x''(''x'' − 1)(''x'' + 1)]]}}.

==History==

Determination of the cubes of large numbers was very common in [[History of mathematics|many ancient civilizations]]. Mesopotamian mathematicians created cuneiform tablets with tables for calculating cubes and cube roots by the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period (20th to 16th centuries BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Roger|title=The History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFDaj0WUvM8C&amp;pg=PT63|date=8 November 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-46029-0|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nen"&gt;{{cite book|last= Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbmXsaTGNKUC&amp;pg=PA306|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29497-6|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubic equations were known to the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek]] mathematician [[Diophantus]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Waerden, Geometry and Algebra of Ancient Civilizations, chapter 4, Zurich  1983 {{ISBN|0-387-12159-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hero of Alexandria]] devised a method for calculating cube roots in the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smyly|first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1399">In mathematics, a '''discrete symmetry''' is a symmetry that describes non-continuous changes in a system. For example, a square possesses discrete [[rotational symmetry]], as only rotations by multiples of right angles will preserve the square's original appearance. Discrete symmetries sometimes involve some type of 'swapping', these swaps usually being called ''reflections'' or ''interchanges''. In mathematics and [[theoretical physics]], a '''discrete symmetry''' is a [[symmetry]] under the transformations of a [[discrete group]]—e.g. a [[topological group]] with a [[discrete topology]] whose elements form a finite or a [[countable set]].

One of the most prominent discrete symmetries in physics is [[Parity (physics)|parity symmetry]]. It manifests itself in various elementary physical quantum systems, such as quantum harmonic oscillator, electron orbitals of Hydrogen-like atoms by forcing wavefunctions to be even or odd. This in turn gives rise to [[Selection rule|selection rules]] that determine which transition lines are visible in atomic [[Absorption spectroscopy|absorption spectra]].

'''Dominique Foata''' (born October 12, 1934) is a [[mathematician]] who works in [[enumerative combinatorics]]. With [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]] and [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]] he pioneered the modern approach to classical combinatorics, that lead, in part, to the current blossoming of [[algebraic combinatorics]]. His pioneering work on permutation statistics, and his combinatorial approach to special functions, are especially notable.

Foata gave an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Warsaw (1983). Among his honors are the Scientific Prize of the
Union des Assurances de Paris (September 1985). With  Adalbert Kerber and Volker Strehl he founded the mathematics journal ''[[Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire]]''. He is also one of the contributors of the pseudonymous collective [[M. Lothaire]].

He was born in [[Damascus]] while it was under [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]].

In [[mathematics]], an '''expression''' or '''mathematical expression''' is a finite combination of [[List of mathematical symbols|symbols]] that is [[well-formed formula|well-formed]] according to rules that depend on the context.  Mathematical symbols can designate numbers ([[Constant (mathematics)|constants]]), [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[Bracket (mathematics)|brackets]], punctuation, and grouping to help determine [[order of operations]], and other aspects of [[syntax (logic)|logical syntax]].

==Examples==

The use of expressions ranges from the simple:

::&lt;math&gt;0+0&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;8x-5&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[linear polynomial]])

::&lt;math&gt;7{{x}^{2}}+4x-10&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[quadratic polynomial]])

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-1}{{{x}^{2}}+12}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[rational fraction]])

to the complex: 

::&lt;math&gt;f(a)+\sum_{k=1}^n\left.\frac{1}{k!}\frac{d^k}{dt^k}\right|_{t=0}f(u(t)) + \int_0^1 \frac{(1-t)^n }{n!} \frac{d^{n+1}}{dt^{n+1}} f(u(t))\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

==Syntax versus semantics==

===Syntax===
{{Main|Syntax}}

An expression is a syntactic construct, it must be [[Well-formed formula|well-formed]]: the allowed [[operator (mathematics)|operators]] must have the correct number of inputs in the correct places, the characters that make up these inputs must be valid, have a clear [[order of operations]], etc. Strings of symbols that violate the rules of syntax are not well-formed and are not valid mathematical expressions.

For example, in the usual notation of [[arithmetic]], the expression ''1 + 2 × 3'' is well-formed, but the following expression is not:

:&lt;math&gt;\times4)x+,/y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Semantics===
{{Main|Semantics|Formal semantics (logic)}}

Semantics is the study of meaning. Formal semantics is about attaching meaning to expressions.

In [[algebra]], an expression may be used to designate a value, which might depend on values assigned to [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s occurring in the expression. The determination of this value depends on the [[semantics]] attached to the symbols of the expression.  The choice of semantics depends on the context of the expression.  The same syntactic expression ''1 + 2 × 3'' can have different values (mathematically 7, but also 9), depending on the [[order of operations]] implied by the context (See [[Order of operation#Calculators|Order of operations:Calculators]]).

The semantic rules may declare that certain expressions do not designate any value (for instance when they involve division by 0); such expressions are said to have an undefined value, but they are well-formed expressions nonetheless. In general the meaning of expressions is not limited to designating values; for instance, an expression might designate a condition, or an [[equation]] that is to be solved, or it can be viewed as an object in its own right that can be manipulated according to certain rules. Certain expressions that designate a value simultaneously express a condition that is assumed to hold, for instance those involving the operator &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; to designate an internal [[direct sum]].

===Formal languages and lambda calculus===
{{Main|Formal language|Lambda calculus}}

Formal languages allow [[Formal system|formalizing]] the concept of well-formed expressions.

In the 1930s, a new type of expressions, called [[lambda expressions]], were introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Stephen Kleene]] for formalizing [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and their evaluation. They form the basis for [[lambda calculus]], a [[formal system]] used in [[mathematical logic]] and the [[Programming language theory|theory of programming languages]].

The equivalence of two lambda expressions is [[decision problem|undecidable]]. This is also the case for the expressions representing real numbers, which are built from the integers by using the arithmetical operations, the logarithm and the exponential ([[Richardson's theorem]]).

==Variables==

Many mathematical expressions include [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. Any variable can be classified as being either a [[free variable]] or a [[bound variable]].

For a given combination of values for the free variables, an expression may be evaluated, although for some combinations of values of the free variables, the value of the expression may be undefined. Thus an expression represents a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose inputs are the values assigned to the free variables and whose output is the resulting value of the expression.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

For example, the expression
:&lt;math&gt; x/y &lt;/math&gt;

evaluated for ''x'' = 10, ''y'' = 5, will give 2; but it is [[Division by zero|undefined]] for ''y'' = 0.

The evaluation of an expression is dependent on the definition of the mathematical operators and on the system of values that is its context.

Two expressions are said to be equivalent if, for each combination of values for the free variables, they have the same output, i.e., they represent the same function. Example:

The expression
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{3} (2nx)&lt;/math&gt;
has free variable ''x'', bound variable ''n'', constants 1, 2, and 3, two occurrences of an implicit multiplication operator, and a summation operator. The expression is equivalent to the simpler expression 12''x''. The value for ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 is 36.

In [[geometry]], the '''Fermat point''' of a [[triangle]], also called the '''Torricelli point''' or '''Fermat–Torricelli point''', is a point such that the total distance from the three vertices of the triangle to the point is the minimum possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Generalization/fermat_point.shtml Cut The Knot - The Fermat Point and Generalizations]&lt;/ref&gt; It is so named because this problem is first raised by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] in a private letter to [[Evangelista Torricelli]], who solved it.

The Fermat point gives a solution to the [[geometric median]] and [[Steiner tree problem]]s for three points.

== Construction ==
The Fermat point of a triangle with largest angle at most 120° is simply its '''first isogonic center''' or '''X(13)''', which is constructed as follows:

# Construct an [[equilateral triangle]] on each of two arbitrarily chosen sides of the given triangle.
# Draw a line from each new [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] to the opposite vertex of the original triangle.
# The two lines intersect at the Fermat point.
An alternate method is the following:
# On each of two arbitrarily chosen sides, construct an [[isosceles triangle]], with base the side in question, 30-degree angles at the base, and the third vertex of each isosceles triangle lying outside the original triangle.
# For each isosceles triangle draw a circle, in each case with center on the new vertex of the isosceles triangle and with radius equal to each of the two new sides of that isosceles triangle.
# The intersection inside the original triangle between the two circles is the Fermat point.

When a triangle has an angle greater than 120°, the Fermat point is sited at the obtuse-angled vertex.

In what follows "Case 1" means the triangle has an angle exceeding 120°. "Case 2" means no angle of the triangle exceeds 120°.

==Location of X(13)==
[[Image:Fermat Point Proof.svg|thumb|right|300px|Fig 2. &amp;nbsp; Geometry of the first isogonic center.]]
Fig. 2 shows the equilateral triangles ARB, AQC and CPB attached to the sides of the arbitrary triangle ABC.
Here is a proof using properties of [[concyclic points]] to show that the three lines RC, BQ and AP in Fig 2 all intersect at the point F and cut one another at angles of 60°.

The triangles RAC and BAQ are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] because the second is a 60° rotation of the first about A. Hence ∠ARF = ∠ABF and ∠AQF = ∠ACF. By the converse of the [[Inscribed angle|inscribed angle theorem]] applied to the segment AF, the points ARBF are [[concyclic points|concyclic]] (they lie on a circle).  Similarly, the points AFCQ are concyclic.

∠ARB = 60°, so ∠AFB = 120°, using the  [[Inscribed angle#Applications|inscribed angle theorem]].  Similarly, ∠AFC = 120°.

So ∠BFC = 120°.  So, ∠BFC and ∠BPC add up to 180°.  Using the [[Inscribed angle#Applications|inscribed angle theorem]], this implies that the points BPCF are concyclic. So, using the [[Inscribed angle|inscribed angle theorem]] applied to the segment BP, ∠BFP = ∠BCP = 60°. Because ∠BFP + ∠BFA = 180°, the point F lies on the line segment AP.  So, the lines RC, BQ and AP are  [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] (they intersect at a single point).   [[Q.E.D.]]

This proof only applies in Case 2 since if ∠BAC &gt; 120°, point A lies inside the circumcircle of BPC which switches the relative positions of A and F. However it is easily modified to cover Case 1. Then ∠AFB = ∠AFC = 60° hence ∠BFC = ∠AFB = ∠AFC = 120° which means BPCF is concyclic so ∠BFP = ∠BCP = 60° = ∠BFA. Therefore, A lies on FP.

The lines joining the centers of the circles in Fig. 2 are perpendicular to the line segments AP, BQ and CR.  For example, the line joining the center of the circle containing ARB and the center of the circle containing AQC, is perpendicular to the segment AP.   So, the lines joining the centers of the circles also intersect at 60° angles.  Therefore, the centers of the circles form an equilateral triangle. This is known as [[Napoleon's Theorem]].

==Location of the Fermat point==

===Traditional geometry===
[[Image:Fermat Point Scope.svg|thumb|right|300px|Fig 3. &amp;nbsp; Geometry of the Fermat point]]
Given any Euclidean triangle ABC and an arbitrary point P let d(P) = PA+PB+PC, with PA denoting the distance between P and A. The aim of this section is to identify a point P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that d(P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; d(P) for all P ≠ P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If such a point exists then it will be the Fermat point. In what follows Δ will denote the points inside the triangle and will be taken to include its boundary Ω.

A key result that will be used is the dogleg rule which asserts that if a triangle and a polygon have one side in common and the rest of the triangle lies inside the polygon then the triangle has a shorter perimeter than the polygon. &lt;br /&gt;[If AB is the common side extend AC to cut the polygon at X. Then by the triangle inequality the polygon perimeter &gt;&amp;nbsp;AB&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;AX&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;XB =&amp;nbsp;AB&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;AC&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;CX&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;XB ≥&amp;nbsp;AB&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;AC&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;BC.]

Let P be any point outside Δ. Associate each vertex with its remote zone; that is, the half-plane beyond the (extended) opposite side. These 3 zones cover the entire plane except for Δ itself and P clearly lies in either one or two of them. If P is in two (say the B and C zones intersection) then setting P' = A implies d(P') = d(A) &lt; d(P) by the dogleg rule. Alternatively if P is in only one zone, say the A-zone, then d(P') &lt; d(P) where P' is the intersection of AP and BC. So '''for every point P outside Δ there exists a point P' in Ω such that d(P') &lt; d(P)'''.

'''Case 1.    The triangle has an angle ≥ 120°.'''

Without loss of generality suppose that the angle at A is ≥ 120°. Construct the equilateral triangle AFB and for any point P in Δ (except A itself) construct Q so that the triangle AQP is equilateral and has the orientation shown. Then the triangle ABP is a 60° rotation of the triangle AFQ about A so these two triangles are congruent and it follows that d(P) = CP+PQ+QF which is simply the length of the path CPQF. As P is constrained to lie within ABC, by the dogleg rule the length of this path exceeds AC+AF = d(A). Therefore, d(A) &lt; d(P) for all P є Δ, P ≠ A. Now allow P to range outside Δ. From above a point P' є Ω exists such that d(P') &lt; d(P) and as d(A) ≤ d (P') it follows that d(A) &lt; d(P) for all P outside Δ. Thus d(A) &lt; d(P) for all P ≠ A which means that A is the Fermat point of Δ. In other words, '''the Fermat point lies at the obtuse angled vertex'''.

'''Case 2.    The triangle has no angle ≥ 120°.'''

Construct the equilateral triangle BCD and let P be any point inside Δ and construct the equilateral triangle CPQ. Then CQD is a 60° rotation of CPB about C so d(P) = PA+PB+PC = AP+PQ+QD which is simply the length of the path APQD. Let P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be the point where AD and CF intersect. This point is commonly called the first isogonic center. By the angular restriction P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; lies inside Δ moreover BCF is a 60° rotation of BDA about B so Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; must lie somewhere on AD. Since CDB = 60° it follows that Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; lies between P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and D which means AP&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;D is a straight line so d(P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = AD. Moreover, if P ≠ P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; then either P or Q won't lie on AD which means d(P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = AD &lt; d(P). Now allow P to range outside Δ. From above a point P' є Ω exists such that d(P') &lt; d(P) and as d(P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ d(P') it follows that d(P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; d(P) for all P outside Δ. That means P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the Fermat point of Δ. In other words, '''the Fermat point is coincident with the first isogonic center'''.

===Vector analysis===
Let ''O'', ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''X'' be any five points in a plane. Denote the vectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{\mathrm{OA}}, \overrightarrow{\mathrm{OB}}, \overrightarrow{\mathrm{OC}}, \overrightarrow{\mathrm{OX}}&lt;/math&gt; by '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''x''' respectively, and let '''i''', '''j''', '''k''' be the unit vectors from ''O'' along '''a''', '''b''', '''c'''. &lt;br /&gt;
Now |'''a'''| = '''a⋅i''' = ('''a''' − '''x''')'''⋅i''' + '''x⋅i''' ≤ |'''a''' − '''x'''| + '''x⋅i''' and similarly |'''b'''| ≤ |'''b''' − '''x'''| + '''x⋅j''' and |'''c'''| ≤ |'''c''' − '''x'''| + '''x⋅k'''.&lt;br /&gt; 
Adding gives |'''a'''| + |'''b'''| + |'''c'''| ≤ |'''a''' − '''x'''| + |'''b''' − '''x'''| + |'''c''' − '''x'''| + '''x⋅'''('''i''' + '''j''' + '''k''').&lt;br /&gt; 
If '''a''', '''b''', '''c''' meet at ''O'' at angles of 120° then '''i''' + '''j''' + '''k''' = '''0''' so |'''a'''| + |'''b'''| + |'''c'''| ≤ |'''a''' − '''x'''| + |'''b''' − '''x'''| + |'''c''' − '''x'''| for all '''x'''.&lt;br /&gt; 
In other words, ''OA'' + ''OB'' + ''OC'' ≤ ''XA'' + ''XB'' + ''XC'' and hence ''O'' is the Fermat point of ''ABC''. &lt;br /&gt;
This argument fails when the triangle has an angle ''∠C'' &gt; 120° because there is no point ''O'' where '''a''', '''b''', '''c''' meet at angles of 120°. Nevertheless, it is easily fixed by redefining '''k''' = − ('''i''' + '''j''') and placing ''O'' at ''C'' so that '''c''' = '''0'''. Note that |'''k'''| ≤ 1 because the angle between the unit vectors '''i''' and '''j''' is ''∠C'' which exceeds 120°. Since |'''0'''| ≤ |'''0''' − '''x'''| + '''x⋅k''' the third inequality still holds, the other two inequalities are unchanged. The proof now continues as above (adding the three inequalities and using '''i''' + '''j''' + '''k''' = '''0''') to reach the same conclusion that ''O'' (or in this case ''C'') must be the Fermat point of ''ABC''.

===Lagrange multipliers===
Another approach to find a point within the triangle, from where sum of the distances to the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of triangle is minimum, is to use one of the [[optimization (mathematics)]] methods. In particular, method of the [[Lagrange multipliers]] and the [[law of cosines]].

We draw lines from the point within the triangle to its vertices and call them '''X''', '''Y''' and '''Z'''. Also, let the lengths of these lines be x, y, and z, respectively. Let the angle between '''X''' and '''Y''' be α, '''Y''' and '''Z''' be β. Then the angle between '''X''' and '''Z''' is (2π − α − β). Using the method of Lagrange multipliers we have to find the minimum of the Lagrangian ''L'', which is expressed as:

: ''L'' = ''x'' + ''y'' + ''z'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''xy'' cos(''α'') − ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''yz'' cos(β) − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''zx'' cos(''α'' + ''β'') − ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Equating each of the five partial derivatives δ''L''/δx, δ''L''/δy, δ''L''/δz, δ''L''/δα, δ''L''/δβ to zero and eliminating ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; eventually gives sin(α) = sin(β) and sin(α + β) = − sin(β) so α = β = 120°. However the elimination is a long tedious business and the end result only covers Case 2.

== Aliases ==
The '''isogonic centers''' ''X''(13) and ''X''(14) are also known as the '''first Fermat point''' and the '''second Fermat point''' respectively. Alternatives are the '''positive Fermat point''' and the '''negative Fermat point'''. However these different names can be confusing and are perhaps best avoided. The problem is that much of the literature blurs the distinction between the '''Fermat point''' and the '''first Fermat point''' whereas it is only in Case 2 above that they are actually the same.

== History ==
This question was proposed by Fermat, as a challenge to [[Evangelista Torricelli]]. He solved the problem in a similar way to Fermat's, albeit using intersection of the circumcircles of the three regular triangles instead. His pupil, Viviani, published the solution in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=FermatPoints |title=Fermat Points}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34343">'''Finitist set theory (FST)'''&lt;ref&gt;Avril Styrman and Aapo Halko (2018) "Finitist set theory in ontological modeling." Applied Ontology, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 107-133, 2018. DOI: 10.3233/AO-180196.&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection theory designed for modeling finite nested structures of individuals and a variety of [[Transitive relation|transitive]] and [[antitransitive]] chains of [[Binary relation|relations]] between individuals. Unlike classical [[set theory|set theories]] such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory|ZFC]] and [[Kripke–Platek set theory|KPU]], FST is not intended to function as a foundation mathematics, but only as a tool in [[ontological modeling]]. FST functions as the logical foundation of the classical layer-cake interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Wimsatt, W.C. (2006). The ontology of complex systems: Levels of organization, perspectives, and causal thickets. Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Supplementary, 20, 207–274. Fine, K. (2010). Towards a theory of part. The Journal of Philosophy, 107(11), 559–589. doi:10.5840/jphil20101071139.&lt;/ref&gt;, and manages to incorporate a large portion of the functionality of [[Mereology|discrete mereology]].

FST models are of type &lt;math&gt;\{U_\alpha, S_\beta, \in\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;
U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of ur-elements of model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt;. Ur-elements (urs) are indivisible
primitives. By assigning a finite integer such as 2 as the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, it is determined that &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; contains exactly 2 urs. &lt;math&gt;S_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a collection whose elements will be called sets. &lt;math&gt;\beta\geq0&lt;/math&gt; is a finite integer which denotes the maximum rank (nesting level) of sets in &lt;math&gt;S_\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Every set in &lt;math&gt;S_\beta&lt;/math&gt; has one or more sets or urs or both as members. The assigned &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the applied axioms fix the contents of &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_\beta&lt;/math&gt;. To facilitate the use of language, expressions such as "sets that are elements of &lt;math&gt;S_\beta&lt;/math&gt; of model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and urs that are elements of &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal
{M}_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt;" are abbreviated as "sets and urs that are elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt;".

FST’s formal development conforms to its intended function as a tool in ontological modeling. The goal of an engineer who applies FST is to select [[axiom]]s which yield a model that is one-one correlated with a target domain that is to be modeled by FST, such as a range of [[chemical compound]]s or [[social construction]]s that are found in nature. The target domain gives the engineer an intuition about the contents of the FST model that ought to be [[One-to-one correlation|one-one correlated]] with it. FST provides a framework that facilitates selecting specific axioms that yield the one-one correlation. The axioms of [[extensionality]] and restriction are postulated in all versions of FST, but set construction axioms (nesting- axioms and union-axioms) vary; the assignment of finite integer values to &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is implicit in the selected set construction axioms.

FST is thereby not a single theory, but a name for a family of theories or versions of FST, where each version has its own set construction
axioms and a unique model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha, \beta}&lt;/math&gt;, which has a finite [[cardinality]] and all its sets have a finite [[Von Neumann universe|rank]] and cardinality. FST axioms are formulated by first-order logic complemented by the member of relation &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. All versions of FST are first-order theories. In the axioms and definitions, symbols &lt;math&gt;x, y, z, v, w&lt;/math&gt; are variables for sets, &lt;math&gt;r, s, t&lt;/math&gt; are variables for both sets and urs, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a variable for urs, and &lt;math&gt;a, b, c, d&lt;/math&gt; denote individual urs of a model. The symbols for urs may appear only on the left side of &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. The symbols for sets may appear on both &lt;math&gt;u \in y&lt;/math&gt;.

An applied FST model is always the minimal model which satisfies the applied axioms. This guarantees that those and only those elements exist in the applied model which are explicitly constructed by the selected axioms: only those urs exist which are stated to exist by assigning their number, and only those sets exist which are constructed by the selected axioms; no other elements exist in addition to these. This interpretation is needed, for typical FST axioms which generate e.g. exactly one set &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; do not otherwise exclude sets such as &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\}\}, \{\{\{a\}\}\}, \ldots \,. &lt;/math&gt;

==Complete FST models==
Complete FST models contain all permutations of sets and urs within the limits of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The axioms for complete FST models are extensionality, restriction, singleton sets and union of sets. Extensionality and restriction are axioms of all versions of FST, whereas the axiom for singleton sets is a provisional nesting-axiom (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;-axiom) and the axiom of union of sets is a provisional union-axiom (&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;-axiom).

* '''Ax. Extensionality''': &lt;math&gt;\forall r( r \in x \leftrightarrow r \in y) \leftrightarrow x=y&lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is identical to set &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; iff (if and only if) &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have the identical members, may these be sets, urs or both.
* '''Ax. Restriction''': &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists r(r \in x)&lt;/math&gt;. Every set has either a set or an ur as a member. The empty set &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt; has no members, and therefore there exists no such thing as &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt; in FST. Urs are the only &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;-minimal elements in FST. Every FST set contains at least one ur as the &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;-minimal member on the bottom.
* '''Ax. Singleton Sets''': &lt;math&gt;\forall r_{&lt;\beta}\exists x \forall s( s = r \leftrightarrow s \in x)&lt;/math&gt;. For every ur and set &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; that has a rank smaller than &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, there exists the singleton set &lt;math&gt;x=\{r\}&lt;/math&gt;. The rank restriction (&lt;math&gt;r_{&lt;\beta}&lt;/math&gt;) in the axiom does the job of the axiom of foundation of traditional set theories: constraining the rank of sets to an assigned finite &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; entails that there are no non-wellfounded sets, for such sets would have a transfinite rank. Given urs &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{2, 1}&lt;/math&gt;, the axiom of singleton sets generates only sets &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the axiom of pairing of traditional set theories generates &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Ax. [[Union (set theory)|Union of Sets]]''': &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \exists z \forall r( (r \in x \lor r \in y) \leftrightarrow r \in z)&lt;/math&gt;. For all sets &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, there exists set &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which contains as members all those and only those sets and urs that are members of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, members of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, or members of both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, if sets &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; exist, the axiom of union of sets states that the set &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; exists. If sets &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; exist, the axiom states that &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; exists. If &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\{b\}\}&lt;/math&gt; exist, the axiom states that &lt;math&gt;\{a,\{b\}\}&lt;/math&gt; exists. This axiom is different from the axiom of union of traditional set theories.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Kripke–Platek_set_theory_with_urelements|KPU]]'s axiom of union gives the set that contains all ''members of members of'' a set, i.e, the existence of &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; is implied by e.g. by the existence of &lt;math&gt;\{ \{a,b\}, \{c\}\}&lt;/math&gt;, as the members of members of &lt;math&gt;\{\{a,b\}, \{c\}\}&lt;/math&gt; are members of &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;. Although such features are applied generating ordinal numbers, they are not needed in modelling finite nested structures.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete FST models &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; contain all permutations of sets and urs within limits of the assigned &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is its number of sets and urs &lt;math&gt;sets(\alpha,\beta) + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
Consider some examples.

:'''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{1,0}&lt;/math&gt;:''''' One ur &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; exists. &lt;math&gt;card(\mathcal{M}_{1,0}) = sets(1,0) + 1 =0+1=1&lt;/math&gt;
:'''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{2,0}&lt;/math&gt;:''''' Two urs &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; exist. &lt;math&gt;card(\mathcal{M}_{2,0}) =  sets(2,0) + 2 =0+2=2.&lt;/math&gt;
:'''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{1,1}&lt;/math&gt;:''''' One ur &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; exist. &lt;math&gt;card(\mathcal{M}_{1,0}) = sets(\alpha,\beta) + \alpha = sets(1,1) + 1 =1+1=2.&lt;/math&gt;
:'''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{2,1}&lt;/math&gt;:''''' Two urs &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; and sets &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; exist. &lt;math&gt;card(\mathcal{M}_{2,1}) = sets(2,1) + 2 =3+2=5.&lt;/math&gt;
:'''''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt;:''''' One ur &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and sets &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\}\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{a, \{a\}\}&lt;/math&gt; exist. &lt;math&gt;card(\mathcal{M}_{1,2}) = sets(1,2) + 1 =3+1=4.&lt;/math&gt;

The recursive formula &lt;math&gt;sets(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; gives the number of sets in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{\alpha, \beta}&lt;/math&gt;:

:'''''&lt;math&gt;sets(\alpha,0)= 0.&lt;/math&gt;'''''
:'''''&lt;math&gt;sets(\alpha,1)= 2^{\alpha}-1.&lt;/math&gt;'''''
:'''''&lt;math&gt;sets(\alpha,\beta)= 2^{\alpha + sets(\alpha,\beta-1)}-1.&lt;/math&gt;'''''
In &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{2,2}&lt;/math&gt; there are &lt;math&gt;sets(2,2) = 2^{2+sets(2,1)}-1 = 2^{2+3}-1=31&lt;/math&gt; sets. 

In &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{2,3}&lt;/math&gt; there are &lt;math&gt;sets(2,3) = 2^{2+31}-1 = 2^{33}-1&lt;/math&gt; sets.

==FST definitions==

FST definitions should be understood as practical naming conventions which are used in stating that the elements of an applied FST model are or are not interrelated in specific ways. The definitions ought not be seen as axioms: only axioms entail existence of elements of an FST model, not definitions. In order to avoid conflicts (especially with axioms for incomplete FST models), the definitions must be subjugated to the applied axioms with the given &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. To illustrate a seeming conflict, suppose that &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; are the only sets of the applied model. The definition of intersection states that &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \cap \{b,c\}=\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist in the applied model, the definition of intersection may appear to be an axiom. However, this is only apparent, for &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; does not have to exist in order to state that the only common element of &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, which is the function of the definition of intersection. Similarly with all definitions.

* '''Def. Rank.''' The rank of a set is the formal analog of the level of an individual. That the rank of set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is written as &lt;math&gt;{\rm rank}(x)=n&lt;/math&gt;, and abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;x_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; in some nesting-axioms. As a convention, the rank of an ur-element is 0. As there is no empty set in FST, the smallest possible rank of a FST set is 1, whereas in traditional set theories the rank of \{\} is 0. The rank of set &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the greatest nesting level of all &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;-minimal elements of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The rank of &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; is 1, as the nesting level of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; is 1. The rank of &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is 2, as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is nested by two concentric sets. The rank of &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\},a\}&lt;/math&gt; is 2, as 2 is the greatest nesting level of all &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;-minimal elements of &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\},a\}&lt;/math&gt;. The rank of &lt;math&gt;\{\{\{a\}\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is 3, the rank of &lt;math&gt;\{\{\{\{a\}\}\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is 4, and so on. Formally:&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm rank}(s)=0 \leftrightarrow s&lt;/math&gt; is an ur-element.&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm rank}(s) \geq n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as: &lt;math&gt;\exists s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n} (s_{1} \in s_{2} \in \ldots \in s_{n} \in s ).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm rank}(s) = n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as: &lt;math&gt;{\rm rank}(s) \geq n \land \lnot ({\rm rank}(s) \geq n+1).&lt;/math&gt;

:By applying the definition of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-member (below) rank can be defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm rank}(s)=0 \leftrightarrow s&lt;/math&gt; is an ur-element.&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm rank}(r)= n&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as &lt;math&gt;\exists a (a \in_{n} x) \land \not\exists a (a \in_{n+1} x ).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

* '''Def. Subset''': &lt;math&gt;\forall r( r \in x \rightarrow r \in  y)&lt;/math&gt;, is denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \subseteq y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; iff every member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a member of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \subseteq  \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \subseteq  \{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not a subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;x \not\subseteq y&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \not\subseteq  \{b\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \not\subseteq  \{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;. Due to the exclusion of the empty set &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, in FST &lt;math&gt;x \subseteq y&lt;/math&gt; means that all members of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are members of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists at least one member in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and at least one member in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In traditional set theories where &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt; exist, &lt;math&gt;x \subseteq y&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not have any members that are {\it not} members of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore in traditional set theories, &lt;math&gt;\{\} \subseteq y&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

* '''Def. Proper Subset''': &lt;math&gt;x \subseteq y \land y \not\subseteq x,&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \subset y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not a subset of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \subset  \{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \subset  \{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;x \not\subset y&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \not\subset \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\} \not\subset \{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;. In FST, &lt;math&gt;x \subset y&lt;/math&gt; means that all members of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are members of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, there exists at least one member in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, at least two members in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and at least one member of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not a member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In traditional set theories, &lt;math&gt;x \subset y&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not have any members that are {\it not} members of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; has at least one member that is not a member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore in traditional set theories, &lt;math&gt;\{\} \subset y&lt;/math&gt; holds for every &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y \neq \{\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; 

* '''Def. Disjointness''': &lt;math&gt;\not\exists r(r \in x \land r \in y),&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \wr y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint iff they do not have any common members. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \wr \{b\}&lt;/math&gt; (when &lt;math&gt;a \neq b&lt;/math&gt;); &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \wr \{\{a\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;  

* '''Def. Overlap''': &lt;math&gt;\exists r(r \in x \land r \in y),&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \circ y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; overlap iff they have one or more common members. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \circ \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \circ \{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;. Disjointness is the contrary of overlap: &lt;math&gt; x \circ y \leftrightarrow \lnot(x \wr y) &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\lnot(x \circ y) \leftrightarrow x \wr y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

* '''Def. Intersection''': &lt;math&gt;\forall r (   (r \in x \land r \in y) \leftrightarrow r \in z),&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;z=x \cap y&lt;/math&gt;. The intersection of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z=x \cap y&lt;/math&gt;, contains those and only those sets and ur-elements that are members of both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \cap \{a\} = \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\} \cap \{b,c,d\} = \{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;. As the empty set does not exist in FST, the intersection of two disjoint sets does not exist. When &lt;math&gt;r \neq s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{r\} \cap \{s\} =y&lt;/math&gt; is not true for any &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the disjointness relation &lt;math&gt;\wr&lt;/math&gt; can be used: &lt;math&gt;\{r\} \wr \{s\}&lt;/math&gt;. In traditional set theories the intersection of two disjoint sets {\it is} the empty set:  &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \cap \{b\} = \{\}&lt;/math&gt;. If the axiom of restriction were deleted and the existence of the empty set were postulated, this would still not imply that the empty set {\it is} the intersection of two disjoint sets.&lt;br /&gt;

* '''Def. Union''':  &lt;math&gt;\forall r (   (r \in x \lor r \in y) \leftrightarrow r \in z),&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;z=x \cup y&lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; contains as members all those sets and ur-elements that are members of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, members of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, or members of both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \cup \{a\} = \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \cup \{b,c\} = \{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \cup \{\{b\}\} = \{a,\{b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

* '''Theorem of Weak Supplementation''': &lt;math&gt;x \subset y \rightarrow  \exists z (z \subset y \land z \wr x).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Varzi, A.C. (2016). Mereology. In E.N. Zalta (Ed.), The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Weak supplementation (WS) expresses that a proper subset &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not the whole &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, but must be supplemented by another subset &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; to compose &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint. In FST, when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; has another subset &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; that is disjoint with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\{a\}  \subset \{a,b\} \rightarrow  (\{b\} \subset \{a,b\} \land \{b\} \wr \{a\})&lt;/math&gt; is true in all FST models which contain the set &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;.

* '''Def. Difference''':  &lt;math&gt;\forall r ( r \in z \leftrightarrow (r \in x \land r \notin y)),&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;  z=x \setminus y.&lt;/math&gt; The difference &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; contains every member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that is not a member of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;\{a\} \setminus \{b\} =\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\{a,b,c\} \setminus \{a,b\} =\{c\}&lt;/math&gt;. As the empty set does not exist, it cannot be stated that &lt;math&gt;\{x\} \setminus \{x\}=\{\}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, there does not exist &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;z= x \setminus y&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y(x \subseteq y \leftrightarrow \not\exists z(z=x \setminus y)).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

* '''Def. Cardinality.''' Cardinality denotes the number of members of a set. Cardinality is defined only for sets: ur-elements do not have a cardinality. The cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\{r\}&lt;/math&gt; is 1, disregarding whether &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a set or an ur-element. The lowest possible cardinality of an FST set is 1, whereas in traditional set theories the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt; is 0. &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(x)=n&lt;/math&gt; means that the cardinality of set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. E.g. &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(\{y,z\})=2&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(\{x,y,\{z\}\})=3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(\{ x, \{x\}, \{\{x\}\} \})=3&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(\{x,y,z,w\})=4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(x) =1&lt;/math&gt; is defined as: &lt;math&gt;\exists s(s \in x \land \forall r (r \in x \leftrightarrow r=s)).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(x) \geq n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \geq  2&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as: &lt;math&gt;\exists s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots , s_{n} ( (\bigwedge_{k=1}^{n} s_{k} \in x)      \land   \bigwedge_{a=1}^{n-1} \bigwedge_{b=a+1}^{n} s_{a} \neq s_{b} ).&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(x) = n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; is defined as: &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(x) \geq n \land \lnot ({\rm card}(x) \geq n+1).&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Def. Power Set''': &lt;math&gt;\forall z  (z \in y \leftrightarrow z \subseteq x),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;y=P(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: &lt;math&gt;P(\{r\}) = \{\{r\}\}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;P(\{r,s\}) = \{ \{r\}, \{s\}, \{r,s\}  \}&lt;/math&gt;. Power sets in FST do not contain the empty set, and thus &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(P(x))=2^{{\rm card}(x)} -1&lt;/math&gt;. In FST power set is not required in building sets, whereas e.g. in ZF set theory the axiom of power set is essential in building the hierarchy transfinite sets.  In ZF power sets contain the empty set, e.g. as in &lt;math&gt;P(\{y,x\})=\{\{\}, \{y\}, \{z\}, \{y,z\}  \}&lt;/math&gt;, which makes &lt;math&gt;{\rm card}(P(x))=2^{{\rm card}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; 

* '''Def. n-Member and Partition Level''':&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r \in_{1} x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;r \in x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;     
:&lt;math&gt;r \in_{2} x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\exists y (r \in y \in x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;     
:&lt;math&gt;r \in_{n} x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as &lt;math&gt;\exists y (r \in_{n-1} y \in x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

:That &lt;math&gt;r \in_{1} x&lt;/math&gt; holds can be stated by saying that &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; exists in the ''first partition level'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;r \in_{2} x&lt;/math&gt; holds can be stated by saying that &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; exists in the second partition level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. And so forth. &lt;ref&gt;The term 'partition level' and the recursive definition of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-member are adapted from: Seibt, J. (2015) Non-transitive parthood, leveled mereology, and the representation of emergent parts of processes. Grazer Philosophische Studien, 91(1), 165–190, pp. 178-80. Seibt, J. (2009).

* '''Def. &lt;math&gt;[n\, m]&lt;/math&gt; Members.&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r \in_{[n\, m]} x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n \leq m&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as: &lt;math&gt;r \in_{n} x \lor r \in_{n+1} x \lor r \in_{n+2} x \lor \ldots  \lor r \in_{m} x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;   
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-to-&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is an n-member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or an n+1-member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or \ldots or an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-member of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

* '''Def. Partition Set.''' A partition set that contains all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-members of a set is defined as: 

:&lt;math&gt;partition_{1}(x)=x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;partition_{2}(x)=y&lt;/math&gt; is defined as: &lt;math&gt;\forall r ( r \in_{2} x  \leftrightarrow r \in y)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;      
:&lt;math&gt;partition_{n}(x)=y&lt;/math&gt; is defined as: &lt;math&gt;\forall r ( r \in_{n} x  \leftrightarrow r \in y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

* '''Def. Transitive Closure''': &lt;math&gt;\forall r ( r \in_{[1\, rank(x)]} x \leftrightarrow r \in y)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;y=Tc(x)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;y=Tc(x)&lt;/math&gt; means that set &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the transitive closure of set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; contains all sets and ur-elements of the input set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the whole inner structure of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: 

:&lt;math&gt;Tc(\{\{a,b\}\})=\{a,b,\{a,b\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;Tc(\{\{\{a\}\}\})=\{a,\{a\},\{\{a\}\}\}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;Tc(\{a,\{a\}\})=\{a,\{a\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Definitions that incorporate the functionality of discrete mereology==
As transitive theories, [[Mereology]] and [[Boolean algebra]] are incapable of modeling nested structures. It is therefore intelligible to take FST or another intransitive theory as primary in modeling nested structures. However, also the functionality of transitive theories finds application in modeling nested structures. A large portion of the functionality of discrete mereology (DM) can be incorporated in FST, in terms of relations which mimic DM's relations. 

DM operates with structureless aggregates such as &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; that consists of urs &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;abcd&lt;/math&gt; that consists of urs &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d&lt;/math&gt;. DM's &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; and other relations defined in terms of &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; characterize relations between aggregates such as in &lt;math&gt;ab \preceq abcd&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;ad \preceq abcd&lt;/math&gt;. An axiomatization of DM and some definitions are given; some definitions are prefixed by &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to distinguish them from FST's definitions with the same names.

*'''ax. extensionality''' &lt;math&gt;x=y \leftrightarrow \forall w (w \preceq x \leftrightarrow w \preceq y)&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''ax. reflexivity''' &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \preceq x).&lt;/math&gt;
*'''ax. transitivity:''' &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z (x \preceq y \preceq z \rightarrow x \preceq z).&lt;/math&gt;
*'''def. proper part:''' &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y \land y \not\preceq x,&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \prec y&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''def. ur-element:''' &lt;math&gt;\not\exists x (x \prec y),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;ur(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''ax. discreteness:''' &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y(ur(y) \land  y \preceq  x).&lt;/math&gt;
*'''def. m-overlap:''' &lt;math&gt;\exists z (z \preceq x \land z \preceq y),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \odot y&lt;/math&gt;. 
*'''def. m-disjointness:''' &lt;math&gt;\not\exists z (z \preceq x \land z \preceq y),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; Ø &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''def. m-intersection:''' &lt;math&gt;\forall w  ( (w \preceq x \land  w \preceq y) \leftrightarrow w \preceq z),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;z=x \otimes y&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''def. m-union:''' &lt;math&gt;y \preceq z \land x \preceq z \land   \forall w ((y \preceq w \land x \preceq w) \rightarrow z \preceq w),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as  &lt;math&gt;z=x \oplus y&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''def. m-difference:''' &lt;math&gt;\forall w (w \preceq z \leftrightarrow  (w \preceq x \land w \not\preceq y) ),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;z=x \ominus y&lt;/math&gt;.

A large portion of the functionality of DM can be incorporated in FST by defining a relation analogous to DM's primitive &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; in terms of FST's membership. Although the identical symbol '&lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;' is used with DM and the goal is to mimic DM functionality, FST's &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; may hold only between elements of a FST model, i.e., nothing is added to the applied FST models. As always, variables &lt;math&gt;x,y,z,w&lt;/math&gt; denote FST sets and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; denotes an ur-element. 

The basic idea is that membership and [[#FST Definitions|FST's basic relations]] defined in terms of membership are structural, whereas FST's &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; and relations defined in terms of &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; are ''structure-independent'' or ''structure-neutral''. That &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt; are structural means that they are sensitive to nested structures of sets: when it is known that &lt;math&gt;u \in y&lt;/math&gt; holds it is known that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a member of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and exists in the first partition level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and when it is known that &lt;math&gt;x \subseteq y&lt;/math&gt; holds it is known that all members of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are members of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and exists in the first partition level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, when it is known e.g. that &lt;math&gt;u \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; holds, it is not known on which specific level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; does &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; exist. &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is characterized as structure-neutral because it allows &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; existing in whatever partition level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is applied in talking about structural FST sets in a structure-neutral way. Similarly as with &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, symbols for urs may appear only the left side of &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the definitions:

*'''def. ur part:''' &lt;math&gt;u \in_{[1\,rank(y)]} y,&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;u \preceq y&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''def. part:''' &lt;math&gt;\forall u (u \in_{[1\,rank(x)]} x \rightarrow u \in_{[1\,rank(y)]} y)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''def. proper part:''' &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y \land y \not\preceq x,&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \prec y&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;u \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; holds, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; exists in some level of set &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;a \preceq \{b,\{a,b\}\}&lt;/math&gt; holds.  When &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; holds, every ur in any level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; exists in some level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \preceq \{b,\{a,b\}\}&lt;/math&gt; holds.  Accordingly, &lt;math&gt;y \not\preceq x&lt;/math&gt; means that there is an ur in some level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that is not in any level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. By the definition of proper part, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \prec \{\{a,b\},\{c,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{c,d\} \prec \{\{a,b\},\{c,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt; hold. Given any kind of a membership hierarchy whatsoever, such as &lt;math&gt;a \in x \in y&lt;/math&gt;, also &lt;math&gt;a \preceq x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; holds; given any kind of a subset hierarchy such as &lt;math&gt; x \subset y \subset z&lt;/math&gt;, also &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y \preceq z&lt;/math&gt; holds; given any kind of a hierarchy which is a combination of membership and subset relations such as &lt;math&gt;a \in x \subset y&lt;/math&gt;, also &lt;math&gt;a \preceq x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; holds. Note that &lt;math&gt;x \subset y \rightarrow x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt; holds whereas  &lt;math&gt;x \subset y \rightarrow x \prec y&lt;/math&gt; does not hold in all FST models, such as in the case where &lt;math&gt;x=\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=\{a,b,\{a\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Fine (2010, p. 579) notes that also chains of relations such as &lt;math&gt;r \in v \subset y \prec w&lt;/math&gt; may be used; such chains have now been given an axiomatic base.

The following translations of DM axioms into the terminology of FST show that FST's &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is congenial with DM's axioms of reflexivity, transitivity and discreteness, but that DM extensionality must be modified by changing one of its equivalence relations into an implication. This reminds that FST sets are structural whereas DM aggretates are structureless.

*'''Extensionality''': &lt;math&gt;x=y \leftrightarrow \forall w (w \preceq x \leftrightarrow w \preceq y)&lt;/math&gt;. This axiom does not hold, for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; may be unidentical sets even if every ur in any level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa, such as when &lt;math&gt;x=\{\{a,b\},\{c,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \{\{a,c\},\{b,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;x=y \rightarrow \forall w (w \preceq x \leftrightarrow w \preceq y)&lt;/math&gt; holds, for the identity of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; implies that every ur that is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.
*'''reflexivity''': &lt;math&gt;\forall x (x \preceq x).&lt;/math&gt; Every ur that is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''transitivity''': &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z (x \preceq y \preceq z \rightarrow x \preceq z).&lt;/math&gt; If every ur that is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and every ur that is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, then every ur that is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''discreteness''': &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists u (u \preceq  x).&lt;/math&gt; Every set contains at least one ur in some level.

To illustrate how FST's &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; can be applied as a structure-neutral relation in talking about structural sets, consider translations of examples (1-2) where only mereology is applied, into (1'-2') where FST's &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is be applied together with membership.

1. A handle is a part of a door; a door is a part of a house; but the handle is not a part of the house.:&lt;br /&gt;
1'. A handle is a part of a door and a member of a door: handle &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; door; handle &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; door. The door is a part of a house and a member of the house: door &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; house; door &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; house. The handle is a part of the house but not a member of the house: handle &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; house; handle &lt;math&gt;\not\in&lt;/math&gt; house.:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;door = \{handle, \ldots\}.&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;house = \{door, \ldots\} = \{\{handle, \ldots\}, \ldots\}.&lt;/math&gt;

2. A platoon is part of a company; a company is part of a battalion; but a platoon is not a part of a battalion.:&lt;br /&gt;
2'. A platoon is part of a company and a member of a company; a company is a part of a battalion and a member of the battalion; a platoon is a part of a battalion but not a member of a battalion.:&lt;br/&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; has been defined, all DM relations that are defined in terms of &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; can be considered as FST definitions, including m-overlap, m-disjointness, m-intersection, m-union and m-difference.

*'''Def. m-overlap''': &lt;math&gt;\exists r (r \preceq x \land r \preceq y),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;x \odot y&lt;/math&gt;. At least one ur in some level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. 
*'''Def. m-disjointness''': &lt;math&gt;\not\exists r (r \preceq x \land r \preceq y),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; Ø &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. No ur in any level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is found in any level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. 
*'''Def. m-intersection''': &lt;math&gt;\forall w  ( (w \preceq x \land  w \preceq y) \leftrightarrow w \preceq z),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;z=x \otimes y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all urs that are found in some levels of both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  
*'''Def. m-union''': &lt;math&gt;y \preceq z \land x \preceq z \land \forall w ((y \preceq w \land x \preceq w) \rightarrow z \preceq w),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as  &lt;math&gt;z=x \oplus y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all urs in any level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; or both.  
*'''Def. m-difference''': &lt;math&gt;\forall w (w \preceq z \leftrightarrow  (w \preceq x \land w \not\preceq y) ),&lt;/math&gt; denoted as &lt;math&gt;z=x \ominus y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all urs that are in some level of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; but not in any level of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. 

Regarding the definitions of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-intersection, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-union and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-difference, in complete FST models all sets &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; exist. In some incomplete FST models some &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; do not exist. For instance, when &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; are the only sets in the applied model, the definition of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-intersection states that &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\} \otimes \{b,c\}=\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, which makes the definition appear as an axiom. As indicated [[#FST Definitions|above]], the definition is not interpreted as an axiom, but only as a formula which states that &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is found in some level of both &lt;math&gt;\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b,c\}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7117">In [[mathematics]], a '''free Boolean algebra''' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with a distinguished set of elements, called '''''generators''''', such that:
#Each element of the Boolean algebra can be expressed as a finite combination of generators, using the Boolean operations, and
#The generators are as ''independent'' as possible, in the sense that there are no relationships among them (again in terms of finite expressions using the Boolean operations) that do not hold in ''every'' Boolean algebra no matter ''which'' elements are chosen.

==A simple example==
[[File:Free-boolean-algebra-hasse-diagram.svg|right|300px|The [[Hasse diagram]] of the free Boolean algebra on two generators, ''p'' and ''q''. Take ''p (left circle)'' to be "John is tall" and ''q (right circle)''to be "Mary is rich". The atoms are the four elements in the row just above FALSE.]]
The [[generating set|generators]] of a free Boolean algebra can represent independent [[proposition]]s. Consider, for example, the propositions "John is tall" and "Mary is rich". These generate a Boolean algebra with four [[atomic (order theory)|atoms]], namely:
*John is tall, and Mary is rich;
*John is tall, and Mary is not rich;
*John is not tall, and Mary is rich;
*John is not tall, and Mary is not rich.

Other elements of the Boolean algebra are then [[logical disjunction]]s of the atoms, such as "John is tall and Mary is not rich, or John is not tall and Mary is rich". In addition there is one more element, FALSE, which can be thought of as the empty disjunction; that is, the disjunction of no atoms.

This example yields a Boolean algebra with 16 elements; in general, for finite ''n'', the free Boolean algebra with ''n'' generators has 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  [[atomic (order theory)|atoms]], and therefore &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; elements.

If there are [[infinite set|infinitely]] many [[generating set|generators]], a similar situation prevails except that now there are no [[atomic (order theory)|atoms]]. Each element of the Boolean algebra is a combination of finitely many of the generating propositions, with two such elements deemed identical if they are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].

==Category-theoretic definition==
In the language of [[category theory]], free Boolean algebras can be defined simply in terms of an [[adjoint functors|adjunction]] between the category of sets and functions, '''Set''', and the category of Boolean algebras and Boolean algebra homomorphisms, '''BA'''. In fact, this approach generalizes to any algebraic structure definable in the framework of [[universal algebra]].

Above, we said that a free Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra with a set of generators that behave a certain way; alternatively, one might start with a set and ask which algebra it generates. Every set ''X'' generates a free Boolean algebra ''FX'' defined as the algebra such that for every algebra ''B'' and function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''B'', there is a unique Boolean algebra homomorphism ''f''&amp;prime; : ''FX'' → ''B'' that extends ''f''. [[Commutative diagram|Diagrammatically]],
[[File:Free-Boolean-algebra-unit-sloppy.png|center]]
where ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is the inclusion, and the dashed arrow denotes uniqueness. The idea is that once one chooses where to send the elements of ''X'', the [[Boolean_algebra_(structure)#Homomorphisms_and_isomorphisms|laws for Boolean algebra homomorphisms]] determine where to send everything else in the free algebra ''FX''. If ''FX'' contained elements inexpressible as combinations of elements of ''X'', then ''f''&amp;prime; wouldn't be unique, and if the elements of ''X'' weren't sufficiently independent, then ''f''&amp;prime; wouldn't be well defined! It is easily shown that ''FX'' is unique (up to isomorphism), so this definition makes sense. It is also easily shown that a free Boolean algebra with generating set X, as defined originally, is isomorphic to ''FX'', so the two definitions agree.

One shortcoming of the above definition is that the diagram doesn't capture that ''f''&amp;prime; is a homomorphism; since it is a diagram in '''Set''' each arrow denotes a mere function. We can fix this by separating it into two diagrams, one in '''BA''' and one in '''Set'''. To relate the two, we introduce a [[functor]] ''U'' : '''BA''' → '''Set''' that "[[Forgetful functor|forgets]]" the algebraic structure, mapping algebras and homomorphisms to their underlying sets and functions.
[[File:Free-Boolean-algebra-unit.png|center]]
If we interpret the top arrow as a diagram in '''BA''' and the bottom triangle as a diagram in '''Set''', then this diagram properly expresses that every function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''UB'' extends to a unique Boolean algebra homomorphism ''f''&amp;prime; : ''FX'' → ''B''. The functor ''U'' can be thought of as a device to pull the homomorphism ''f''&amp;prime; back into '''Set''' so it can be related to ''f''.

The remarkable aspect of this is that the latter diagram is one of the various (equivalent) definitions of when two functors are [[adjoint functors|adjoint]]. Our ''F'' easily extends to a functor '''Set''' → '''BA''', and our definition of ''X'' generating a free Boolean algebra ''FX'' is precisely that ''U'' has a [[left adjoint]] ''F''.

==Topological realization==
The free Boolean algebra with κ [[generating set|generators]], where κ is a finite or infinite [[cardinal number]], may be realized as the collection of all [[clopen set|clopen]] [[subset]]s of {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;, given the [[product topology]] assuming that {0,1} has the [[discrete topology]]. For each α&amp;lt;κ, the α''th'' generator is the set of all elements of {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; whose α''th'' coordinate is 1. In particular, the free Boolean algebra with &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; generators is the collection of all [[clopen set|clopen subsets]] of a [[Cantor space]], sometimes called the [[Cantor algebra]]. Surprisingly, this collection is [[countable set|countable]]. In fact, while the free Boolean algebra with ''n'' generators, ''n'' finite, has [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, the free Boolean algebra with &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; generators, as for any free algebra with &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; generators and countably many finitary operations, has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.

For more on this [[topology|topological]] approach to free Boolean algebra, see [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1898">In [[mathematics]], '''Frölicher spaces''' extend the notions of [[calculus]] and [[smooth manifold]]s. They were introduced in 1982 by the [[mathematician]] [[Alfred Frölicher]].

==Definition==
A '''Frölicher space''' consists of a non-empty set ''X'' together with a subset ''C'' of Hom('''R''', ''X'') called the set of '''smooth curves''', and a subset ''F'' of Hom(''X'', '''R''') called the set of '''smooth real functions''', such that for each real function

:''f'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; '''R'''

in ''F'' and each curve

:''c'' : '''R''' &amp;rarr; ''X''

in ''C'', the following axioms are satisfied:

# ''f'' in ''F'' if and only if for each ''γ'' in ''C'', ''f'' . ''γ'' in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''', '''R''')
# ''c'' in ''C'' if and only if for each ''φ'' in ''F'', ''φ'' . ''c'' in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''R''', '''R''')

Let ''A'' and ''B'' be two Frölicher spaces. A map

:''m'' : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B''

is called ''smooth'' if for each smooth curve ''c'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''.''c'' is in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the space of all such smooth maps has itself the structure of a Frölicher space. The smooth functions on 
''
:''C&lt;sup&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'', ''B'')

are the images of
:&lt;math&gt;S : F_B \times C_A \times \mathrm{C}^{\infty}(\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{R})' \to \mathrm{Mor}(\mathrm{C}^{\infty}(A, B), \mathbf{R}) : (f, c, \lambda) \mapsto S(f, c, \lambda), \quad S(f, c, \lambda)(m) := \lambda(f \circ m \circ c)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2881">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[differential geometry]], the '''GJMS operators''' are a family of [[differential operator]]s, that are defined on a [[Riemannian manifold]].  In an appropriate sense, they depend only on the [[conformal structure]] of the manifold.  The GJMS operators generalize the [[Paneitz operator]] and the [[Laplace operators in differential geometry#Conformal Laplacian|conformal Laplacian]].  The initials GJMS are for its discoverers [[#CITEREFGrahamJenneMasonSparling1992|Graham, Jenne, Mason &amp;amp; Sparling (1992)]].

Properly, the GJMS operator on a conformal manifold of dimension ''n'' is a [[conformally invariant]] operator between the [[line bundle]] of [[density on a manifold|conformal densities]] of weight {{nowrap|''k'' &amp;minus; ''n''/2}} for ''k'' a positive integer
:&lt;math&gt;L_k : E[k-n/2] \to E[-k-n/2].&lt;/math&gt;
The operators have [[symbol of a differential operator|leading symbol]] given by a power of the [[Laplace&amp;ndash;Beltrami operator]], and have lower order correction terms that ensure conformal invariance.

The original construction of the GJMS operators used the [[ambient construction]] of [[Charles Fefferman]] and [[Robin Graham (mathematician)|Robin Graham]].  A conformal density defines, in a natural way, a function on the [[null cone]] in the ambient space.  The GJMS operator is defined by taking density ''&amp;fnof;'' of the appropriate weight {{nowrap|''k'' &amp;minus; ''n''/2}} and extending it arbitrarily to a function ''F'' off the null cone so that it still retains the same homogeneity.  The function Δ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''F'', where Δ is the ambient [[Laplace&amp;ndash;Beltrami operator]], is then homogeneous of degree  {{nowrap|&amp;minus;''k'' &amp;minus; ''n''/2}}, and its restriction to the null cone does not depend on how the original function ''&amp;fnof;'' was extended to begin with, and so is independent of choices. The GJMS operator also represents the obstruction term to a formal asymptotic solution of the [[Cauchy problem]] for extending a weight {{nowrap|''k'' &amp;minus; ''n''/2}} function off the null cone in the ambient space to a harmonic function in the full ambient space.

The most important GJMS operators are the ''critical'' GJMS operators.  In even dimension ''n'', these are the operators ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sub&gt; that take a true function on the manifold and produce a multiple of the [[volume form]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1618">A '''gigantic prime''' is a [[prime number]] with at least 10,000 decimal digits. 

The term appeared in ''[[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]]'' in the article "Collecting gigantic and titanic primes" (1992) by [[Samuel Yates]]. [[Chris Caldwell (mathematician)|Chris Caldwell]], who continued Yates' collection in [[Prime Pages|The Prime Pages]], reports that he changed the requirement from Yates' original 5,000 digits to 10,000 digits, when he was asked to revise the article after the death of Yates.&lt;ref&gt;http://primes.utm.edu/references/refs.cgi?long=Yates92b&lt;/ref&gt; Few primes of that size were known then, but a modern [[personal computer]] can find many in a day.

The first discovered gigantic prime was the [[Mersenne prime]] 2&lt;sup&gt;44497&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1. It has 13,395 digits and was found in 1979 by [[Harry L. Nelson]] and [[David Slowinski]].&lt;ref&gt;http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest gigantic prime is 10&lt;sup&gt;9999&lt;/sup&gt; + 33603. It was proved prime in 2003 by [[Jens Franke]], Thorsten Kleinjung and Tobias Wirth with their own distributed [[Elliptic curve primality proving|ECPP]] program. It was the largest ECPP proof at the time.

Harmonious coloring of the complete 7-ary tree with 3 levels using 12 colors. The harmonious chromatic number of this graph is 12 since 
Any fewer colors will result in a color pair appearing on more than one pair of adjacent vertices.  Moreover, by Mitchem's Formula, ''&amp;chi;''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(T&lt;sub&gt;7,3&lt;/sub&gt;) = &amp;lceil;(3/2)(7+1)&amp;rceil; = 12.]]

In [[graph theory]], a '''harmonious coloring''' is a [[Graph coloring|(proper) vertex coloring]] in which every pair of colors appears on at most one pair of adjacent vertices. The '''harmonious chromatic number''' χ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'') of a graph ''G'' is the minimum number of colors needed for any harmonious coloring of ''G''.

Every graph has a harmonious coloring, since it suffices to assign every vertex a distinct color; thus χ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'') ≤ |V(''G'')|. There trivially exist graphs ''G'' with χ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'') &gt; χ(''G'') (where χ is the [[chromatic number]]); one example is any path of length&gt;2, which can be 2-colored but has no harmonious coloring with 2 colors.

Some properties of χ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''G''):
# &lt;math&gt;\chi_{H}(T_{k,3}) = \left\lceil\frac{3(k+1)}{2}\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;, where T&lt;sub&gt;''k'',3&lt;/sub&gt; is the complete [[Glossary of graph theory#k-ary|{{mvar|k}}-ary]] tree with 3 levels. (Mitchem 1989)

Harmonious coloring was first proposed by Harary and Plantholt (1982).
Still very little is known about it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7113">In [[mathematics]], an '''indexed family''' is informally a collection of objects, each associated with an index from some index set. For example, a ''family of [[real number]]s, indexed by the set of [[integer]]s'' is a collection of real numbers, where a given function selects for each integer one real number (possibly the same).

More formally, an indexed family is a  [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] together with its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] ''X''. Often the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set ''X'' are referred to as making up the family. In this view indexed families are interpreted as collections instead of as functions. The set ''I'' is called the ''index (set)'' of the family, and ''X'' is the ''indexed set''.

==Mathematical statement==

'''Definition.''' Let ''I'' and ''X'' be sets and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a [[surjective function]], such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x\colon I &amp;\to X \\
 i &amp;\mapsto x_i = x(i),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then this establishes a '''family of elements in ''X'' indexed by ''I'' ''', which is denoted by (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; or simply (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), when the index set is assumed to be known. Sometimes angle brackets or braces are used instead of parentheses, the latter with the risk of mixing-up families with sets.

An indexed family can be turned into a set by considering the set &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{X} = \{ x_i : i \in I \} &lt;/math&gt;, that is, the image of ''I'' under ''x''. Since the mapping x is not required to be [[Injective function|injective]], there may exist &lt;math&gt;i,j \in I &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;| \mathcal{X}| \leq |I|,&lt;/math&gt; where |''A''| denotes the cardinality of the set ''A''.

The index set is not restricted to be countable, and, of course, a subset of a powerset may be indexed, resulting in an '''indexed family of sets'''. For the important differences in sets and families see below.

==Examples==

===Index notation===
Whenever [[index notation]] is used the indexed objects form a family. For example, consider the following sentence.
*The vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly independent. 
Here (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ {1, …, ''n''}&lt;/sub&gt; denotes a family of vectors. The ''i''-th vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; only makes sense with respect to this family, as sets are unordered and there is no ''i''-th vector of a set. Furthermore, [[linear independence]] is only defined as the property of a collection; it therefore is important if those vectors are linearly independent as a set or as a family. 

If we consider ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 2 and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (1, 0), the ''set'' of them consists of only one element and is linearly independent, but the family contains the same element twice and is linearly dependent.

===Matrices===
Suppose a text states the following:
*A square matrix ''A'' is invertible, [[if and only if]] the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent. 

As in the previous example it is important that the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent as a family, not as a set. For Example, consider the matrix
:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;
The ''set'' of rows only consists of a single element (1, 1) and is linearly independent, but the matrix is not invertible. The ''family'' of rows contains two elements and is linearly dependent. The statement is therefore correct if it refers to the family of rows, but wrong if it refers to the set of rows. (The statement is also correct when "the rows" is interpreted as referring to a [[multiset]], in which the elements are also kept distinct but which lacks some of the structure of an indexed family.)

== Functions, sets and families ==
[[Surjective]] [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and families are formally equivalent, as any function ''f'' with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' induces a family (''f''(''i''))&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;.  In practice, however, a family is viewed as a collection, not as a function: being ''an element of a family'' is equivalent with being in the range of the corresponding function. A family contains any element exactly once, [[if and only if]] the corresponding function is [[injective]]. 

Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], a family is a container and any set ''X'' gives rise to a family (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''x''∈''X''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus any set naturally becomes a family. For any family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; there is the set of all elements {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''i''∈''I''}, but this does not carry any information on multiple containment or the structure given by ''I''.  Hence, by using a set instead of the family, some information might be lost.

== Examples ==
Let '''n''' be the finite set {1, 2, …, ''n''}, where ''n'' is a positive [[integer]].
* An [[ordered pair]] is a family indexed by the two element set '''2'''&amp;nbsp;= {1, 2}.
* An [[tuple|''n-''tuple]] is a family indexed by '''n'''.
* An infinite [[sequence]] is a family indexed by the [[natural numbers]].
* A [[tuple|list]] is an ''n-''tuple for an unspecified ''n'', or an infinite sequence.
* An ''n''×''m'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a family indexed by the [[cartesian product]] '''n'''&amp;times;'''m'''.
* A [[net (mathematics)|net]] is a family indexed by a [[directed set]].

==Operations on families==

Index sets are often used in sums and other similar operations. For example, if (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a family of numbers, the sum of all those numbers is denoted by

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i\in I}a_i. &lt;/math&gt;

When (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[family of sets]], the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all those sets is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise for [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s and [[cartesian product]]s.

==Subfamily==

A family (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is a '''subfamily''' of a family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, [[if and only if]] ''J'' is a subset of ''I'' and for all ''i'' in ''J'' 
:''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

==Usage in category theory==
{{main|Diagram (category theory)}}

The analogous concept in [[category theory]] is called a '''[[diagram (category theory)|diagram]]'''. A diagram is a [[functor]] giving rise to an indexed family of objects in a [[category theory|category]] '''''C''''', indexed by another category '''''J''''', and related by [[morphism]]s depending on two indices.

'''Rewriting Techniques and Applications''' ('''RTA''') is an annual international [[academic conference]] on the topic of [[rewriting]]. It covers all aspects of rewriting, including [[termination proof|termination]], [[equational reasoning]], [[theorem proving]], [[higher-order rewriting]], [[unification (computing)|unification]] and the [[lambda calculus]]. The conference consists of peer-reviewed papers with the proceedings published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] in the [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science|LNCS]] series until 2009, and since then in the [[LIPIcs]] series published by the Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik. Several rewriting-related workshops are also affiliated with RTA.

The first RTA was held in [[Dijon]], [[France]] in September 1983. RTA takes part in the federated conferences [[Federated Logic Conference|Federated Logic Conference (FLoC)]], and [[Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming (RDP)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3007">In [[mathematical economics]], an '''isoelastic function''', sometimes '''constant elasticity function''', is a function that exhibits a constant [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]], i.e. has a constant [[Elasticity Coefficient|elasticity coefficient]]. The elasticity is the ratio of the percentage change in the [[dependent variable]] to the percentage causative change in the [[independent variable]], in the limit as the changes approach zero in magnitude. 

For an elasticity coefficient &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (which can take on any real value), the function's general form is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = {k x^r},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are constants. The elasticity is by definition

:&lt;math&gt;\text {elasticity} = \frac {d f(x)}{dx} \frac {x}{f(x)} = \frac {d \text{ln} f(x)}{d \text{ln} x},&lt;/math&gt;

which for this function simply equals ''r''.

==Examples==

===Demand functions===

An example in [[microeconomics]] is the constant elasticity [[demand curve|demand function]], in which ''p'' is the price of a product and ''D''(''p'') is the resulting quantity demanded by consumers. For most goods the elasticity ''r'' (the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price) is negative, so it can be convenient to write the constant elasticity demand function with a negative sign on the exponent, in order for the coefficient &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to take on a positive value:
:&lt;math&gt;
D(p) = {k p^{-r}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is now interpreted as the unsigned magnitude of the responsiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Carl P. |last2=Blume |first2=Lawrence |title=Mathematics for Economists |location=New York |publisher=Norton |year=1994 |page=67 |isbn=0393957330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility functions in the presence of risk===

The constant elasticity function is also used in the theory of choice under [[risk aversion]], which usually assumes that risk-averse decision-makers maximize the expected value of a [[Concave function|concave]] [[von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function]]. In this context, with a [[Isoelastic utility|constant elasticity of utility]] with respect to, say, wealth, optimal decisions on such things as shares of [[Stock market|stocks]] in a [[Modern portfolio theory|portfolio]] are independent of the scale of the decision-maker's wealth. The constant elasticity utility function in this context is generally written as

:&lt;math&gt;U(x) = \frac{1}{1 - \gamma}x^{1 - \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is wealth and &lt;math&gt;1 - \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the elasticity, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; ≠ 1 referred to as the constant coefficient of relative risk aversion (with risk aversion approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; → ∞).

  Knuth D.E. (1969) ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]. v.2.'' Addison-Wesley Publ.Co., 724 pp.
&lt;/ref&gt; It reduces the multiplication of two ''n''-digit numbers to at most &lt;math&gt; n^{\log_23}\approx n^{1.585}&lt;/math&gt; single-digit multiplications in general (and exactly &lt;math&gt;n^{\log_23}&lt;/math&gt; when ''n'' is a power of 2). It is therefore faster than the [[long multiplication|classical]] algorithm, which requires ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; single-digit products. For example, the Karatsuba algorithm requires 3&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 59,049 single-digit multiplications to multiply two 1024-digit numbers (''n'' = 1024 = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the classical algorithm requires (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,048,576 (a speedup of 17.75 times).

The Karatsuba algorithm was the first multiplication algorithm asymptotically faster than the quadratic "grade school" algorithm.
The [[Toom–Cook multiplication|Toom–Cook algorithm]] is a faster generalization of Karatsuba's method, and the [[Schönhage–Strassen algorithm]] is even faster, for sufficiently large ''n''.

==History==
The standard procedure for multiplication of two ''n''-digit numbers requires a number of elementary operations proportional to &lt;math&gt;n^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in [[big-O notation]]. [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] conjectured that the classical algorithm was ''[[asymptotically optimal]],'' meaning that any algorithm for that task would require &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; elementary operations.

In 1960, Kolmogorov organized a seminar on mathematical problems in [[cybernetics]] at the [[Moscow State University]], where he stated the &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; conjecture and other problems in the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of computation]]. Within a week, Karatsuba, then a 23-year-old student, found an algorithm (later it was called "divide and conquer") that multiplies two ''n''-digit numbers in &lt;math&gt;O(n^{\log_2 3})&lt;/math&gt; elementary steps, thus disproving the conjecture. Kolmogorov was very agitated about the discovery; he communicated it at the next meeting of the seminar, which was then terminated. Kolmogorov did some lectures on the Karatsuba result at the conferences all over the world (see, for example, "Proceedings of the international congress of mathematicians 1962", pp.&amp;nbsp;351–356, and also
"6 Lectures delivered at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm, 1962") and published the method in 1962, in the [[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]. The article had been written by Kolmogorov and contained two results on multiplication, Karatsuba's algorithm and a separate result by [[Yuri Petrovich Ofman|Yuri Ofman]]; it listed "A. Karatsuba and Yu. Ofman" as the authors. Karatsuba only became aware of the paper when he received the reprints from the publisher.&lt;ref name="kara1995"/&gt;

==Algorithm==

===Basic step===
The basic step of Karatsuba's algorithm is a formula that allows one to compute the product of two large numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; using three multiplications of smaller numbers, each with about half as many digits as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, plus some additions and digit shifts. This basic step is, in fact, a generalization of [[Multiplication algorithm#Complex multiplication algorithm|Gauss's complex multiplication algorithm]], where the [[imaginary unit]] {{mvar|i}} is replaced by a power of the [[radix|base]].

Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be represented as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-digit strings in some base &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. For any positive integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, one can write the two given numbers as

:&lt;math&gt;x = x_1 B^m + x_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = y_1 B^m + y_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; are less than &lt;math&gt;B^m&lt;/math&gt;. The product is then

:&lt;math&gt;xy = (x_1 B^m + x_0)(y_1 B^m + y_0),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;xy = z_2 B^{2m} + z_1 B^m + z_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;z_2 = x_1 y_1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = x_1 y_0 + x_0 y_1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_0 = x_0 y_0.&lt;/math&gt;

These formulae require four multiplications and were known to [[Charles Babbage]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Babbage, Chapter VIII – Of the Analytical Engine, Larger Numbers Treated, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fa1JAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA125 Passages from the Life of a Philosopher], Longman Green, London, 1864; page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Karatsuba observed that &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; can be computed in only three multiplications, at the cost of a few extra additions.  With &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt; as before one can calculate

:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = (x_1 + x_0)(y_1 + y_0) - z_2 - z_0,&lt;/math&gt;

which holds, since

:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = x_1 y_0 + x_0 y_1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = (x_1 + x_0)(y_1 + y_0) - x_1 y_1 - x_0 y_0.&lt;/math&gt;

An issue that occurs, however, when computing &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; is that the above computation of &lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_1 + y_0)&lt;/math&gt; may result in overflow (will produce a result in the range &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \text{result} &lt; 2 B^m&lt;/math&gt;), which require a multiplier having one extra bit.  This can be avoided by noting that

:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = (x_1 + x_0)(y_1 + y_0) - x_1 y_1 - x_0 y_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = (x_1 y_1 + x_1 y_0 + x_0 y_1 + x_0 y_0) - x_1 y_1 - x_0 y_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = (-x_1 y_1 + x_1 y_0 + x_0 y_1 - x_0 y_0) + x_1 y_1 + x_0 y_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = -(x_1 y_1 - x_1 y_0 - x_0 y_1 + x_0 y_0) + x_1 y_1 + x_0 y_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = -(x_1 - x_0)(y_1 - y_0) + x_1 y_1 + x_0 y_0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = (x_0 - x_1)(y_1 - y_0) + x_1 y_1 + x_0 y_0.&lt;/math&gt;

This computation of &lt;math&gt;(x_0 - x_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_1 - y_0)&lt;/math&gt; will produce a result in the range of &lt;math&gt;-B^m &lt; \text{result} &lt; B^m&lt;/math&gt;.  This method may produce negative numbers, which require one extra bit to encode signedness, and would still require one extra bit for the multiplier.  However, one way to avoid this is to record the sign and then use the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;(x_0 - x_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_1 - y_0)&lt;/math&gt; to perform an unsigned multiplication, after which the result may be negated when both signs originally differed.  Another advantage is that even though &lt;math&gt;(x_0 - x_1)(y_1 - y_0)&lt;/math&gt; may be negative, the final computation of &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; only involve additions.

===Example===
To compute the product of 12345 and 6789, where ''B'' = 10, choose ''m'' = 3. Then we decompose the input operands using the resulting base (''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''1000''), as:
: 12345 = '''12''' · ''1000'' + '''345'''
:  6789 =  '''6''' · ''1000'' + '''789'''

Only three multiplications, which operate on smaller integers, are used to compute three partial results:
: ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''12''' '''×''' '''6''' = 72
: ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = '''345''' '''×''' '''789''' = 272205
: ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ('''12''' + '''345''') '''×''' ('''6''' + '''789''') − ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 357 '''×''' 795 − 72 − 272205 = 283815 − 72 − 272205 = 11538

We get the result by just adding these three partial results, shifted accordingly (and then taking carries into account by decomposing these three inputs in base ''1000'' like for the input operands):
: result = ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · (''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; · (''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; · (''B''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''0''&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e.
: result = 72 · ''1000''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 11538 · ''1000'' + 272205 = '''83810205'''.

Note that the intermediate third multiplication operates on an input domain which is less than two times larger than for the two first multiplications, its output domain is less than four times larger, and base-''1000'' carries computed from the first two multiplications must be taken into account when computing these two subtractions.

===Recursive application===
If ''n'' is four or more, the three multiplications in Karatsuba's basic step involve operands with fewer than ''n'' digits. Therefore, those products can be computed by [[recursion|recursive]] calls of the Karatsuba algorithm. The recursion can be applied until the numbers are so small that they can (or must) be computed directly.

In a computer with a full 32-bit by 32-bit [[Binary multiplier|multiplier]], for example, one could choose ''B'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|2,147,483,648}}, and store each digit as a separate 32-bit binary word. Then the sums ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will not need an extra binary word for storing the carry-over digit (as in [[carry-save adder]]), and the Karatsuba recursion can be applied until the numbers to multiply are only one-digit long.

===Asymmetric Karatsuba-like formulae===
Karatsuba's original formula and other generalizations are themselves symmetric. For example, 
the following formula computes 
:&lt;math&gt;c(x)=c_4x^4+c_3x^3+c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0=a(x)b(x)=(a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0)(b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0)&lt;/math&gt;
with 6 multiplications in &lt;math&gt;{\text{GF}}(2)[x]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{\text{GF}}(2)&lt;/math&gt; is the Galois field with two elements 0 and 1.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left\{ {
\begin{array}{l}
c_0 = p_0,		\\
c_1 = p_{012} + p_{02} + p_{12} + p_2,		\\
c_2 = p_{012} + p_{01} + p_{12},			\\
c_3 = p_{012} + p_{01} + p_{02} + p_0,		\\
c_4 = p_2,
\end{array}
}\right.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p_{i}=a_ib_i, \ \ p_{ij}=(a_i+a_j)(b_i+b_j)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{ijk}=(a_i+a_j+a_k)(b_i+b_j+b_k)&lt;/math&gt;.
We note that addition and subtraction are the same in fields of characteristic 2.

This formula is symmetrical, namely, it does not change if we exchange &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;p_i, \ \  p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt;.

Based on the second [[Euclidean division|Generalized division algorithms]]
,&lt;ref&gt;Haining Fan, Ming Gu, Jiaguang Sun, Kwok-Yan Lam,"Obtaining More Karatsuba-Like Formulae over the Binary 
Field", IET Information security Vol. 6 No. 1 pp. 14-19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Fan et al. found the following asymmetric formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left\{ {
\begin{array}{l}
c_{0}=p_{0} \\ 
c_{1}=p_{012}+p_{2}+m_{4}+m_{5} \\ 
c_{2}=p_{012}+m_{3}+m_{5} \\ 
c_{3}=p_{012}+p_{0}+m_{3}+m_{4} \\ 
c_{4}=p_{2},
\end{array}
}\right.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
&lt;math&gt;m_{3}=(a_{1}+a_{2})(b_{0}+b_{2}), \ \ m_{4}=(a_{0}+a_{1})(b_{1}+b_{2})&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;m_{5}=(a_{0}+a_{2})(b_{0}+b_{1})&lt;/math&gt;.

It is asymmetric because we can obtain the following new formula by exchanging &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in 
&lt;math&gt;m_{3}, \ \  m_{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{5}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left\{ {
\begin{array}{l}
c_{0}=p_{0} \\ 
c_{1}=p_{012}+p_{2}+m_{4}+m_{5} \\ 
c_{2}=p_{012}+m_{3}+m_{5} \\ 
c_{3}=p_{012}+p_{0}+m_{3}+m_{4} \\ 
c_{4}=p_{2},
\end{array}
}\right.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
&lt;math&gt;m_{3}=(a_{0}+a_{2})(b_{1}+b_{2}), \ \ m_{4}=(a_{1}+a_{2})(b_{0}+b_{1})&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;m_{5}=(a_{0}+a_{1})(b_{0}+b_{2})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Efficiency analysis==
Karatsuba's basic step works for any base ''B'' and any ''m'', but the recursive algorithm is most efficient when ''m'' is equal to ''n''/2, rounded up. In particular, if ''n'' is 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, for some integer ''k'', and the recursion stops only when ''n'' is 1, then the number of single-digit multiplications is 3&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''c'' = log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;3.

Since one can extend any inputs with zero digits until their length is a power of two, it follows that the number of elementary multiplications, for any ''n'', is at most &lt;math&gt;3^{ \lceil\log_2 n \rceil} \leq 3 n^{\log_2 3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the additions, subtractions, and digit shifts (multiplications by powers of ''B'') in Karatsuba's basic step take time proportional to ''n'', their cost becomes negligible as ''n'' increases. More precisely, if ''t''(''n'') denotes the total number of elementary operations that the algorithm performs when multiplying two ''n''-digit numbers, then

:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = 3 T(\lceil n/2\rceil) + cn + d&lt;/math&gt;

for some constants ''c'' and ''d''. For this [[recurrence relation]], the [[master theorem (analysis of algorithms)|master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences]] gives the [[big O notation|asymptotic]] bound &lt;math&gt;T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_2 3})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows that, for sufficiently large ''n'', Karatsuba's algorithm will perform fewer shifts and single-digit additions than longhand multiplication, even though its basic step uses more additions and shifts than the straightforward formula. For small values of ''n'', however, the extra shift and add operations may make it run slower than the longhand method. The point of positive return depends on the [[computer platform]] and context. As a rule of thumb, Karatsuba's method is usually faster when the multiplicands are longer than 320–640 bits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmplib.org/manual/Karatsuba-Multiplication.html][http://www.cburch.com/proj/karat/comment1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudocode==
&lt;pre&gt;
procedure karatsuba(num1, num2)
  if (num1 &lt; 10) or (num2 &lt; 10)
    return num1*num2
  /* calculates the size of the numbers */
  m = min(size_base10(num1), size_base10(num2))
  m2 = floor(m/2)
  /* split the digit sequences in the middle */
  high1, low1 = split_at(num1, m2)
  high2, low2 = split_at(num2, m2)
  /* 3 calls made to numbers approximately half the size */
  z0 = karatsuba(low1, low2)
  z1 = karatsuba((low1 + high1), (low2 + high2))
  z2 = karatsuba(high1, high2)
  return (z2 * 10 ^ (m2 * 2)) + ((z1 - z2 - z0) * 10 ^ m2) + z0
&lt;/pre&gt;

In practice, the choice of the optimal base case is machine specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Weiss |first= Mark A. |date= 2005 |title= Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ |location= |publisher= Addison-Wesley|page= 480|isbn= 0321375319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurt Leichtweiss''' (March 2, 1927 in [[Villingen-Schwenningen|Villingen]], [[Republic of Baden|Baden]] – June 23, 2013) was a [[mathematician]] specializing in [[convex geometry|convex]] and [[differential geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuttgart-gedenkt.de/Traueranzeige/Kurt-Leichtweiss|title=obituary|date=June 29, 2013|publisher=[[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]|language=German|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;&lt;ref name="UniStuttgart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hkom/publikationen/uni-kurier/uk99/leute/lt105b.html|title=Kurt Leichtweiß 80|last=Hermann Hähl, Eberhard Teufel|date=2007-06-30|publisher=[[University of Stuttgart]]|language=German|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leichtweiss was born in [[Villingen-Schwenningen]].  In 1944, while still in high school he traveled to the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach|Mathematical Institute]] where his mathematical interests were encouraged.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;A.

He was a student of [[Emanuel Sperner]] and [[Wilhelm Süss]].  He was then a lecturer in Freiburg and in 1963 became a professor at [[TU Berlin]]. From 1970 until his retirement in 1995, he was a professor at the [[University of Stuttgart]].

Then the tuple &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal A) &lt;/math&gt; is called a measurable space.&lt;ref name="Klenke18" /&gt;

Note that in contrast to a [[measure space]], no [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] is needed for a measurable space.

== Example ==
Look at the set
:&lt;math&gt; X= \{1,2,3\}. &lt;/math&gt;
One possible &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-Algebra would be
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal A_1=\{X, \emptyset\}. &lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt; (X,\mathcal A_1) &lt;/math&gt; is a measurable space. Another possible &lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra would be the [[power set]] on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal A_2= \mathcal P(X). &lt;/math&gt;
With this, a second measurable space on the set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is given by  &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal A_2) &lt;/math&gt;.

== Common measurable spaces ==
If &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is finite or countable infinite, the &lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is most of the times the [[power set]] on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A= \mathcal P(X) &lt;/math&gt;. This leads to the measurable space &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal P(X)) &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological space]], the &lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is most commonly the [[Borel sigma algebra|Borel &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal B &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A= \mathcal B(X) &lt;/math&gt;. This leads to the measurable space &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal B(X)) &lt;/math&gt; that is common for all topological spaces such as the real numbers &lt;math&gt; \R &lt;/math&gt;.

== Ambiguity with Borel spaces ==
The term Borel space is used for different types of measurable spaces. It can refer to
* any measurable space, so it is a synonym for a measurable space as defined above &lt;ref name="eommeasurablespace" /&gt;
* a measurable space that is [[Borel isomorphism|Borel isomorphic]] to a measurable subset of the real numbers (again with the Borel &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra)&lt;ref name="Kallenberg15" /&gt;

In [[probability theory]], the '''method of moments''' is a way of proving [[convergence in distribution]] by proving convergence of a sequence of [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prokhorov|first=A.V.|chapter=Moments, method of (in probability theory)|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics (online)|isbn=1-4020-0609-8|url=http://eom.springer.de/m/m064610.htm|mr=1375697|editor=M. Hazewinkel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suppose ''X'' is a [[random variable]] and that all of the moments

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(X^k)\,&lt;/math&gt;

exist.  Further suppose the [[probability distribution]] of ''X'' is completely determined by its moments, i.e., there is no other probability distribution with the same sequence of moments
(cf. the [[problem of moments]]).  If

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{E}(X_n^k) = \operatorname{E}(X^k)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all values of ''k'', then the sequence {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} converges to ''X'' in distribution.

The method of moments was introduced by [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]] for proving the [[central limit theorem]]; Chebyshev cited earlier contributions by [[Irénée-Jules Bienaymé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|mr=2743162|last=Fischer|first=H.|title=A history of the central limit theorem.

Chebyshev's and Markov's Contributions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been applied by [[Eugene Wigner]] to prove [[Wigner's semicircle law]], and has since found numerous applications in the [[random matrix theory|theory of random matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=G.W.|last2=Guionnet|first2=A.|last3=Zeitouni|first3=O.|title=An introduction to random matrices.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-19452-5|chapter=2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4232">[[File:Diaorifa.GIF|thumb|right|Fractional approximations to [[pi|{{pi}}]].]]

The name '''Milü''' ({{zh|c=密率|p=mì lǜ}}; "close ratio"), also known as '''Zulü''' ([[Zu Chongzhi|Zu]]'s ratio), is given to an approximation to [[pi|{{pi}}]] (pi) found by Chinese mathematician and [[Chinese astronomy|astronomer]], [[Zu Chongzhi|Zǔ Chōngzhī (祖沖之)]]. Using [[Liu Hui's π algorithm#Later developments|Liu Hui's algorithm]] (which is based on the areas of regular polygons approximating a circle), Zu famously computed {{pi}} to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927 and gave two rational approximations of {{pi}}, {{sfrac|22|7}} and {{sfrac|355|113}}, naming them respectively Yuelü 约率 (approximate ratio) and Milü.

{{sfrac|355|113}} is the best [[rational number|rational]] approximation of {{pi}} with a denominator of four digits or fewer, being accurate to 6 decimal places. It is within 0.000009% of the value of {{pi}}, or in terms of common fractions overestimates {{pi}} by less than {{sfrac|1|{{val|3748629}}}}. The next rational number (ordered by size of denominator) that is a better rational approximation of {{pi}} is {{sfrac|{{val|52163}}|{{val|16604}}}}, still only correct to 6 decimal places and hardly closer to {{pi}} than {{sfrac|355|113}}. To be accurate to 7 decimal places, one needs to go as far as {{sfrac|{{val|86953}}|{{val|27678}}}}. For 8, we need {{sfrac|{{val|102928}}|{{val|32763}}}}.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\pi &amp; \approx 3.141\ 592\ 653\ 5\dots \\
\\
\frac{355}{113} &amp; \approx 3.141\ 592\ 920\ 3\dots \\
\\
\frac{52163}{16604} &amp; \approx 3.141\ 592\ 387\ 4\dots \\
\\
\frac{86953}{27678} &amp; \approx 3.141\ 592\ 600\ 6\dots\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The accuracy of Milü to the true value of {{Pi}} can be explained using the [[Continued fraction#Continued fraction expansions of .CF.80|continued fraction expansion of {{Pi}}]], the first few terms of which are &lt;math&gt;[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, ...]&lt;/math&gt;. A property of continued fractions is that truncating the expansion of a given number at any point will give the "[[Continued fraction#Best rational approximations|best rational approximation]]" to the number. To obtain Milü, truncate the continued fraction expansion of {{Pi}} immediately before the term 292; that is, {{Pi}} is approximated by the finite continued fraction &lt;math&gt;[3; 7, 15, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to Milü. Since 292 is an unusually large term in a continued fraction expansion, this convergent will be very close to the true value of {{Pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiContinuedFraction.html|title=Pi Continued Fraction|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An easy [[mnemonic]] helps memorize this useful fraction by writing down each of the first three [[odd numbers]] twice: 1 1 3 3 5 5, then dividing the decimal number represented by the last 3 digits by the decimal number given by the first three digits. Alternatively, {{sfrac|1|{{pi}}}} ≈ {{sfrac|113|355}}.

Zu's contemporary calendarist and mathematician [[He Chengtian]] ([[:zh:何承天_(南朝)|何承天]]) invented a fraction interpolation method called "harmonization of the divisor of the day" to obtain a closer approximation by iteratively adding the numerators and denominators of a "weak" fraction and a "strong" fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martzloff|first=Jean-Claude|title=A History of Chinese Mathematics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zu Chongzhi]]'s approximation {{pi}} ≈ {{sfrac|355|113}} can be obtained with He Chengtian's method.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Wenjun ed Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics vol 4 p125&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petr Vopěnka''' (16 May 1935 – 20 March 2015) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] [[mathematician]]. In the early seventies, he developed [[alternative set theory]] (i.e. alternative to the classical Cantor theory), which he subsequently developed in a series of articles and monographs.  Vopěnka’s name is associated with many mathematical achievements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vize.cz/download/laureat-Petr-Vopenka-en-bio.pdf |title=Petr Vopěnka Biography |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929182536/http://www.vize.cz/download/laureat-Petr-Vopenka-en-bio.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Antonín Sochor | year = 2001 | title = Petr Vopěnka (born 16. 5. 1935) | journal = Ann.

Since the mid-eighties he concerned himself with philosophical questions of mathematics (particularly vis-à-vis [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]ian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]).

Vopěnka served as the Minister of Education of the [[Czech Republic]] (then part of [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic|Czechoslovakia]]) from 1990 to 1992 within the government of [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Petr Pithart]].&lt;ref name=pdm&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Czech mathematician, former minister Petr Vopěnka dies |url=http://www.adn.com/article/20150306/yupik-cultural-leader-paul-john-toksook-bay-dead-85 |work=[[Prague Daily Monitor]] |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Petr Vopěnka grew up in small town of [[Dolní Kralovice]]. After finishing [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Ledeč nad Sázavou]] in 1953 he went to study mathematics at the Mathematics and Physics Faculty of [[Charles University in Prague]], graduating in 1958. In 1962 he was made [[Candidate of Sciences]] (CSc) and in 1967 [[Doctor of Science]] (DrSc). His advisors were [[Eduard Čech]] and [[Ladislav Rieger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=64314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1958 Vopěnka taught at the Mathematics and Physics Faculty, since 1964 as lecturer, since 1965 as senior lecturer. In 1968 he was made [[professor]] but was prevented to take this title until 1990 due to political reasons. Between 1966 and 69 Vopěnka served as Vice Dean of the faculty.

In 1967 Vopěnka became head of the newly established Department of Mathematical Logic. The department was abolished in 1970 and Vopěnka, though allowed to stay at the university, fell into disfavour with the regime which limited his contacts with foreign mathematicians.  During the 1970s and 1980s he concentrated on philosophy and history of mathematics and on phenomenology of infinity.

After the [[Velvet Revolution]], in January 1990, Vopěnka became Deputy Rector of the Charles University. Between June 1990 - July 1992 he served as Minister of Education of the Czech Republic (then part of Czechoslovakia). In this position he, without much of success and facing protests from the teachers, attempted to institute school reforms.

In 1992 the Department of Mathematical Logic was reopened and Vopěnka became its head. In 2000 he retired from the Charles University and the department was closed. Until 2009 Vopěnka worked as a professor at the [[Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem]], in the Department of Mathematics of the Faculty of Science.

Petr Vopěnka also participated in translation and publishing of early mathematical texts (such as works of [[Euclid]] and [[Al-Khwarezmi]]) into Czech language and then he worked at the Department of Philosophy and Department of Interdisciplinary Activities, [[University of West Bohemia]] in Pilsen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8512">'''Phase retrieval''' is the process of [[algorithm]]ically finding solutions to the [[phase problem]]. Given a complex signal &lt;math&gt;F(k)&lt;/math&gt;, of amplitude &lt;math&gt;|F (k)| &lt;/math&gt;, and phase &lt;math&gt;\psi(k)&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;F(k) = |F(k)|e^{i \psi(k)} =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\ e^{- 2\pi i k \cdot x}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is an ''M''-dimensional spatial coordinate and ''k'' is an ''M''-dimensional spatial frequency coordinate, phase retrieval consists in finding the phase that for a measured amplitude satisfies a set of constraints. Important applications of phase retrieval include [[X-ray crystallography]], [[transmission electron microscopy]] and [[coherent diffractive imaging]], for which &lt;math&gt; M = 2&lt;/math&gt;. (Fienup 1982:2759) Uniqueness theorems for both 1-D and 2-D cases of the phase retrieval problem, including the phaseless 1-D inverse scattering problem, were proved by Klibanov and his collaborators (see References).

== Methods ==

=== Error reduction algorithm ===
[[File:GS-diagram.png|thumb|right|400px|Schematic view of the error reduction algorithm for phase retrieval]]
The error reduction is a generalisation of the [[Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm]]. It solves for &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; from measurements of &lt;math&gt; |F(x)| &lt;/math&gt;. It uses iteration of a four-step process. For the  &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;'th iteration the steps are as follows:

Step (1): &lt;math&gt; G_k(u) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \phi_k &lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; g_k(x) &lt;/math&gt; are estimates of, respectively, &lt;math&gt; F(u) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;.  In the first step &lt;math&gt; g_k(x) &lt;/math&gt; undergoes [[Fourier transformation]]:

::&lt;math&gt;
G_k(u) = |G_k(u)|e^{i \phi_k(u)} = \mathcal{F} (g_k (x))
&lt;/math&gt;

Step (2): The experimental value of &lt;math&gt; |F(u)| &lt;/math&gt;, calculated from the diffraction pattern via the signal equation, is then substituted for &lt;math&gt; |G_k(u)| &lt;/math&gt;, giving an estimate of the Fourier transformation:

::&lt;math&gt;
G'_k(u) = |F(u)|e^{i \phi_k(u)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the ' denotes that the object is temporary, for further calculations.

Step (3): the estimate of the Fourier transformation &lt;math&gt; G'_k(u) &lt;/math&gt; is inverse Fourier transformed:

::&lt;math&gt;
g'_k(x) =|g'_k(x)|e^{i \theta'_k(x)} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(G'_k (u))
&lt;/math&gt;

Step (4):  &lt;math&gt; g'_k (x) &lt;/math&gt; then must be changed so that the new estimate of the object, &lt;math&gt; g_{k+1} (x) &lt;/math&gt; satisfies the object constraints. &lt;math&gt; g_{k+1} (x) &lt;/math&gt; is therefore defined piecewise as:
::&lt;math&gt;
g_{k+1} (x) \equiv \begin{cases}
    g'_k(x) &amp; x \notin \gamma \\
  0 &amp; x \in \gamma
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the domain in which &lt;math&gt; g'_k (x) &lt;/math&gt; does not satisfy the object constraints. A new estimate &lt;math&gt; g_{k+1} (x) &lt;/math&gt; is obtained and the four step process can be repeated iteratively.

This process is continued until both the Fourier constraint and object constraint are satisfied. Theoretically, the process will always lead to a [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] (Fienup 1982:2761), but the large number of iterations needed to produce a satisfactory image (generally &gt;2000) results in the error-reduction algorithm being unsuitably inefficient for sole use in practical applications.

=== Hybrid input-output algorithm ===

{{Main|Hybrid input output (HIO) algorithm for phase retrieval}}

The hybrid input-output algorithm is a modification of the error-reduction algorithm - the first three stages are identical. However, &lt;math&gt; g_k(x) &lt;/math&gt; no longer acts as an estimate of &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, but the input function corresponding to the output function &lt;math&gt; g'_k (x) &lt;/math&gt;, which is an estimate of &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; (Fienup 1982:2762). In the fourth step, when the function &lt;math&gt; g'_k (x) &lt;/math&gt; violates the object constraints, the value of  &lt;math&gt; g_{k+1}(x) &lt;/math&gt; is forced towards zero, but optimally not to zero. The chief advantage of the hybrid input-output algorithm is that the function &lt;math&gt; g_k(x) &lt;/math&gt; contains [[feedback|feedback information]] concerning previous iterations, reducing the probability of stagnation.

::&lt;math&gt;
g_{k+1} (x) \equiv \begin{cases}
  g'_k(x) &amp; x \notin \gamma \\
  g_k (x) - \beta{g'_k(x)} &amp; x \in \gamma
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a feedback parameter which can take a value between 0 and 1. For most applications, &lt;math&gt; \beta \approx 0.9 &lt;/math&gt; gives optimal results.

=== Shrinkwrap ===
For a two dimensional phase retrieval problem, there is a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degeneracy of solutions]] as &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; and its conjugate &lt;math&gt; f^*(-x) &lt;/math&gt; have the same Fourier modulus. This leads to "image twinning" in which the phase retrieval algorithm stagnates producing an image with features of both the object and its [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] (Fienup and Wackerman, 1986:1900). The shrinkwrap technique periodically updates the estimate of the support by low-pass filtering the current estimate of the object amplitude (by convolution with a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]]) and applying a threshold, leading to a reduction in the image ambiguity (Marchesini et al., 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5483">In [[mathematics]], the set of '''positive real numbers''', &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0} = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x &gt; 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;, is the subset of those [[real number]]s that are greater than zero. The '''non-negative real numbers''', &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \geq 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;, also include zero. The symbols &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{+}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; are ambiguously used for either of these, so it safer to always specify which.

In a [[complex plane]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; is identified with the '''positive real axis''' and is usually drawn as a horizontal [[ray (geometry)|ray]]. This ray is used as reference in the [[complex number#Polar form|polar form of a complex number]]. The real positive axis corresponds to [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;z = |z| \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; with [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
The non-negative reals serve as the [[range (mathematics)|range]] for [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]s, [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s, and [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s in mathematics.

==Properties==
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition, multiplication, and division. It inherits a [[topology]] from the [[real line]] and, thus, has the structure of a multiplicative [[topological group]] or of an additive [[topological semigroup]]. Including 0, the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[semiring]] structure (0 is the additive identity), known as the [[probability semiring]]; taking logarithms (with a choice of base giving a [[logarithmic unit]]) gives an [[isomorphism]] with the [[log semiring]] (with 0 corresponding to −∞), and its units (the finite numbers, excluding −∞) correspond to the positive real numbers.

For a given positive real number ''x'', the [[sequence]] {''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;} of its integral powers has three different fates: When ''x'' ∈ (0, 1) the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] is zero and when ''x'' ∈ (1, ∞) the limit is infinity, while the sequence is constant for ''x'' = 1. The case ''x'' &gt; 1 thus leads to an [[unbounded set|unbounded sequence]].

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0} = (0,1) \cup \{ 1 \} \cup (1,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and the [[multiplicative inverse]] function exchanges the intervals. The functions [[floor function|floor]], &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{floor} : [ 1 , \infty ) \to \mathbb{N},\, x \mapsto \lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, and [[sawtooth function|excess]], &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{excess} : [ 1 , \infty ) \to (0,1),\, x \mapsto x - \lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;, have been used to describe an element &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; as a [[continued fraction]] &lt;math&gt;[ n_0; n_1, n_2, \ldots]&lt;/math&gt; which is a sequence of integers obtained from the floor function after the excess has been reciprocated. For &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; the sequence terminates with an exact fractional expression of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and for [[quadratic irrational]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the sequence becomes a [[periodic continued fraction]].

In the study of [[classical group]]s, for every &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[determinant]] gives a map from {{tmath|n \times n}} matrices over the reals to the real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}(n, \mathbf{R}) \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt; Restricting to invertible matrices gives a map from the [[general linear group]] to non-zero real numbers: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R}) \to \mathbf{R}^\times&lt;/math&gt;. Restricting to matrices with a positive determinant gives the map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}^+(n, \mathbf{R}) \to \mathbf{R}_{&gt; 0}&lt;/math&gt;; interpreting the image as a [[quotient group]] by the [[normal subgroup]] relation {{math|[[SL(n,R)|SL(''n'',ℝ)]]&amp;nbsp;◁&amp;nbsp;GL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'',ℝ)}} expresses the positive reals as a [[Lie group]].

==Logarithmic measure==
If &lt;math&gt;[a,b] \subseteq \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], then &lt;math&gt;\mu([a,b]) = \log(b / a) = \log 
b - \log a&lt;/math&gt; determines a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on certain subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the [[pullback]] of the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on the real numbers under the logarithm: it is the length on the [[logarithmic scale]]. In fact, it is an [[invariant measure]] with respect to multiplication &lt;math&gt;[a,b] \to [az,bz]&lt;/math&gt; by a &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;, just as the Lebesgue measure is invariant under addition. In the context of topological groups, this measure is an example of a [[Haar measure]].

The utility of this measure is shown in its use for describing [[stellar magnitude]]s and noise levels in [[decibel]]s, among other applications of the [[logarithmic scale]]. For purposes of international standards [[ISO 80000-3]] the dimensionless quantities are referred to as [[level (logarithmic quantity)|levels]].

{{unreferenced|date=August 2012}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''''q''-theta function''' is a type of [[q-series|''q''-series]]. It is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta(z;q)=\prod_{n=0}^\infty (1-q^nz)\left(1-q^{n+1}/z\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where one takes 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;|''q''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.  It obeys the identities

:&lt;math&gt;\theta(z;q)=\theta\left(\frac{q}{z};q\right)=-z\theta\left(\frac{1}{z};q\right). &lt;/math&gt;

It may also be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta(z;q)=(z;q)_\infty (q/z;q)_\infty&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(\cdot  \cdot )_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the [[q-Pochhammer symbol]].

[[File:Mallet miniature map France 1687.jpg|thumb|350px|A 17th-century map of France (1687), by [[Alain Manesson-Mallet]], shows the ''Septentrion'' atop of the chart, indicating the northern region of the country; the other regions indicated are the Occident (west), the Orient (east), and the Midy (south).]]
{{wiktionary|septentrional|septentrion}}
'''Septentrional''', meaning "of the [[north]]", is a word rarely used in [[English language|English]], but is commonly used in [[Latin language|Latin]] and in the [[Romance languages]]. The term ''septentrional'' usually is  found on maps, mostly those made before 1700. Early maps of North America often refer to the northern- and northwestern-most unexplored areas of the continent as at the "Septentrional" and as "America Septentrionalis", sometimes with slightly varying spellings.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, the "Double Hemisphere" world map, by [[Moses Pitt]], dated about 1680, by labels North America as ''America Septentriona'', to identify the uncharted, northwest of North America.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''septentrional'' is the adjectival form of the Latin noun ''septentriones'', which refers to the seven stars of the ''[[Big Dipper]]'' [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], the ''Septentrion''.

==Etymology==
The ''[[OED|Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the etymology of ''septentrional'' as:

{{quote|[ad. L. ''septentrio'', sing. of ''septentriōnēs'', orig. ''septem triōnēs'', the seven stars of the constellation of the Great Bear, f. ''septem'' seven + ''triōnes'', pl. of ''trio'' plough-ox. Cf. F. ''septentrion''.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/176201?redirectedFrom=Septentrional#eid |title=septentrional |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |year=1989 |edition=2nd 1989, online March 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Usage==
"Septentrional" is more or less synonymous with the term "boreal". The constellation [[Ursa Major]], containing the Big Dipper, or Plough, dominates the skies of the North. There does not appear to be a comparable term linking the regions of the South with some prominent astral feature of the Southern sky. The usual antonym for ''septentrional'' is the term ''[[meridional]]'', which refers to the noonday sun, not to a celestial feature in the Southern sky.

The novelist [[Gene Wolfe]] used the word ''septentrional'' in ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'', as the name of a praetorian guard, who are especially close to the ruler, hence are part of the palace inner-circle; such stars are close to the polar star. 
 
The term, sometimes abbreviated to "Sep.", was used in historical astronomy to indicate the northern direction on the celestial globe, together with [[Meridional]] ("Mer.") for southern, [[Oriental]] ("Ori.") for eastern and [[Europe|Occidental]] ("Occ.") for western.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke, Robert. 1666. Volume 1. ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
==French wine regions==
In [[French wine|France]], the term septentrional refers to the Northern stretch of the [[Côtes du Rhône AOC]] winemaking region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avis-vin.lefigaro.fr/connaitre-deguster/tout-savoir-sur-le-vin/guide-des-regions-et-des-appellations/vallee-du-rhone/nord-septentrional Nord Septentrional]&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Rhône, or septentrional, runs along the [[Rhône river]] from Vienne in the north, to Montélimar in the south. It includes the eight [[cru (wine)|cru]]s:  [[Côte Rôtie AOC|Côte Rôtie]], [[Condrieu AOC|Condrieu]], [[Château-Grillet]], [[Hermitage AOC|Hermitage]], [[Saint-Joseph AOC|Saint-Joseph]], [[Crozes-Hermitage]], [[Cornas AOC|Cornas]] and [[Saint-Péray]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notretemps.com/cuisine/cotes-du-rhone-au-nord-huit-crus-celebres,i1518 Huit Crus Celebres]&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Rhône is referred to as the [[meridional]] (''Rhône méridionale''), and extends from [[Montélimar]] in the north, to [[Avignon]] in the south.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Sigma''' (Science in General Management) was a [[limited company]] established by [[Henry Novy]], [[Stafford Beer]] and [[Roger Eddison]] in 1961. It sold [[operational research]] OR in the [[United Kingdom]] and overseas. Beer was responsible for the cybernetic models of organisation and corporate planning which were the firm's specially. Eddison was the Operations Director.

The consultancy arose following discussions between the Société d’Économie et de Mathématiques Appliquées (SEMA) and Martech Consultants Limited. Novy, who ran Maretch, was given the job of selecting the people to run the company, inviting several OR practitioners to come to Paris for an interview. After he selected Beer, Beer only agreed if Eddison would also join him. This was arranged and the company was launched with a reception at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in October 1961.&lt;ref name="Beer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beer |first1=Stafford |title=Roger Tatham Eddison: an appreciation |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |date=August 2000 |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=1004–1007 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |accessdate=29 September 2018 |language=en |issn=0160-5682}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Over the next five years Sigma developed into a substantial organisation providing services to several leading companies across the UK as well as for six government departments. It also took on contracts in the United States and several developing countries. Amongst the diverse areas it worked in were energy, for the [[Gas Council]], transportation, for [[British Rail]] and the [[Port of London Authority]], shipbuilding, for the [[Geddes Committee]], education for [[Yugoslavia]], tourism, for [[Israel]], nationalised industry in South America, and distribution for a variety of industrial firms.&lt;ref name="GCF"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabezas Fuentealba|first1=Guido|title=Beer|url=http://www.oocities.org/gicabezas/Beer.html|website=www.oocities.org|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sigma, Martech, and Proplan were amalgamated to form what afterwards became the Metra Consulting Group in the United Kingdom.

[[File:Stationary vs inflection pts.svg|350px|thumb|right|The stationary points are the red circles. In this graph, they are all relative maxima or relative minima. The blue squares are [[inflection point]]s.]]
In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[calculus]],  a '''stationary point''' of a [[differentiable function]] of one variable is a point on the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the function where the function's [[derivative]] is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics|last=Chiang|first=Alpha C.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=0-07-010813-7|edition=3rd|location=New York|page=236|authorlink=Alpha Chiang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saddler/&gt;&lt;ref name=TCS/&gt; Informally, it is a point where the function "stops" increasing or decreasing (hence the name).  Some authors treat this term as synonymous with "[[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]," but for other authors the latter is a broader term.

For a differentiable [[function of several real variables]], a stationary (critical) point is a point on the [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] of the graph where all its [[partial derivative]]s are zero (equivalently, the [[gradient]] is zero).

Stationary points are easy to visualize on the graph of a function of one variable: they correspond to the points on the graph where the [[tangent]] is horizontal (i.e., [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[Abscissa|{{math|''x''}}-axis]]). For a function of two variables, they correspond to the points on the graph where the tangent plane is parallel to the {{math|''xy''}} plane.

==Turning points==
A '''turning point''' is a point at which the derivative changes sign.&lt;ref name=Saddler&gt;{{citation|title=Cambridge 2 Unit Mathematics Year 11|first1=David|last1=Saddler|first2=Julia|last2=Shea|first3=Derek|last3=Ward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781107679573|contribution=12 B Stationary Points and Turning Points|page=318|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDKLXdzQL5AC&amp;pg=PA318}}&lt;/ref&gt; A turning point may be either a relative maximum or a relative minimum (also known as local minimum and maximum). If the function is differentiable, then a turning point is a stationary point; however not all stationary points are turning points. If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary points that are not turning points are horizontal [[inflection point]]s. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^3&lt;/math&gt; has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection point, but is not a turning point.&lt;ref name=TCS&gt;{{cite web|title=Turning points and stationary points|url=http://www.teacherschoice.com.au/Maths_Library/Calculus/stationary_points.htm|work=TCS FREE high school mathematics 'How-to Library',|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:Extrema example original.svg|thumb|250px|A graph in which local extrema and global extrema have been labeled.]]
{{See also|maxima and minima}}

Isolated stationary points of a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; real valued function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are classified into four kinds, by the [[first derivative test]]:

* a '''local minimum''' ('''minimal turning point''' or '''relative minimum''') is one where the derivative of the function changes from negative to positive;
* a '''local maximum''' ('''maximal turning point''' or '''relative maximum''') is one where the derivative of the function changes from positive to negative;
[[Image:Stationary and inflection pts.gif|thumb|left|250px|[[Saddle point]]s (stationary points that are ''neither'' local maxima nor minima: they are [[inflection points]]. The left is a "rising point of inflection" (derivative is positive on both sides of the red point); the right is a "falling point of inflection" (derivative is negative on both sides of the red point).]]
* a '''rising [[inflection point|point of inflection]]''' (or '''inflexion''') is one where the derivative of the function is positive on both sides of the stationary point; such a point marks a change in [[concave function|concavity]];
* a '''falling point of inflection''' (or '''inflexion''') is one where the derivative of the function is negative on both sides of the stationary point; such a point marks a change in concavity.

The first two options are collectively known as "[[Maxima and minima|local extrema]]". Similarly a point that is either a global (or absolute) maximum or a global (or absolute) minimum is called a global (or absolute) extremum. The last two options—stationary points that are ''not'' local extremum—are known as [[saddle point]]s.

By [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]], global extrema must occur (for a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; function) on the boundary or at stationary points.

==Curve sketching==
{{Cubic graph special points.svg}}
Determining the position and nature of stationary points aids in [[curve sketching]] of differentiable functions. Solving the equation ''f&amp;#39;''(''x'') = 0 returns the ''x''-coordinates of all stationary points; the ''y''-coordinates are trivially the function values at those ''x''-coordinates.
The specific nature of a stationary point at ''x'' can in some cases be determined by examining the [[second derivative]] ''f'&amp;#39;''(''x''):
* If ''f'&amp;#39;''(''x'') &lt; 0, the stationary point at ''x'' is concave down; a maximal extremum.
* If ''f'&amp;#39;''(''x'') &gt; 0, the stationary point at ''x'' is concave up; a minimal extremum.
* If ''f'&amp;#39;''(''x'') = 0, the nature of the stationary point must be determined by way of other means, often by noting a sign change around that point.

A more straightforward way of determining the nature of a stationary point is by examining the function values between the stationary points (if the function is defined and continuous between them).

A simple example of a point of inflection is the function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. There is a clear change of concavity about the point ''x'' = 0, and we can prove this by means of [[calculus]]. The second derivative of ''f'' is the everywhere-continuous 6''x'', and at ''x'' = 0,  ''f''′′ = 0, and the sign changes about this point. So ''x'' = 0 is a point of inflection.

More generally, the stationary points of a real valued function &lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are those
points '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; where the derivative in every direction equals zero, or equivalently, the [[gradient]] is zero.

===Example===
For the function ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  we have ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(0) = 0 and ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(0) = 0. Even though ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(0) = 0, this point is not a point of inflection.  The reason is that the sign of ''f'''(''x'') changes from negative to positive.

For the function ''f''(''x'') = sin(''x'') we have ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(0) ≠ 0 and  ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(0) = 0. But this is not a stationary point, rather it is a point of inflection. This is because the concavity changes from concave downwards to concave upwards and the sign of ''f'''(''x'') does not change; it stays positive.

For the function ''f''(''x'') = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; we have ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(0) = 0 and ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(0) = 0. This is both a stationary point and a point of inflection. This is because the concavity changes from concave downwards to concave upwards and the sign of ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x'') does not change; it stays positive.

'''Streamline diffusion''', given an [[advection equation|advection]]-[[diffusion equation]], refers to all [[diffusion]] going on along the advection direction.

==Explanation==
In an advection equation, for simplicity assume: &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot{\mathbf u}=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;||{\mathbf u}||=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}
+{\mathbf u}\cdot\nabla\psi=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Adding a diffusion term, again for simplicity, assume the diffusion to be constant over the entire field.

:&lt;math&gt;D\nabla^2\psi&lt;/math&gt;,

Giving an [[equation]] of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}
+{\mathbf u}\cdot\nabla\psi
+D\nabla^2\psi
=0
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation may now be rewritten in the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}
+{\mathbf u}\cdot \nabla\psi
+{\mathbf u}({\mathbf u}\cdot D\nabla^2\psi)
+(D\nabla^2\psi-{\mathbf u}({\mathbf u}\cdot D\nabla^2\psi))
=0
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Term (mathematics)|term]] below is called [[streamline diffusion]].
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf u}({\mathbf u}\cdot D\nabla^2\psi)&lt;/math&gt;

===Crosswind diffusion===
Any diffusion [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the streamline diffusion is called [[crosswind diffusion]], for us this becomes the term:
:&lt;math&gt;
(D\nabla^2\psi-{\mathbf u}({\mathbf u}\cdot D\nabla^2\psi))
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Structural information theory''' ('''SIT''') is a theory about [[perception|human perception]] and in particular about visual perceptual organization, which is the neuro-cognitive process that enables us to perceive scenes as structured wholes consisting of objects arranged in space. It has been applied to a wide range of research topics,&lt;ref&gt;Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. &amp; van der Helm, P. A. (2013). ''Structural information theory: The simplicity of visual form''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in visual form perception but also in, for instance, visual ergonomics, [[data visualization]], and [[music perception]].

SIT began as a quantitative model of visual [[pattern classification]]. Nowadays, it includes quantitative models of [[symmetry|symmetry perception]] and [[amodal perception|amodal completion]], and is theoretically sustained by a perceptually adequate formalization of visual regularity, a quantitative account of viewpoint dependencies, and a powerful form of neurocomputation.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2014). ''Simplicity in vision: A multidisciplinary account of perceptual organization''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; SIT has been argued to be the best defined and most successful extension of [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S. E. (1999).  ''Vision science: Photons to phenomenology.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Gestalt approach providing a [[calculus|formal calculus]] that generates plausible [[percept|perceptual interpretations]].

== The simplicity principle ==

Although visual stimuli are fundamentally multi-interpretable, the human visual system usually has a clear preference for only one interpretation. To explain this preference, SIT introduced a formal coding model starting from the assumption that the perceptually preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one with the [[simplicity|simplest code]]. A simplest code is a code with minimum information load, that is, a code that enables a reconstruction of the stimulus using a minimum number of descriptive parameters. Such a code is obtained by capturing a maximum amount of visual regularity and yields a hierarchical organization of the stimulus in terms of wholes and parts.

The assumption that the visual system prefers simplest interpretations is called the simplicity principle.&lt;ref&gt;Hochberg, J. E., &amp; McAlister, E. (1953). A quantitative approach to figural "goodness". ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 46,'' 361—364.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the simplicity principle is an information-theoretical translation of the Gestalt law of Prägnanz,&lt;ref&gt;Koffka, K. (1935). ''Principles of gestalt psychology.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by the natural tendency of physical systems to settle into relatively stable states defined by a minimum of free-energy. Furthermore, just as the later-proposed [[Minimum description length|minimum description length principle]] in [[algorithmic information theory]] (AIT), a.k.a. the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]], it can be seen as a formalization of [[Occam's Razor]], according to which the simplest interpretation of data is the best one.

== Structural versus algorithmic information theory ==

Since the 1960s, SIT (in psychology) and AIT (in computer science) evolved independently as viable alternatives for [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] classical [[information theory]] which had been developed in communication theory.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, C. E. (1948). A mathematical theory of communication. ''Bell System Technical Journal, 27,'' 379-423, 623—656.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shannon's approach, things are assigned codes with lengths based on their probability in terms of frequencies of occurrence (as, e.g., in the [[Morse code]]). However, in many domains, including perception, such probabilities are hardly quantifiable, if at all. Both SIT and AIT circumvent this problem by turning to descriptive complexities of individual things.

Although SIT and AIT share many starting points and objectives, there are also several relevant differences:
* SIT makes the perceptually relevant distinction between structural and metrical information, whereas AIT does not.
* SIT encodes for a restricted set of perceptually relevant kinds of regularities, whereas AIT encodes for any imaginable regularity.
* In SIT, the relevant outcome of an encoding is a hierarchical organization, whereas in AIT, it is only a complexity value.

== Simplicity versus likelihood ==

In visual perception research, the simplicity principle contrasts with the [[Helmholtz]]ian likelihood principle,&lt;ref&gt;von Helmholtz, H. L. F. (1962). ''Treatise on Physiological Optics'' (J. P. C. Southall, Trans.). New York: Dover. (Original work published 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that the preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one most likely to be true in this world. As shown within a [[Bayes theorem|Bayesian framework]] and using AIT findings, the simplicity principle would imply that perceptual interpretations are fairly veridical (i.e., truthful) in many worlds rather than, as assumed by the likelihood principle, highly veridical in only one world.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2000). Simplicity versus likelihood in visual perception: From surprisals to precisals. ''Psychological Bulletin, 126,'' 770—800. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0033-2909.126.5.770 doi:10.1037//0033-2909.126.5.770].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whereas the likelihood principle suggests that the visual system is a special-purpose system (i.e., adapted to one specific world), the simplicity principle suggests that it is a general-purpose system (i.e., adaptive to many different worlds).

Crucial to the latter finding is the distinction between, and integration of, viewpoint-independent and viewpoint-dependent factors in vision, as proposed in SIT's empirically successful model of amodal completion.&lt;ref&gt;van Lier, R. J., van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1994). Integrating global and local aspects of visual occlusion. ''Perception, 23,'' 883—903. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p230883 doi:10.1068/p230883].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bayesian framework, these factors correspond to prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, respectively. In SIT's model, however, both factors are quantified in terms of complexities, that is, complexities of objects and of their spatial relationships, respectively. This approach is consistent with [[cognitive neuroscience|neuroscientific]] ideas about the distinction and interaction between the ventral ("what") and dorsal ("where") streams in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, L. G., &amp; Mishkin, M. (1982). Two cortical visual systems. In D. J. Ingle, M. A. Goodale, &amp; R. J. W. Mansfield (Eds.), ''Analysis of Visual Behavior'' (pp. 549—586). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus connectionism and dynamic systems theory ==

A representational theory like SIT seems opposite to [[dynamic systems theory]] (DST), while [[connectionism]] can be seen as something in between. That is, connectionism flirts with DST when it comes to the usage of [[differential equations]] and flirts with theories like SIT when it comes to the representation of information. In fact, the different operating bases of SIT, connectionism, and DST, correspond to what [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|Marr]] called the computational, the algorithmic, and the implementational levels of description, respectively. According to Marr, these levels of description are complementary rather than opposite, thus reflecting [[epistemological pluralism]].

What SIT, connectionism, and DST have in common is that they describe nonlinear system behavior, that is, a minor change in the input may yield a major change in the output. Their complementarity expresses itself in that they focus on different aspects:
* Whereas DST focuses primarily on how the state of a physical system as a whole (in this case, the [[brain]]) develops over time, both SIT and connectionism focus primarily on what a system does in terms of information processing (which, in this case, can be said to constitute [[Cognitive science|cognition]]) and both assume that this information processing relies on interactions between pieces of information in distributed representations, that is, in networks of connected pieces of information.
* Whereas connectionism focuses on concrete interaction mechanisms (i.c., activation spreading) in a prefixed network that is assumed to be suited for many inputs, SIT focuses on the nature of the outcome of interactions that are assumed to take place in transient, input-dependent, networks.

== Modeling principles ==

In SIT's formal coding model, candidate interpretations of a stimulus are represented by [[String (computer science)|symbol strings]], in which identical symbols refer to identical perceptual primitives (e.g., blobs or edges). Every substring of such a string represents a spatially contiguous part of an interpretation, so that the entire string can be read as a reconstruction recipe for the interpretation and, thereby, for the stimulus. These strings then are encoded (i.e., they are searched for visual regularities) to find the interpretation with the simplest code.

This encoding is performed by way of symbol manipulation, which, in psychology, has led to critical statements of the sort of "SIT assumes that the brain performs symbol manipulation". Such statements, however, fall in the same category as statements such as "physics assumes that nature applies formulas such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] ''E=mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''F=ma''" and "DST models assume that dynamic systems apply differential equations". That is, these statements ignore that the very concept of [[formal system|formalization]] means that potentially relevant things are represented by symbols—not as a goal in itself but as a means to capture potentially relevant relationships between these things.

== Visual regularity ==

To obtain simplest codes, SIT applies coding rules that capture the kinds of regularity called iteration, symmetry, and alternation. These have been shown to be the only regularities that satisfy the formal criteria of
(a) being holographic regularities that (b) allow for hierarchically transparent codes.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1991). Accessibility, a criterion for regularity and hierarchy in visual pattern codes. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 35,'' 151—213. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2496%2891%2990025-O doi:10.1016/0022-2496%2891%2990025-O].&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial difference with respect to the traditionally considered transformational formalization of visual regularity is that, holographically, mirror symmetry is composed of many relationships between symmetry pairs rather than one relationship between symmetry halves. Whereas the transformational characterization may be suited better for [[object recognition]], the holographic characterization seems more consistent with the buildup of mental representations in object perception.

The perceptual relevance of the criteria of holography and transparency has been verified in the holographic approach to visual regularity.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1996). Goodness of visual regularities: A nontransformational approach. ''Psychological Review, 103,'' 429—456. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.429 doi:10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.429].&lt;/ref&gt; This approach provides an empirically successful model of the detectability of single and combined visual regularities, whether or not perturbed by noise. For instance, it explains that mirror symmetries and Glass pattens are about equally detectable and usually better detectable than repetitions. It also explains that the detectability of mirror symmetries and Glass pattens in the presence of noise follows a psychophysical law that improves on [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2010). Weber-Fechner behaviour in symmetry perception? ''Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics, 72'', 1854—1864. [https://dx.doi.org/10.3758/APP.72.7.1854 doi:10.3758/APP.72.7.1854.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a '''tetrahedral molecular geometry''', a central [[atom]] is located at the center with four [[substituent]]s that are located at the corners of a [[tetrahedron]]. The [[bond angle]]s are cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−⅓) = 109.4712206...° ≈ 109.5° when all four substituents are the same, as in [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maze5.net/?page_id=367|title=Angle Between 2 Legs of a Tetrahedron|website=Maze5.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed022p145|title=Valence Angle of the Tetrahedral Carbon Atom|first=W.

Methane and other perfectly symmetrical tetrahedral molecules belong to [[point group]] T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, but most tetrahedral molecules have [[Tetrahedron#Isometries of irregular tetrahedra|lower symmetry]]. Tetrahedral molecules can be [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]].

== Examples ==

===Main group chemistry===
[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|200px|The tetrahedral molecule methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
Aside from virtually all saturated organic compounds, most compounds of Si, Ge, and Sn are tetrahedral. Often tetrahedral molecules feature multiple bonding to the outer ligands, as in [[xenon tetroxide]] (XeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[perchlorate]] ion ({{chem|ClO|4|−}}), the [[sulfate]] ion ({{chem|SO|4|2−}}), the [[phosphate]] ion ({{chem|PO|4|3−}}). [[Thiazyl trifluoride]] (SNF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is tetrahedral, featuring a sulfur-to-nitrogen triple bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G. L. | last1 = Miessler | first2 = D. A. | last2 = Tarr | title = Inorganic Chemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher =  Pearson/Prentice Hall | isbn = 0-13-035471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other molecules have a tetrahedral arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom; for example [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with the nitrogen atom surrounded by three hydrogens and one [[lone pair]]. However the usual classification considers only the bonded atoms and not the lone pair, so that ammonia is actually considered as [[Trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry|pyramidal]]. The H–N–H angles are 107°, contracted from 109.5. This difference is attributed to the influence of the lone pair which exerts a greater repulsive influence than a bonded atom.

===Transition metal chemistry===
Again the geometry is widespread, particularly so for complexes where the metal has d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; or d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; configuration. Illustrative examples include [[tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)]] (Pd[P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nickel carbonyl]] (Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[titanium tetrachloride]] (TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  Many complexes with incompletely filled d-shells are often tetrahedral, e.g. the tetrahalides of iron(II), cobalt(II), and nickel(II).

===Water structure===
In the gas phase, a single water molecule has an oxygen atom surrounded by two hydrogens and two lone pairs, and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O geometry is simply described as [[Bent molecular geometry|bent]] without considering the nonbonded lone pairs. 

However in liquid water or in ice, the lone pairs form [[hydrogen bond]]s with neighboring water molecules. The most common arrangement of hydrogen atoms around an oxygen is tetrahedral with two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to oxygen and two attached by hydrogen bonds.  Since the hydrogen bonds vary in length many of these water molecules are not symmetrical and form transient irregular tetrahedra between their four associated hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = "Tetrahedrality" and the Relationship between Collective Structure and Radial Distribution Functions in Liquid Water | first1 = P. E. | last1 = Mason | first2 = J. W. | last2 = Brady | journal = [[J. Phys. Chem. B]] | year = 2007 | volume = 111 | pages = 5669–5679 | doi = 10.1021/jp068581n | issue = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bitetrahedral structures==
Many compounds and complexes adopt bitetrahedral structures.  In this motif, the two tetrahedra share a common edge.  The inorganic polymer [[silicon disulfide]] features an infinite chain of edge-shared tetrahedra.
[[File:Gallium-trichloride-from-xtal-2004-3D-balls.png|thumb|220 px|left|Bitetrahedral structure adopted by Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ("[[aluminium tribromide]]") and Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ("[[gallium trichloride]]").]]

==Exceptions and distortions==
Inversion of tetrahedral occurs widely in organic and main group chemistry.  The so-called [[Walden inversion]] illustrates the stereochemical consequences of inversion at carbon.  [[Nitrogen inversion]] in ammonia also entails transient formation of planar NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Inverted tetrahedral geometry===
Geometrical constraints in a molecule can cause a severe distortion of idealized tetrahedral geometry. In compounds featuring "inverted" tetrahedral geometry at a carbon atom, all four groups attached to this carbon are on one side of a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Inverted geometries at carbon | journal = [[Acc. Chem. Res.]] | year = 1984 | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 379–386 | doi = 10.1021/ar00107a001 | last1 = Wiberg | first1 = Kenneth B. |authorlink = Kenneth B. Wiberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon atom lies  at or near the apex of a square [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] with the other four groups at the corners.&lt;ref name=Kenny/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewars/&gt;

:[[Image:Invertedcarbon.png|200px|Inverted carbon]]

The simplest examples of organic molecules displaying inverted tetrahedral geometry are the smallest [[propellane]]s, such as [[1.1.1-Propellane|[1.1.1]propellane]]; or more generally the [[paddlane]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title = paddlanes | file = P04395}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pyramidane]] ([3.3.3.3]fenestrane).&lt;ref name=Kenny&gt;{{cite journal | title = C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:  Pyramidane and Its Low-Lying Isomers |author1=Joseph P. Kenny |author2=Karl M. Krueger |author3=Jonathan C. Rienstra-Kiracofe |author4=Henry F. Schaefer III | journal = [[J. Phys. Chem. A]] | year = 2001 | volume = 105 | pages = 7745–7750 | doi = 10.1021/jp011642r | issue = 32|bibcode=2001JPCA..105.7745K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewars&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pyramidane: an ''ab initio'' study of the C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; potential energy surface | last = Lewars | first = E. | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Structure]]: THEOCHEM | volume = 423 | issue = 3 | year = 1998 | pages = 173–188 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-1280(97)00118-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such molecules are typically [[strain energy|strained]], resulting in increased reactivity.

=== Planarization ===
A tetrahedron can also be distorted by increasing the angle between two of the bonds.  In the extreme case, flattening results. For carbon this phenomenon can be observed in a class of compounds called the [[fenestrane]]s.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===Tetrahedral molecules with no central atom===
A few molecules have a tetrahedral geometry with no central atom. An inorganic example is [[Allotropes of phosphorus#White phosphorus|tetraphosphorus]] (P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) which has four phosphorus atoms at the vertices of a tetrahedron and each bonded to the other three. An organic example is [[tetrahedrane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with four carbon atoms each bonded to one hydrogen and the other three carbons.

Given a discrete set of probabilities &lt;math&gt;\{p_i\}&lt;/math&gt; with the condition &lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; any real number, the '''Tsallis entropy''' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;S_q({p_i}) = {k \over q - 1} \left( 1 - \sum_i p_i^q \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a real parameter sometimes called ''entropic-index''.
In the limit as &lt;math&gt;q \to 1&lt;/math&gt;, the usual Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy is recovered, namely

:&lt;math&gt;S_{BG} = S_1(p) =  -k \sum_i p_i \ln p_i .&lt;/math&gt;

For continuous probability distributions, we define the entropy as

:&lt;math&gt;S_q[p] = {1 \over q - 1} \left( 1 - \int (p(x))^q\, dx \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[probability density function]].

The Tsallis Entropy has been used along with the [[Principle of maximum entropy]] to derive the [[Tsallis distribution]].

== Various relationships ==

The discrete Tsallis entropy satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;S_q = -\lim_{x\rightarrow 1}D_q \sum_i p_i^x &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[q-derivative]] with respect to ''x''. This may be compared to the standard entropy formula:

:&lt;math&gt;S = -\lim_{x\rightarrow 1}\frac{d}{dx} \sum_i p_i^x &lt;/math&gt;

== Non-additivity ==

Given two independent systems ''A'' and ''B'', for which the joint [[probability density function|probability density]] satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;p(A, B) = p(A) p(B),\,&lt;/math&gt;

the Tsallis entropy of this system satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;S_q(A,B) = S_q(A) + S_q(B) + (1-q)S_q(A) S_q(B).\,&lt;/math&gt;

From this result, it is evident that the parameter &lt;math&gt;|1-q|&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the departure from additivity. In the limit when ''q'' = 1,

:&lt;math&gt;S(A,B) = S(A) + S(B),\,&lt;/math&gt;

which is what is expected for an additive system. This property is sometimes referred to as "pseudo-additivity".

== Exponential families ==
Many common distributions like the normal distribution belongs to the statistical [[exponential families]].
Tsallis entropy for an exponential family  can be written &lt;ref name=nielsennock&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1751-8113/45/3/032003| title = A closed-form expression for the Sharma–Mittal entropy of exponential families| journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical| volume = 45| issue = 3| pages = 032003| year = 2012| last1 = Nielsen | first1 = F. | last2 = Nock | first2 = R. |arxiv = 1112.4221 |bibcode = 2012JPhA...45c2003N }}&lt;/ref&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;H^T_q(p_F(x;\theta)) =   \frac{1}{1-q} \left((e^{F(q\theta)-q F(\theta)}) E_p[e^{(q-1)k(x)}]-1  \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F'' is log-normalizer and ''k'' the term indicating the carrier measure.
For multivariate normal, term ''k'' is zero, and therefore the Tsallis entropy is in closed-form.

== Generalized entropies ==
A number of interesting physical systems&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last2=Krischer |author-last1=García-Morales |author-first1=V. |author-first2=K. |title=Superstatistics in nanoscale electrochemical systems |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |date=2011 |volume=108 |issue=49 |pages=19535–19539 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1109844108 |bibcode=2011PNAS..10819535G |pmid=22106266 |pmc=3241754}}&lt;/ref&gt; abide to entropic [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]s that are more general than the standard Tsallis entropy. Therefore, several physically meaningful generalizations have been introduced. The two most general of those are notably: Superstatistics, introduced by C. Beck and E. G. D. Cohen in 2003&lt;ref name="superstatistics"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Beck |author-first1=C. |author-last2=Cohen |author-first2=E. G. D. |journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications |date=2003 |volume=322 |pages=267 |title=Superstatistics |doi=10.1016/S0378-4371(03)00019-0 |arxiv=cond-mat/0205097 |bibcode=2003PhyA..322..267B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spectral Statistics, introduced by G. A. Tsekouras and [[Constantino Tsallis]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="spectral"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Tsekouras |author-first1=G. A. |author-last2=Tsallis |author-first2=C. |title=Generalized entropy arising from a distribution of q indices |journal=Physical Review E |date=2005 |volume=71 |issue=4 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.71.046144 |arxiv=cond-mat/0412329 |bibcode=2005PhRvE..71d6144T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these entropic forms have Tsallis and Boltzmann–Gibbs statistics as special cases; Spectral Statistics has been proven to at least contain Superstatistics and it has been conjectured to also cover some additional cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">In [[type theory]] and [[programming language]]s, a '''type variable''' is a [[Variable_(mathematics)|mathematical variable]] ranging over [[data types|types]]. Even in programming languages that allow [[variable (programming)|mutable variable]]s, a type variable remains an abstraction, in the sense that it does not correspond to some memory locations.

[[Programming language]]s that support [[parametric polymorphism]] make use of [[universally quantified]] type variables. Languages that support [[existential type]]s make use of [[existentially quantified]] type variables. For example, the following [[OCaml]] code defines a polymorphic [[identity function]] that has a universally quantified type, which is printed by the interpreter on the second line:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
# let id x = x;;
val id : 'a -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In mathematical notation, the type of the function &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\forall a.a \to a&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a type variable.

{{Regression bar}}

In [[statistics]], the '''variance function''' is a smooth function which depicts the [[variance]] of a random quantity as a function of its [[mean]]. The variance function plays a large role in many settings of statistical modelling. It is a main ingredient in the [[generalized linear model]] framework and a tool used in [[non-parametric regression]],&lt;ref name="Muller1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muller and Zhao|title=On a semi parametric variance function model and a test for heteroscedasticity|journal=The Annals of Statistics|year=1995|volume=23|issue=3|pages=946–967|jstor=2242430|doi=10.1214/aos/1176324630}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[semiparametric regression]]&lt;ref name="Muller1"/&gt;  and [[functional data analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muller, Stadtmuller and Yao|title=Functional Variance Processes|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|year=2006|volume=101|issue=475|pages=1007|jstor=27590778|doi=10.1198/016214506000000186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parametric modeling, variance functions take on a parametric form and explicitly describe the relationship between the variance and the mean of a random quantity. In a non-parametric setting, the variance function is assumed to be a [[smooth function]].

== Intuition ==

In a regression model setting, the goal is to establish whether or not a relationship exists between a response variable and a set of predictor variables. Further, if a relationship does exist, the goal is then to be able to describe this relationship as best as possible. A main assumption in [[linear regression]] is constant variance or (homoscedasticity), meaning that different response variables have the same variance in their errors, at every predictor level. This assumption works well when the response variable and the predictor variable are jointly Normal, see [[Normal distribution]]. As we will see later, the variance function in the Normal setting, is constant, however, we must find a way to quantify heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) in the absence of joint Normality.

When it is likely that the response follows a distribution that is a member of the exponential family, a [[generalized linear model]] may be more appropriate to use, and moreover, when we wish not to force a parametric model onto our data, a [[non-parametric regression]] approach can be useful. The importance of being able to model the variance as a function of the mean lies in improved inference (in a parametric setting), and estimation of the regression function in general, for any setting.

Variance functions play a very important role in parameter estimation and inference. In general, maximum likelihood estimation requires that a likelihood function be defined. This requirement then implies that one must first specify the distribution of the response variables observed. However, to define a quasi-likelihood, one need only specify a relationship between the mean and the variance of the observations to then be able to use the quasi-likelihood function for estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R.W.M.|last=Wedderburn|title=Quasi-likelihood functions, generalized linear models, and the Gauss–Newton Method|journal=Biometrika|year=1974|volume=61|issue=3|pages=439|jstor=2334725|doi=10.1093/biomet/61.3.439}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quasi-likelihood]] estimation is particularly useful when there is [[overdispersion]]. Overdispersion occurs when there is more variability in the data than there should otherwise be expected according to the assumed distribution of the data.

In summary, to ensure efficient inference of the regression parameters and the regression function, the heteroscedasticity must be accounted for. Variance functions quantify the relationship between the variance and the mean of the observed data and hence play a significant role in regression estimation and inference.

== Types of variance functions ==

The variance function and its applications come up in many areas of statistical analysis. A very important use of this function is in the framework of [[generalized linear models]] and [[non-parametric regression]].

=== Generalized linear model ===

When a member of the [[exponential family]] has been specified, the variance function can easily be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = McCullagh | first = Peter |author2=Nelder, John |authorlink2=John Nelder  | title = Generalized Linear Models | publisher = London: Chapman and Hall | year = 1989 | edition=second| isbn = 0-412-31760-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} The general form of the variance function is presented under the exponential family context, as well as specific forms for Normal, Bernoulli, Poisson, and Gamma. In addition, we describe the applications and use of variance functions in maximum likelihood estimation and quasi-likelihood estimation.

==== Derivation ====

The '''generalized linear model (GLM)''', is a generalization of ordinary regression analysis that extends to any member of the [[exponential family]]. It is particularly useful when the response variable is categorical, binary or subject to a constraint (e.g. only positive responses make sense). A quick summary of the components of a GLM are summarized on this page, but for more details and information see the page on [[generalized linear models]].

A '''GLM''' consists of three main ingredients:
:1. Random Component: a distribution of '''y''' from the exponential family, &lt;math&gt;E[y \mid X] = \mu&lt;/math&gt;
:2. Linear predictor:  &lt;math&gt;\eta = XB = \sum_{j=1}^p X_{ij}^T B_j&lt;/math&gt; 
:3. Link function: &lt;math&gt;\eta = g(\mu), \mu = g^{-1}(\eta)&lt;/math&gt;

First it is important to derive a couple key properties of the exponential family.

Any random variable &lt;math&gt;\textit{y}&lt;/math&gt; in the exponential family has a probability density function of the form,

:&lt;math&gt;f(y,\theta,\phi) = \exp\left(\frac{y\theta - b(\theta)}{\phi} - c(y,\phi)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
with loglikelihood,
:&lt;math&gt;\ell(\theta,y,\phi)=\log(f(y,\theta,\phi)) = \frac{y\theta - b(\theta)}{\phi} - c(y,\phi)
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical parameter and the parameter of interest, and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a nuisance parameter which plays a role in the variance.
We use the '''Bartlett's Identities''' to derive a general expression for the '''variance function'''.
The first and second Bartlett results ensures that under suitable conditions ((see [[Leibniz integral rule]])), for a density function dependent on &lt;math&gt;\theta, f_\theta()&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log(f_\theta(y)) \right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}_\theta\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\log(f_\theta(y))\right]+\operatorname{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2} \log(f_\theta(y))\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

These identities lead to simple calculations of the expected value and variance of any random variable &lt;math&gt;\textit{y}&lt;/math&gt; in the exponential family &lt;math&gt;E_\theta[y], Var_\theta[y]&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Expected value of ''Y'':'''
Taking the first derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; of the log of the density in the exponential family form described above, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\log(f(y,\theta,\phi))= \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left[\frac{y\theta - b(\theta)}{\phi} - c(y,\phi)\right] = \frac{y-b'(\theta)}{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
Then taking the expected value and setting it equal to zero leads to, 
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}_\theta\left[\frac{y-b'(\theta)}{\phi}\right] = \frac{\operatorname{E}_\theta[y]-b'(\theta)}{\phi}=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}_\theta[y] = b'(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Variance of Y:'''
To compute the variance we use the second Bartlett identity,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}_\theta\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left(\frac{y\theta - b(\theta)}{\phi} - c(y,\phi)\right)\right]+\operatorname{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\left(\frac{y\theta - b(\theta)}{\phi} - c(y,\phi)\right)\right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}_\theta\left[\frac{y - b'(\theta)} \phi \right] + \operatorname{E}_\theta \left[\frac{-b''(\theta)} \phi \right] = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}_\theta\left[y\right]=b''(\theta)\phi&lt;/math&gt;

We have now a relationship between &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, namely

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = b'(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta = b'^{-1}(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, which allows for a relationship between &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and the variance,

:&lt;math&gt;V(\theta) = b''(\theta) = \text{the part of the variance that depends on }\theta&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{V}(\mu) = b''(b'^{-1}(\mu)). \, &lt;/math&gt;
Note that because &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}_\theta\left[y\right]&gt;0, b''(\theta)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;b': \theta \rightarrow \mu&lt;/math&gt; is invertible.
We derive the variance function for a few common distributions.

==== Example – normal ====

The [[Normal distribution]] is a special case where the variance function is a constant. Let &lt;math&gt;y \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; then we put the density function of '''y''' in the form of the exponential family described above:

:&lt;math&gt;f(y) = \exp\left(\frac{y\mu - \frac{\mu^2}{2}}{\sigma^2} - \frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2}\ln{2\pi\sigma^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where
 
: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \mu, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b(\theta) = \frac{\mu^2}{2}, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\phi=\sigma^2, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c(y,\phi)=- \frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2}\ln{2\pi\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the variance function &lt;math&gt;V(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, we first express &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. Then we transform &lt;math&gt;V(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; into a function of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta=\mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b'(\theta) = \theta= \operatorname{E}[y] = \mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(\theta) = b''(\theta) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the variance function is constant.

==== Example – Bernoulli ====

Let &lt;math&gt; y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)&lt;/math&gt;, then we express the density of the [[Bernoulli distribution]] in exponential family form, 
:&lt;math&gt; f(y) = \exp\left(y\ln\frac{p}{1-p} + \ln(1-p)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \ln\frac{p}{1-p} =&lt;/math&gt; [[logit]](p), which gives us &lt;math&gt; p = \frac{e^\theta}{1+e^\theta} =&lt;/math&gt; [[expit]]&lt;math&gt;(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b(\theta) = \ln(1+e^\theta)&lt;/math&gt;  and   
:&lt;math&gt; b'(\theta) = \frac{e^\theta}{1+e^\theta} =&lt;/math&gt; [[expit]]&lt;math&gt;(\theta) = p = \mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; b''(\theta) =\frac{e^\theta}{1+e^\theta} - \left(\frac{e^\theta}{1+e^\theta}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

This give us 
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mu) = \mu(1-\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example – Poisson ====

Let &lt;math&gt; y \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, then we express the density of the [[Poisson distribution]] in exponential family form, 
:&lt;math&gt; f(y) = \exp(y\ln\lambda -\ln\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \ln\lambda =&lt;/math&gt; which gives us &lt;math&gt; \lambda = e^\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b(\theta) = e^\theta&lt;/math&gt;  and   
:&lt;math&gt; b'(\theta) = e^\theta = \lambda = \mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; b''(\theta) =e^\theta = \mu&lt;/math&gt;

This give us 
:&lt;math&gt;V(\mu) = \mu &lt;/math&gt;

Here we see the central property of Poisson data, that the variance is equal to the mean.

==== Example – Gamma ====

The [[Gamma distribution]] and density function can be expressed under different parametrizations. We will use the form of the gamma with parameters &lt;math&gt;(\mu,\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\mu,\nu}(y) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\nu)y}\left(\frac{\nu y}{\mu}\right)^\nu e^{\frac{\nu y}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;
Then in exponential family form we have 
:&lt;math&gt;f_{\mu,\nu}(y) = \exp\left(\frac{-\frac{1}{\mu}y+\ln(\frac{1}{\mu})}{\frac{1}{\nu}}+ \ln\left(\frac{\nu^\nu y^{\nu-1}}{\Gamma(\nu)}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;	\theta = \frac{-1}{\mu} \rightarrow \mu = \frac{-1}{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;	\phi = \frac{1}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;	b(\theta) = -ln(-\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;	b'(\theta) = \frac{-1}{\theta} = \frac{-1}{\frac{-1}{\mu}} = \mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; b''(\theta) = \frac{1}{\theta^2} = \mu^2&lt;/math&gt;

And we have &lt;math&gt;V(\mu) = \mu^2&lt;/math&gt;

==== Application – weighted least squares ====

A very important application of the variance function is its use in parameter estimation and inference when the response variable is of the required exponential family form as well as in some cases when it is not (which we will discuss in [[quasi-likelihood]]). Weighted [[least squares]] (WLS) is a special case of generalized least squares. Each term in the WLS criterion includes a weight that determines that the influence each observation has on the final parameter estimates. As in regular least squares, the goal is to estimate the unknown parameters in the regression function by finding values for parameter estimates that minimize the sum of the squared deviations between the observed responses and the functional portion of the model.

While WLS assumes independence of observations it does not assume equal variance and is therefore a solution for parameter estimation in the presence of heteroscedasticity. The [[Gauss–Markov theorem]] and [[Alexander Aitken|Aitken]] demonstrate that the [[best linear unbiased estimator]] (BLUE), the unbiased estimator with minimum variance, has each weight equal to the reciprocal of the variance of the measurement.

In the GLM framework, our goal is to estimate parameters &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z = g(E[y\mid X]) = X\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we would like to minimize &lt;math&gt;(Z-XB)^{T}W(Z-XB)&lt;/math&gt; and if we define the weight matrix '''W''' as

:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{W}_{n \times n} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\phi V(\mu_1)g'(\mu_1)^2} &amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;0  \\
0&amp;\frac{1}{\phi V(\mu_2)g'(\mu_2)^2}&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0 \\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;0\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;0\\
0 &amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;\frac{1}{\phi V(\mu_n)g'(\mu_n)^2} \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi,V(\mu),g(\mu)&lt;/math&gt; are defined in the previous section, it allows for [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] (IRLS) estimation of the parameters. See the section on [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] for more derivation and information.

Also, important to note is that when the weight matrix is of the form described here, minimizing the expression &lt;math&gt;(Z-XB)^{T}W(Z-XB)&lt;/math&gt; also minimizes the Pearson distance. See [[Distance correlation]] for more.

The matrix '''W''' falls right out of the estimating equations for estimation of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Maximum likelihood estimation for each parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta_r, 1\leq r \leq p&lt;/math&gt;, requires
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial l_i}{\partial \beta_r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{l}(\theta,y,\phi)=\log(\operatorname{f}(y,\theta,\phi)) = \frac{y\theta - b(\theta)}{\phi} - c(y,\phi)
&lt;/math&gt; is the log-likelihood. 
Looking at a single observation we have,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial l}{\partial \beta_r} = \frac{\partial l}{\partial \theta} \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \mu}\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial \eta}\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial \beta_r}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial \beta_r} = x_r &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial l}{\partial \theta} = \frac{y-b'(\theta)}{\phi}=\frac{y-\mu}{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \mu} = \frac{\partial b'^{-1}(\mu)}{\mu} = \frac{1}{b''(b'(\mu))} = \frac{1}{V(\mu)} &lt;/math&gt;

This gives us
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial l}{\partial \beta_r} =\frac{y-\mu}{\phi V(\mu)} \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial \eta}x_r&lt;/math&gt;, and noting that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial \mu} = g'(\mu)&lt;/math&gt; we have that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial l}{\partial \beta_r} =\frac{y-\mu}{\phi V(\mu)}W\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial \mu}x_r&lt;/math&gt;

The Hessian matrix is determined in a similar manner and can be shown to be,

: &lt;math&gt;H = X^T(y-\mu)\left[\frac{\partial}{\beta_s}W\frac{\partial}{\beta_r}\right] - X^TWX&lt;/math&gt;

Noticing that the Fisher Information (FI), 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{FI} = -E[H] = X^TWX&lt;/math&gt;, allows for asymptotic approximation of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta} \sim N_p(\beta,(X^TWX)^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;, and hence inference can be performed.

==== Application – quasi-likelihood ====

Because most features of '''GLMs''' only depend on the first two moments of the distribution, rather than then entire distribution, the quasi-likelihood can be developed by just specifying a link function and a variance function. That is, we need to specify
: – Link function: &lt;math&gt;E[y] = \mu = g^{-1}(\eta)&lt;/math&gt;				
: – Variance function: &lt;math&gt;V(\mu)\text{, where the }\operatorname{Var}_\theta(y) = \sigma^2V(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;
				
With a specified variance function and link function we can develop, as alternatives to the log-[[likelihood function]], the [[score (statistics)|score function]], and the [[Fisher information]],  a '''[[quasi-likelihood]]''', a '''quasi-score''', and the '''quasi-information'''. This allows for full inference of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Quasi-likelihood (QL)'''

Though called a [[quasi-likelihood]], this is in fact a quasi-'''log'''-likelihood. The QL for one observation is

:&lt;math&gt; Q_i(\mu_i,y_i) = \int_{y_i}^{\mu_i} \frac{y_i-t}{\sigma^2V(t)} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;
And therefore the QL for all '''n''' observations is

:&lt;math&gt;Q(\mu,y) = \sum_{i=1}^n Q_i(\mu_i,y_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n \int_{y_i}^{\mu_i} \frac{y-t}{\sigma^2V(t)} \, dt &lt;/math&gt;

From the '''QL''' we have the '''quasi-score'''

'''Quasi-score (QS)'''

Recall the [[score (statistics)|score function]], '''U''', for data with log-likelihood &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{l}(\mu\mid y)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{\partial l }{d\mu}.&lt;/math&gt;

We obtain the quasi-score in an identical manner,

:&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{y-\mu}{\sigma^2V(\mu)}&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that, for one observation the score is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \mu} = \frac{y-\mu}{\sigma^2V(\mu)}&lt;/math&gt;

The first two Bartlett equations are satisfied for the quasi-score, namely

:&lt;math&gt; E[U] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Cov}(U) + E\left[\frac{\partial U}{\partial \mu}\right] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, the quasi-score is linear in '''y'''.

Ultimately the goal is to find information about the parameters of interest &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Both the QS and the QL are actually functions of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Recall, &lt;math&gt;\mu = g^{-1}(\eta)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\eta = X\beta&lt;/math&gt;, therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = g^{-1}(X\beta).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Quasi-information (QI)'''

The '''quasi-information''', is similar to the [[Fisher information]],
:&lt;math&gt;i_b = -\operatorname{E}\left[\frac{\partial U}{\partial \beta}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

'''QL,QS,QI as functions of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;'''

The QL, QS and QI all provide the building blocks for inference about the parameters of interest and therefore it is important to express the QL, QS and QI all as functions of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Recalling again that &lt;math&gt;\mu = g^{-1}(X\beta)&lt;/math&gt;, we derive the expressions for QL,QS and QI parametrized under &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Quasi-likelihood in &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt; Q(\beta,y) = \int_y^{\mu(\beta)} \frac{y-t}{\sigma^2V(t)} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

The QS as a function of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;U_j(\beta_j) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_j} Q(\beta,y) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial \mu_i}{\partial\beta_j} \frac{y_i-\mu_i(\beta_j)}{\sigma^2V(\mu_i)}&lt;/math&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;U(\beta) = \begin{bmatrix} U_1(\beta)\\
U_2(\beta)\\
\vdots\\
\vdots\\
U_p(\beta)
\end{bmatrix} = D^TV^{-1}\frac{(y-\mu)}{\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, 
:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{D}_{n \times p} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial \mu_1}{\partial \beta_1} &amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\frac{\partial \mu_1}{\partial \beta_p}  \\
\frac{\partial \mu_2}{\partial \beta_1} &amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\frac{\partial \mu_2}{\partial \beta_p}  \\
\vdots\\
\vdots\\
\frac{\partial \mu_m}{\partial \beta_1} &amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\frac{\partial \mu_m}{\partial \beta_p} \end{bmatrix}
 \underbrace{V}_{n\times n} = \operatorname{diag}(V(\mu_1),V(\mu_2),\ldots,\ldots,V(\mu_n))&lt;/math&gt;

The quasi-information matrix in &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is,

:&lt;math&gt;i_b = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial \beta} = \operatorname{Cov}(U(\beta)) = \frac{D^TV^{-1}D}{\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Obtaining the score function and the information of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; allows for parameter estimation and inference in a similar manner as described in [[#Section name|Application – weighted least squares]].

Non-parametric estimation of the variance function and its importance, has been discussed widely in the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muller and StadtMuller|title=Estimation of Heteroscedasticity in Regression Analysis|journal=The Annals of Statistics|year=1987|volume=15|issue=2|pages=610–625|jstor=2241329|doi=10.1214/aos/1176350364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cai and Wang|title=Adaptive Variance Function Estimation in Heteroscedastic Nonparametric Regression|journal=The Annals of Statistics|year=2008|volume=36|issue=5|pages=2025–2054|jstor=2546470|bibcode=2008arXiv0810.4780C|last2=Wang|first2=Lie|arxiv=0810.4780|first1=T.|doi=10.1214/07-AOS509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rice and Silverman|title=Estimating the Mean and Covariance structure nonparametrically when the data are curves|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|year=1991|volume=53|issue=1|pages=233–243|jstor=2345738}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[non-parametric regression]] analysis, the goal is to express the expected value of your response variable('''y''') as a function of your predictors ('''X'''). That is we are looking to estimate a '''mean''' function, &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \operatorname{E}[y\mid X=x]&lt;/math&gt; without assuming a parametric form. There are many forms of non-parametric [[smoothing]] methods to help estimate the function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. An interesting approach is to also look at a non-parametric '''variance function''', &lt;math&gt;g_v(x) = \operatorname{Var}(Y\mid X=x)&lt;/math&gt;. A non-parametric variance function allows one to look at the mean function as it relates to the variance function and notice patterns in the data.

:&lt;math&gt;g_v(x) = \operatorname{Var}(Y\mid X=x) =\operatorname{E}[y^2\mid X=x] - \left[\operatorname{E}[y\mid X=x]\right]^2 &lt;/math&gt;

An example is detailed in the pictures to the left. The goal of the project was to determine (among other things) whether or not the predictor, '''number of years in the major leagues''' (baseball,) had an effect on the response, '''salary''', a player made. An initial scatter plot of the data indicates that there is heteroscedasticity in the data as the variance is not constant at each level of the predictor. Because we can visually detect the non-constant variance, it useful now to plot &lt;math&gt;g_v(x) = \operatorname{Var}(Y\mid X=x) =\operatorname{E}[y^2\mid X=x] - \left[\operatorname{E}[y\mid X=x]\right]^2 &lt;/math&gt;, and look to see if the shape is indicative of any known distribution. One can estimate &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[y^2\mid X=x]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left[\operatorname{E}[y\mid X=x]\right]^2 &lt;/math&gt; using a general [[smoothing]] method. The plot of the non-parametric smoothed variance function can give the researcher an idea of the relationship between the variance and the mean. The picture to the right indicates a quadratic relationship between the mean and the variance. As we saw above, the Gamma variance function is quadratic in the mean.

'''Walter Benz''' (May 2, 1931 [[Lahnstein]] – January 13, 2017 [[Ratzeburg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]], an expert in [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebenswege.faz.net/traueranzeige/walter-benz/48997763 Walter Benz : Traueranzeige] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benz studied at the [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]] and received his [[doctoral degree]] in 1954, with Robert Furch as his advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=21533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After a position at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main]], he served as a professor at the Universities of [[Ruhr University Bochum|Bochum]], [[University of Waterloo|Waterloo]] and [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]]. Benz was honoured with the degree of a [[Honorary degree|Dr. h.c.]]

Based on his book ''Vorlesungen über Geometrie der Algebren'' ([[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] 1973), certain geometric objects are called [[Benz plane]]s.

[[Inner product space]]s over the [[real number]]s provide the basis of a 2007 book by Benz: ''Classical Geometries in Modern Contexts''.&lt;ref&gt;W. Benz (2007) ''Classical Geometries in Modern Contexts: Geometry of Real Inner Product Spaces'', [[Birkhäuser]],

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5290">In mathematics, and especially [[differential topology]], [[functional analysis]] and [[Singularity theory#Arnold.27s view|singularity theory]], the '''Whitney topologies''' are a [[countably infinite]] family of [[General topology#Definition|topologies]] defined on the set of [[smooth mapping]]s between two [[smooth manifold]]s. They are named after the American mathematician [[Hassler Whitney]].

==Construction==
Let ''M'' and ''N'' be two real, smooth manifolds. Furthermore, let [[Smooth mapping#Multivariate differentiability classes|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;]](''M'',''N'') denote the space of smooth mappings between ''M'' and ''N''. The notation C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; means that the mappings are infinitely differentiable, i.e. [[partial derivative]]s of all orders exist and are [[continuous function|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=M.|last1=Golubitsky|author1-link=Marty Golubitsky|first2=V.|last2=Guillemin|author2-link=Victor Guillemin|title=Stable Mappings and Their Singularities |publisher=Springer|year=1974|ISBN=0-387-90072-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-topology===
For some [[integer]] {{nowrap|1=''k'' ≥ 0}}, let J&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') denote the [[jet (mathematics)|''k''-jet space]] of mappings between ''M'' and ''N''. The jet space can be endowed with a smooth structure (i.e. a structure as a C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; manifold) which make it into a topological space. This topology is used to define a topology on C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'').

For a fixed [[integer]] {{nowrap|1=''k'' ≥ 0}} consider an open subset {{nowrap|1=''U'' ⊂ J&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N''),}} and denote by ''S&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''U'') the following:
:&lt;math&gt; S^k(U) = \{ f \in C^{\infty}(M,N) : (J^kf)(M) \subseteq U \} . &lt;/math&gt;
The sets ''S&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''U'') form a [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the '''Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-topology''' on C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'').&lt;ref name="GG42"&gt;{{harvtxt|Golubitsky|Guillemin|1974}}, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-topology===
For each choice of {{nowrap|1=''k'' &amp;ge; 0}}, the Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-topology gives a topology for C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N''); in other words the Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-topology tells us which subsets of C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') are open sets. Let us denote by W&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; the set of open subsets of C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') with respect to the Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-topology. Then the '''Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-topology''' is defined to be the topology whose [[basis (topology)|basis]] is given by ''W'', where:&lt;ref name="GG42"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; W = \bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} W^k . &lt;/math&gt;

==Dimensionality==
Notice that C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') has infinite dimension, whereas J&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') has finite dimension. In fact, J&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') is a real, finite-dimensional manifold. To see this, let {{nowrap|1=ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} denote the space of [[polynomial]]s, with real coefficients, in ''m'' variables of order at most ''k'' and with zero as the constant term. This is a real [[vector space]] with dimension
:&lt;math&gt; \dim\left\{\R^k[x_1,\ldots,x_m]\right\} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(m+i-1)!}{(m-1)! \cdot i!} = \left( \frac{(m+k)!}{m!\cdot k!} - 1 \right) . &lt;/math&gt;
Writing {{nowrap|1=''a'' = dim{ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}} then, by the standard theory of vector spaces {{nowrap|1=ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;] ≅ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;,}} and so is a real, finite-dimensional manifold. Next, define:
:&lt;math&gt;B_{m,n}^k = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \R^k[x_1,\ldots,x_m], \implies \dim\left\{B_{m,n}^k\right\} = n \dim \left\{ A_m^k \right\} = n \left( \frac{(m+k)!}{m!\cdot k!} - 1 \right) . &lt;/math&gt;
Using ''b'' to denote the dimension ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, we see that {{nowrap|1=''B''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and so is a real, finite-dimensional manifold.

In fact, if ''M'' and ''N'' have dimension ''m'' and ''n'' respectively then:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golubitsky|Guillemin|1974}}, p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \dim\!\left\{J^k(M,N)\right\} = m + n + \dim \!\left\{B_{n,m}^k\right\} = m + n\left( \frac{(m+k)!}{m!\cdot k!}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

==Topology==
Consider the [[surjective map]]ping from the space of smooth maps between smooth manifolds and the ''k''-jet space:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi^k : C^{\infty}(M,N) \twoheadrightarrow J^k(M,N) \ \mbox{where} \ \pi^k(f) = (j^kf)(M) .&lt;/math&gt;
In the Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-topology the open sets in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') are, by definition, the preimages of open sets in J&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N''). It follows that the map π&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; between C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') given the Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-topology and  J&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') given the Euclidean topology is [[Continuity (topology)#Continuous functions between topological spaces|continuous]].

Given the Whitney C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-topology, the space C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',''N'') is a [[Baire space]], i.e. every [[residual set]] is [[dense (topology)|dense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golubitsky|Guillemin|1974}}, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">In [[mathematical physics]], the '''Wigner surmise''' is a statement about the [[probability distribution]] of the spaces between points in the [[Spectroscopy#Atoms|spectra]] of nuclei of heavy atoms. It was proposed by [[Eugene Wigner]] in [[probability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Random Matrices By Madan Lal Mehta |page=13 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Kp3Nx03_gMwC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=wigner+surmise&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdzM-fzYfeAhXIfysKHcFHC6QQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wigner%20surmise&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surmise was a result of Wigner's introduction of [[random matrices]] in the field of [[nuclear physics]]. The surmise consists of two postulates:
*In a simple sequence ([[Spin_(physics)|spin]] and [[Parity_(physics)|parity]] are same), the [[probability density function]] for a spacing is given by,
:: &lt;math&gt;p_w(s) = \frac{\pi s}{2} e^{-\pi s^2/4}.&lt;/math&gt;
: Here, &lt;math&gt;s = \frac{S}{D}&lt;/math&gt; where ''S'' is a particular spacing and ''D'' is the mean distance between neighboring intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Quantum Computation and Information |page=406 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9cRl0dFaeGMC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;dq=wigner+surmise&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdzM-fzYfeAhXIfysKHcFHC6QQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=wigner%20surmise&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a mixed sequence (spin and parity are different), the probability density function can be obtained by randomly superimposing simple sequences.

'''Willis Nelson Dysart''' (March 15, 1923 in [[Omega, Georgia]] - November 8, 2011)&lt;ref name="refe1"&gt;The Mental Calculator's Handbook, Fountain and van Koningsveld, 2013, pages 476-483. &lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[mental calculator]]. His talent for arithmetic emerged at the age of three after his mother taught him to count. He quit school in the [[third grade]] (age 9) and pursued a career as a lightning calculator.&lt;ref&gt;Mickey:
Short Stories and Anecdotes - Neurosis Can Be a Good Thing After All, R.E. McCoy 2004, pp 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raleigh Register, September 13, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]], May 2, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Los Angeles Herald, December 27, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 [[Robert Ripley]] featured Dysart in his 'Believe It Or Not' [[Columnist|newspaper column]] and introduced what would become Dysart's [[stage name]] - 'Willie the Wizard'.

In 1940 Dysart was recruited by a local radio station to tally votes in the US [[Election|presidential election]]. Dysart would very quickly (much more quickly than rival [[radio station]]s aided by [[calculating machine]]s) give "the exact standing of any candidate on the board, including his current total, the percentage of votes counted at that point and the probable outcome of the contest on the basis of existing information". Not content with that, Dysart would provide a little entertainment by, for instance, asking for the birth dates of the candidates and immediately giving the years, months, hours, minutes and seconds they had lived to that moment&lt;ref&gt;Strange people, [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edwards]], [[Lyle Stuart]] (New York) 1961, pp 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysart has given many live demonstrations of his skill at a range of venues. He has also appeared on numerous television shows, including I've Got a Secret, [[You Asked For It]], The [[Art Linkletter]] Show and The [[Joe Pyne]] Show, which made him famous in the United States. He has also been the subject of psychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;East Los Angeles Gazette, April 12, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long Beach Press Telegram, December 20, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

Although excelling at all kinds of arithmetic, Dysart's most startling demonstrations have been in addition and multiplication. Multiplying a pair of three-digit numbers is for Dysart a trivial task, which is why he breaks larger numbers into groups of three digits before multiplying them (many of the multiplications reported to have been made by Dysart involve six or nine-digit numbers). In this respect Dysart is unique among the documented calculators, some of whom – most notably Dutchman [[Willem Klein|Wim Klein]] – multiplied large numbers by breaking them up into groups of two-digit numbers but never three-digit numbers. It took Dysart less than 10 seconds to multiply a pair of nine-digit numbers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long Beach Independent, February 9, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;South Gate Press, March 19, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Readings in Psychology Today: Some Memory Freaks I Have Known, James B. Maas 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Deseret Morning News|Deseret News]], August 11, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Star News, March 17, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysart died on November 8, 2011 in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California.&lt;ref name="refe1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1690">The '''Łoś&amp;ndash;Tarski theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], that states that the set of formulas preserved under taking substructures is exactly the set of ''universal'' formulas (Hodges 1997). The theorem was discovered by [[Jerzy Los|Jerzy Łoś]] and [[Alfred Tarski]].

== Statement ==

Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a theory in a first-order language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;\Phi(\bar{x})&lt;/math&gt; a set of formulas of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.
(The set of sequence of variables &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; need not be
finite.) Then the following are equivalent:
# If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are models of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;B \models \bigwedge \Phi(\bar{a})&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A \models \bigwedge \Phi(\bar{a})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is preserved in substructures for models of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;)
# &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent modulo &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to a set &lt;math&gt;\Psi(\bar{x})&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\forall_1&lt;/math&gt; formulas of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

A formula is &lt;math&gt;\forall_1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is of the form &lt;math&gt;\forall \bar{x} [\psi(\bar{x})]&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\psi(\bar{x})&lt;/math&gt; is quantifier-free.

Note that this property fails for [[finite model theory|finite models]].
