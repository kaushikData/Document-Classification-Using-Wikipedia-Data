{{Italic title}}'''''Actus Essendi'''''  is a [[Latin]] expression coined by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274). Translated as "act of being", the expression ''actus essendi'' refers to a fundamental metaphysical principle discovered by Aquinas in his Christianizing of [[Aristotle]]. 

Aquinas saw that in any subsisting extramental thing one finds a couplet of [[metaphysical]] principles: one is the ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is, the other is the ''actus essendi'' which gives to the thing and to its ‘essence’ actual existence. 

The observation that individual things display instantiations of a particular ‘essence’ led Aquinas to postulate that what gives actual existence to a thing and to its ‘essence’ — the ''actus essendi'' — is unique, in the sense that the perfection of ''actus essendi'' cannot be said to be common in the way an ‘essence’ is said to be common. 

Things instantiating the essence of horseness, for example, are said to be similar because of their horseness. The essence of horseness is what makes horses to be the same under a common category.

But things instantiating the perfection of ''actus essendi'', are said to be different on account of their ''actus essendi''. The possession of ''actus essendi'' is what makes things unique and distinct from all other things. 

Thus in what actually exists as a subsisting extramental thing, there is an ‘essence’ which makes the thing to be what it is (a horse, for example), and the ''actus essendi'' which makes the thing to be a real, individual, existing thing.

Aristotle didn’t have the notion of ''actus essendi''. In fact, the contribution of Aquinas to the philosophy of being is precisely this, that he discovered that all Aristotelian acts were in reality ‘potency’ with respect to the ''actus essendi''. 

Aquinas saw that the metaphysical principle of ''actus essendi'' is the "act of all acts, the perfection of all perfections",&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Quaestiones Disputatae De Potentia'', question 7, article 2, ad 9.  See also ''Summa Theologiae'', part I, question 4, article 1, ad 3; and ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', book II, chapter 54, no. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a proper effect of God".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', book III, chapter 66, no. 4. See also ''Summa Theologiae'', part I, question 45, article 5, corpus.&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphysics of Aristotle did not reach that far.

Accordingly, Pope John Paul II stresses in his teachings that the philosophy of Aquinas is the philosophy of ''actus essendi'', "whose transcendental value paves the most direct way to rise to the knowledge of subsisting Being and pure Act, namely to God."&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, "The ''Angelicum'' Address", speech delivered at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in Rome on 17 November 1979. The original, in Italian, was published in ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 71 (1979): 1472-1483. English translations are available in ''L'Osservatore Romano English Weekly Edition'' (17 December 1979): 6-8; and in ''Angelicum'' 57 (1980): 133-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas defined God as the ‘''Ipse Actus Essendi subsistens''’, subsisting act of being.

'''Alejandro Korn''' (3 May 1860 – 9 October 1936) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[psychiatrist]], [[philosopher]], [[reformist]] and [[politician]]. For eighteen years, he was the director of the psychiatry hospital in [[Melchor Romero]] (a locality of La Plata in [[Buenos Aires]]). He was the first university official in [[Latin America]]  to be elected thanks to the student's vote. He is considered to be the pioneer of Argentine philosophy. Along with [[Florentino Ameghino]], [[Juan Vucetich]], [[Pedro Bonifacio Palacios|Almafuerte]] and [[Carlos Spegazzini]], he is considered to be one of ''the five wise men'' of [[La Plata]].

==Biography==

=== Childhood, youth and family===
Alejandro Korn was born in [[San Vicente, Buenos Aires]]. His father, Carlos Adolfo Korn, was a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Germany|German]]-[[Prussian]] doctor and soldier, who had refused to take part in the repression that followed the worker's strike in the textile sector during the Social Revolution in 1848. Sentenced to death, he fled to [[Switzerland]] on horseback. There, he studied [[Medicine]] and  met his future wife, María Verena Meyer. He decided to migrate to Argentina, and there they got married. He settled down in [[San Vicente (Buenos Aires)]], where he worked as a doctor and a judge. He promoted the construction of the first flour mill and the lengthening of the railroad tracks to reach the city. He distinguished for his remarkable work fighting the [[cholera]] [[epidemics]], and, for that reason, he was awarded by the president [[Domingo F. Sarmiento]].&lt;ref name="Su entorno masónico"&gt;{{cite web

Alejandro Korn was the eldest of eight siblings. His only brother, Mauricio, would also become a doctor. In his youth, Alejandro showed an interest in culture and sport. In 1877 he settled down in [[Buenos Aires]] to study, first at the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]] and later at the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires]]'s College of Medicine.

Afterwards, he met and married María Villafañe, and settled in La Plata. They had seven children, four of which survived childhood. One of them, [[Alejandro Korn Villafañe]], was instrumental in the [[University Reform]] and is distinguished for his insights into catholic doctrine and his teaching position at the modern Escuela de La Plata. His other son, [[Guillermo Korn]], was a left-wing reformer and student leader, journalist, leader of the Socialist Party and national deputy, as well as a playwright and the founder of the ''Teatro del Pueblo'' in La Plata.

===Doctor===
He graduated in 1882, with his thesis ''Locura y crimen'' (“Insanity and crime”). He worked in the small towns of Navarro and Ranchos, where he was living at the time.

In 1888 he was appointed to police doctor. In 1897 he was appointed to director of the [[Hospital Provincial de Melchor Romero]], a hospital-colony with a surface of 80 hectares (which he would afterwards increase to 180 hectares), designed by his lodge mate [[Pedro Benoit]], placed 10 kilometers away from La Plata city, where Benoit lived.

It was inaugurated as a hospital in 1884, but then it specialized in treating mental diseases. It was the first hospital of its kind in Argentine, and, probably, in Latin America. Korn acted as director of Melchor Romero Hospital until 1916, when he resigned from the title in order to devote all his time and energies to philosophy. From 1900 onwards, his brother Mauricia Korn also worked there.

In 1910 he founded the ''Medical Association of La Plata'' where he acted as its president.

===Freemason===
Alejandro Korn entered in the Argentine [[Freemasonry]] on 15 June 1881, aged 21, in the Germania Nº 19 [[Masonic Lodge|lodge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logiamazzini.org.ar/masones_ilustres_argentinos.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922004533/http://www.logiamazzini.org.ar/masones_ilustres_argentinos.htm |archivedate=2013-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had entered the same lodge in Germany, and was a long-standing and  influential member, who had in fact helped his lodge establish in Argentina, with the help of his Freemason Brothers in the country.

When he was 23 years old, Alejandro was appointed to Venerable Maestro (“Venerable Master”) of his lodge. Later, he entered the La Plata Nº 80 lodge, which included other influential inhabitants of La Plata such as Carlos Spegazzini and Pedro Benoit.

===Politician===
He was a member of [[Unión Cívica Radical]]  (“Radical Civic Union”) since its foundation in 1891, and, in the 1893 Revolution, he was appointed by the Revolutionary Junta to La Plata's Intendant, a title that he held for some days until the defeat of the Revolution. In 1894, he was elected as a deputy of the UCR. He resigned from the title in 1897, to express his disapproval of a series of acts of corruption in the “Banco Hipotecario”, in which several other members he knew where involved.

In 1917 he was elected as a deputy of La Plata again as part of UCR, and he opted to the title of national deputy in 1918. In that year, he left the UCR, embraced the socialist beliefs and wrote ''Socialismo ético'' (“Ethical socialism”) and ''Incipit Vita Nova'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The new philosophy will liberate us from the nightmare of mechanic automatism, and will give us back the dignity of our conscious free personality, free and master of its own destiny…If we want a better world, we will build it… Socialism itself, beyond Marx’s well-known theorem, asks for solidarity, that is to say, a theoretical feeling.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1931 he entered the Socialist Party (Argentina). In 1934  he gave a much-praised  series of lectures in the “Casa del Pueblo de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires” (“Buenos Aires’s People’s House”). The lectures were titled ''Jean Jaurés'', ''Hegel y Marx'' (“Hegel and Marx”), and ''Antimarx'', and were published by the ''Revista Socialista'' (“Socialist magazine”) in February 1935.

In 1934 he was elected to be a “convencional constituyente” to help rewrite the Constitution of the Buenos Aires Province, but he resigned from that title as a protest for the fraud that the government had committed in those elections, as did [[Alfredo Palacios]] and his son Guillermo Korn.

===University Reformist===
Alejandro Korn was not only a teacher, but a high-level official in [[National University of La Plata|La Plata's]] and [[University of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires's]] Universities as well. He was also involved in the students’ reformist movement. In fact, both of his sons were leaders of students’ groups, though different ones.

In 1903 he entered in the [[National University of La Plata]] as councillor and vice-rector, when it was still a provincial one and [[Dardo Rocha]] was its rector. From that moment, he was the associate professor of the History of Philosophy Cathedra. The Obstetrics School was created thanks to his initiative.

In 1919, in a moment of social unrest, the students’ movement chose him to be responsible for the University, together with Carlos Spegazzini and Edelmiro Calvo.
In 1906 he entered as a teacher of the History of Philosophy Cathedra in Buenos Aires's University's Philosophy Faculty. In 1912 he was elected Faculty councillor, a title he held until 1918. That year, with the University Reform as background, he was elected dean by the students of the Philosophy Faculty in the [[University of Buenos Aires]], a title he held until 1921.

In 1918, Korn was one of the professors, together with [[José Ingenieros]], Alfredo Palacios and [[José Vasconcelos]], to be taken as a model by the students’ organization that promoted the University Reform throughout Latin America. Unlike the situation in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Cordoba]], where the movement was basically antischolastic, La Plata's reformism was marked by a strong antipositivism because clericalism was almost completely inexistent in La Plata. This [[Positivism|antipositivistic]] reaction was guided by Alejandro Korn. Between 1919 and 1922, he wrote several articles about the impact of the University Reform in the cultural renovation of Latin America.

His most remarkable work, ''La Libertad creadora'' (“The creative freedom”) was written as a request from the “Centro de Estudiantes”, a Buenos Aires Law Student's Association, to be published in their magazine ''Verbum'', in order to give basis to the transforming activities in which the reformist youth was embarked upon. It was written under the concepts that inspired his vision of an “ethical socialism”. The former Guatemala president [[Juan José Arévalo]], former pupil of Korn in [[National University of La Plata]] defined him as ''the professor par excellence''.

Deputy Silvia Augsburger claimed that Korn was the main thinker of the University Reform, in what concerns new syllabuses and modern teaching methods. Those aspects had also an important role in the agitated public debates in which Korn participated. Ahead of his time, following educationalist concepts that would be universally acknowledged in the 1950s, he remarked the need of make the student, as an active and creative subject, the center of the educationalist process. In ''La Reforma Universitaria'' (1919), he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Reform is a dynamic process, and its purpose is creating a new University spirit and giving the University back its lost prestige, being conscious of its mission and dignity. In order to attain so, the student’s participation in the University’s government is essential. They, and only they, represent the propulsion force, the efficient action, capable of moving inertia and avoid stagnation. Without them, nothing has been done, and nothing would have been done. The way in which they must intervene, that’s a secondary issue; the important thing is to make sure that they constitute such  a power, that nothing will be done without it. We have announced the advent of an intense ethical and aesthetical culture, purely Argentine, noble because of its yearning of social justice; a culture meant to exceed, without harming Science, an intellectualist and utilitarianist age. It is pleasing to observe the youth looking for the light of new ideals through different paths. A free cathedra surrounded by free students, who own and are responsible for their acts, will contribute towards forging the national character in a better way than the wordy tutelage of those who never even had strength of character themselves.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sportsman===
Korn practiced sport, especially [[fencing]],  and helped spread it in Argentina, when it wasn’t the popular activity it is today.

In 1891, with an economic, political and social crisis started in 1890 as background, he was elected President of [[Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]], a title he held until 1894. His most remarkable work, together with other leaders, was getting the estate enclosed by the streets Nº 1 and Nº 47 in order to build there the first sport's field of the club.

Together with [[José Ingenieros]], Alejandro Korn is considered to be the pioneer in Argentine philosophical thinking, and part of the foundational group of Latin American philosophy, together with [[Cuba]]n [[Enrique José Varona]], [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Antonio Caso]], [[Peru]]vian [[Alejandro Desutúa]], Uruguayan [[Carlos Vaz Ferreira]], [[Brazil]]ian [[Raimundo Farías Brito]] and [[Chile]]an [[Enrique Molina (philosopher)|Enrique Molina]].

Alejandro Korn's thinking inspired a profound renovation of Latin American philosophy, under the principles of the continental University Reform democratizing movement, in a moment when Argentina was experiencing a clash in order to exceed the “[[oligarchic republic]]”, which was based on electoral [[fraud]] and “voto cantado” (“spoken vote”), and establish a democratic system that had respect for the general will as its core. The people who read his works were mainly young reformist students and left-center political and social activists. The central theme of his work was the study of values and freedom. Two notable works are ''La libertad creadora'' (1922) and ''Axiología'' (1930).

The crux of Alejandro Korn's philosophy is the criticism towards [[positivism]] and naïve [[Philosophical realism|realism]], that is to say, the principles and conclusions, usually spontaneous, that are considered evident in each age, and which are present in every philosophical system, often as items from the rational analysis that are considered obvious.

Korn conceives philosophy as thought intimately related to the culture of the moment, and the moment itself, a reflexion that comes as a by-product of a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] linked to the problems and will of the specific individuals and democratic communities.

===The five wise men of the cultural beacon===
[[La Plata]] was conceived in  1882 as a cultural excellence center, open to the world, and specially open to Latin America. From its notable urbanistic design to its University and its famous Natural Sciences Museum, all the way up to the city's historical theaters and its extensive students’, teachers’ and researchers’ communities, with people from several regions and countries, La Plata established itself as an educational and scientific center, often called one of the ''Latin American cultural beacons''.

Korn was part of the core of that beacon, together with four other La Plata's citizens known as ''the five wise men'': poet [[Pedro Bonifacio Palacios|Almafuerte]], paleontologist and anthropologist [[Florentino Ameghino]], philosopher Alejandro Korn, biologist [[Carlos Luis Spegazzini]] and criminologist [[Juan Vucetich]].

''The five wise men'' were broadly the same sage: the two eldest ones, Ameghino and Almafuerte, were born in 1854, and the youngest, Korn himself, was born in 1860. Korn was, in addition, the last to die, in 1936; the first had been Ameghino in 1911.

==Works==

===The creative freedom (1920)===
''The Creative Freedom'' is a paper first published in 1920, by the ''Verbum'' magazine, by the Law Students Centre of the University of Buenos Aires. It was the time of the University Reform, started in 1918 in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and spread afterwards throughout [[Latin America]], which sought the generalization of the Latin American university kind that was found under a principle of autonomy, and with student participation in its government, as well as cathedra freedom. Korn had a decisive role in the University Reform, as a protagonist (he was the first dean to be elected by the students), and also as a thinker of the movement. In that way, ''The creative freedom'' is a profound philosophical reflexion about freedom, that sought boosting the role of the common man and woman, the “free subject”, as Korn called it, in the voluntarily transformation of the world.

[[Eugenio Pucciarelli]] wrote in the prologue to ''The creative freedom'' that “freedom is experienced as a liberation, as an emancipation from servitude, as an overcoming of an obstacle, as a triumph over resistance”. Korn himself stated that “our freedom would plunge if it were not leaning on the resistance that opposes it”.

The dynamics of [[antinomies]] is a fundamental trait of Alejandro Korn's thought. With the same approaching method, Korn stated that justice itself doesn’t exist, that there's only injustice and the constant fight against it towards the ideal of justice.

In order to understand the dynamics of [[Political freedom|freedom]], Alejandro Korn started from the comprehension of “I” and the “subject” as active entities, bestowed with their own initiative.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The subject does not stand before the world in a contemplative attitude, he is not, in any way, a disinterested spectator. Consciousness is the theater for the conflicts and harmonies between the subject that feel, judges and wants, and the object that adjusts and resists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Korn gave priority to the concept of  ''present time'' over the concept of ''reality''. Reality, defined from the idea of ''thing'', tends to form a static and passive field, whereas present time, defined from the idea of ''act'', tends to form dynamic processes, always changing and influenced by human decisions. From this theory, Korn outlined a criticism for language when he says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A philosophy treatise, in order to be logical, should be written using verbs and not a single noun. We never use a verb without referring it to a noun or a pronoun that substitutes it. This way of using the language, suggested by the relative stagnancy of things, derives from naïve realism and leads us towards mistakes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Korn approached the concept of ''creative freedom'' through the [[antinomy]] of the objective world and the subjective world. The objective world, he said, obeys necessary rules, whereas the subjective world has no rules, it's free.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Kant’s third antinomy states, in a concise way, the philosophical problem par excellence: the joint affirmation of necessity and freedom.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this conflict between freedom and necessity emerges a permanent process of both scientific and technical development that seeks obtaining power over the objective world and [[ethical]] self-domain of the subjective world that seeks subjugating necessity to freedom, thus reaching freedom itself in its uttermost development, dynamically linking power and will (desire).

Freedom, thus understood, as an action, transformation and taking of an ethical position by an autonoumus subject, is referred to as ''creative freedom'' by Alejandro Korn

'''Anavastha''' (Sanskrit: अनवस्था) is a [[Sanskrit]] nominal compound derived from the verb ''Stha'' (meaning ''standing'', ''resting'', ''grounded'' or ''founded''). The expression literally means: that which does not stand down, non-resting, unstable, holding no definite position, un-grounded or without foundation. It can also mean unsettled condition or character or absence of finality or conclusion. As a philosophical term it refers to the non-finality of a proposition or endless series of statements or ''regressus ad infinitum'' ([[infinite regress]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=anavastha&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Buddhist Thought and Applied Psychological Research:Transcending the Boundaries|publisher= Routledge |page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gue4a7Xpe9wC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=anavastha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ng1cZkxWr_&amp;sig=ur7jL6hIPwC2zSZi55Pst1qUae0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tUOgUpaJM6bH7Abe9ICQAg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol.15 Part 2|author= Baman Das Basu|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=565|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dn_SVa0vgzcC&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=anavastha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cX64Jl3jj6&amp;sig=XRD8Hz7yc_wrSY4wcHKyWEKnJsc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tUOgUpaJM6bH7Abe9ICQAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hindi language]], as a noun Anavastha means Nothingness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hinkhoj.com|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-anavastha-in-english.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In Indian thought and Indian logic ''Anavastha'' is an important doctrine. All major schools of philosophy have examined and commented upon this concept and laid down guidelines so as to avoid the endless series of statements and propositions and the non-finality of those propositions. Certain aphorisms of [[Pāṇini]], in his [[Ashtadhyayi]] indicate that ''[[asiddhatva]]'' leads to ''anavastha'' since rules which cause endless repetition of application cannot be there because application of a rule should certainly result in finality. The word अत्र ''atra'' of Sutra 6.4.22 indicates that two rules must have the same आश्रय ''āśraya'' or place of operation but where their places of operation are different they are not ''asiddha'' to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadhyayi Vol.9|author=Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=202–204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFiCjATkpP4C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=anavastha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3-hUqS0BMWw7AbEl4CwBw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The automatic application of ''sutras'' (rules of grammar) to take place without generating unintended results requires the establishment of a particular sequence among the rules and also the provision for cyclical application as well as blocking of some rules whenever it is desirable to do so. Panini orders rules and methods for their activation, reactivation and non-activation, and provides that the results brought about by some rules will not be 'known' to certain other rules, so that the question of these other rules becoming activated does not arise. The best example of the application of this method is known as ''Asiddhatva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in South Asia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89aPZJ3qCD4C&amp;pg=PA210}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the concept of ''[[Asiddhatva]]'' to prevent the application of a rule on the substitute, to enable its application on a substituent and to mandate its application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asiddhatva principle in Computational Model of Ashtadhyayi|author=Sridhar Subbana|publisher=|page=1|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-17528-2_18#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kiparsky’s definitions, ''Asiddhatva'' implies 'no order of taking effect' since ''asiddha'' means 'not having taken effect'.

==Vedic concept==
The [[Upanishads]] speak about the two-fold Brahman, the one with attributes called the ''Saguna Brahman'', and the other without attributes called the ''Nirguna Brahman'' only to deny and accept these two to state that Brahman is One. [[Brahman]] is called
''Nirguna'' because Brahman has not the three ''[[Guna]]s'' of ''[[Prakrti]]'', and not because Brahman has got no ''gunas'' absolutely; in order to prove the substantive existence of Brahman (''prameya''), Brahman is called ''Saguna'' even though there is absence of ''Gunas'' in Brahman (''aprameya''). Brahman is One, and Oneness cannot be confounded with non-oneness; also oneness does not require another oneness to differentiate through second oneness or a third to differentiate the second oneness, otherwise there will be no end or conclusion. This fallacy is ''Anavastha'' or infinite regress. The [[Vedas]] advise that Brahman must be looked at in one and one mode only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol.15 Part 2|author= Baman Das Basu|publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=561–565|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dn_SVa0vgzcC&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=anavastha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cX64Jl3jj6&amp;sig=XRD8Hz7yc_wrSY4wcHKyWEKnJsc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tUOgUpaJM6bH7Abe9ICQAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In created things differences are of three kinds – 1) Existing in oneself, 2) difference in species and 3) difference in genus. In three words denoting a) 'oneness of Brahman', the ''svajatiya-bheda'', b) 'restriction', the ''svagata-bheda'' and 3) 'rejection of duality', the ''vijatiya-bheda'', these three differences are negated by the Sruti texts ([[Panchadasi]] Stanzas II.20&amp;21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swammi|author=Swammi Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=38–39|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/pancadasi-of-sri-vidyaranya-swami/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The created things are many, a chain of causes and effects is also present, but to avoid the fallacy of ''anavastha'', it is necessary to consider Brahman as the root cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Vaishnava Interpretation of the Brahmasutras:Vedanta and Theism |author=Ramapada Cattopadhyaya|publisher=BRILL|pages=25, 85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XY_nOafZ84C&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=samadhipada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1_yjUpK-OpOI7AbR2ICICQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vedanta]] does not admit the existence of the relation of ''samvaya'' (the inseparable inherence or concomitant cause or combining force) as subsisting between two different entities such as substance and qualities. In his Brahmasutra-bhashya II.ii.13, [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that if a ''samvaya'' relation is to be admitted to connect two things, then another ''samvaya'' would be necessary to connect it with either of the two entities that it intended to connect. Thus,there are two kinds of ''Anavastha'' - the ''Pramaniki'', the valid infinite, and the ''Apramaniki'', the vicious infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Systems of Indian Philosophy|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=209|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FWLRyXBzgsoC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=Anavastha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEehUtqsAYWYhQeI94HQBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Anavastha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge is ''[[Chaitanya (consciousness)|Chaitanya]]'' (''anubhuti'') i.e. [[Consciousness]], and consciousness reveals the reality of objects. An object cannot be talked about if it does not exist. Any attempt to find out whether the second knowledge that reveals the first knowledge identical with it is a separate knowledge or not leads to ''anavastha''. Because the first knowledge is a revelation, there is no second knowledge that reveals the first knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita Vedanta and Vaishnavism|author=Sanjukta Gupta|publisher=Routledge|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4AFxluCHsoAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Anavastha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEehUtqsAYWYhQeI94HQBA&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consciousness]] cannot be perceived, it perceives itself and is not perceived by any greater source; the logical fallacy of ''Anavastha'' (an endless series of cause and effect) would exist if it were to be said that Consciousness requires another source of perception (Devi GitaIV.12-13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi Gita|author=Swami Satyananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqeK1wVsiTIC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=anavastha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uHmhUpitJ4m07Qb1v4DAAg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no eternal First Cause, the logical fallacy of ''Anavastha Dosha'' is inevitable.

==Yoga concept==
In [[Yoga]], Ecstasy is the yogic visualization of a deity. And, the beginning five states of ecstasy induced by ''Cakra'' are – birth, childhood, youth, maturity and adulthood; the 6th is ''unmana'' ( also said to denote the dreaming state) meaning agitation or excitement when the devotee often swoons; and when this occurs and when the strong desire to experience the ultimate ''parabrahman'' holds complete sway then the 7th state i.e. ''manollasa'' (extreme exhilaration) or anavastha (the state beyond states or state without qualities or locale)(also said to denote the dreamless sleep) is reached (Kularnava-tantra.

According to [[Hemachandra]], Anavastha is a ''Dosha'', a defect or fault along with ''virodha'', ''vaiyadhikarana'', ''samkara'', ''samsaya'', ''vyatikara'', ''apratipatti'' and ''abhava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indica et Tibetica|author=Michael Hahn|page=483|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5NoQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Anavastha&amp;dq=Anavastha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEehUtqsAYWYhQeI94HQBA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBDgK}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the dialectical principles applied alongside ''atmasraya'', ''anyonyasraya'', ''cakraka'', ''atiprasanga'', ''ubhayatahspasa'' and the like employed by logicians from very early times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Dialectics: Methods of Philosophical Discussions Vol.1|author=Esther Abraham Solomon|publisher=B.J.Institute of Learning and Research|page=509|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L-EMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Anavastha&amp;dq=Anavastha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NEShUqfaFYiqhAf0pIDwBA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sriharsa explains that dialectical reasoning, which has its foundation in pervasion, can lead to contradiction when the reasoning becomes fallacious, it is the limit of doubt; and since differing unwanted contrary options create new doubts difficult to resolve which lead to ''anavastha'' or infinite regress and there is the absence of finality. The argument that contradiction cannot block an infinite regress is rejected; it is the doubter’s own behaviour that process the lie to the doubt, that blocks it (''[[pratibandhaka]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Indian Metaphysics:Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of New Logic|author= Stephen H.

This particular state has 21 sub-species beginning with ''asiddhatva'', which is the state of unholiness, when the spiritual perfection is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Doctrine of Karman in Jain Philosophy|author=Helmuth von Glasenap|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-5sKkV1XQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=asiddhatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FbqlUs30DYXH7Abmt4HwAg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asiddhatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist concept==
[[Nagarjuna]] states that if there is a characteristic of the conditioned other than origination (''utpada''), existence (''stithi''), and destruction (''bhanga''), there would be infinite regress (''anavastha''). If there is no such characteristic, these are not conditioned (''na samskrta''). The quest to find the origination of origination which originations are all conditioned by ''dharma'' is a never-ending cycle and leads to infinite regress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist teaching in India|author= Johannes Bronkhorst| authorlink = Johannes Bronkhorst |publisher=Wisdom Publications Inc.|page=138|url=

If ''pramanas'' are established through other ''pramanas'' it would result in infinite regress, then nothing can be established. Negation can be of an existent self-nature, if that self-nature does not exist it cannot be negated; the negation of non-existent entity is established without words.(Vigrha-vyartani Karika Stanza 11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagarjunian Disputations: A philosophical journey through an Indian Looking Glass|author= Thomas E.

Nagarjuna tends to equate lack of ''svabhava'' with dependence on causes and conditions and not with parts, and his argument that dependently originated things lacked ''svabhava'' and were ''prajnaptisat'' or conventionally existing entities, and that all ''dharmas'' are ''prajnapisat'' does lead to an infinite regress or ''anavastha'' and is, therefore, not valid. ''Samyutta Nikaya'' summarises the doctrine of 'dependent-origination' in terms of the necessary conditions for something to be, which doctrine is applied by ''Sarvastivadins'' to determine whether or not an entity ultimately existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture|author=Joseph Walser|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUmrdqQ8Vz8C&amp;pg=PT321&amp;dq=anavastha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wBGkUu-QItLT7Aat24DYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=anavastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chokmâh''''' ({{lang|he|[[:wikt:חכמה|חָכְמָה]]}} ,חכמה [[ISO 259]] {{transl|he|ḥoḵma}} or ''khok-maw''') is the [[Biblical Hebrew]] word rendered as "[[wisdom]]" in English Bible versions ([[LXX]] {{lang|grc|σοφία}} ''[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'', [[Vulgate]] ''{{lang|la|sapientia}}'').&lt;ref name=Strong&gt;''[[Strong's Concordance]]'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2451&amp;t=KJV H2451]:
"from H2449 [חָכַם ''chakam'' "wise"]; wisdom (in a good sense):—skilful, wisdom, wisely, wit."
"The KJV translates Strong's H2451 in the following manner: wisdom (145x), wisely (2x), skilful man (1x), wits (1x)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word occurs 149 times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;
The Talmud ([[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 31a) describes knowledge of the Talmudic order of [[Kodshim]] as a high level of wisdom, ''chokhmah''.

It is [[cognate]] with the Arabic word for "wisdom", ''[[ḥikma]]'' {{lang|ar|حكمة}} ([[Semitic root]] {{lang|sem|ḥ-k-m}}). 
Adjectival {{transl|he|[[hakham|ḥaḵam]]}} "wise" is used as a honorific, as in ''[[Talmid Chacham]]'' (lit. "student of a sage") for a  [[Torah study|Torah scholar]], or ''[[hakham Bashi]]'' for a [[chief rabbi]].

In the [[Kabbalah]], ''Chokhmah'' is the uppermost of the [[sephirot]] of the right line (''kav yamin'', the "Pillar of Mercy") in the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. 
It is to the bottom right of [[Keter (Kabbalah)|Keter]], with [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] across from it. Under it are the ''sephirot'' of [[Chesed (Kabbalah)|Chesed]] and [[Netzach (Kabbalah)|Netzach]]. It commonly has four paths going to Keter, Binah, [[Tiphereth (Kabbalah)|Tifereth]], and Chesed. (Some kabbalists{{Who|date=July 2010}} attribute a path between Chokhmah and [[Gevurah (Kabbalah)|Gevurah]].)

==Hebrew Bible==
{{see|Sophia (wisdom)}}
Proverbs personifies Divine Wisdom, which existed before the world was made, revealed God, and acted as God's agent in creation ({{bibleverse||Prov|8:22–31|KJV}} cf. 3:19; {{bibleverse||Wisdom|8:4-6|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Sir|1:4,9|KJV}}). Wisdom dwelt with God ({{bibleverse||Prov|8:22–31|KJV}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Sir|24:4|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Wisdom|9:9-10|KJV}}) and being the exclusive property of God was as such inaccessible to human beings ({{bibleverse||Job|28:12–13, 20–1, 23–27|KJV}}). It was God who "found" wisdom ({{bibleverse||Bar|3:29-37|KJV}}) and gave her to [[Israelites|Israel]]: "He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men." ({{bibleverse||Bar|3:36-37|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Sir|24:1-12|KJV}}). As a female figure (Sir. 1:15; Wis. 7:12), wisdom addressed human beings (Prov. 1:20–33; 8:1–9:6) inviting to her feast those who are not yet wise (Prov. 9:1-6). 
Wisdom 7:22b-8:1 is a famous passage describing Divine Wisdom, including the passage:
"For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets." ({{bibleverse||Wisdom|7:25-27|KJV}}). 
[[Solomon]], as the archetypal wise person, fell in love with Wisdom: "I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty." ({{bibleverse||Wisdom|8:2|KJV}}).&lt;ref&gt;For a summary account of wisdom in the Hebrew Bible cf. R.E. Murphy, "Wisdom in the Old Testament", ''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' (1992), vi. 920–931.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kabbalah==
{{More footnotes|date=July 2010}}
According to the Bahir: "The second (utterance) is [[wisdom]], as is written: 'Y-H-W-H acquired me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old' (Prov 8:22). And there is no 'beginning' but wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Green. ''A Guide to the Zohar''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chokhmah, the second of the ten sefirot, is the first power of conscious intellect within Creation, and the first point of 'real' existence, since Keter represents emptiness. According to the book of Job, "Wisdom comes from nothingness".&lt;ref&gt;Job. 28:12&lt;/ref&gt; This point is both infinitely small, and yet encompasses the whole of being, but it remains incomprehensible until it is given shape and form in [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of God associated with Chokhmah is [[Yah (Yahweh)|Yah]].

Chokhmah  appears in the configuration of the ''sefirot'' at the top of the right axis, and corresponds in the ''tzelem Elokim'' ("the Divine image") to the right eye, or right hemisphere of the brain.

In its fully articulated form, Chokhmah  possesses two ''partzufim'' ("faces" or "features"): the higher of these is referred to as ''Abba Ila'ah'' ("the higher father"), whereas the lower is referred to as Yisrael Saba ("Israel, the Elder"). These two ''partzufim'' are referred to jointly as ''Abba'' ("father").

Chokhmah is associated in the soul with the power of intuitive insight, flashing lightning-like across consciousness. The ''partzuf'' of ''Abba Ila'ah'' is associated with the power to spontaneously extract such insight from the superconscious realm, whereas the ''partzuf'' of ''Yisrael Saba'' is associated with the power to subsequently direct it into consciousness.

The "wisdom" of Chokhmah also implies the ability to look deeply at some aspect of reality and abstract its conceptual essence till one succeeds in uncovering its underlying axiomatic truth. These seeds of truth can then be conveyed to the companion power of Binah for the sake of intellectual analysis and development.

Chokhmah is the primary ("beginning") force in the creative process, [[Creativity]], as it is said: "You have made them all with Chokhmah." (Psalms 104:24) The first word of the [[Torah]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], ''Breishit'' means "In the beginning (God created the heavens and the earth)", is translated (Targum Yonatan) as "With Chokhmah (God created…)."

Chokhmah is also called Fear, 'because it has no measure of boundary, and therefore the mind does not have the power to grasp it'.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt; The book of Job states 'Behold the fear of God is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding' (Job 28:28).

In the array of sefirot in three columns (''gimel kavim''), Chokmah is situated at the top of the right column, and corresponds to the right hemisphere of the [[brain]]. There are several aspects of Chokhmah:

The word Chokhmah itself may be broken into two words -- ''koach'' ("potential") and ''ma'' ("what is"). Thus, Chokhmah means "the potential of what is", or, "the potential to be." This aspect of Chokhmah describes the state of Chokhmah in relation to the sefira of Keter. As Chokhmah emanates from Keter, the first dawning of the "Infinite Light", it "appears" in an obscure and undefined state that is a virtual non-being. Thus the verse states, "and Chokhmah emerges from nothingness" (Job 28:12, see Zohar II, 121a, Zohar III, 290a, commentaries). The light of the [[Ein Sof (Kabbalah)|Ein Sof]] becomes unified in the world of ''[[Atziluth]]'' through clothing itself first in the sefira of Chokhmah. In the soul, Chokhmah is associated with the power of intuitive insight.

In the Zohar Chokhmah is the primordial point which shines forth from the will of God and thus, is the starting point of Creation. All things are still undifferentiated at this point and only become intelligible at Binah.

&lt;!--

The word Chokhmah  is read in the [[Zohar]] (Numbers 220b) as ''koach mah'', "the power of selflessness", or, alternatively, as ''cheich mah'', "the palate of selflessness."

"The power of selflessness" implies not only the attribute of selflessness itself, but the great creative power that selflessness entails.

"The palate of selflessness" is the soul's ability to "taste" Divinity by virtue of one's state of selflessness, as is said (Psalms 34:8): "Taste and see that God is good." In general, the sense of sight relates to Chokhmah  (the lightning-flash referred to above). From this verse we learn that there is an inner, spiritual sense of taste in Chokhmah  that precedes and arouses the sense of sight.

In Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]]'s commentary on the [[Bahir]] he says "Wisdom (Chokhmah) is therefore the first thing that the mind can grasp, and is therefore called a "beginning." and according to the [[Hasidic Judaism]] site Inner.org, Chokhmah refers to "the first power of conscious intellect within Creation."

==Qualities derived from Chokhmah==

===Ethical Behaviour===
Chokhmah has 2 faces, one facing keter above, and the other overseeing the over sefirot. Therefore, to emulate this Sefira, one aspect should be in communion with his Creator in order to increase his wisdom, and the other should be to teach others the wisdom that the Holy One has endowed him.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Modern occultism==
According to the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], the name of God associated with Chokmah is [[Jehovah]], the [[archangel]] that presides over it is [[Raziel]], the order of [[angel]]s that reside in it are the [[Ophanim]] (the wheels), the Heaven of [[Assiah]] associated with it is called Mazloth, implying the fulfillment of destiny, and the mundane chakra associated with it is the [[Zodiac]].

In [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[Liber 777]]'', Chokhma is represented as The Four twos of the [[Tarot]], Illuminating, [[Thoth]], [[Vishnu]], [[Philosophy of happiness|Joy]], [[Odin]], [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], [[Athena]], [[God]] the Father, [[Man]], [[Amaranth]], [[Lingam]], [[Hashish]], [[Phosphorus]], [[Musk]], and [[yin and yang|Yang]] (not a complete list).

'''Father Claude Sumner, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] '''was a Canadian professor of philosophy who worked at  [[Addis Ababa University]] from 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Teodros Kiros, "Doing African Philosophy: Claude Sumner's Work on Ethiopian Philosophy", ''New Political Science'' 16.1 (1995), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; He was best known for his work on [[Ethiopian philosophy]], and in particular for introducing the philosophers [[Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]] to the English-speaking world.

A '''concordance''' is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work, listing every instance of each word with its immediate [[context (language use)#Verbal context|context]]. Only works of special importance have had concordances prepared for them, such as the [[Vedas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Maurice | last = Bloomfield| authorlink = Maurice Bloomfield | title = A Vedic Concordance| year  = 1990| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| isbn = 81-208-0654-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bible]], [[Qur'an]] or the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[James Joyce]] or classical Latin and Greek authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Roy | last = Wisbey | authorlink = Roy Wisbey | title = Concordance Making by Electronic Computer: Some Experiences with the Wiener Genesis| journal = The Modern Language Review | publisher = Modern Humanities Research Association | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 161–172 | date = April 1962 | doi=10.2307/3720960}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-[[computer]] era. 
[[File:Mordechai nathan hebrew latin concordance.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Mordecai Nathan's Hebrew-Latin Concordance of the Bible]]

A concordance is more than an index; additional material make producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers, such as commentary, definitions, and topical cross-indexing.

In the precomputing era, [[search engine technology|search]] technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for. Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as [[latent semantic indexing]] have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.

A '''bilingual concordance''' is a concordance based on [[aligned parallel text]].

A '''topical concordance''' is a list of subjects that a book covers (usually The Bible), with the immediate context of the coverage of those subjects. Unlike a traditional concordance, the indexed word does not have to appear in the verse. The best-known topical concordance is [[Nave's Topical Bible]].

The first [[Bible concordance]] was compiled for the [[Vulgate]] Bible by [[Hugh of St Cher]] (d.1262), who employed 500 monks to assist him. In 1448, Rabbi Mordecai Nathan completed a concordance to the Hebrew Bible. It took him ten years. A concordance to the Greek New Testament was published in 1599 by [[Henri Estienne (elder)|Henry Stephens]], and the Septuagint was done a couple of years later by Conrad Kircher in 1602. The first concordance to the English Bible was published in 1550 by Mr Marbeck. According to Cruden, it did not employ the verse numbers devised by [[Robert Estienne|Robert Stephens]] in 1545, but "the pretty large concordance" of Mr Cotton did. Then followed [[Cruden's Concordance]] and [[Strong's Concordance]].

==Use in linguistics==
Concordances are frequently used in [[linguistics]], when studying a text. For example:
* comparing different usages of the same word
* analysing keywords
* analysing [[word frequencies]]
* finding and analysing phrases and [[idioms]]
* finding [[translation]]s of subsentential elements, e.g. [[terminology]], in [[Bitext#Bitexts and translation memories|bitexts and translation memories]]
* creating indexes and word lists (also useful for publishing)

Concordancing techniques are widely used in national [[text corpora]] such as [[American National Corpus]], [[British National Corpus]], and [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] available on-line.  Stand-alone applications that employ concordancing techniques are known as [[Concordancer|concordancers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexically.net/wordsmith/introduction.htm?gclid=COjFnvGKhakCFVJX4Qod-RqjjQ Introduction to WordSmith]&lt;/ref&gt; or more advanced [[corpus manager|corpus managers]]. Some of them have integrated [[Part of speech tagger|part-of-speech taggers]] and enable the user to create his/her own [[part of speech|POS]]-annotated corpora to conduct various type of searches adopted in corpus linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/linguistic-toobox-a-concordancer.html Linguistic Toolbox]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inversion==

The reconstruction of the text of some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] involved a concordance.

Access to some of the scrolls was governed by a "secrecy rule" that allowed only the original International Team or their designates to view the original materials. After the death of [[Roland de Vaux]] in 1971, his successors repeatedly refused to even allow the publication of photographs to other scholars. This restriction was circumvented by [[Martin Abegg]] in 1991, who used a computer to "invert" a concordance of the missing documents made in the 1950s which had come into the hands of scholars outside of the International Team, to obtain an approximate reconstruction of the original text of 17 of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Hawrysch |first= George |title= Dr. George Hawrysch's speech on concordance book launch |work= The Ukrainian Weekly, No. 31, Vol. LXX |publisher= Ukrainian National Association |date= 2002-08-04 |url= http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/2002/310217.shtml |accessdate= 2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Jillette |first= Penn |title= You May Already be a "Computer Expert" |url= http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc/deadsea.html |accessdate= 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by the release of the original text of the scrolls.

==Overview==
Darsanalaya Ashram started with the same spirit of Jesus Christ and [[Blessed Chavara]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blessedchavara.org Blessed Kuriakose Elias Chavara&lt;/ref&gt; It is a place of silence and solitude. The Ashram vicinity is powered with spiritual vibrations. This is an Ashram where people can come from all lifestyles irrespective of caste and creed.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Ethnic diversity==
The village population consists of different [[Culture of India|castes and traditions]]. The main classes of people in this area are Jats, Rajputs, Brahmins, Ahirs, Banias, Harijans and Gujars.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Almost all belong to agricultural communities. There are also categories like village artisans, craftsmen and certain other menials who helped in the agricultural operations. These included the village blacksmith, the carpenter, the oil man, the barber, the washer man, the village potter and some others.

==Ambiance==
Darsanalaya keeps an atmosphere of silence in and around the ashram vicinity. The people who visit the ashram enjoy the simple vegetarian food and fresh air with yoga and meditation in the atmosphere of silence. The ashram has developed an idea of ''Garbhagraha Anubhava'' meditation (Womb Experience). Dr. Aji Sebastian the visionary and the Acharya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darsanalaya.org/acharya.html |title=Acharya of Darsanalaya Ashram |publisher=Darsanalaya.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Director) of the Ashram were in silence for a year in Saccidananda Ashram,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmibhopal.in/houses.php?show=19 Saccidananda Ashram]&lt;/ref&gt; at Narsinghpur, M.P. state of India, for the experiment of ''Garbhagraha Anubhava''.

In this busy world, people are in stress and confusion and they always run here and there for solace. When a human being was in the womb of its mother, it was alone in its solitude. In this busy world, people forget the cause of their life, i.e. solitude and silence. Darsanalaya Ashram is a place to repose in the busy schedule of this world.

Ashram inmates observe and study the problems and issues of the world. The problems relate to children, women, rich and poor, healthy and weak, family and society; each individual in the community is responsible for the things that happen in the society.

Darsanalaya promotes the eco-friendly life style and raises a voice against social evils like child labor, HIV/AIDS discrimination and its stigma, sex imbalance, abortion, women feticide, poverty, and sexual abuse, while trying to promote value-based education in rural and urban areas, religious harmony and ecumenical fellowship, creating equality, solidarity and friendship among people.

Darsanalaya Ashram and its activities originate from the deeper levels of meditation in solitude and silence. The divine energy that proceeds from meditation moves to social activities. Many people from far and near are members of the Darsanalaya family, and behind the Darsanalaya Ashram's humanitarian and developmental activities. The vision of the ashram been fulfilled, ‘with the people for the goodness’.

People from different parts of the country and abroad visit the Arogalaya for treatment. It has consulting centers in different parts of the country.

===Navadarsan===
The inspiration for Nava Darsan is from the words of [[APJ Abdul Kalam]], former President of India.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Dream, Dream, Dream'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Dreams transform into thoughts''&lt;br /&gt;
''And thoughts result in action"'' (Ignited Minds, P.1)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea of the Nava Darsan (New Vision), value-added education program originates from the group discussion of experts in the field of academics, social scientists, social workers, educators, artists, film directors, politicians and principals of CBSE schools. The discussion resulted in formulating the objectives for the Nava Darshan Education Program.

The aims and objectives of the Nava Darshan Education Program:

''•	To promote value based classes.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To give clear cut sex education.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To find out the leadership qualities of the children.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To create a stage for interaction and to widen their world.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To create a sensitive generation for the future.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To shape the youngsters into persons with a strong character and outgoing personality.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To give dreams for the youngsters.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To find out the talents of students.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To provide counseling, yoga Training, and Meditation techniques to the children to reduce the stress and to increase the concentration and meaning in life.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To make a better rapport between the parents, teachers and children.&lt;br /&gt;
''•	To conduct animation programs for teachers and parents through the schools.''

There are thousands of schools in government and private sectors. Years of experience with the students and parents made a few issues clear, related to this field. Stress among the students, identity crisis, broken family relationships, emotionally imbalanced teachers, the aimless life etc. were a few burning issues of study findings.

The society sponsors over a hundred brilliant and poor children from the villages. It is not only to provide a little financial support, but to give formation to these children though seminars, talent shows, sports and games etc. Darsanalaya provides sponsorship to one hundred and thirty students for their studies from 13 schools around the Ashram. Nava Darshan aspirants have regular get-togethers, classes, seminars, sport and literary competitions etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6187">'''Dualism in Indian philosophy''' refers to the belief held by certain schools of [[Indian philosophy]] that reality is fundamentally composed of two parts. This mainly takes the form of either mind-matter dualism in [[Buddhist philosophy]] or consciousness-matter dualism in the [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. These can be contrasted with [[mind-body dualism]] in Western [[philosophy of mind]], but also have similarities with it.

Another form of dualism in Hindu philosophy is found in the [[Dvaita]] ("dualism") [[Vedanta]] school, which regards God and the world as two realities with distinct essences; this is a form of [[theistic dualism]]. By contrast, schools such as [[Advaita]] ("nondualism") Vedanta embrace absolute [[monism]] and regard dualism as an illusion (''[[Maya (religion)|maya]]'').

==Buddhist philosophy==
[[File:Dharmakirti.gif|thumb|150 px|right|Dharmakīrti, a key theorist of [[Buddhist atomism]].]]
During the classical era of [[Buddhist philosophy]] in India, philosophers such as [[Dharmakirti]] argued for a dualism between states of consciousness and [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atoms]] (the basic building blocks that make up reality), according to the "standard interpretation" of Dharmakirti's Buddhist [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges B.J. Dreyfus, ''Recognizing Reality'', SUNY Press 1996 ({{ISBN|978-0791430989}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samkhya and Yogic philosophy==
While [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical traditions]], as exemplified by Descartes, equate mind with the conscious self and theorize on consciousness on the basis of mind/body dualism; some [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophies]] provide an alternate viewpoint, intimately related to [[substance dualism]], by drawing a metaphysical line between consciousness and matter — where matter includes both body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], two of the six orthodox ([[āstika]]) schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], "there are two irreducible, innate and independent realities: 1) [[consciousness]] itself ([[Purusha]]), and 2) primordial materiality ([[Prakriti]])".{{cn|date=December 2017}} The unconscious primordial materiality, Prakriti, contains 23 components including intellect ([[buddhi]], mahat), ego ([[ahamkara]]) and mind ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]). Therefore, the intellect, mind and ego are all seen as forms of unconscious matter.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from Purusha. Consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or 'shapes' assumed by the mind. So intellect after receiving cognitive structures form the mind and illumination from pure consciousness creates thought structures that appear to be conscious.&lt;ref name="page342"&gt;Isaac, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates.&lt;ref name="page342"/&gt;

By including mind in the realm of matter, Samkhya-Yoga avoids one of the most serious pitfalls of Cartesian dualism, the violation of physical conservation laws.{{according to|date=December 2017}} Because mind is an evolute of matter, mental events are granted causal efficacy and are therefore able to initiate bodily motions.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dvaita philosophy==
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D.

:''See also [[Exhaustion of intellectual property rights]] for a general introduction not limited to U.S. law.''

The '''exhaustion doctrine''', also referred to as the first sale doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The term "exhaustion doctrine" is used in patent cases. The term "first sale doctrine" is used in copyright cases. Compare [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]] (patent) with [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] (copyright).&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S. [[common law]] [[patent]] doctrine that limits the extent to which patent holders can control an individual article of a patented product after a so-called authorized sale. Under the doctrine, once an authorized sale of a patented article occurs, the patent holder's exclusive rights to control the use and sale of that article are said to be "exhausted," and the purchaser is free to use or resell that article without further restraint from patent law. However, under the repair and reconstruction doctrine, the patent owner retains the right to exclude purchasers of the articles from making the patented invention anew (i.e., making another article), unless it is specifically authorized by the patentee to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 377 U.S. 476 (1964); ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961); ''Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Co.'', 152 U.S. 425 (1894); ''Cotton-Tie Co. v. Simmons'', 106 U.S. 89 (1882). See also ''Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther'', 377 U.S. 422 (1964) (purchaser may modify article to improve or alter functionality).&lt;/ref&gt;

Procedurally, the patent exhaustion doctrine operates as an [[affirmative defense]], shielding authorized purchasers from infringement claims concerning the sale or use (including repair and modification) of a patented product after the patent owner authorized its sale.

Because only an "authorized" sale triggers the doctrine, it may be difficult or at least controversial to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine applies in a particular case: for example, when the patentee purports to restrict or condition the use or resale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user ([[post-sale restraint|post-sale restrictions]]); or when the patentee licenses another to manufacture and use or sell the patented product only in a particular field. The 2008 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', arguably leaves unclear the extent to which patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by means of so-called limited licenses (licenses limited to a specified field of use). Since its development by the courts in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Adams v. Burke'', 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873).&lt;/ref&gt; the patent exhaustion doctrine has raised questions regarding the scope of exclusive rights granted by patents and the extent to which a patent owner may extend those rights to control downstream use and sales of patented articles.

== Overview ==

A patent gives the patent owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing into the U.S. the patented invention (i.e., a product embodying the invention) during the term of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;35 U.S.C. § 271(a)(2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional rationale behind providing these exclusive rights is to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 8&lt;/ref&gt; by providing inventors the incentive to invest their time, labor, and funds in researching and developing innovative technology.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Landes &amp; Richard A. Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law 294 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Providing these protections, however, comes with social costs (monopoly rents) and limits the public's ability to freely alienate patented goods. Thus, public policy dictates that the patent owner's exclusive rights be limited in scope. Generally, when a patent owner receives compensation for the use of his or her invention through sale of a patented product, the purpose of patent law is fulfilled with respect to that product.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co.'', 157 U.S. 659, 666-67 (1895) ("The conclusion reached does not deprive a patentee of his just rights, because no article can be unfettered from the claim of his monopoly without paying its tribute. The inconvenience and annoyance to the public that an opposite conclusion would occasion are too obvious to require illustration.").&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving compensation, the patent owner's rights to exclude others are exhausted and "the patent law affords no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', 316 U.S. 241, 251 (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, a patent owner's voluntary introduction of a patented product into commerce without restriction prevents the patent owner from exercising any claimed right to exclude others from using or reselling the sold product.&lt;ref&gt;Exhaustion occurs also when a product is given away. ''Lifescan Scotland, Ltd. v. Shasta Technologies'', 734 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the analogous [[first-sale doctrine]] in copyright, the patent exhaustion doctrine has not been codified into the patent statute, and is thus still a [[common law]] doctrine. It was first explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in 1873 in ''[[Adams v. Burke]]''.&lt;ref&gt;84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). The ''Adams'' decision referred to earlier 19th century decisions whose language supported the proposition, but in slightly different contexts. In [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]], a 2013 copyright decision, the Supreme Court termed the exhaustion principle "a common-law doctrine with an impeccable historic pedigree," and cited 15th and 17th century exhaustion precedents.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the patentee Adams assigned to another the right to make, use, and sell patented coffin lids only within a ten-mile radius of Boston. Burke (an undertaker), a customer of the assignee, bought the coffin lids from the manufacturer-assignee within the ten-mile radius, but later used (and effectively resold) the patented coffin lids outside of the ten-mile radius, in his trade in the course of burying a person. The patentee Adams sued the undertaker Burke for patent infringement, but the Supreme Court found no infringement liability: Once the coffin lids were lawfully made and sold, "there is no restriction on their use to be implied for the benefit of the patentee or his assignees or licensees." Because the sale was authorized (bought from an authorized seller within the ten-mile radius), the defendant acquired the right to use the coffin lids free from any claim of the patentee, even though he carried it outside the ten-mile radius to use it.

==Limitations==

The exhaustion doctrine is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]], 316 U.S. at 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there are circumstances where it may be difficult to determine whether the exhaustion doctrine is triggered, in light of restrictions that the patentee has purported to place on the sale or use of the patented invention. Two general questions arise in these situations: (1) Was the sale authorized by the patentee? This can often be a complex factual question. (2) Regardless of whether authorized by the patentee, are those restrictions valid and recognizable under the law?

Generally, these cases involve one or more of the following scenarios: the patent owner: (1) sells one or more components of a multi-component patented product;&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', 316 U.S. 241 (1942) (sale of incomplete lens blank embodying essential features of invention exhausts patent rights in finished, patented lens); ''[[Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States]]'', 309 U.S. 436 (1940) (sale of fuel additive exhausts patent rights in fuel).&lt;/ref&gt; (2) licenses another to make and sell patented product with certain restrictions on field in which the sale may be made;&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 175, 179 (1937) (license limited to making and selling in "noncommercial" field held effective).&lt;/ref&gt; or (3) sells the article with restrictions directly on the purchasers or end-users ([[post-sale restraint]]).&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', 553 U.S. 617 (2008) (holding "downstream" restraint legally ineffective).; ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]'', 976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (permitting post-sale restraint).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of incomplete articles===

One scenario in which the exhaustion doctrine may or may not be triggered is when the patent holder sells an incomplete article or precursor or ingredient that does not directly practice or embody the patent in suit. In this situation, exhaustion is triggered by the authorized sale of the incomplete article if: (1) its "only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent, and (2) it "embodies essential features" of the patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]], 316 U.S. 241 (1942); [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]], 553 U.S. 617, 631-32 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the exhaustion doctrine is applicable to the sale of an incomplete article, however, there is a separate analysis of whether the sale of that article was actually authorized, and therefore whether exhaustion was actually triggered.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''id.'' at 635-37 (first considering whether exhaustion applies, then separately analyzing whether the sale actually triggered exhaustion).&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicability of exhaustion to the sale of an incomplete article was recognized by the Supreme Court in 1942 in ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]''. In that case, the patent holder sold lens blanks which had to be ground into finished lenses — the patented invention. The Court held that this sale exhausted the patents on the finished lenses because the lens blanks substantially "embodi[ed] essential features of the patented device and [were] without utility until . . . ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent."&lt;ref&gt;''Univis'', 316 U.S. at 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the grinding process was standard (conventional) and not central to the patents, indicating further that the lens blanks constituted a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practiced the patent, since only conventional further processing steps were needed to complete the invention.

In ''Quanta'', the Supreme Court applied the same test to determine whether exhaustion is triggered by the licensing of a portfolio of product and [[Method (patent)|method patents]]. In that case, the patent holder ([[LG Electronics|LGE]]) authorized the licensee ([[Intel]]) by cross-license to manufacture and sell microprocessors and chipsets that (unless licensed) would infringe LGE product and method patents, as well as patents on computer systems containing the licensed microprocessors and chipsets. The Court found that, even though these Intel products did not directly practice the system patents, they sufficiently embodied the inventions of those patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable. First, the Court found that there was no reasonable use for the Intel products other than incorporating them into a computer system that practiced the LGE system patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Quanta'', 553 U.S. at 631-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Intel products embodied essential features of the patented processes because the only necessary step to practice the patents was the addition of such standard computer parts as memories and buses.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 632-33.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there was nothing inventive about the systems other than that they contained the inventive microprocessors and chipsets.&lt;ref&gt;Under present U.S. patent law it is possible to obtain a patent on a superset of elements simply because a subset within it is patentable. See Richard H. Stern, ''Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc—Comments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States'', [2008] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 527, 529-30. See also [[Exhausted combination doctrine]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, under the ''Univis'' test, the Intel products sufficiently embodied the patents, making the exhaustion doctrine applicable.

===Limitations on sale===

Another scenario in which it may be difficult to determine if the sale of a patented article was authorized, and therefore if exhaustion is triggered, occurs when the patentee grants a license to make and sell with specific limitations on the field in which the seller may operate, such as sales to particular types of customer, specified territories, or other [[field-of-use limitation]]s. If these limitations (or "restrictions") have been imposed, the licensee's sale to a purchaser exhausts only the patentee's rights to restrict use and resale when the restrictions have not been exceeded ("violated").&lt;ref&gt;Technically, the terms "restrict" and "violate" are inappropriate in the context of such field-of-use limitations pursuant to the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine, because the Supreme Court has held that the presence of a field-of-use limitation does not imply a promise not to exceed the field limitation without a further, special promise to that effect. ''Automatic Radio Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc''., 339 U.S. 827, 836 (1950) ("This limited license for 'home' use production contains neither an express nor implied agreement to refrain from production for 'commercial' or any other use as part consideration for the license grant.").&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that if Alice owns Blackacre but not Whiteacre, she cannot convey good title to Bob by purporting to sell him Whiteacre. She can sell only what she owns.&lt;ref&gt;''General Talking Pictures'', 304 U.S, 175, 181 ("The Transformer Company could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell.").&lt;/ref&gt; If the license limitations ("restrictions") are exceeded ("violated"), then exhaustion cannot occur and therefore is not triggered, and the patentee can successfully sue the licensee and any downstream customers for patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''General Talking Pictures''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court in ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]'' has specifically upheld the legitimacy of field-of-use limitations in patent licenses to manufacture patented products.  A licensee who exceeds ("violates") a field-of-use limitation by selling an article outside of the permissible field commits patent infringement. The exhaustion doctrine would provide no protection because the "violation" makes the sale "unauthorized" for the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', ''General Talking Pictures'', 304 U.S. at 181-82 ("The Transformer Company could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell. By knowingly making the sales to petitioner outside the scope of its license, the Transformer Company infringed the patents embodied in the amplifiers.") (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

The field-of-use limitations on sale (those imposed on the licensee in selling the patented articles) are different from post-sale restrictions or limitations (those that purpose to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user). Patentees can avoid the exhaustion doctrine by imposing the former, but it is questionable that patentees can do so through the latter.&lt;ref&gt;''Compare'' [[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]] ''with'' [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]. A case in now pending before the Federal Circuit, to be reargued ''en banc'', in which the court directed the parties to brief and argue the issue whether ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt''. [http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/14-1617enbanc.pdf ''Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc''.], Nos. 2014-1617 and 1619, Order of Apr. 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Limitations on sale must very explicitly bind the licensee or seller. For example, in ''Quanta'', LGE licensed Intel to make products using LGE's patents. The license expressly stated that LGE was not licensing third parties to combine licensed products with any non-Intel products (i.e., microprocessors and chipsets purchased from a third party), and LGE required Intel to notify customers of that. Intel sold products to Quanta, who combined the Intel products with non-Intel products. LGE sued Quanta for patent infringement. The Supreme Court found that the licensing agreement failed to explicitly impose a field-of-use limitation, and therefore found that there were no conditions limiting to whom Intel could sell. The sale was thus "authorized," and exhaustion was triggered. In the Court's words, "The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the patents. No conditions limited Intel's authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. . . . Intel's authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta."&lt;ref&gt;''Quanta'', 553 U.S. at 637. This point is discussed in Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/EIPR'Quanta.pdf ''Quanta Computer Inc v LGE Electronics Inc — Comments on the Reaffirmance of the Exhaustion Doctrine in the United States'', &amp;#91;2008&amp;#93; Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 527].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the contractual documents in the ''Quanta'' case were insufficiently explicit, the Court applied the exhaustion doctrine, finding the sale "authorized" and unconditional, even though LGE attempted to impose some restrictions on use of the products. Therefore, purchasers of the patented product were free to use them without restrictions that the patentee sought to have imposed on them. The Court found that the licensing agreement did not impose any limitations on whom the licensee could sell to. The ''Quanta'' Court did not address, however, whether the restriction in the licensing agreement could be enforced by contract. In fact, the Court pointedly said it was not addressing that issue.

===Post-sale limitations===

The most difficult and unsettled area of the law regarding patent exhaustion involves cases in which a patentee purports to impose [[post-sale restraint|post-sale restrictions]]. Post-sale restrictions are those that purport to restrict the use or sale of the patented article once purchased and in the hands of an end user customer, rather than similar limitations on a manufacturer-licensee. Common post-sale restrictions include "single use only" and "refill only with proprietary ink" notices. Whether violations of such restrictions make a sale "unauthorized," and therefore make patent exhaustion inapplicable, is still unclear or at least controversial.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]], 553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Federal Circuit]] approved the use of post-sale restrictions in ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]''. Specifically, the court held that patent owners could condition the sale of patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the exception of such antitrust law violations as price-fixing and tie-in restrictions, or violations of "some other law or policy."&lt;ref&gt;976 F.2d 700, 708 (Fed. Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff in the case owned a patent on a medical device, which it sold to hospitals with a "single use only" notice label. The defendant purchased the used devices from hospitals, refurbished them, and resold them to hospitals. The Federal Circuit held that the single-use restriction was enforceable in accordance with the 1926 ''General Electric'' case,&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. General Electric Co''., 272 U.S. 476 (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; because the restriction was "reasonably within the patent grant. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 708.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court did not discuss the ''Mallinckrodt'' case in ''Quanta''. As one commentator noted: "The Supreme Court, in ''Quanta'', was widely expected to rule on whether ''Mallinckrodt'' was good law. But the Court sidestepped the issue by narrowly interpreting the license agreement so that it was not a conditional license. . . . Because the Supreme Court sidestepped the issue, it remains unclear to what extent a patentee can use a conditional license to impose restrictions on downstream purchasers."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Seidenberg, [http://www.insidecounsel.com/2008/09/01/patent-predicament- Patent Predicament], Sept. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two district courts have concluded that ''Mallinckrodt'' is no longer good law after ''Quanta''.&lt;ref&gt;''See Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l'', Inc., 615 F. Supp. 2d 586 (E.D. Ky. 2009); accord ''Egrowerx Int'l, LLC v. Maxell Corp''., 18 F. Supp. 3d 430 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) ("[A] majority of commentators have adopted the view that Quanta overturned the conditional sales doctrine.").&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.'', the court concluded that the Supreme Court's ''Quanta'' decision implicitly overruled ''Mallinckrodt''. At issue in ''Static Control'' was Lexmark's so called "prebate" program, in which customers could buy cartridges that were subject to a single use for a 20 percent discounted price. In its original order, before ''Quanta'' was decided, the court rejected Static Control's argument that Lexmark's patent rights were exhausted as a result of the authorized sale of the cartridges. Relying heavily on ''Mallinckrodt'', the court found that the sales were valid post-sale restrictions that avoided exhaustion. After ''Quanta'' was decided, however, the court reversed its original order and concluded that Lexmark's single use restriction was not enforceable under patent law because the court was "persuaded that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The court explained, "The Supreme Court's broad statement of the law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the ''Quanta'' holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on ''Mallinckrodt'' in reaching its decision in ''LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc.'', 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in ''Quanta''. It is also worth noting that the ''Quanta'' decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case."&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court's conclusion, however, that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'' reflects the ambiguity in ''Quanta'' itself. The ''Static Control'' court noted that "[s]ales of Lexmark Prebate cartridges were unconditional" because "[n]o potential buyer was required to agree to abide by the Prebate terms before purchasing a cartridge. Thus, sales of Lexmark's Prebate toner cartridges were authorized and unconditional, just like sales of LGE's patented products in ''Quanta''."&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 584.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, both ''Quanta'' and ''Static Control'' can be seen as either cautionary tales&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent Chiapetta, Patent Exhaustion: What's It Good For?, 51 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1087, 1089 (2011) (stating that some view ''Quanta'' as holding that the exhaustion doctrine "absolutely prohibits patent enforcement of post-sale conditions. Others view the decision as a cautionary tale, with exhaustion operating as a default contract term placing the burden on patent owners (and their lawyers) to incorporate any waiver explicitly into the sale agreement. Many practitioners and scholars, myself included, are not sure what the correct interpretation may be.").&lt;/ref&gt; about failed attempts to comply with the [[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.|General Talking Pictures]] doctrine&lt;ref&gt;Actually, Lexmark could not have complied with the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine because it was not imposing a limitation on the field in which a manufacturer-licensee of Lexmark could operate, which is all that the doctrine addresses. Instead, Lexmark imposed a restriction on what its own customers might do with the product that Lexmark sold them.&lt;/ref&gt; or to explicitly condition sales, without need to rule on whether the post-sale restrictions were valid, or as overruling ''Mallinckrodt'''s approval of post-sale restrictions. Which interpretation is correct remains to be seen. The Federal Circuit's decision in the ''en banc'' reargument of ''Lexmark Int'l v. Impression Prods.'' should provide a more definitive answer, subject of course to possible further review in the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;See supra note _.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International exhaustion==

An emerging issue is whether U.S. patent exhaustion is international or strictly national. Until recently, or at least since the formation of the Federal Circuit in 1982 until recently,&lt;ref&gt;There are many earlier cases, however, holding that a U.S. patentee can trigger domestic exhaustion by making or authorizing a foreign sale. E.g., ''Dickerson v. Matheson'', 57 F. 524, 527 (2d Cir. 1893) ("A purchaser in a foreign country, of an article patented in that country and also in the United States, from the owner of each patent, or from a licensee under each patent, who purchases without any restrictions upon the extent of his use or power of sale, acquires an unrestricted ownership in the article, and can use or sell it in this country."); accord ''Curtiss Aeroplane &amp; Motor Corp. v. United Aircraft Eng'g Corp.'', 266 F. 71, 77 (2d Cir. 1920); ''Seiko v. Refac Tech. Dev. Corp.'', 690 F. Supp. 1339, 1342 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); ''Holiday v. Mattheson'', 24 F. 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1885).&lt;/ref&gt; most U.S. courts simply assumed that a sale outside the United States, even if made by the U.S. patent owner or its parent, subsidiary, or affiliate, or by the U.S. patent owner's licensee, did not trigger the exhaustion doctrine within the United States. Usually, the basis for the assumption was (1) the Supreme Court allegedly so held in ''Boesch v. Graff'',;&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; (2) a foreign patent is a different property right that is not the same as a corresponding U.S. patent because foreign patent law is different from U.S. patent law and gives different scope to such a foreign patent;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Griffin v. Keystone Mushroom Farm, Inc''., 453 F. Supp. 1283, 1285 (E.D. Pa. 1978) ("The sale or use of each machine in both countries represents potentially two separate torts against the plaintiff and infringes potentially on two separate sets of rights held by him .... The non-tortiousness of defendant's conduct in Italy cannot enter into an adjudication of the plaintiffs rights in this country.").&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) many cases hold that U.S. patent law has no "extraterritorial" application.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Jazz Photo Corp. v. ITC,'' 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001). See also ''Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. v. Jazz Photo Corp.'', 394 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (in response to Jazz's argument that Fuji had already been adequately rewarded by its earnings on its sale of the product in Japan, the Federal Circuit said: "The patentee's authorization of an international first sale does not affect exhaustion of that patentee's rights in the United States. ...Moreover, Fuji's foreign sales can never occur under a United States patent because the United States patent system does not provide for extraterritorial effect.");accord ''Minebea Co., Ltd. v. Papst'', 444 F. Supp. 2d 68, 140-41 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these points is on firm, sound ground. In the ''Boesch'' case, a seller entirely unrelated to the U.S. patent owner made the sale in Germany; the German seller had a right to sell the product under German law because it had begun preparation to manufacture the product before the U.S. patent owner applied for its German patent.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, the German seller, had the right to make and sell the patented burners in Germany because under German law one "who, at the time of the patentee's application, ha[d] already commenced to make use of the invention in the country..." had the right to continue selling the product despite the subsequent issuance of a German patent to Boesch. ''Boesch'', 133 U.S. at 701.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. company (the patentee) had no complicity in the sale and did not profit from it, and could not possible be accused of "double dipping."&lt;ref&gt;This "double dipping" point is the basis of the current Japanese position on international exhaustion. In ''BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG v. Rashimekkusu Japan Co. Ltd. and JAP Auto Prod. Co., Ltd.'' (Sup. Ct. Japan July 1, 1997) (translated in 29 Int'l. Rev. Indus Prop &amp; Copy. 331), the Japanese Supreme Court held that an overseas sale of hubcaps exhausted the seller's Japanese patent rights in Japan. BBS, a German manufacturer of aluminum hubcaps and the owner of the hubcap patent rights in both Germany and Japan, sold the hubcaps in Germany. Jap Auto Products and Raximex, Japanese companies, purchased the products in Germany and then imported them into Japan. The intermediate appellate patent court (Tokyo High Court) said, in reference to "double dipping": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he opportunity of the patent holder to receive compensation for the disclosure of the invention is limited to one opportunity. ...[I]t does not make any particular difference whether the putting into circulation takes place within the country or abroad. For the mere fact that national borders are crossed does not constitute a sound reason why a second opportunity for compensation for the disclosure of the invention should be allowed." &lt;/blockquote&gt;''Jap Auto Products Kabushiki Kaisha and Another v. BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik AG; BBS v. Rashimex Japan Co. et al.'', Hanrei Jiho 3 (No. 1524) (March 23, 1995), reproduced in 27 IIC 550 (1996) - BBS Wheels H and 21 AIPPI (Japanese Gr. Journal) 36 (1/1996).&lt;/ref&gt; This is quite unlike the usual U.S. situation, such as that in the ''Lexmark'' and ''Jazz'' cases, in which the U.S. patent owner was responsible for the foreign sale, and therefore profited from it. The ''Boesch'' case is therefore not a proper precedent to support the general international exhaustion situation.

Whether foreign patents are comparable to U.S. patents is a factual issue that may differ from case to case, or nation to nation, and cannot be assumed one way or the other. Furthermore, 35 U.S.C. § 119(a), the U.S. patent statute governing when a U.S. patent can be based on a filing of a foreign patent application, provides that the U.S. patent and the corresponding foreign patent must be "for the same invention." Therefore, there may be far more similarity than the cases assume.

Finally, the statement that U.S. patent law is without extraterritorial application occurs universally in cases holding that liability for patent infringement under U.S. law should not be based on acts and conduct occurring outside the United States. And even that generality is suspect, for sometimes patent infringement liability in the United States is based on conduct outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., 35 U.S.C. § 271(f) and (g); ''Honeywell, Inc. v. Metz Aparatewerkex'', 509 F.2d 1137, 1141 (7th Cir. 1975) ("although the patent laws of the United States do not have extra-territorial effect, 'active inducement' may be found in events outside the United States if they result in a direct infringement here."); ''Akzona Inc. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.'', 662 F. Supp. 603, 613 (D. Del. 1987) ("inducing activity may take place outside of the United States, so long as the direct infringement occurs within the United States").&lt;/ref&gt; Applying exhaustion on an international basis does not regulate acts and conduct performed outside the United States; it defines infringement remedies against importation into and sale in the United States on the basis of acts and conduct performed outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See John A. Rothchild, ''Exhausting Extraterritoriality'', 51 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1187, 1238-39 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The point is now pending decision in the Federal Circuit, because that court has ordered ''en banc'' rehearing on that issue in the ''Lexmark'' case.&lt;ref&gt;Supra note _.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason that the issue has come to the fore is that the Supreme Court, in its recent copyright decision in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; held that a foreign sale authorized by the copyright owners exhausts U.S. copyright. The Supreme Court rested its decision mainly on common-law authority, quoting extensively from [[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Coke's Institutes]] (Coke on Littleton), and saying that this stated the general rule from which any exception must be proved. Some have thought, therefore, that the same principle applies at least as forcefully in patent law as in copyright law, so that patent exhaustion should be international just as copyright exhaustion is.

In Europe&lt;ref&gt;International patent exhaustion in Europe is discussed in Christopher Stothers, ''Patent Exhaustion: the UK perspective'', 16th Annual Conference on Intellectual Property Law and Policy, Fordham University School of Law, 27 March 2008 [http://fordhamipconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Christopher-Sothers-Patent-Exhaustion.pdf]. In the EU, member states recognize international exhaustion on a regional basis: a product first sold in an EU member state will exhaust the patent owner's rights in all other EU member states; but a sale in a non-EU country will not exhaust rights in any EU country. See ''Centrafarm BV v. Sterling Drug Inc'', Case 15/74, 1974 E.C.R. 1147 ("[O]bstacles to free movement may. be justifiable for reasons of
protection of industrial property when the protection is invoked against a product coming from a Member State in which it is not patentable and has been manufactured by third parties without the consent of the patentee or where the original patentees are legally and economically independent of-each other; the derogation to the principle of free movement of goods is not justified when the product has been lawfully put by the patentee himself or with his consent, on the market of the Member State from which it is being imported, e.g. in the case of a holder of parallel patents.").&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan, a regime of absolute or modified international exhaustion of patent rights is followed. Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Australia recognizes international exhaustion only if there is no contractual restriction against imports. Christopher J. Clugston, International Exhaustion, Parallel Imports, and the Conflict between the Patent and Copyright Laws of the United States, 4 Beijing L. Rev. 95, 97 (2013), [https://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=37387] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724185436/https://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=37387 |date=July 24, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, and Norway also adopt international patent exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 96. See also T. Syddall, ''Parallel Imports get Go-Ahead in New Zealand'', MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (Oct. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) explicitly leaves to each member state the freedom to address exhaustion of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;TRIPS: Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Apr. 15, 1994, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 1C, THE LEGAL TEXTS: THE RESULTS OF THE URUGUAY ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS 320 (1999), 1869 U.N.T.S. 299, 33 I.L.M. 1197 (1994), at Art. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report&lt;ref&gt;WIPO Committee on Development and Intellectual Property (CDIP), ''Patent Related Flexibilities in the Multilateral Legal Framework and Their Legislative Implementation at the National and Regional Levels'', (5th Sess.), CDIP/5/4 (Mar. 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 provides a listing of various countries' statutory provisions on international exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;According to the WIPO report, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Jordan, Kenya, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines (for drugs and medicines), Singapore (with the exception of pharmaceutical products under certain conditions), South Africa, Uruguay, and Vietnam have statutory international exhaustion provisions. Id., ¶58 and Annex II(2). The Andean Community, like the EU, has exhaustion within the community. Id., Annex II(2). National exhaustion, however, obtains in "Ghana, Liberia, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Tunisia, Uganda, and a certain number of Asian countries, such as the Philippines." Marco Aleman, Paper delivered at WIPO Regional Seminar on the Effective Implementation and Use of Several Patent-Related Flexibilities, Patent Exhaustion (2011).

==Standing or right to assert exhaustion==

Another emerging issue under the exhaustion doctrine is what persons may assert the exhaustion doctrine as a defense to a claim of patent infringement. In most of the exhaustion cases discussed earlier in this article, the facts of the case follow what may be termed a "straight line" pattern: A patentee ''A'' (or its licensee) makes and sells a product ''a'' covered by patent ''P1'' to customer ''C''. ''C'' then does something with ''a'' that ''A'' has ordered (by some sort of agreement or putative agreement) ''C'' not to do. A patent infringement suit, ''A v. C'', follows. Diagrammatically, this fact pattern may be represented as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' '''A → a (P1) → C''' ''
*where ''a(P1)'' means that patent ''P1'' covers product ''a'' and the → indicates a sale
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New information-technology inventions can lead to exhaustion suits following a different fact pattern, because of peculiarities of information technology and present U.S. patent law. An information-technology invention may involve several aspects each of which has a separate stakeholder. For example, a smartphone, TV set, or [[set-top box]] may be economically important to both equipment manufacturers and content providers, as well as the end user public (i.e., consumers). A license or sale to one stakeholder may or may not trigger the exhaustion doctrine with respect to conduct by another stakeholder, perhaps depending on how relevant business transactions are structured.

Under present U.S. patent law, a method claim of a patent is infringed only when a single actor performs each step of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;''Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp.'', 532 F. 3d 1318, 1329 (2008) (direct infringement under § 271(a) requires a single party to perform every step of a claimed method); see ''Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc.'', 134 S. Ct. 2111 (2014) (Court said it was "assuming, but not deciding" that the Federal Circuit's rule requiring that all steps of a method patent be attributable to a single direct infringer was correct).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, induced infringement of a method claim has the same requirement.&lt;ref&gt;''Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc.'', 134 S. Ct. 2111 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; System claims raise more complicated issues. One can make the system only by placing each element into combination with the others, but it is possible to be liable for using a system invention merely by commercially exploiting the system.&lt;ref&gt;''Centillion Data Sys. LLC v. Qwest Comm. Int'l Inc.'', 631 F.3d 1279 (2011). Direct ''use'' infringement occurs when a part "put[s] the invention into service, i.e., control[s] the system as a whole and obtain[s] benefit from it," even though different persons operate the different components of the system. ''Id''. at 1284.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when both the relevant equipment manufacturer and content provider utilize aspects of the invention in a method claim, whether infringement liability attaches to them may depend on both how the relevant claim is written and how licenses or sales are structured. This is illustrated in pending smartphone litigation, in which structure dictated the legal outcome.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dorsey.com/eu-post-limelight-akamai-multi-actor-patent-claims/   ''Post Limelight v. Akamai, Are Multi-actor Method Patent Claims D.O.A.?''] (June 3, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC v. New York Times Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;778 F.3d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Circuit overturned a district court's summary dismissal on exhaustion grounds of a patent infringement suit against content providers. The invention concerns methods and systems for alerting smartphone users to content that may be of interest to them, for example, breaking news stories. The way the invention works is along these lines: A content provider such as the New York Times sends a text message to its online subscribers' smartphones. The message might consist of a headline and the lead to a story, together with a hyperlink to the story as stored in the online database of the New York Times. A subscriber interested in reading the story clicks on the link and thus causes the browser for the smartphone to retrieve and display the story.

The way the claims were drafted is very important to the outcome. There are two relevant types of claim, One set considers only smartphone manufacturers, and the claims describe only acts performed in the smartphone (receiving signals, clicking on hyperlinks, etc.). The other set of claims considers only acts that the content providers perform (sending the text message alert, storing the news story, sending it out over the Internet in response to a hyperlink click, etc.). Thus, it is possible to infringe one set of these single-actor claims without infringing the other.

The patentee licensed substantially all smartphone manufacturers in the United States under the first set of patents. It then sought to license content providers. When some content providers, including the New York Times, refused to take licenses under the second set of patents, claiming that under the exhaustion doctrine they needed no licenses, the patentee sued them. Instead of the "straight line" fact pattern described above for prior exhaustion cases, this case has a different, bi-directional pattern. Diagrammatically, the fact pattern of this type of case is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'' '''P → lic (P1) → A, a''' ''
*Patentee ''P'' licenses manufacturer ''A'' under patent ''P1'' (the smartphone patents) to make smartphones ''a'' embodying the patented invention. ''A'' then sells smartphones ''a'' to consumers ''C''.

'' '''A → a (P1) → C ← i (P2) ← B''' ''
*Content provider ''B'' sends news alerts and content ''i'' to consumers ''C'', thus practicing the method claimed in patent ''P2'' (the content provider patents).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On appeal from the district court's summary judgment ruling, the Federal Circuit held that the structure of the patent licensing arrangement avoided the exhaustion doctrine. The court ruled that the exhaustion doctrine may be asserted only by an "authorized acquirer" — one who purchases the patented article from the patentee or its authorized seller. The court further explained this, using slightly different terminology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[It is a] core notion that exhaustion lifts legal restrictions on an authorized acquirer. The doctrine has never applied unless, at a minimum, the patentee's allegations of infringement . . . entail infringement of the asserted claims by authorized acquirers . . . Here, as noted, that is not so, because infringement of the content claims has not been . . . shown to require that [the authorized] handset acquirers are practicing those claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the patentee put it in its brief, and the court accepted, "the exhaustion doctrine protects only the ability of a purchaser (or other lawful possessor) of an article to use and sell the article."&lt;ref&gt;Main Br. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The content providers were not parties to the transaction that triggered whatever exhaustion there was — that transaction was the sale of smartphones by manufacturers to consumers. The exhaustion doctrine exists to protect the interests of purchasers, not third parties.&lt;ref&gt;But see the speech of Lord Bridges in ''British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.'', [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.), in which he said: "What the owner needs, if his right to repair is to be of value to him, is the freedom to acquire a previously manufactured replacement exhaust system in an unrestricted market." See also the similar US ruling in ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961). in which the US Supreme Court permitted a spare parts supplier to defend against a charge of patent infringement by asserting the right of automobile purchasers to refurbish their automobiles, a right deriving from the exhaustion doctrine. See ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964) (citing ''Univis'' and ''Adams v. Burke'', 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453 (1873). to support the right of repair).&lt;/ref&gt; The patentee told the Federal Circuit, and it apparently agreed, that the exhaustion doctrine does not immunize the conduct of the content providers, "regardless of the effect on the amount of licensed content available to their subscribers' handsets."&lt;ref&gt;Reply Br. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the patent claims licensed to the manufacturers (the ''P1'' of the diagram above) are not infringed by the conduct of the content providers accused of infringement. Their conduct infringes the ''P2'' patent claims that were not licensed to the manufacturers. The only sale in the case was by the licensed smartphone manufacturers to the consumer end users, and that sale exhausted only the ''P1'' claims. The Federal Circuit said exhaustion cannot occur as to unrelated patent claims. The court added that the content providers had not shown that the licensed ''P1'' claims embodied substantially the same invention as the ''P2'' patent claims under which the content providers were sued, so that the doctrine of the ''Univis'' and ''Quanta'' cases did not apply to expand the scope of the exhaustion.

There is another possible way to analyze cases of this type, but the parties did not raise it and the court did not address it. That would be to make an equitable estoppel analysis as to whether smartphone purchasers had reasonable expectations at the time of purchase and whether the result reached in the case unfairly and substantially derogated from the rights the purchasers expected to enjoy, as a result of conduct by the plaintiff. That is an approach similar to one of those that the House of Lords considered in the ''British Leyland'' case.&lt;ref&gt;''[[British Leyland Motor Corp v Armstrong Patents Co]]'', [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparable doctrines outside U.S.==

Other countries recognize legal doctrines comparable to the exhaustion doctrine of U.S. patent law.

===Canada===
In ''Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[1998] 2 S.C.R. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the principle that sale of a patented article exhausts the patentee's right in that article.&lt;ref&gt;The court said: "If the patentee sells the patented article that he made, he transfers the ownership of that article to the purchaser. This means that, henceforth, the patentee no longer has any right with respect to the article which now belongs to the purchaser who, as the new owner, has the exclusive right to possess, use, enjoy, destroy or alienate it."&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Eli Lilly'' case the Supreme Court also took the position that subsequent purchasers are not bound by any contractual limitations imposed by the patentee, unless they are brought to their attention at the time of sale: "restrictive conditions imposed by a patentee on a purchaser or licensee do not run with the goods unless they are brought to the attention of the [subsequent] purchaser at the time of their acquisition." This principle appears to differ somewhat from U.S. patent law, in which bringing the restriction to the attention of the purchaser is generally immaterial.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Quanta'' case, discussed earlier in this article, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held the purported restriction ineffective despite notice.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Approximately 60 percent of European patent litigation is in German courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2008/licensing--andpatent-exhaustion W. von Meibom and M. Meyer], ''Licensing and Patent Exhaustion'' (Nov. 5, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; German law has long recognized the exhaustion doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;In 1902 the Reichsgericht held, "The proprietor who has manufactured the product and has put it on the market under this protection which excludes competition from other parties, has enjoyed advantages which the patent confers upon him and has thus exhausted his right." ''Guajakol Karbont''51 RGZ 129 (Mar. 26, 1902).&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Fullplastverfahren'' case, the German Federal Supreme Court stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The doctrine [of exhaustion] finds its justification in the argument that the holder of the rights who puts into circulation the product produced under the application of the protected procedure has had the opportunity to avail himself of the advantages granted by the patent.&lt;ref&gt;GRUR 1980, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A commentator asserts that the decision of the German Federal Supreme Court in the ''Brochure Rock'' case&lt;ref&gt;GRUR 1997, 116, 117 (English translation published in IIC 1998, 207).&lt;/ref&gt; would require a contrary result as to the fact pattern of the U.S. ''Quanta'' case (discussed above). The sale of the chips would ''not'' exhaust the patent rights to the computer systems containing the chips, so that LG in that case would have been entitled to a further royalty payment from Quanta despite LG's license to the chip manufacturer Intel.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.twobirds.com/en/news/articles/2008/licensing--andpatent-exhaustion W. von Meibom and M. Meyer], ''Licensing and Patent Exhaustion'' (Nov. 5, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent decision of the Düsseldorf District Court,&lt;ref&gt;Decision of Dec. 12, 2013 – Case 4b O 88/12 (''Datenübertragungssystem''/Data memory system).&lt;/ref&gt; however, perhaps points to greater similarity between German and U.S.; patent law. The case had facts almost identical to those of the ''Quanta'' case. The court held that the sale of the component did not exhaust the patent rights on the system because, among other things, the components sold by the suppliers did not make use of the teachings of the system patent.

As for using the doctrine of the U.S. ''Quanta'' case, the Düsseldorf District Court stated that the rationale for such an "extended exhaustion doctrine" could only be to prevent the patent owner from enjoying the advantages of the patent more than once, that is, "double dipping" or "double charging." The court said that such a danger of double charging at different stages of the distribution chain and, thus, a rationale for an "extended exhaustion doctrine," might exist if, in one and the same patent, there is a claim to the overall device and a claim to an individual component of the overall device. That was not the case here.

A second basis for an "extended exhaustion doctrine" ''might'' exist if the overall device and its individual components are protected by different patents (as here), but only when the inventive concept of the two patents is the same and is substantially embodied in the component. But that was not true here, as it was in the ''Quanta'' case. This is the point of possible similarity to ''Quanta,'' but it is entirely in the form of ''obiter dicta'',

The court ruled that the fact that the component had no reasonable use except in making the patented system (which was so in the ''Quanta'' case) did not matter, because that raised an implied license issue rather than an exhaustion issue. The component manufacturer's license expressly disclaimed any such implied license as to the system (as in the ''Quanta'' case).

The '''fact–value distinction''' is the distinction between things that can be known to be true and things that are the personal preferences of individuals.

==David Hume's skepticism==
The fact–value distinction emerged in [[philosophy]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In particular, [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) argued that human beings are unable to ground normative arguments in positive arguments, that is, to derive [[is–ought problem|''ought'' from ''is'']]. Hume was a [[skeptic]], and although a complex and dedicated philosopher, he shared a political viewpoint with early Enlightenment [[philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) and [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). Specifically, Hume, at least to some extent, argued that religious and national hostilities that divided European society were based on unfounded beliefs. In effect, Hume contended that such hostilities are not found in [[nature]], but are a human creation, depending on a particular time and place, and thus unworthy of mortal conflict.

==Naturalistic fallacy==
The fact–value distinction is closely related to the [[naturalistic fallacy]], a topic debated in ethical and [[moral philosophy]]. [[G. E. Moore]] believed it essential to all ethical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Casimir Lewy 1965 - G.E. Moore on the naturalistic fallacy&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary philosophers like [[Phillipa Foot]] have called into question the validity of such assumptions. Others, such as Ruth Anna Putnam, argue that even the most "scientific" of disciplines are affected by the "values" of those who research and practice the vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Ruth Anna. "Perceiving Facts and Values", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' 73, 1998. {{JSTOR|3752124}}  This article as well as her earlier article, "Creating Facts and Values", ''Philosophy'' 60, 1985 {{JSTOR|3750998}}, examines how scientists may base their choice of investigations on their unexamined subjectivity, which undermines the objectivity of their hypothesis and findings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.C. "Ruth Anna Putnam and the Fact-Value Distinction", ''Philosophy'' 74, 1999.  {{JSTOR|3751844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the difference between the naturalistic fallacy and the fact–value distinction is derived from the manner in which modern [[social science]] has used the fact–value distinction, and not the strict naturalistic fallacy to articulate new fields of study and create academic disciplines.

==Moralistic fallacy==
The fact–value distinction is also closely related to the [[moralistic fallacy]], an invalid inference of factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises. For example, an invalid inference "Because everybody ought to be equal, there are no innate genetic differences between people" is an instance of the moralistic fallacy. As for the naturalistic fallacy one attempts to move from an "is" to an "ought" statement, with the moralistic fallacy one attempts to move from an "ought" to an "is" statement.

==Nietzsche's table of values==
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' said that a table of values hangs above every great people. Nietzsche points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of ''esteeming'', of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to act on those values.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. Book Two "On the Virtuous": "You who are virtuous still want to be paid! Do you want rewards for virtue, and heaven for earth, and the eternal for your today? And now you are angry with me because I teach that there is no reward and paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''willing'' is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. Book Four "On Old and New Tablets": "To redeem what is past in man and to recreate all 'it was' until the will says, 'Thus I willed it! Thus I shall will it!' - this I called redemption and this alone I taught them to call redemption."&lt;/ref&gt; "A thousand goals have there been so far," says Zarathustra, "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." Hence, the title of the aphorism, "On The Thousand And One Goals." The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical endeavor, as well as their political understanding.

==Criticisms==
Virtually all modern philosophers affirm ''some'' sort of fact–value distinction, insofar as they distinguish between science and "valued" disciplines such as [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], or the fine [[arts]]. However, philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam]] argue that the distinction between fact and value is not as absolute as Hume envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_9.pdf |title=The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy and Other Essays, Cambridge, MA : Harvard University Press, 2002 |author=Putnam, Hilary |publisher=Reasonpapers.com |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical [[pragmatists]], for instance, believe that true propositions are those that are ''useful'' or ''effective'' in predicting future (empirical) states of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/#PeiTruRea |title=Pragmatism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-08-16 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from being value-free, the pragmatists' conception of truth or facts directly relates to an end (namely, empirical predictability) that human beings regard as ''normatively'' desirable. Other thinkers reject an absolutist fact–value distinction by contending that our senses are imbued with prior conceptualizations, making it impossible to have any observation that is totally value-free, which is how Hume and the later [[Positivism|positivists]] conceived of facts.

=== Functionalist counterexamples ===
Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an evaluative statement does indeed logically follow from a factual statement. [[Arthur Prior|A. N. Prior]] points out, from the statement "He is a sea captain," it logically follows, "He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair MacIntyre]], ''After Virtue'' (1984), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] points out, from the statement "This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably," the evaluative conclusion validly follows, "This is a bad watch."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Searle]] points out, from the statement "Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars," it logically follows that "Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars." The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Don MacNiven, ''Creative Morality'', pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral realism ===
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a [[Moral realism|moral realist]] position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension".&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Foot, “Moral Beliefs,” ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word "injury". Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connexion between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref&gt;Foot 1958, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref&gt;Foot 1958, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Gilbert de la Porrée''' (after 1085 – 4 September 1154), also known as '''Gilbert of Poitiers''', '''Gilbertus Porretanus''' or '''Pictaviensis''', was a [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[logician]] and [[theology|theologian]].

==Life==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2017}}
He was born in [[Poitiers]], and completed his first studies there.  He was then educated at Chartres under [[Bernard of Chartres]], where he learned the differences between Aristotle and Plato and later at Laon under [[Anselm of Laon]] and Ralph of Laon, where he studied biblical scriptures. After his education, he returned to Poitiers, where its believed he taught.  He then returned to Chartres to teach logic and theology and took over Chancellor after Bernard from 1126-1140.  It is in Paris where we also know he gave lectures. From a passage from the text, Dialogue with Ratius and Everard, by the Cistercian Everardus, we learn that Gilbert was more popular in Paris than in Chartres. Everardus writes that he was fourth to attend Gilberts lectures in Chartres and three hundredth to attend in Paris. In Paris, John of Salisbury attended Gilbert's lectures in 1141 and was greatly influenced by them. John of Salisbury would later become chancellor of Chartres and also wrote over Gilbert saying: He taught grammar and theology, would whip a student who made a grammatical error, if he believed a student was wasting time in class he would suggest they take up bread making, and last when he lectured he used philosophers, orators and as well as poets to help interpret.

Sometime in the 1140s, Gilbert published his Commentary on Boethius's, Opuscula Sacra.  Although intended as an explanation of what Boethius meant, it interpreted the [[Holy Trinity]] in such a way that it went against the teachings of the church. In 1142, Gilbert became [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poitiers|Bishop of Poitiers]], and within the same year two archdeacons, Arnaud and Calon, denounced Gilbert for his ideas on the Trinity.  It was also in 1142 when Gilbert's teaching position was taken over in Chartres.  By 1147, in Paris, [[Peter Lombard]] attacked Gilbert for his trinitarian beliefs. In 1148, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, known as the great detector of heresies, brought Gilbert to trial. Saint Bernard had previous reasons to believe Gilbert was a heretic because when Abelard was tried and condemned, the [[school of Chartres]]}--where Gilbert was chancellor at that moment—backed Abelard. Pope Eugene III presided over the trial. During the trial, Gilbert and Bernard were asked to recite and speak of specific biblical scriptures. Bernard, being nowhere near as well versed as Gilbert, was not able to condemn him.  It was decided however that in order to make the church happy, Gilbert had to change parts of his book that were not in accordance with the official position on faith. Gilbert died in 1154.

Gilbert is almost the only logician of the 12th century who is quoted by the greater scholastics of the succeeding age. The ''Liber sex principiorum'', attributed to him, but of an anonymous author,&lt;ref&gt;L. O.  Nielsen, ''Theology and Philosophy in the Twelfth Century. A Study of Gilbert Porreta’s Thinking and the Theological Expositions of the Doctrine of the Incarnation During the Period 1130-1180'', Brill:
Leiden, 1982, pp. 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt; was regarded with a reverence almost equal to that paid to [[Aristotle]], and furnished matter for numerous commentators, amongst them [[Albertus Magnus]]. Owing to the fame of this work, he is mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] as the ''Magister sex principiorum''. The treatise itself is a discussion of the Aristotelian categories, specially of the six subordinate modes.
The author distinguishes in the ten categories two classes, one essential, the other derivative. Essential or inhering (formae inhaerentes) in the objects themselves are only substance, quantity, quality and relation in the stricter sense of that term. The remaining six, when, where, action, passion, position and habit, are relative and subordinate (formae assistantes). This suggestion has some interest, but is of no great value, either in logic or in the theory of knowledge. More important in the history of scholasticism are the theological consequences to which Gilbert's realism led him.

In the commentary on the treatise ''De Trinitate'' of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;De sex rerum principiis and commentary on the De Trinitate in Migne, Patrologia Latina, lxiv. 1255 and clxxxviii. 1257.&lt;/ref&gt; he proceeds from the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] notion that pure or abstract being is prior in nature to that which is. This pure being is [[God]], and must be distinguished from the triune God as known to us. God is incomprehensible, and the categories cannot be applied to determine his existence. In God there is no distinction or difference, whereas in all substances or things there is duality, arising from the element of matter. Between pure being and substances stand the ideas or forms, which subsist, though they are not substances. These forms, when materialized, are called ''formae substantiales'' or ''formae nativae''; they are the essences of things, and in themselves have no relation to the accidents of things. Things are temporal, the ideas perpetual, God eternal. The pure form of existence, that by which God is God, must be distinguished from the three persons who are God by participation in this form. The form or essence is one, the persons or substances three. This distinction clearly goes against the church's tenet of divine simplicity.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}  It was this distinction between ''Deitas'' or ''Divinitas'' and ''Deus'' that led to the condemnation of Gilbert's doctrine.

Swami Shri Mahamandaleshwar Santosh Puri '''Gita Bharatiji''', is a guru who was born in [[Delhi]], [[India]] in 1944. She was the disciple of Shri 108 Mahamandaleshwar Swami Shri Hariharanand Ji Maharaj since the age of three. She showed remarkable talents at a young age, delivering discourses on the [Bhagavad Gita] at the age of seven years. It was because of her impressive sermons on the holy Gita that she was dubbed 'Gita Bharati' at the age of 10 years by [[Rajendra Prasad]], who was then the President of India. At the age of 14 years she took sanyas diksha and was termed as Mahamandaleshwar at 18 years of age.

While preaching the Gita in [[Gujarat]], when they finally arrived in [[Ahmedabad]], on 11 November 1963, Swami Shri Hariharanandji Maharaj died.  Pujya Guruji  built a beautiful ashram and temple in his memory. Pujya Guruji is also the founder of many ashrams, including ones in [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Delhi]], [[Solapur]], and [[Haridwar]], which are also the sites of highly regarded [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shpshardwar.com/] Swami Hariharanand Public School site&lt;/ref&gt;

Pujya Gita Bharatiji is a [[Mahamandaleshwar]] of the [[Nirvani Akhada]]. The Nirvani Akhada is made up of about two thousand renouncers. Pujya Guruji is the first woman in history to  have the honor of being selected a Mahamandaleshwar. She is also the author of many books, the most famous being  'Guru Gita'.

{{nihongo|'''Hayashi Razan'''|林 羅山|extra=1583 – March 7, 1657}}, also known as Hayashi Dōshun,&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard A. B. (1956). ''Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794–1869'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Japanese [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] philosopher, serving as a tutor and an advisor to the first four ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa ''bakufu'']].  He is also attributed with first listing the [[Three Views of Japan]]. Razan was the founder of the [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi clan]] of Confucian scholars.

Razan was an influential scholar, teacher and administrator.  Together with his sons and grandsons, he is credited with establishing the official neo-Confucian doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate.  Razan's emphasis on the values inherent in a static conservative perspective provided the intellectual underpinnings for the Edo bakufu. Razan also reinterpreted [[Shinto]], and thus created a foundation for the eventual development of Confucianised Shinto in the 20th century.

The intellectual foundation of Razan's life's work was based on early studies with [[Fujiwara Seika]] (1561–1619), the first Japanese scholar who is known for a close study of Confucius and the Confucian commentators. This ''[[kuge]]'' noble had become a Buddhist priest; but Seika's dissatisfaction with the philosophy and doctrines of Buddhism led him to a study of Confucianism.  In due course, Seika drew other similarly motivated scholars to join him in studies which were greatly influenced by the work of Chinese Neo-Confucianist [[Zhu Xi]], a [[Sung dynasty|Sung-dynasty]] savant.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, R. (1956). ''Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794–1869'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhu Xi and Seika emphasized the role of the individual as a functionary of a society which naturally settles into a certain [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] form. He separated people into four distinct classes: [[samurai]] (ruling class), farmers, artisans and merchants.

==Academician==
Razan developed a practical blending of [[Shinto]] and [[Confucian]] beliefs and practices. In particular, he argued that Shinto was a provisional and local form of Confucian ideas, enabling a Confucian interpretation of Shinto shrine rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=28|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxzuzIszO60C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coherent construct of inter-related ideas lent themselves to a well-accepted program of samurai and bureaucrat educational, training and testing protocols.  In 1607, Hayashi was accepted as a political adviser to the second ''[[shōgun]]'', [[Tokugawa Hidetada]].

Razan became the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Edo's Confucian Academy, the [[Shōhei-kō]] (afterwards known at the [[Yushima Seidō]]) which was built on land provided by the ''[[shōgun]]''. This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the Tokugawa shogunate. Razan had the honorific title ''[[Daigaku-no-kami]],'' which became hereditary in his family.  It also happened that the position as head of the Seidō became hereditary in the Hayashi family. ''Daigaku-no-kami'', in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as "Head of the State University.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the elevated context his father engendered, [[Hayashi Gahō]] (formerly Harukatsu), worked on editing a chronicle of Japanese emperors compiled in conformance with his father's principles. ''[[Nihon Ōdai Ichiran]]'' grew into a seven-volume text which was completed in 1650. Gahō himself was accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period; but the Hayashi and the Shōhei-kō links to the work's circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity. Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this summary drawn from historical records.

The narrative of ''Nihon Ōdai Ichiran'' stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime.  Gahō's text did not continue up through his present day; but rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler.  This book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, "perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials".&lt;ref&gt;Screech, ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822''. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Razan's successor as the Tokugawa's chief scholar was his third son, Gahō.  After Razan's death, Gahō finished work his father had begun, including a number of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history. In 1670, the Hayashi family's scholarly reputation was burnished when Gahō published the 310 volumes of ''The Comprehensive History of Japan'' (本朝通鑑, ''Honchō-tsugan'').&lt;ref&gt;Brownlee, John. (1999). ''Political Thought in Japanese Historical Writing'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Razan's writings were compiled, edited and posthumously published by Hayashi Gahō and his younger brother, [[Hayashi Dokkōsai]] (formerly Morikatsu):
* ''Hayashi Razan bunshū'' (''The Collected Works of Hayashi Razan''), reissued in 1918
* ''Razan sensei isshū'' (''Master Razan's Poems''), reissued in 1921

Razan's grandson, [[Hayashi Hōkō]] (formerly Nobuatsu) would head the Yushima Seidō and he would bear the inherited title ''Daigaku-no kami''. Hōkō's progeny would continue the work begun in the 18th century by the scholarly Hayashi patriarch.

==Political Influence==
As a political theorist, Hayashi lived to witness his philosophical and pragmatic reasoning become a foundation for the dominant ideology of the ''[[bakufu]]''. The political dominance of Hayashi's ideas lasted until the end of the 18th century.  This evolution developed in part from Razan's equating samurai with the cultured governing class.  Razan helped to legitimize the role of the militaristic ''bakufu'' at the beginning of its existence.  His philosophy moreover encouraged the samurai class to cultivate themselves, a trend which became increasingly widespread over the course of his lifetime and after his death.  Razan's aphorism encapsulates this view:
:::"No true learning without arms and no true arms without learning."&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, Catherina. (1999). ''The Heart of the Warrior'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hayashi Razan and his family played a significant role is helping to crystallize the theoretical underpinnings of the Tokugawa regime.

In January 1858, [[Hayashi Akira]], the hereditary ''Daigaku-no-kami'' descendant of Hayashi Razan, headed the bakufu delegation that sought advice from the emperor in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, L. M. (2003). ''A History of Japan, 1582–1941: Internal and External Worlds'',  p. 178 n11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time the Emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate.  The most obvious consequence of this transitional overture was the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade. In the 19th century, this scholar-bureaucrat found himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change, moving arguably "by the book" through uncharted waters with Razan's well-settled theories as the only guide.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horace Howard Furness''' (November 2, 1833 – August 13, 1912) was an American [[Shakespeare]]an scholar of the 19th century.

==Life and career==
[[File:HHFurness.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Horace Howard Furness in his library at "Lindenshade," ca. 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Historic American Buildings Survey PA.23-WALF.2A-5, Library of Congress.[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?hh:2:./temp/~ammem_4nsm::]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Horace Furness was the son of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister and abolitionist [[William Henry Furness]] (1802–1896), and brother of the architect [[Frank Furness]] (1839–1912).  He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1854, then studied in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wentworth Higginson, [https://archive.org/details/memoriesmileston00chap ''Harvard Memorial Biographies''], Volume 1, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the United States, he was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1859, but his growing deafness interfered with the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Harry |date=1995 |title=Deaf Persons in the Arts and Sciences: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |page=136 |isbn=0313291705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, he joined the Shakspere {{sic}} Society of Philadelphia, an amateur study group that took its scholarship seriously. As he later wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Every member had a copy of the Variorum of 1821, which we fondly believed had gathered under each play all Shakespearian lore worth preserving down to that date. What had been added since that year was scattered in many different editions, and in numberless volumes dispersed over the whole domain of literature. To gather these stray items of criticism was real toil, real but necessary if we did not wish our labour over the text to be in vain."&lt;ref&gt;Horace Howard Furness, "How did you become a Shakespeare Student?" ''Shakespeariana'', vol. 5 (October 1888), pp. 439-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As editor of the "New [[Variorum]]" editions of Shakespeare—also called the "Furness Variorum"—he collected in a single source 300 years of references, antecedent works, influences and commentaries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} He devoted more than forty years to the series, completing the annotation of sixteen plays. His son, Horace Howard Furness, Jr. (1865–1930), joined as co-editor of the Variorum's later volumes, and continued the project after the father's death, annotating three additional plays and revising two others.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

He was a lecturer at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], a long-serving trustee (1880–1904), and chairman of the building committee for its library. Designed by his brother Frank,  Horace selected the Shakepearean quotes for the 1891 building's leaded glass windows.&lt;ref&gt;Following a 6-year restoration, Frank Furness's University of Pennsylvania Library was rededicated in 1991, on the occasion of its centennial, as the [[Fisher Fine Arts Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was the advisor for doctoral student [[Emily Jordan Folger]] who, with her husband [[Henry Clay Folger]], would co-found the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Quincy Adams and Paul Cret, ''The Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington'' (Amherst College, 1933).&lt;/ref&gt; 

An 1890 review in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' may indicate the esteem in which British critics held Furness's scholarship:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In what is called 'The Variorum Edition of Shakespeare,' America has the honor of having produced the very best and most complete edition, so far as it has gone, of our great national poet. For text, illustration (happily, not pictorial), commentary and criticism, it leaves nothing to be desired. The editor combines with the patience and accuracy of the textural scholar, an industry which has overlooked nothing of value that has been written about Shakespeare by the best German and French, as well as English commentators and critics; and what is of no less moment he possesses in himself a rare delicacy of literary appreciation and breadth of judgment, disciplined by familiarity with all that is best in the literature of antiquity as well as of modern times, which he brings to bear on his notes with great effect."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in "Horace Howard Furness," ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' (Thomson Gale, 2005-06)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">'''Jean C. Baudet''' is a Belgian [[philosopher]] and writer, born in Brussels (May 31, 1944).

==Life==
J.C. Baudet taught philosophy and history of science, from 1966 to 1973, in Africa (Congo, Burundi).
From 1973 to 1978, he was a biology researcher (agronomy faculty of [[Gembloux, Belgium]], and [[Université de Paris]]-VI). 
In 1978, he was the founder of the periodical ''Technologia'' (history of Science-Technics-Industry).
Since 1996, he was an editor of the ''Revue Générale'' (Bruxelles). The philosophical system developed by J.C. Baudet is known as editology.

==Science-Technics-Industry==
Science-Technics-Industry (STI) is a philosophical concept proposed by the Belgian philosopher Jean C. Baudet.  The objective of STI is to distinguish the rational cultural productions from the emotional or imaginary ones.  Emotional and imaginary cultural productions lead to ideologies and/or ethical and politically illusive constructions. STI is a key-concept in editology. It may be seen as an elaborate philosophical generalization of the economical notion of ''science and industry''. In the STI, technics are the interface between science and industry, and thus between knowledge (truth) and practice (efficiency).

==Editology==
Editology (in French: ''éditologie'') is the [[epistemology|epistemological]] system developed by Baudet. The main characteristic of the editology is to define the knowledge as a set of texts, discourses (and thus ''terms''), and to assign the scientificity of those texts to the very conditions of their edition - the manner they are accepted by the international scientific community. It has two purposes: understand the terms (terminology) and analyze the edition (editology ''sensu stricto'').

This philosophical approach leads to a conception of the knowledge (an truth) which admits that the hard core of rationalism (logic) is the epistemological complex STI (Science-Technics-Industry). An important consequence of the editological thought is to establish an historical critic of the successive discourses which characterize the milestones of the human thinking: literature, religion, and later philosophy. In that sense, the philosophy is defined as a discourse rejecting all the discourses.

'''John Wilson''' of Elleray [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (18 May 1785 – 3 April 1854) was a Scottish advocate, literary critic and author, the writer most frequently identified with the pseudonym '''Christopher North''' of ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]''.

He was professor of [[Moral Philosophy]] at [[Edinburgh University]] (1820–1851).

==Life and work==
John Wilson was born at [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the son of John Wilson, a wealthy gauze manufacturer who died in 1796, when John was eleven years old,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}} and Margaret Syme (1753–1825).{{sfn|Waterston|Shearer|2006|p={{page needed|date=February 2017}} }} He was the fourth child, but the eldest son, and he had nine brothers and sisters. He was only twelve when he entered the [[University of Glasgow]], and continued to attend various classes for six years, mostly under Professor [[George Jardine]], with whose family he lived.  During this period Wilson excelled in sport as well as academic subjects, and fell in love with Margaret Fletcher, who was the object of his affections for several years.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}} Fellow student [[Alexander Blair (writer)|Alexander Blair]] became a very close friend.&lt;ref name="FRonalds2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803 Wilson was entered as a [[gentleman commoner]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].  He was inspired by [[Oxford, England|Oxford]], and in much of his later work, notably in the essay called "Old North and Young North", he expresses his love for it. But his Magdalen days were not altogether happy, though he obtained a brilliant first class degree. His love affairs did not go happily, his "Margaret" eloped to New York with his younger brother, Charles and he made no close friends at his own college and few in the university. He took his degree in 1807, and at twenty-two was his own master, with a good income, no guardian to control him, and no need to work for a living. Instead, his occupation was an estate on [[Windermere]] called Elleray, ever since connected with his name. Here he built, boated, wrestled, shot, fished, walked and amused himself for four years, besides composing or collecting from previous compositions a considerable volume of poems, published in 1812 as ''The Isle of Palms''. He became intimate with [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Robert Southey]] and [[Thomas de Quincey]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}}

[[Image:ChristopherNorth.JPG|thumb|left|'Christopher North' in his sporting jacket]]
In 1811 he married Jane Penny, daughter of the [[Liverpool]] merchant and slave trader [[James Penny]], and they were happy for four years, until the event which made a working [[man of letters]] of Wilson, and without which he would probably have produced a few volumes of verse and nothing more. Most of his fortune was lost by the dishonest speculation of an uncle, in whose hands Wilson had carelessly left it.  His mother had a house in [[Edinburgh]], in which she was able and willing to receive her son and his family; he was not forced to give up Elleray, though he was no longer able to live there.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}}

[[File:John Wilson 1785-1854.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Etching of Wilson]]
He read law and was elected to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1815, still with many outside interests, and in 1816 produced a second volume of poems, ''The City of the Plague''. In 1817, soon after the founding of ''Blackwood's Magazine'', Wilson began his connection with the [[Tory]] monthly and in October 1817 he joined with [[John Gibson Lockhart]] in the October number working up [[James Hogg]]'s MS a satire called the ''Chaldee Manuscript'', in the form of biblical parody, on the rival ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', its publisher and his contributors. He became the principal writer for ''Blackwood's'', though never its nominal editor, the publisher retaining supervision even over [[John Gibson Lockhart|Lockhart]]'s and "Christopher North's" contributions, which were the making of the magazine.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}}

In 1822 began the series of ''[[Noctes Ambrosianae]]'', after 1825 mostly Wilson's work. These are discussions in the form of convivial table-talk, including wonderfully various digressions of criticism, description and miscellaneous writing.  There was much ephemeral, a certain amount purely local, and something occasionally trivial in them. But their dramatic force, their incessant flashes of happy thought and happy expression, their almost incomparable fulness of life, and their magnificent humour give them all but the highest place among genial and recreative literature. "The Ettrick Shepherd," an idealised portrait of [[James Hogg]], one of the talkers, is a most delightful creation. Before this, Wilson had contributed to ''Blackwood's'' prose tales and sketches, and novels, some of which were afterwards published separately in Lights and ''Shadows of Scottish Life'' (1822), ''The Trials of Margaret Lyndsay'' (1823) and ''The Foresters'' (1825); later appeared essays on [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Homer]] and all sorts of modern subjects and authors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}}{{sfn|Gilman|Thurston|Colby|1905|p=549}}

[[File:John Wilson aka 'Christopher North' statue, Princes Street Gardens.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Statue in Princes Street Gardens]]
Wilson left his mother's house and established himself (1819) in Ann Street, Edinburgh, with his wife and five children. His election to the chair of [[Moral Philosophy]] in the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1820) was unexpected, and the best qualified man in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], Sir [[William Hamilton (metaphysician)|William Hamilton]], was also a candidate. But the matter was made a political one; the Tories still had a majority in the burgh council; Wilson was powerfully backed by friends, Sir [[Walter Scott]] at their head; and his adversaries played into his hands by attacking his moral character, which was not open to any fair reproach.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}}

Wilson made a very excellent professor, never perhaps attaining to any great scientific knowledge in his subject or power of expounding it, but acting on generation after generation of students with a stimulating force that is far more valuable than the most exhaustive knowledge of a particular topic.{{sfn|Garnett|1900|p=109}}

His duties left him plenty of time for magazine work, and for many years his contributions to Blackwood were voluminous, in one year (1834) amounting to over fifty separate articles. Most of the best and best known of them appeared between 1825 and 1835.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694}}

In his last thirty years, he oscillated between Edinburgh and Elleray, with excursions and summer residences elsewhere, a sea trip on board the [[Experimental Squadron (Royal Navy)|Experimental Squadron]] in the [[English Channel]] during the summer of 1832, and a few other unimportant diversions. The death of his wife in 1837 was an exceedingly severe blow to him, especially as it followed within three years that of his friend Blackwood.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=694–695}}

==Death and legacy==
John Wilson died at home in Gloucester Place in Edinburgh.

He is buried beneath a large red granite obelisk of simple design on the southern side of [[Dean Cemetery]].

In 1865 a statue by Sir [[John Steell]] was erected to his memory in [[Princes Street Gardens]]. The bronze figure stands on a substantial stone pedestal and is located between the Royal Scottish Academy and the [[Scott Monument]].

A scene from his play "A City of Plague" was adapted by [[Alexander Pushkin]] as "[[A Feast in Time of Plague]]" and become a subject of a number of adaptations, including operas and a TV movie "[[Little Tragedies (1979 film)|Little Tragedies]]" (featuring [[Ivan Lapikov]] as The Priest).

==Family==
His brother [[James Wilson (zoologist)|James Wilson]] (1795–1856), was known as a zoölogist.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=694, fn. 1}}

On 11 May 1811 Wilson married Jane Penny, the daughter of a Liverpool merchant and "the leading belle of the lake country". They had children.

Wilson left two sons, John and Blair, one a clergyman of the church of England, the other for a time secretary to the university of Edinburgh;{{sfn|Garnett|1900|p=111}}vand had three daughters:
*Margaret Anne, married Professor [[James Frederick Ferrier]];{{sfn|Garnett|1900|p=111}}
*Mary, his biographer, married [[John Thomson Gordon]] [[FRSE]] (1813-1865), [[sheriff of Midlothian]] and son of [[John Gordon (anatomist)|Dr John Gordon]].{{sfn|Garnett|1900|p=111}}{{sfn|RSE|2006}}
*Jane Emily, married [[William Edmonstoune Aytoun]].{{sfn|Garnett|1900|p=111}}

He was cousin to Very Rev [[Matthew Leishman]] and they lived side by side during their childhood in Paisley.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/matthewleishmano00leisuoft/matthewleishmano00leisuoft_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was also the great great great uncle of [[Ludovic Kennedy]].

==Publications==
Publications include the ''Works'' of John Wilson, edited by P. J. Ferrier (12 volumes, Edinburgh, 1855–59); the ''Noctes Ambrosianœ'', edited by R. S. Mackenzie (five volumes, New York, 1854); a ''Memoir'' by his daughter, M. W. Gordon (two volumes, Edinburgh, 1862); and for a good estimate, [[George Saintsbury|G. Saintsbury]], in ''Essays in English Literature'' (London, 1890); and [[Caleb Thomas Winchester|C. T. Winchester]], "John Wilson," in ''Group of English Essayists of the Early Nineteenth Century'' (New York, 1910).{{sfn|Gilman|Thurston|Colby|1905|p=549}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6078">[[File:Alois Gügler.jpg|thumb|250px|Aloysius Gügler.]]
'''Joseph Heinrich Aloysius Gügler''' (25 August 1782 &amp;ndash; 28 February 1827) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[theologian]].

Gügler was born at [[Udligerschwyl]], near [[Lucerne]], Switzerland. The only son of simple country people, he was a delicate child and received no regular schooling, but read the books belonging to his father again and again, so that, when only twelve years old, he had read the entire Holy [[Scripture]] several times. Religiously inclined from childhood, he early desired to enter the clerical state, and after many entreaties his parents permitted him to begin his studies at the abbey school of [[Einsiedeln]]. When the storms of the [[French Revolution]] crossed the [[Rhine]], Abbot Beatus, the religious, and students, in May, 1798, went to the [[Abbey]] of St. Gerold, and at the end of the year Gügler was sent to [[Petershausen]], near [[Constance]]. In 1800 he continued his classical course at [[Solothurn]]. In 1801 he began [[philosophy]], which he finished with great credit at Lucerne according to [[Immanuel Kant]] and Jacobi. Even as a student he showed those opposite traits of character, for which he was noted all through life: a courage ready to overcome any obstacles and fearing no consequences in the defence of right, with at the same time an unobtrusive, almost shrinking nature; a very comprehensive knowledge of men and affairs together with a dread of showing it. During this period he became acquainted with [[Joseph Widmer]], a fellow-student, the acquaintance ripening into a lifelong friendship. Through the influence of Widmer, Gügler, who had become undecided as to his future career, took up the study of [[theology]], which both pursued at [[Landshut]] under Sailer and Zimmer. Shortly before his ordination to the [[priest]]hood he was appointed professor of [[exegesis]] at the [[lyceum]] in Lucerne. After he had received Holy orders, 9 March 1805, at the hands of Testa Ferrata, the [[papal legate]], he was made a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the collegiate church of St. [[Leodegar]] (Saint-Léger), retaining his position as professor of exegesis. Later he also taught pastoral theology, and 1822-24 acted as prefect of the lyceum. 

Gügler and Widmer, who had also been made a professor at Lucerne, put new life into the study of the Scriptures, theology, and cognate branches. Students were encouraged to drop antiquated notions, to think and investigate for themselves, to gain solid knowledge, and to avoid superficiality. The methods of the new teachers brought them into conflict, as well with the supporters of the old school, as with the followers of [[Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg]] and the "Illuminati" of Switzerland who accused the professors of unchristian mysticism. A controversy followed between Gügler and Thaddæus Müller, city [[pastor]] of Lucerne, during which appeared, among other writings, Gügler's "Geist des Christentums und der Literatur im Verhältniss zu den Thaddæus Müllerschen Schriften". Müller made a formal demand to the municipal authorities for the removal of Gügler from the professorship, which was decreed 12 Dec., 1810. Immediately Widmer handed in his resignation, a large number of students threatened to leave, and even the majority of citizens sided with Gügler. Müller saw his mistake, and, at his special request Gügler was reinstated 23 Jan., 1811. Gügler had also a dispute with Marcus Lutz, pastor at [[Leufelfingen]], and issued the sarcastic [[pamphlet]] "Chemische Analyse und Synthese des Marcus Lutz zu Leufelfingen" (1816). Another controversy was with Troxler, who later became known as a philosopher. Gügler devoted his time chiefly to teaching and to literary work, but he frequently preached, and he wrote a poem for the twenty-fifth anniversary of Sailer's ordination. To his scholars he was a true friend, adviser, and consoler. Perhaps the last literary work of Gügler was a protest against the admission of non-Catholics to the Canton of Lucerne, as he wished to preserve for the people the inestimable boon of unity in faith. He died at Lucerne.  His career, though short, was a source of great blessing to his country. Sketches of his life were written by Widmer and Geiger, and his biography was prepared by Joseph L. Schiffmann, "Lebensgeschichte des Chorherrn und Professors Aloys Gügler" (Augsburg, 1833); a lengthy article on Gügler and his exegetical works appeared in the "Katholik" (1829), XXXIV, 53, 196. 

His principal work is: "Die hl. Kunst oder die Kunst der Hebräer" (1814, 1817, 1818), 3 vols. It is a philosophical exposition of Old Testament Revelation undertaken by a mind which gives full credence to the truth of Revelation, and under the veil of the letter sees hidden treasures of wonderful wisdom which it considers the highest achievement of human investigation to find and give to the world. In 1819 Widmer published the continuation of this work in relation to the [[New Testament]]: "Ziffern der Sphinx oder Typen der Zeit und ihr Deuten auf die Zukunft" (Solothurn, 1819). This wishes to show the divine order of current events which are presented in grand pictures and prophetic visions. A periodical founded by Gügler in 1823, "Zeichen der Zeit im Guten und Bösen", was continued by Dr. Segesser. Among Gügler's published works is a volume entitled "Privatvorträge", lectures on the Gospel of St. John, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Christian doctrine of St. Augustine, together with a brief sketch of the sacred books of the Old Testament (Sarmenstorf, 1842). His posthumous works were edited by Widmer between 1828 and 1842. A complete list of all his printed works is given in the "Thesaurus librorum rei catholicæ" (Würzburg, 1856), I, 337.

== Biography ==
Shaikh Abdul Latif was follower of the [[Naqshbandi]] sufi sect so Muhammad Zaman learned [[Quran]] and [[Sufi]] teachings from his father. Then he was sent to [[Thatta]] to study further in the Madrassa of Shaikh Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi who was a follower of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref name=maqoolat/&gt; During this time he met Khawaja Abul Masakin,&lt;ref name="sindh_govt"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sindh.gov.pk/dpt/usharzakaat/khwajazaman.htm|title= HAZRAT KHAWJA MUHAMMAD ZAMAN , LUARI SHARIF}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a sufi saint and a follower of the Sirhandi saints, and left the madrassa of Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi to start sufi training under Abul Masakin from whom he later earneded the title of Sultan Al Aoliya (Master of Sufis). After some time Abul Masakin appointed him his successor and himself went to [[Mecca]] for Hajj  where he died shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=maqoolat/&gt; Muhammad Zaman then started  preaching [[sufism]], training people in the path of divine love.&lt;ref name=mayaar&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MaayarSalikan-e-tariqatsindhiTranslation/00426_Maayar-Salikan-Tariqat-sd#page/n646/mode/2up |title=Mayaar-e-Salikeen |last1=Qani'i Thatwi |first1=Mir Ali Sher |date=2010 |website= archives.org |accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time he was a complete [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]]. Later, Muhammad Zaman moved to his home town Luari and continued his preachings, where he attracted masses of people around him.&lt;ref name=zulfiqar/&gt;&lt;ref name="sindh_govt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tufatulkiram&gt;{{cite web|url =https://archive.org/stream/Tuhfat-ul-kiramurduTranslation/00444_Tuhfat-ul-Kiram-ur#page/n593/mode/2up |title = Tuhfat-ul-kiramurduTranslation|last = Rizvi |first = Akhtar |accessdate= 4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]], a sufi poet himself, once came to Luari to meet Muhammad Zaman.&lt;ref name="Jotwani"&gt;Jotwani Motilal: ''Sufis of Sindh''. Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, 1986, {{ISBN|81-230-0508-3}}, ({{Google books|xvgADgAAQBAJ|page=105}}).&lt;/ref&gt; After the meeting Latif is said to have repeatedly recited this verse in praise of Muhammad Zaman:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|

He died on January 6, 1775 AD (Dhul-Qadh 4, 1188 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]]), and his tomb is in Luari, Sindh.&lt;ref name=tufatulkiram /&gt;&lt;ref name=Makhdoom&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MakhdoomAbdulRahimGirhorisindhiABiography/Girhori#page/n30/mode/2up |title=Makhdoom Abdul Rahim Garhori |last1=Qaboolai |first1=Taj Muhammad |date=2000 |website= archives.org |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==
Muhammad Zaman was also a [[sufi poet]].&lt;ref name="Ansari1992"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ansari |first= S. F. D. |date= 1992 |title= Sufi Saints and State Power: The Pirs of Sind, 1843-1947 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 22 |isbn= 0521405300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he is said to have said hundreds of poems but only 85 have been available in written form.  A collection of these poems is ''Abyat Sindhi'' (Sindhi poems). [[Faqir Abdul Raheem Garhori|Shaikh Abdul Rahim Garhori]], one of his disciples,&lt;ref name="Schimmel1974"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schimmel |first= A. |date= 1974 |title= Sindhi literature (A history of Indian literature) |location= Wiesbaden|publisher= Otto Harrassowitz |page= 20 |isbn= 978-3447015608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kalam&gt;{{cite web |url =https://archive.org/stream/KalamGirhoriSindhi_201304/Kalam-Girhori-sindhi#page/n15/mode/2up |title = Kalam-e-Garhori|last = Daudpoto |first = Umar bin Muhammad |date=1995 |accessdate= 5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has written a comprehensive commentary and explanation of these poems, called ''Sharah Abyat Sindhi''. They reflect deep mysteries of sufism and general common sense.&lt;ref name=maqoolat/&gt; Though he was a Naqshbandi and all Naqshbandi sufis follow [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat-ash-Shuhūd]] he seems to have merged Wahdat-ash-Shuhūd and [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat-al-Wujūd]] in his poerty.&lt;ref name=Tuhfa/&gt; He says:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
سرتيون سٽ ڪپاھ ماريو م منصور کي
ٿي ترڪيب تباھ وحدت وايُ وات مِ
|
O friends! do not kill [[Mansoor Al Hallaj|Mansoor]] as yarn is nothing else but cotton itself in modified form
When assemblage is gone, there is no difference between two and one will definitely shout of the unity of existence.&lt;ref name=Abyat/&gt;}}

This implies that claim of Mansoor ''Ana-al-Haqq'' (I am God : Haqq is a name of God in Islam) was not pointless as he had discovered the fact that his existence and that of universe was nothing but the manifestation of God's attributes, as yarn is nothing but cotton, therefore Mansoor should not be killed. At some other point he says in favour of Shuhūd:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
پاڻي لھر پسڻ مِ برابر ٿيا
ڪي اتي يُ اڙيا ڪي لنگھي مقصد مڙيا
|
Water and waves seem to be one thing, not two
Some thought it is the reality while some perceived non existence of waves on their own.&lt;ref name=Abyat/&gt;}}

Means waves have no real existence of their own and are merely movement in water, in the same way, while the universe does not have its own existence, it is not the same as God. But generally it is considered that he was neither on side of Wahdat-al-Shuhūd completely nor in complete favour of Wahdat-al-Wujūd, instead he combined both ideologies to show that the differences in between them were merely of words and not real.&lt;ref name=Tuhfa&gt;{{cite web |url =https://archive.org/stream/TuhfaLawariSharifsindhi/00381_TUHFA-LAWARI-SHARIF#page/n50/mode/2up |title = Tuhfa Luwari|last = Girami |first = Ghulam Muhammad |date=1974 |accessdate= 30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kind Movement''' (sometimes stylized as ''KIND Movement'') is a [[cause marketing|cause-marketing]] campaign&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-12" /&gt; launched by [[KIND Healthy Snacks|Kind LLC]], a [[NYC|New-York]]-based [[snack food|snack-food]] manufacturer.

== History ==
Introduced in 2008, the Kind Movement was announced by Kind LLC's marketing director with the purpose of "[furthering] our mission to make the world a little kinder by inspiring kind acts." The Kind Movement is said to have "inspired thousands of unexpected acts of kindness around the world"{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.

=== ''Kinded'' ===
The ''Kinded'' involved created and distributed uniquely coded cards that were to serve as 'licenses' to do kind acts. The hope was that this would start a chain of kind acts that could be publicly tracked by their unique code on an interactive online platform.

===''Do the KIND Thing''===
In March 2010, the company furthered its efforts to inspire unexpected acts of kindness with ''Do the KIND Thing'', a platform that empowered people to turn kind acts into support for causes.&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-12"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/business/media/12adnewsletter1.html "Depending on the Kind-ness of Strangers"] The New York Times, 2010-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; During the platform's three-month duration, ''Do The KIND Thing'' inspired more than 40,000 acts of kindness in support of nearly 150 causes. At the culmination, KIND awarded funds to the three causes that inspired the greatest number of KIND acts: Operation Gratitude&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opgratitude.com/|title=Operation Gratitude - Sending Care Packages to U.S. Military|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good Girls Give&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodgirlsgive.org/|title=Good Girls|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Suffolk County JCC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolkyjcc.org/|title=Home - SYJCC Your Community's Community Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, KIND unveiled a new iteration of ''Do the KIND Thing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.KINDsnacks.com/world|title=Let's celebrate kindness!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where people could transform their small acts of kindness into big KIND Acts that give back to the world.

On the first Tuesday of each month, KIND challenges its community to carry out a specific KINDING Mission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindsnacks.com/world/glossary#term-kinding-mission-proper-noun KINDING Mission]&lt;/ref&gt; (KIND Tuesday).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindsnacks.com/world/glossary#term-kind-tuesday-proper-noun KIND Tuesday]&lt;/ref&gt; If enough people sign up to complete that month's KINDING Mission, KIND carries out a BIG KIND Act&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110404001123/http://www.kindsnacks.com/world/glossary BIG KIND Act] &lt;/ref&gt; for a group of people that really needs it.

===#Kindawesome Card===
The #kindawesome card is a method noted on the Kind bar website. When someone does something nice, a #kindawesome card can be sent to them that can be redeemed for a free kind bar. The recipient gets another card to pass on to someone else and continue the kind gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.howkindofyou.com|title=Let's celebrate kindness!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kind Food Truck===
In April 2011, Kind introduced the Kind Food Truck to recruit people for the movement and to distribute samples of Kind products.

===Kind Charitable Support===
In 2010, Kind granted more than $100,000 in product and monetary donations to causes that inspired kindness—including organizations such as [[Surfrider Foundation]], [[Gail Simmons|Common Threads]], [[Autism Speaks]], [[Extreme Makeover Home Edition]] and the [[Great Kindness Challenges]].&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-12"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}

==Reception==
The ''Kinded'' campaign received mixed press coverage, with [[NBC]] Connecticut asking, "Clever and optimistic or jaded marketing ploy?"&lt;ref name="nbcct"&gt;[http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/around-town/food-drink/Being-Kind-Kind-of-Pays-Off-63772162.html “Being Kind Pays Off, Kind Of”], NBC Connecticut. 2009-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; It was recognized by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as a "new way to make a difference"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1921428,00.html “New Ways to Make a Difference”], TIME Magazine. 2009-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=July 2016}} and by '' [[Ladies' Home Journal]]''as a way to "snack and give back."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindsnacks.com/media-center/2009/10/ladies-home-journal-features-kind-and-kinded/ “Snack and Give Back”], Ladies’ Home Journal. 2009-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marc Jean-Bernard''' (born May 14, 1952) is a French philosopher, thinker in [[International Relations]], classical musician and musicologist. His published work is notably dedicated to  ''[[Hermeneutics]] of Culture.'', ''International Politics Theory'', [[Aesthetics|Aesthetic Theory]]'',  and ''[[Philosophy of music|Philosophy of Music]]''.
His theoretical contributions (written in French, English, and Spanish) to ''Philosophy of Music'' present the particularity to synthesize hermeneutical, analytical and cognitive methodologies.
Marc Jean-Bernard internally associates theoretical investigation into artistic/educative praxis and concrete institutional action in Puerto Rico (USA).

==Life==
Marc Jean-Bernard was born in Paris into a family of intellectuals and lawyers (he was named ''Jean-Bernard'' after the French historian Jean-Bernard Passerieu). He accomplished his philosophical studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], Paris 1, where he was strongly influenced by the French philosopher [[Jacques Bouveresse]], and by the French philosopher and musicologist [[Vladimir Jankélévitch]]. After working on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s Aesthetics, his Doctoral Studies and Thesis on Wittgenstein was specifically focused on the aesthetic and [[cultural dimensions]] of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s Philosophical corpus, in relation with Austrian/German culture and Music. Marc Jean-Bernard received his Doctorate in Philosophy at the Sorbonne (Paris 1) for his thesis on Wittgenstein under the direction of Professor Jacques Bouveresse.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein and the Idea of Culture&lt;/ref&gt; At the same, the time he started an active career as a ''classical guitarist'', conductor and musicologist. He started studying Music formally at a very early age and developed since 1978 a career of classical musician and performed extensively worldwide as a soloist and conductor until 2000.  He dedicated as well himself to philosophical, academic and diplomatic activities. Since his new public appearance in June 2015 in London[5], Marc Jean-Bernard returned successfully to the concert halls in Europe and South America, as a conductor, soloist and a lecturer in the frame of Concert-Lectures.

Having been also trained with American composers and virtuosos, his strong interest and competencies in South American Music, Literature and Culture led him to investigate in a Wittgenstein's way -and interpret as well- narrative and mythical dimensions of [[Latin American music|Latin American Music]]. His life took on a [[Latin America|Latin-American]] flavor with a move to Colombia, where he combined the teaching of ''Philosophy of Language'' at the Public University&lt;ref&gt;Universidad del Valle&lt;/ref&gt; with the post of Dean of the Music Faculty at a leading Conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;Conservatorio Antonio Mar♂a Valencia&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2004, Marc Jean-Bernard's professional life was divided between the worlds of philosophy and music. In that year, a third world was added to them with his nomination as [[ad honorem]] [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of [[France]] in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein and the Idea of Culture&lt;/ref&gt;   
Currently, Professor of [[Humanities]] at the [[University of Puerto Rico]], he maintains his interests in the [[Culture Theory]] and the ''Philosophy of the Arts'', the subjects of many essays and papers in French, English, and Spanish. He also pursues his musical activities, some of which have been recorded on French labels. He is also active in his consular mission, which is particularly involved in the development of [[European studies|European Studies]], through bilateral agreements with overseas universities. Since 2009, Dr. Marc Jean-Bernard is the Director of an [[International Studies]] Program at the [[University of Puerto Rico]].  His current investigations and publications on this subject are dedicated to the [[dialogue]] between Europe and [[the United States|America]], with a topical emphasis on [[Latin America]] from a perspective articulating [[International Relations]] and [[Culture]].  Dr. Marc Jean-Bernard published in 2012 an extent essay: ""Tractatus Musico Philosophicus, I. Filosofía y Estética Musical"", Ed. Posdata, 522 p.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9781480191884}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is preparing a French, Spanish and English full publication of his [[Essays]]. His extensive research on the theory of diplomatic dialogue conducted him to privilege the diplomacy of [[Charles de Gaulle]] in several articles and a new essay on de Gaulle's foreign policy and diplomacy, to be issued in French, English, and Spanish. The French original version of this new philosophical essay, the first volume of an extent ''Phenomenology of Dialogue'', has been published in September 2018: ''Phénoménologie du dialogue, I.-Charles de Gaulle,une pensée diplomatique en acte. Amérique Latine.'' {{ISBN|9782414243235}}/{{ISBN|9782414243242}}

In 2010, Dr. Jean-Bernard has been elected [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Consular Corps]] of [[Puerto Rico]].

In July 2014, Dr. Jean-Bernard founded the first ''''Institute of [[International Relations]] of Puerto Rico'''' (Non-Profit Corporation), a [[think tank]] dedicated to the offering, far from the ideologies, independent scientific and specialized contributions to concrete governance, democracy, and peace. http://iripr.weebly.com

He has been elected member of the ''Academy of the Arts and Sciences'' of [[Puerto Rico]], between other academical and official distinctions.

==Philosophy==
Marc Jean-Bernard's Philosophy could be accurately described as a musico-philosophical investigation of ''understanding'' and ''interpreting'', following the tradition of thinkers such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty|Merleau-Ponty]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Jankélévitch]].  Such a philosophical perspective assume -after [[Schopenhauer]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Wittgenstein]]-, that the blurring of the original unity between Philosophy and Music has to be rethought and overcome. This assumption, equally relevant for the Indo- Iranian, Japanese and Chinese cosmologies, is grounded, in [[western culture]], on the constructive acknowledgment of the internal relation between the general theory of ''Lógos'', and the theory of ''αρμονια'' for which the concept of ''musiké'' is one of the major dimensions. This theoretical and dialogical perspective, with its stress on the relevance of cultural hermeneutics, aesthetics and musical thinking for the problematic of unity and diversity in culture(s), entail several methodological demands. These tasks can be equally formulated from a phenomenological, hermeneutical, or grammatical point of view. This open hermeneutics  is focused by Marc Jean-Bernard on both practical and theoretical dimensions:

'''Epistemic Perspective'''

The Greek locution ''Dialegein'' synthesizes a theoretic set of axiological investigations, corresponding to a unified epistemic methodology which embraces Cultural Hermeneutics, specifically Aesthetics and Ethics. His construction of ethical and aesthetical responsibility stands as a philosophical ''cantus firmus'' for the understanding of cultural polyphony. 
'''Intentionality and Cognition'''
Firstly, Marc Jean-Bernard seeks to provide a philosophical account of [[cognitive science]]s in the field of culture. The extension of research in [[Philosophy of mind|Philosophy of Mind]] and [[Continental philosophy|Continental Philosophy]] assigns a theoretical imperative to ethical and cultural investigations, in order to grammatically fix the amphibology of explanation. In contrast to the anti-functionalism and anti- [[physicalism]] of phenomenology and hermeneutics, his research on intentionality and subjectivity induces a deep revision of the dichotomy between the transcendental and analytical accounts of phenomenology. He starts with a clear grammar of the term [[intentionality]], unifying its phenomenological and cognitive meaning. Then, a '' non-reductive'' perspective on Mind and Psychism examines cognitive intentionality (representational consciousness of cognition) and affective intentionality (non-representational consciousness and non-affective connaturality), following both the phenomenological description of consciousness and the legacy of Wittgenstein’s investigations on perception, knowledge, and psychology.

'''Aesthetic experience as axiology'''

In his musical or philosophical essays and papers, he stressed the relevance of ''values'' in the aesthetic experience considered as a counterpoint of hermeneutic gestures. This insight on symbolic consciousness and truth-content of art is exemplified throughout two ontologically interconnected main fields: Music and Architecture. Considering non- representational and representational semantics of Music and Architecture, the temporalization and spatialization gestures implied in design and composition embrace the entire sphere of dwelling in a given world, what we call an aesthetical ''oikonomia''. This connection between temporality and spatiality is exposed through recent examples, where axiological and "immunological" claims of a harmonic world are creatively expressed. These paradigmatic topics, focused on architectural design and musical compositions, are chosen between contemporary works from European, Japanese, North and South American cultures.

'''Knowledge, Art, and Responsibility'''

Correspondingly, he crystallizes the claim for ''dialogue'' between cognitive and hermeneutics in Art, Ethics and Education. His dialogical perspective entails new methodological demands applied to [[cultural diversity]]. Phenomenological, grammatical, and cognitive approaches of today’s Aesthetic Endeavour induce a corresponding insight of the role of affective intentionality in Ethics. He assumes that we are led to a synoptic view of Responsibility, within a non reductive frame. Responsibility, linking Wittgenstein to Levinas, and phenomenological to cognitive descriptions, emphasizes the exigent core of a philosophical telos. This Duty reaffirms Malraux’s meditation in ''The Twilight of the Absolute'', through the infinite epiphany of Autrui.

'''Marc Jean-Bernard's musical career''' mirror his thinking, which is exposed and published in three languages through multiples essays and conferences to be soon republished in a synthetic way.
Echoing [[Bernard Holland]] in [[The New York Times]] in 1982, Jean Gallois synthetized the enthusiastic reception of his concerts by the public: " C’est Splendide; oyez, oyez bonnes gens! Un merveilleux guitariste nous est né".
Marc Jean-Bernard's Recital programs reflect his philosophical conception of music and project his conception of the social mission of the classical performer. Tour recitals and recordings have been always dedicated to  the insight of the ''musical thinking'' of  specific composers. According to this goal, Marc Jean-Bernard's discography is focused on complete works or cycles, fully documented by commentaries.

'''Marcelo Dascal''' (born 1940 in [[São Paulo]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian-born [[Israel]]i [[philosopher]] and [[linguist]], who has been a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Tel Aviv University]] since 1967. He also served as a ''Dean of the Faculty of Humanities'' from 1995 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/philos/dascal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Marcelo Dascal graduated from a philosophy and electrical engineering faculty at the [[University of São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. He studied linguistics and epistemology in Aix-en- Provence (France) and obtained his Ph.D. at the Hebrew [[University of Jerusalem]], under the supervision of Yehoshua Bar-Hillel. 

In Israel he became a teacher at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and [[Ben-Gurion University]] of the Negev. At this university he founded and lead the Department of Philosophy. 

Abroad, he taught at different well-known educational institutions such as the University of São Paulo, Brasília, Campinas and Unisinos (Brazil), Lisboa (Portugal), Lugano (Switzerland), Massachusetts (Amherst), California (Berkeley), Monash (Melbourne, Australia), UNAM and UAM (Mexico), Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris), Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris III), Università degli Studi di Bologna (Italy), and others.
In addition to his undergraduate teaching, he has supervised thirteen completed Ph.D. dissertations.

He took part in a lot of scientific meetings all around the world, often being invited there as a keynote speaker.

He is currently a member of the board of many scientific associations and journals and the President of the New Israeli Philosophical Association and of the International Association for the Study of Controversies. 

He has held research positions at the universities of Indiana, Stuttgart, Bochum, Technische Univ. Berlin, UNED (Madrid) and the Centre d'Etudes de la Philosophie Moderne (CNRS, Paris), and conducted research on the pragmatics of native languages in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] area. In 1985-1986 he was a Fellow of the Netherlands Institute of Advanced Studies (Wassenaar) and in 1994-1995 he was a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the winter term of 2002/3, he was granted the Leibniz Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Studies of Leipzig University (Germany), where he was the first Leibniz scholar to hold this position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/philos/dascal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
In 1995/6 Dascal coordinated in Jerusalem an international research project called "Leibniz the Polemicist", which was aimed to find new ways to develop an understanding of the importance of [[debate]] in shaping knowledge. It was inspired in Leibniz's eclectic and pluralistic approach, according to which knowledge arises out of the synthesis of the "grains of truth" present in every [[doctrine]], a synthesis that is to be achieved through rational controversy governed by a notion of rationality not reducible to logical deduction and yet not arbitrary. One of the results of this project was the creation of the International Association for the Study of Controversies (IASC, read I ASK). The association has conducted since 1996 yearly workshops and conferences.

Another result was a joint German-Israeli research project on the evolution of scientific, philosophical and theological controversies in the 17th and 18th centuries. This project received a three-year grant (1999–2001) from the German-Israeli Foundation. It was conducted by a team of ten Israeli and German Post-Doctoral and Doctoral researchers, and published four reports.

Dascal has published several articles on the topic, and co-founded (along with Gerd Fritz) a new book series called "Controversies", whose first three volumes were published in 2005.

===Leibniz and the history of modern philosophy===
Dascal is a [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] scholar. He has published ''La Sémiologie de Leibniz'' (Paris, 1978), ''Leibniz: Language, Signs and Thought'' (Amsterdam, 1987), and has co-edited ''Leibniz and Adam'' (Tel Aviv, 1991) which was selected by the Leibniz Gesellschaft as a special gift for its members. He published many articles on Leibniz, his contemporaries, and his influence. Dascal is co-founder of the Israel Leibniz Association (in Hebrew: ''Agudat Leibniz Israel'') and a member of the Leibniz Association of America and of the Leibniz Gesellschaft.

In his earlier work, Dascal focused mainly on Leibniz's philosophy of language, and established the now accepted view that natural [[language]]s and other semiotic systems play, for Leibniz, a crucial role in our mental life, and therefore cannot be overlooked in understanding his [[epistemology]]. In his recent work, Dascal has been emphasizing the fact that, alongside Leibniz's well known and advertised idea of a formal semiotic system, the "Universal Characteristic", which would be the ideal tool for human cognition, based on a strictly deductive or "calculation" model of [[rationality]], Leibniz was also concerned with those aspects of rational thought and action which were not accountable for in terms of such a model. Accordingly, he developed a model of what came to be known later as "soft" rationality. Dascal has conducted intensive research on this rather underestimated aspect of Leibniz's rationalism.

===Philosophy of language, pragmatics and cognitive science===
In the [[philosophy of language]], Dascal's work focuses on the theory of language use, i.e., [[pragmatics]]. He has contributed both to sociopragmatics and to psychopragmatics (a concept he created) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/philos/dascal/ 
Marcelo Dascal, Ph.D.] Retrieved on 5 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as securing a proper philosophical foundation for these two branches and for their distinction from other components of a theory of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. His contributions to the [[cognitive science]]s are closely related with his work on the mental use of language.

He has published ''Pragmatics and the Philosophy of Mind'' (Amsterdam, 1983), and has edited the relevant volume of the ''Enciclopedia IberoAmericana de Filosofia'', (Madrid, 1999) and ''Misunderstanding'' (a special issue of the ''Journal of Pragmatics'', 1999). He has also co-edited the trilingual, two volume, two-thousand page ''Philosophy of Language: A Handbook of Contemporary Research'' (Berlin, 1992, 1995), and, more recently; ''Negotiation and Power in Dialogic Interaction''. A Portuguese translation of his book ''Interpretation and Understanding'' (2003) was published in 2006.

In order to foster the study of the relationship between the use of language (and other [[semiotic]] systems) and [[cognition]] (and other kinds of mental life) Dascal founded and edits the interdisciplinary journal ''Pragmatics &amp; Cognition'' (Amsterdam). Since 2005, the journal publishes an annual Special Issue devoted to Cognition &amp; Technology.

==Personal life==
He has been living in Israel since 1965. He is married to Varda. They have 3 children -  Hagit, Shlomit and Tamar and eight grandchildren - Adi, Lior, Ohad, Noga, Jonathan, Gilead, Almog, and Naomi. .

The '''Megarian school''' of philosophy, which flourished in the 4th century BC, was founded by [[Euclides of Megara]], one of the pupils of [[Socrates]]. Its ethical teachings were derived from Socrates, recognizing a single [[Form of the Good|good]], which was apparently combined with the [[Eleatic]] doctrine of [[monism|Unity]]. Some of Euclides' successors developed [[logic]] to such an extent that they became a separate school, known as the '''Dialectical school'''. Their work on [[modal logic]], [[logical conditional]]s, and [[propositional logic]] played an important role in the development of logic in antiquity.

==History==
The Megarian school of philosophy was founded by [[Euclides of Megara]], who had been one of the pupils of [[Socrates]] in the late 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 47&lt;/ref&gt; His successors, as head of the school in [[Megara]], were said to have been [[Ichthyas]] (mid 4th century BC), and [[Stilpo]] (late 4th century BC).&lt;ref name="diog113"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 113&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely, however, that the Megarian school was a genuine institution, nor did it have a unified philosophical position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|Pellegrin|2006|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that the philosophers of the school were first called ''Megarians'' and that later they were called ''Eristics'', and then ''Dialecticians'',&lt;ref name="diog106"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 106&lt;/ref&gt; but it is probable that these names designated splinter groups distinct from the Megarian school.&lt;ref name="otoole406"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Ichthyas, Euclides' most important pupils were [[Eubulides of Miletus]]&lt;ref name="diog108"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clinomachus|Clinomachus of Thurii]].&lt;ref name="diog112"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 112&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to have been under Clinomachus that a separate Dialectical school was founded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=406}} Although the name "Dialectical school" was apparently coined by [[Dionysius of Chalcedon]], (Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 106)&lt;/ref&gt; which placed great emphasis on [[logic]] and [[dialectic]], and Clinomachus was said to have been "the first to write about [[proposition]]s and [[Predicate (logic)|predicates]]."&lt;ref name="diog112"/&gt; However, Euclides himself taught logic,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and his pupil, Eubulides, who was famous for employing celebrated [[paradox]]es,&lt;ref name="diog108"/&gt; was the teacher of several later dialecticians.

Via Stilpo, the Megarian school is said to have influenced [[Pyrrho]], the [[Eretrian school]] under [[Menedemus]] and [[Asclepiades of Phlius|Asclepiades]], and [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], the founder of [[Stoicism]]. Zeno was said to have studied under Stilpo and [[Diodorus Cronus]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and to have disputed with [[Philo the Dialectician]]. It was perhaps the Dialecticians, Diodorus and Philo, who were the biggest influence on the development of Stoic logic, and that Zeno studied under Stilpo to learn his moral teachings, although Stilpo, too, is said to have excelled "in the invention of arguments and in sophistry."&lt;ref name="diog113"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Euclides had been a pupil of Socrates, but ancient historians regarded him as a successor to the [[Eleatics]], hence his philosophy was seen as a fusion of Eleatic and Socratic thought. Thus the Eleatic idea of "The One" was identified with the Socratic "[[Form of the Good]],"&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 106; Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposite of Good was regarded by Euclides as non-existent.&lt;ref name="diog106"/&gt; But the emphasis of his thought is not on ''being'' but on the ''good'', and idea that what is opposite to the good does not exist arises from the understanding of the good's unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gill|Pellegrin|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is typically Socratic, what matters is the moral good and the will of the good person to strive towards it. Stilpo is said to have continued the Eleatic tendency, by asserting a strict [[monism]] and denying all change and motion,&lt;ref&gt;Aristocles, in Eusebius, ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' xiv. 16. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and he also rejected [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Stilpo taught freedom, self-control, and self-sufficiency, approaching the teachings of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]s, another Socratic school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goulet-Cazé|1996|pp=403–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides studying logical puzzles and paradoxes, the Dialecticians made two important logical innovations, by re-examining [[modal logic]], and by starting an important debate on the nature of [[Material conditional|conditional statement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kneale|Kneale|1984|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the work of [[Diodorus Cronus]] and [[Philo the Dialectician]], the only two members of the Dialectical school we have detailed information about. Through their development of [[propositional logic]], the Dialectical school played an important role in the development of logic, which was an important precursor of [[Stoic logic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18996">'''Neoabolitionist''' (or '''neo-abolitionist''' or '''new abolitionism''') is  a term used in [[historiography]] to characterize historians of race relations motivated by the spirit of racial equality typified by the abolitionists who fought to abolish slavery in the mid-19th century.  They write especially about [[African-American]] history, slavery, the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]].

As abolitionists had worked in the 19th century to end slavery and provide equal rights under the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] to blacks, the new activists worked to enforce constitutional rights for all citizens and restore equality under the law for African Americans, including [[suffrage]] and [[civil rights]].

In the late 20th century some historians emphasized the worlds of African Americans in their own words, in their own communities, to recognize them as agents, not victims. Publishing in the mid-1960s and through the 20th century, a new generation of historians began to revise traditional accounts of slavery in the United States, reconstruction, [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] laws. Some major historians began to apply the term "neoabolitionist" to such historians, and some of this group identified as such.

==Early 20th century: Dunning School==
{{main|Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)}}
Many early 20th-century histories of the abolitionists and of the Reconstruction Era gave harsh assessments to the movement and the attempts by the federal government to force a transition in the South to a new social system. For instance, what was called the [[Dunning School]], an influential group of white historians led by [[William Archibald Dunning]] at [[Columbia University]], assessed Reconstruction as marred by African-American participation, saying that all the state legislatures were dominated by freedmen, that they were incompetent to govern; that they had been misled by northern carpetbaggers; and that these governments of the postwar decades were unusually corrupt.

In the 19th century after Reconstruction, former abolitionists, especially [[African American]]s such as [[Frederick Douglass]], presented positive views of its achievements: gaining of [[civil rights]] for African Americans, and expanded [[suffrage]] to include poor whites. In the early 20th century, [[Fisk University]] historian [[Alrutheus Taylor]] described the period of Reconstruction in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] in several books and articles. [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a leading Marxist historian, published his ''Black Reconstruction in America'' in 1935, challenging the Dunning School. Du Bois stressed biracial cooperation and noted the achievements of biracial Reconstruction legislatures: establishment of public education in the South for the first time, founding of hospitals, asylums, and charitable institutions to improve general welfare. He said the higher taxes were needed to finance the new infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Milton Stampp|author2=Leon F. Litwack, eds.|title=Reconstruction: An Anthology of Revisionist Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__OQ__dLw-MC&amp;pg=PA221|year=1969|publisher=Louisiana State UP|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New views of race and slavery==
Beginning in the 1960s, historians writing about slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, emphasized the human advancement achieved by the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of those who had been enslaved. Historians such as [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] and [[Martin Duberman]] admired the abolitionists and wrote studies of them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Duberman, ed. ''The Antislavery Vanguard: New Essays on the Abolitionists'' 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Through the later 20th century, such historians as David W. Blight,&lt;ref name=Blight&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David W. Blight]]|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|year=2001|publisher=Belknap Press; |isbn=0-674-00819-7 |pages=2&amp;ndash;3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Les Benedict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Les Benedict]]|title=A Compromise of Principle: Congressional Republicans and Reconstruction, 1863-1869|year=1974|publisher=Norton, W. W. &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=0-393-05524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; James McPherson, [[John Hope Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Hope Franklin]] with Alfred Moss|title=From Slavery to Freedom. A History of African Americans|edition=8th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2001|isbn=0-07-112058-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Hahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Steven Hahn]]|title=A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-674-01765-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; marshalled documentation to reject the Dunning School notion that the Reconstruction era was overwhelmingly corrupt. They evaluated the postwar period as not more corrupt than many times of social change and turmoil in American history.

[[John Hope Franklin]]  argued that Reconstruction had positive elements: most significantly, the [[enfranchisement]] of African Americans, both those already free before the war and former slaves; the extension of citizenship and civil rights to four million African Americans; and the introduction of public schools throughout the South where such schools generally had not existed. Franklin, for example, points to the founding of [[Howard University|Howard]] and [[Fisk University|Fisk]], [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black universities]] that educated generations, as two major successes of Reconstruction.

They went far beyond that in looking at slavery in detail, with changes in ideas about relations between masters and enslaved, and the various forms of resistance the latter used. The development of African-American communities, education and political culture has been intensively studied.

Historians argued that depriving African Americans of suffrage and civil rights, as was done in the South following Reconstruction, was itself a terrible form of corruption. They considered it a violation of the tenets of [[representative government]], as African Americans had been effectively excluded from political participation and public life for decades.

In his 1988 book [[Eric Foner]] dated the beginning of Reconstruction in 1863, emphasizing the significance of emancipation and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. His title, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'' (1988), emphasized the "unfinished" theme in its subtitle, explicitly connecting Reconstruction to the [[American Revolution]], which had been based on ideas about human liberty and equality. His work suggested that Reconstruction had not completed the work of providing equality and rights to all American citizens, even after constitutional amendments to provide freedmen with citizenship. That work was continuing in the 20th century. His book was published after the civil rights movement gained federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights of suffrage and equal treatment under the law for African Americans and overturn state discrimination. Foner did not identify as a "neoabolitionist" in this work, nor did he refer to other historians by that term.

==Usage history==
* The newly founded [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) in 1910 called itself a "New Abolition Movement." Historian [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] often used the term, as did newspapers in writing about the organization.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1975), pp 5, 390&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1952, [[Kenneth M. Stampp]], discussing the new generation of revisionist historians of slavery (including himself), described them as "scholarly descendants of the northern abolitionists." &lt;ref&gt;Stampp, "The Historian and Southern Negro Slavery", ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 57, No. 3. (April 1952), pp. 613-624&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1964, historian [[George Tindall]] said that in the 1920s, writer [[H. L. Mencken]] was the "guiding genius" behind "the neoabolitionist myth of the Savage South." That is, Mencken was breaking with the "[[Lost Cause]]" heroic image of the South and sharply criticizing it.&lt;ref&gt;Tindall, "Mythology: A New Frontier in Southern History," in Frank E. Vandiver, ed., ''The Idea of the South: Pursuit of a Central Theme'' (1964), pp 5&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt;
* In  the early 1960s, says [[Peter Novick]], many historians dedicated to racial equality "were called 'neo-abolitionists'--a not unfriendly characterization, and one which many so-designated embraced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Novick|title=That Noble Dream: The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA351|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=351n}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Howard Zinn]] described [[SNCC]] activists in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as the "new abolitionists" in the title of his 1964 book about the organization. Zinn did not use the term "neoabolitionist," nor did he apply the term to historians.
* In 1969, [[Don E. Fehrenbacher]] in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' discussed "today's neoabolitionist historians, whose own social roles often intensify their sense of identity with the antislavery radicals."&lt;ref&gt;Review by Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''American Historical Review'' (Oct., 1969) 75#1 pp. 212-213   [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1842054 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1974, [[C. Vann Woodward]], a historian of the South, noted that, "by the 1950s a neoabolitionist mood prevailed among historians of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;review by C. Vann Woodward, ''American Historical Review,'' (April 1974), p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1975, [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson's]] book, ''Abolitionist Legacy,'' used "neo-abolitionist" more than 50 times to characterize 20th-century activists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=sWfgQto81NsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:legacy+inauthor:james+inauthor:mcpherson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F_lDU5FGs5DJAeSkgJgM&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=neo-abolitionist&amp;f=false 57 citations]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1986, historian Jack Temple Kirby wrote, "''Neo-abolitionist'' includes both popular and scholarly liberalism and black history in race relations imagery and scholarship, and a certain cynicism toward white southern elites."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Temple Kirby, ''Media-Made Dixie: The South in the American Imagination'' (1986), p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David W. Blight]] wrote in his book, ''Race and Reunion'' (2001):
::In the end this is a story of how the forces of reconciliation overwhelmed the emancipationist vision in the national culture, how the inexorable drive for reunion both used and trumped race. But the story does not merely dead-end in the bleakness of the age of segregation; so much of the emancipationist vision persisted in American culture during the early twentieth century, upheld by blacks and a fledgling neo-abolitionist tradition, that it never died a permanent death on the landscape of Civil War memory. That persistence made the revival of the emancipationist memory of the war and the transformation of American society possible in the last third of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Blight /&gt;
* In 2003, the conservative ''[[National Review]]'' commented in 2003 "[t]his general perspective on the sectional conflict is already well represented by the Neoabolitionist school of Early American historians, and informs important works by scholars such as Paul Finkelman, Leonard Richards, Donald Robinson, and William Wiecek."[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_24_55/ai_n13606723]{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--who wrote the quote? What article?--&gt;
*According to historian Harvard Sitkoff in his 2001 article on books about African-American education, the term neoabolition or neo-abolitionist is sometimes considered derisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harvard Sitkoff|title=Segregation, Desegregation, Resegregation: African American Education, A Guide to the Literature|year=2001|publisher=Organization of American Historians.|issn=0882-228X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Fellman in his 2006 book wrote: 
::Starting in the late 1950s and continuing through the next decade, in tandem with the rise of the civil rights movement, many progressive historians reevaluated the abolitionists, even referring to the contemporary movement for change in America's perception of race as the "new abolitionism."&lt;ref&gt;Fellman, ''Prophets of Protests'' (2006), pp ix-x&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historian Christopher Metress in ''The American Historical Review'' in 2005 asserted, "the iconoclastic historian [[Stanley M. Elkins]] reinterpreted the rebellious slave as a neoabolitionist fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;Review by: Christopher Metress, ''American Historical Review,'' (February 2005) 110#1 p 155 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/531186 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fredrickson in 2008 wrote that "the most thorough and influential of the neo-abolitionist works of the 1960s was [[James M. McPherson]] ''The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionist and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (1964)." He notes that much neo-abolitionist historiography "clearly sides with the radicals against Lincoln," and that in later works, McPherson was more sympathetic to Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George M Fredrickson|title=Big Enough to Be Inconsistent: Abraham Lincoln Confronts Slavery and Race|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDpnUEpbfVwC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=131 note 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Winthrop Jordan]] in his 2008 book on slavery and the South examines a contemporary group of "neo-abolitionist" historians who are "taking seriously again the critiques of black and white abolitionists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop D.

* Zeus Leonardo wrote in 2009 the term had uses beyond historiography, saying, "Neo-abolitionist [[pedagogy]] suggests that teachers and students work together to name, reflect on, and dismantle discourses of [[whiteness]]. It means disrupting white discourses and unsettling their codes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zeus Leonardo|title=Race, Whiteness, and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3fzFqjR92esC&amp;pg=PA169|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* [[Allen C. Guelzo]] (2009) notes that Lincoln's hesitation regarding emancipation, "has earned him the execration of every abolitionist and neo-abolitionist, from Garrison to (most recently) ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' editor [[Lerone Bennett]], whose book ''[[Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream]]'' depicts Lincoln as a callous white racist, the kind of fence straddler 'we find in almost all situations of oppression or it.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen C.

*In his 2010 study of 20th-century American literature, David Seed classifies the novel, ''This Child's Gonna Live'' (1969), by Sarah E Wright, as a "neo-abolitionist" novel that "borrows from black nationalist discourse in its bold exploration of the loss of social ground gained in the Reconstruction South."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Seed|title=A Companion to Twentieth-Century United States Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4R0B0rSKmxUC&amp;pg=PA86|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Miller (2012) notes "the neo-abolitionist tone of nearly all the academic literature" on slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph C.

* Abolitionism in the United States originally related to the abolition of slavery of African-descended peoples. In the 21st century, Lawrance and Roberts have applied the term "neoabolitionist" to opponents of contemporary sexual slavery, whose victims include people from every continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin N. Lawrance|author2=Richard L.

* In 2014, historian Yonatan Eyal argued that starting in the 1950s with Kenneth Stampp "the neo-abolitionist school diametrically flipped the views of the revisionists. It earned moral credibility in doing so, maturing as it did during the upheavals of the 1960s, yet at the same time lost the ability to explain the appeal of Union and compromise as formative influences on America's past." By 2008, Eyal continues: "More Americans identify with the Civil War as a struggle for a 'new birth of freedom,' rather than for the Union, and neo-abolitionist historiography has contributed to that sense over the past several decades."&lt;ref&gt;Yonatan Eyal, "Franklin Pierce, Democratic Partisan ," in [[Joel H. Silbey]], ed. '' A Companion to the Antebellum Presidents 1837-1861''  (2014) p 347&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Kashmiri moved page [[Prakasa]] to [[Prakāśa]] over redirect: IAST spelling, as this is a technical term (IAST preferable to "prakasha")</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6456">'''Prakāśa''' is a concept of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] translated by various authors as "light", "splendour", "light of consciousness" (identified with ''[[Śiva]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Vijñana Bhairava, The Practice of Centering Awareness, Swami Lakshman Joo, glossary&lt;/ref&gt; (Swami Lakshman Joo), "luminous and undifferentiated consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;Triadic Mysticism, Paul E. Murphy, glossary&lt;/ref&gt; (Paul E. Murphy) or "primordial light beyond all manifestations"&lt;ref name="Shiva, Paul Muller-Ortega page 95"&gt;The Triadic Heart of Shiva, Paul Muller-Ortega, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; (Paul Muller-Ortega). Fellow [[Tantra|Tantric]] practitioners [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] practice [[Ösel (yoga)|Clear Light yoga]] based on a similar concept.

''Prakāśa'' is considered supreme, ultimate, unsurpassable, but as such it cannot be described as pure [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], because even though it is above all, it is still present in the manifestation, in every aspect of it. Thus ''prakāśa'' is said to be both transcendent and [[immanent]].&lt;ref name="Shiva, Paul Muller-Ortega page 95"/&gt;

==The prakāśa-vimarśa couple==
Uncreated light (''prakāśa'') is the essence of ''Śiva''. Its function is to illuminate, to make manifest. However, [[Kashmir Shaivism]] declares that the nature of ''prakāśa'' is "self apprehension", or, to reflect upon itself. "''If the supreme light were devoid of this free and spontaneous self-referential capacity, it would be powerless and inert''".&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-prāvesikā, Kṣemaraja}}, sūtra 1&lt;/ref&gt;''Prakāśa'' and ''vimarśa'' form a couple at the supreme level, identified respectively with [[Śiva]] and [[Śakti]].

==Related terms and synonyms==
Kashmir Shaivism accords a very important role to the concept of consciousness as light, so, repeatedly trying to describe this essentially undescribable experience, has given it a plurality of names:
* ''sphurattā'' - twinkling, spark
* ''ābhāsa'' - splendour, light, appearance, shining forth
* ''pratibhā'' - to shine upon, become clear or manifest, intuition
* ''{{IAST|sphuraṇa}}'' - glittering, sparkling
* ''ullāsa'' - light, splendour, bright

==Subjective experiences of prakāśa==
There is no way a personal experience of ''prakāśa'' could be fully conveyed into words, but mystics, both ancient and modern, have tried to do so, because such words carry a powerful spiritual charge. Some of the subjective attributes of the light of consciousness, in synthesis, are: "liquid", "blissful", "immaculate", "blinding", "enveloping" and "weightless". Here are but a few of the many accounts:

===Gopi Krishna===
[[Gopi Krishna (yogi)|Gopi Krishna]], in his first experience of the awakening of [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] has experienced luminous manifestations he described as:
* "''a halo of light''",
* "''a stream of liquid light''",
* "''waves of light''" and
* "''a sea of light''"

===Jaideva Singh===
In his translation of ''{{IAST|Pratyabhijñahṛdayam}}'' uses such formulations :
* about consciousness : "''the perfect I-consciousness is full of light and bliss''"&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Recognition: A Translation of {{IAST|Pratyabhijñahṛdayam, Kṣemarāja}}, Jaideva Singh, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;
* about the spiritual heart : "''{{IAST|Hṛdaya}} is not the physical heart. It had been called {{IAST|hṛdaya}} because it is the center of reality. It is the light of consciousness.''"&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Recognition: A Translation of {{IAST|Pratyabhijñahṛdayam, Kṣemarāja}}, Jaideva Singh, page 82&lt;/ref&gt;
* the world as seen from the perspective of the liberated being - "''the world no longer appears as mere earth, but as clothed in celestial light''".&lt;ref&gt;The Doctrine of Recognition: A Translation of {{IAST|Pratyabhijñahṛdayam, Kṣemarāja}}, Jaideva Singh, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramakrishna===
A mystical experience of [[Ramakrishna]], representing a turning point for him :
* "''Everything vanished, as if there was nothing anywhere! And what was that I saw? A boundless, endless, conscious ocean of light;...; brilliant rows of waves were roaring towards me''" &lt;ref&gt;Kālī's Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna, Jeffrey John Kripal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogananda===
A few accounts of encounters with the uncreated light, by [[Yogananda]] :
* "''I saw a blinding light, enveloping my body and the entire room''"&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda, {{ISBN|81-902562-0-3}}, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''a fluid piercing light streaming from every pore;...; my sense of identity was no longer confined to a body but embraced the circumambient atoms''"&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda, {{ISBN|81-902562-0-3}}, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''I gazed at my arms and moved them back and forth, yet could not feel their weight; ecstatic joy overwhelmed me... the illusion of a solid body was completely dissipated, as my realization deepened that the essence of all things is light''"&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda, {{ISBN|81-902562-0-3}}, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{IAST|Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa}}===
''{{IAST|Stavacintāmaṇi}}'' by ''{{IAST|Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa}}'' is an intensely devotional text of Kashmir Shaivism. Here are some quotes referring to the light of consciousness :
* Parameśvara ... "''blindingly shining in eternity''"&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Stavacintāmaṇi, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa}}, sūtra 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Śañkara ... "''infinite light who's essence is the pure ambrosia''"&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Stavacintāmaṇi, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa}}, sūtra 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Śiva ... "''you are the white-shining essence, origin of every intention, unchanged in each reincarnation''"&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Stavacintāmaṇi, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa}}, sūtra 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhinavagupta===
A few selective quotes from [[Tantraloka]] of [[Abhinavagupta]]:
* "''By the means of the splendid light that shines in the immaculate heart, one obtains union with Śiva''"&lt;ref&gt;Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, sūtra 1.212&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''The yogi who has had the experience of the great light enters into the condition of being of the nature of Śiva''"&lt;ref&gt;Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, sūtra 5.86-90a&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''The consciousness is formed of light and beatitude''"&lt;ref&gt;Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, sūtra 6.78b-83a&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5356">'''Quinzio Bongiovanni''' (or '''Quinto Buongiovanni''') ([[Tropea]] c.1550 - [[Naples]] 5 June 1612) was an Italian doctor and scholar, active in the disputes between traditional [[scholasticism]] and the [[natural philosophy]] of [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Giambattista della Porta]] and members of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cassiodoro.unicz.it/web/?page_id=746 accessed 23/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background and career==
Quinzio Bongiovanni was the son of Giovan Nicola, a doctor, and Lamberta Fazzari. The family had probably originally come from [[Maida, Calabria|Maida]], which it left to escape the feudal domination of the [[House of Caracciolo]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldrysinstitute.com/cognomi/Buongiovanni/Italia/idc/659 accessed 24/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt; and moved into the Palazzo Bongiovanni, home to the Vianeo brothers, pioneering surgeons, who were also from Maida. Quinzio finished his studies in medicine and philosophy under [[Giovan Bernardino Longo]] and [[Giovan Girolamo Polverino]] in [[Naples]].  In 1571 he published the work for which he is principally remembered, ''Peripateticarum disputationum de principiis naturae'' (Venice 1571), dedicated to [[Cardinal Carafa]].&lt;ref&gt;Vito Capialbi, Memorie per Servire alla Storia della Santa Chiesa Tropeana, Nicola Porcelli, 1832 p.xlviii&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a member Accademia degli Affaticati ('Academy of the Weary') in his home town of Tropea.&lt;ref&gt;https://premiotropea.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/appunti-sullaccademia-degli-affaticati-di-tropea-cosera/ accessed 24/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time before 1583 he was appointed Protomedico (Chief Physician) to the King ([[Philip II of Spain]]), a position which required him to licence and regulate all healers, surgeons, midwives and alchemists in the kingdom. He insisted that [[apothecary|apothecaries]] be prevented from preparing herbal remedies before being properly inspected, otherwise 'they make the compositions up in their own way, without fear of God or justice, and to the detriment of human bodies, which for this reason are daily made to suffer.'&lt;ref&gt;David Gentilcore, Healers and Healing in Early Modern Italy, Manchester University Press, 1998 pp.29, 41&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently also worked for a time for the Prince of [[Bisignano]].&lt;ref&gt;Vito Capialbi, Memorie per Servire alla Storia della Santa Chiesa Tropeana, Nicola Porcelli, 1832 p.xlviii&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Naples in 1588 and was appointed Reader in Philosophy and Medicine at the university. He later became Professor of Medicine, and [[Archiater]] to Popes [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] and [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]]. Among his most distinguished pupils were [[Marco Aurelio Severino]] and [[Giovanni Battista Cavallari]].&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/obiettivosaviano/docs/aprile_2014_inserto_su_giambattista accessed 23/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1608 the German medic Giovanni Custode reported to his colleague [[Giovanni Faber]] the opinion of Bongiovanni that in Rome 'doctors are princes, but in Naples they are paupers, poorly-considered and working very hard to earn anything.'&lt;ref&gt;http://books.openedition.org/efr/1937?lang=it accessed 23/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions on natural philosophy==
One story about Buongiovanni suggests that he was firmly in the Aristotelian camp in the discussions about nature, sensation, and the order of the universe.  In 1571 Telesio was debating with his student [[Antonio Persio]] the nature of light, and whether or not the sun was hot. Buongiovanni joined the discussion, arguing it could not be hot, because it was beyond the moon and therefore, in traditional Aristotelian cosmology, beyond the realm of the senses; Telesio argued that the sun's rays both illuminate and heat the earth. When the argument could not be resolved, Telesio took him out into the street in the midday sun and stood with him.  'Can't you feel it?' he asked, but Buongiovanni refused to accept this evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Gianna Pomata, Historia: Empiricism and Erudition in Early Modern Europe, MIT Press, 2005 pp.190-191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Bongiovanni died in Naples on 5 June 1612, bequeathing part of his estate to the two sons of his brother Flaminio, Giovancola and Quinzio (junior). He also left provision for the Jesuit Colleges in Naples, [[Massa Lubrense]] and Tropea; 500 [[scudi]] for the education of twelve poor boys of his home town with the Jesuits; 500 scudi to provide dowries for widows and orphans of the same town to marry; and 500 scudi for the rector of the Jesuit College in Naples to clothe and equip impoverished scholars from out of town.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Capialbi, Memorie per Servire alla Storia della Santa Chiesa Tropeana, Nicola Porcelli, 1832 p.xlviii&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramón Xirau Subías''' ({{IPA-es|raˈmon ʃiˈɾau|lang}}, {{IPA-ca|rəˈmoɲ ʃiˈɾaw|lang}}; [[Barcelona]], Spain, 20 January 1924 – Mexico City, 26 July 2017) was a Spanish-born Mexican poet, philosopher and literary critic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uoc.edu/lletra/noms/rxirau/index.html Ramón Xirau at lletrA (UOC)] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1939, as the [[Spanish civil war]] was coming to an end, Xirau emigrated to Mexico where he obtained Mexican citizenship in 1955. He obtained a [[Master's Degree]] in [[philosophy]] at the [[UNAM]] and an [[honorary degree|honorary]] doctorate from the [[Universidad de las Américas, A.C.|Universidad de las Américas]]. He was a research faculty member of the UNAM y and the National System of Researchers. At the UNAM he taught at the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature and did research at the Institute of Philosophy Research. He was a member of the [[Colegio Nacional (Mexico)|Colegio Nacional]] since 1973. 

Xirau received the [[Legion of Honour]] from France and the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic|Isabel la Católica]] from Spain awards as well as the [[Creu de Sant Jordi]] from the Generalitat of [[Catalonia]] for his works in essay and academics in Spanish and Catalan literature. He also received the Elías Sourasky and the Premio Universidad Nacional awards at the UNAM. Professor Xirau is mostly known in the English speaking world as the co-author of ''The Nature of Man'' along with [[Erich Fromm]] (Macmillan 1968, {{ISBN|0-02-084960-5}}).

'''Ratnakīrti''' (11th century CE) was a Buddhist philosopher of the [[Yogacara]] and epistemological schools (''pramanavada'') who wrote on logic, [[philosophy of mind]] and [[epistemology]]. Ratnakīrti studied at [[Vikramashila]] university under [[Jñanasrimitra]] (975–1025).&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, A. C. Senape; An Eleventh-Century Buddhist Logic of ‘Exists’&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}}

Ratnakīrti's 'Refutation of Other mindstreams' (''Saṃtãnãntaradusana''), argued that knowledge of external streams of consciousness ([[Mindstream|citta-santāna]]) is a form of inference (anumāna), not a direct perception (pratyakṣa). Ratnakīrti introduced the [[two truths]] doctrine as key to the nature of the discussion. Since inference deals with conceptual universals, the proof of the mindstreams of others, whilst empirically valid in relative truth (saṃvṛtisatya), does not hold ultimate metaphysical certainty in absolute truth (paramārthasatya). Ratnakīrti therefore argued for the ultimate truth of "one mind" (ekacitta). By establishing the impossibility of external mindstreams, Ratnakīrti was also arguing for the [[non-dualism]] of [[Yogacara]] "consciousness-only".&lt;ref&gt;Chakrabarti, Arindam; Weber, Ralph; [https://books.google.com/books?id=lfiiCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Ratnak%C4%ABrti&amp;f=false Comparative Philosophy without Borders]. New York: Bloomsbury Academic, 2015. pp 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Ratnakīrti argued that from an ultimate point of view, the distinctions between a subject and object, the observer and the observed, all disappear. Ratnakīrti's theory states then, that there is no logical foundation for individuating mindstreams, and that there are no boundaries between minds from the perspective of ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;Jonardon Ganeri, The Concealed Art of the Soul, Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This sub school of [[Yogacara]] Cittamatra (mind only) has been called the ''Citradvaitavada'' school (non-dual mind) or ''Vijñanadvaitavada'' school (non-dual consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Thomas E. Mind Only: A Philosophical and Doctrinal Analysis of the Vijñānavāda, University of Hawaii Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}}

Ratnakīrti's "Refutation of Arguments Establishing Īśvara" (Īśvara-sādhana-dūṣaṇa) argued against the Hindu concept of a [[creator God]].&lt;ref&gt;Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India. New York: Columbia University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-231-14222-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2016}}

Ratnakīrti also wrote the "Proof of Momentariness" (''Kṣānabhaṅgasiddhi''), where he defended the theory of momentariness, the view that dharmas last only for a moment.

'''Restoration ecology''' is the scientific study supporting the practice of '''ecological restoration''', which is the practice of renewing and restoring [[environmental degradation|degraded]], damaged, or destroyed [[ecosystem]]s and [[habitat]]s in the [[Natural environment|environment]] by active human intervention and action.

==Definition==

Restoration ecology is the academic study of the process, whereas ecological restoration is the actual project or process by restoration practitioners. The Society for Ecological Restoration defines "ecological restoration" as an "intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Society for Ecological Restoration International Science &amp; Policy Working Group|first=|date=2004|title=The SER International Primer on Ecological Restoration|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ser.org/resource/resmgr/custompages/publications/ser_publications/ser_primer.pdf|journal=www.ser.org &amp; Tucson: Society for Ecological Restoration International|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological restoration includes a wide scope of projects including [[erosion]] control, [[reforestation]], removal of [[non-native species]] and weeds, [[revegetation]] of disturbed areas, [[daylighting (streams)|daylighting streams]], reintroduction of [[native species]] (preferably native species that have [[local adaptation]]), and habitat and range improvement for targeted species.

[[E. O. Wilson]], a biologist, states, "Here is the means to end the great extinction spasm. The next century will, I believe, be the era of restoration in ecology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/691398594|title=The diversity of life|last=O.|first=Wilson, Edward|date=2010, ©1992|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674058170|edition=  1st Harvard University Press paperback |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=691398594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of restoration ecology==
'''Restoration ecology''' emerged as a separate field in [[ecology]] in the late twentieth century. "Restoration ecology" was not first formally identified as a distinct scientific field until the late twentieth century. The term was coined by [[John Aber]] and [[Bill Jordan (environmental critic)|William Jordan III]] when they were at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref name="jordan2011"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/750183084|title=Making nature whole : a history of ecological restoration|last=Jordan, III|first=W. R.|date=2011|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781610910422|location=Washington, DC|oclc=750183084}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[indigenous peoples]], land managers, stewards, and laypeople have been practicing ecological restoration or ecological management for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="anderson2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56103978|title=Tending the wild: Native American knowledge and the management of California's natural resources|last=Anderson|first=K.|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520238567|location=Berkeley|oclc=56103978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the birthplace of modern ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum]].&lt;ref name="court2012"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/814694131|title=Pioneers of ecological restoration : the people and legacy of the University of Wisconsin Arboretum|last=Court|first=F. E.|date=2012|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299286630|location=Madison|oclc=814694131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jordan2011"/&gt; [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] workers replanted nearby prairie species onto a former horse pasture, overseen by university faculty including renowned ecologist [[Aldo Leopold]], botanist [[Theodore Sperry]], mycologist [[Henry C. Greene]], and plant ecologist [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]]. Curtis and his graduate students surveyed the whole of Wisconsin, documenting native species communities and creating the first species lists for tallgrass restorations.&lt;ref name="curtis1971"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811410421|title=The vegetation of Wisconsin : an ordination of plant communities|last=Curtis|first=J. T.|date=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299019433|location=Madison|oclc=811410421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing prairie remnants, such as locations within pioneer [[cemeteries]] and railroad rights-of-way, were located and inventoried by Curtis and his team. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]], and pioneering techniques like [[Controlled burn|prescribed burning]].&lt;ref name="court2012"/&gt;

The latter-half of the 20th century saw the growth of ecological restoration beyond Wisconsin borders. The 285-hectare Green Oaks Biological Field Station at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologist Paul Shepard. It was followed by the 40-hectare Schulenberg Prairie at the [[Morton Arboretum]], started in 1962 by Ray Schulenberg and Bob Betz. Betz then worked with [[The Nature Conservancy]] to establish the 260-hectare [[Fermilab|Fermi National Laboratory]] tallgrass prairie in 1974.&lt;ref name="fermi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fermilab History &amp; Archives Project: Natural History - Prairie |url=https://history.fnal.gov/prairie.html |website=fnal.gov |publisher=Fermilab |accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These major tallgrass restoration projects marked the growth of ecological restoration from isolated studies to widespread practice.

Australia has also been the site of historically significant ecological restoration projects. In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 [[Albert Morris]] and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the ''Broken Hill regeneration area''.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, William R. &amp; Lubick, George M.

== Theoretical foundations of restoration ecology ==

Restoration ecology draws on a wide range of ecological concepts.

=== Disturbance ===

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] is a change in environmental conditions that disrupts the functioning of an ecosystem. Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173134455|title=Assembly rules and restoration ecology : bridging the gap between theory and practice|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Island Press|others=Temperton, Vicky M.|year=|isbn=9781429495134|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Chapter 17: Disturbance, Succession, and Community Assembly in Terrestrial Plant Communities|oclc=173134455}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement [[fire ecology|fire as a natural disturbance regime]]. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are  to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on the ecosystems.

=== Succession ===

[[Ecological succession]] is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with  a few dominant [[pioneer species]] to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21376331|title=Directing ecological succession|last=1955-|first=Luken, James O.,|date=1990|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=0412344505|edition= 1st |location=London|oclc=21376331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following mild to moderate natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (i.e. physical or chemical alteration of the environment), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes.

=== Fragmentation ===

[[Habitat fragmentation]] describes spatial discontinuities in a biological system, where ecosystems are broken up into smaller parts through land use changes (e.g. [[agriculture]]) and natural disturbance. This both reduces the size of the populations and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases quality of the habitat. The [[Edge effects|edge of a fragment]] has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating [[wildlife corridor|habitat corridor]]s that link isolated fragments. Reversing the effects of fragmentation is an important component of restoration ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Targeted habitat restoration can reduced extinction rates in fragrmented forests|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9635.abstract|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem function ===
Ecosystem function describes the most basic and essential foundational processes of any natural systems, including [[nutrient cycle]]s and [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flux]]es. An understanding of the complexity of these ecosystem functions is necessary to address any ecological processes that may be degraded. Ecosystem functions are [[emergent properties]] of the [[Systems theory|system as a whole]], thus monitoring and [[Natural resource management|management]] are crucial for the long-term stability of ecosystems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}A fully functional ecosystem that is completely self-perpetuating is the ultimate goal of restorative efforts.

=== Community assembly ===

Community assembly "is a framework that can unify virtually all of (community) ecology under a single conceptual umbrella".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894509632|title=Urban ecology : an introduction|last=1936-|first=Douglas, Ian,|others=James, Philip (Professor of ecology),|isbn=9781136266966|location=New York, NY|oclc=894509632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community assembly theory attempts to explain the existence of environmentally similar sites with differing assemblages of species. It assumes that species have similar [[ecological niche|niche]] requirements, so that community formation is a product of random fluctuations from a common [[species pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P.|last2=Chase|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Huddleston|first3=Russell T.|date=2001|title=Community Succession and Assembly: Comparing, Contrasting and Combining Paradigms in the Context of Ecological Restoration|jstor=43440887|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if all species are fairly ecologically equivalent, then random variation in colonization, and migration and extinction rates between species, drive differences in species composition between sites with comparable environmental conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Population genetics ===
Genetic diversity has shown to be as important as species diversity for restoring ecosystem processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=A. Randall|last2=Inouye|first2=Brian D.|last3=Johnson|first3=Marc T.

== Applications of restoration ecology ==

=== Soil heterogeneity effects on community heterogeneity ===

Spatial heterogeneity of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity, and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated [[soil]] resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass [[prairie restoration]] project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which on its own was insufficient to insure [[species diversity]] in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings were consistent with the theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, [[adaptation|best adapted]] to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baer|first=Sara G.|last2=Collins|first2=Scott L|last3=Blair|first3=John M.|last4=Knapp|first4=Alan K.|last5=Fiedler|first5=Anna K.|date=2005-06|title=Soil Heterogeneity Effects on Tallgrass Prairie Community Heterogeneity: An Application of Ecological Theory to Restoration Ecology|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00051.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=413–424|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2005.00051.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invasion and restoration ===

Restoration is used as a tool for reducing the spread of invasive plant species in a number of ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread.  As this approach emphasizes control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epanchin-Niell|first=Rebecca|last2=Englin|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Nalle|first3=Darek|date=November 2009|title=Investing in rangeland restoration in the Arid West, USA: Countering the effects of an invasive weed on the long-term fire cycle|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709003004|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=91|issue=2|pages=370–379|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Török|first=Péter|last2=Miglécz|first2=Tamás|last3=Valkó|first3=Orsolya|last4=Kelemen|first4=András|last5=Deák|first5=Balázs|last6=Lengyel|first6=Szabolcs|last7=Tóthmérész|first7=Béla|date=January 2012|title=Recovery of native grass biodiversity by sowing on former croplands: Is weed suppression a feasible goal for grassland restoration?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161713811100046X|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|volume=20|issue=1|pages=41–48|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2011.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|title=Selecting Plant Species for Ecological Restoration: a Perspective for Land Managers|last=Brown|first=Ray|last2=Amacher|first2=Michael|date=1999|website=USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505022949/https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Rob G.|last2=Orloff|first2=Steve B.|last3=Lancaster|first3=Donald L.|last4=Kirby|first4=Donald W.|last5=Carlson|first5=Harry L.|date=2010|title=Integrating Herbicide Use and Perennial Grass Revegetation to Suppress Weeds in Noncrop Areas|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/invasive-plant-science-and-management/article/integrating-herbicide-use-and-perennial-grass-revegetation-to-suppress-weeds-in-noncrop-areas/31659B7952971D35546D9EE56DE9DC5B|journal=Invasive Plant Science and Management|volume=3|issue=1|pages=81–92|doi=10.1614/ipsm-09-008.1|issn=1939-7291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not always actively managed following seeding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kettenring|first=Karin M.|last2=Adams|first2=Carrie Reinhardt|date=2011-08-01|title=Lessons learned from invasive plant control experiments: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=48|issue=4|pages=970–979|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a sustainable solution long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dana|first=Blumenthal,|last2=Nicholas|first2=Jordan,|last3=Elizabeth|first3=Svenson,|date=2003-03-06|title=Weed Control as a Rationale for Restoration: The Example of Tallgrass Prairie|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol7/iss1/art6/|journal=Conservation Ecology|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.5751/ES-00480-070106|issn=1195-5449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Dana M.|last2=Jordan|first2=Nicholas R.|last3=Svenson|first3=Elizabeth L.|date=2005-05-20|title=Effects of prairie restoration on weed invasions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904003603|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=107|issue=2–3|pages=221–230|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2004.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Successional trajectories ===

Progress along a desired successional pathway may be difficult if multiple stable states exist. Looking over 40 years of wetland restoration data, Klötzli and Gootjans (2001) argue that unexpected and undesired vegetation assemblies "may indicate that environmental conditions are not suitable for target communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotzli|first=Frank|last2=Grootjans|first2=Ab P.|date=2001-06|title=Restoration of Natural and Semi-Natural Wetland Systems in Central Europe: Progress and Predictability of Developments|url=https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=209–219|doi=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succession may move in unpredicted directions, but constricting environmental conditions within a narrow range may rein in the possible successional trajectories and increase the likelihood of a desired outcome.

=== Sourcing material for restoration ===
For most restoration projects it is generally recommend to source material from local populations, to increase chance of restoration success and minimize the effects of [[maladaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breed|first=Martin F.|last2=Stead|first2=Michael G.|last3=Ottewell|first3=Kym M.|last4=Gardner|first4=Michael G.|last5=Lowe|first5=Andrew J.|date=2013-02-01|title=Which provenance and where?

==Principles of ecological restoration==
[[File:Regenerated habitat for superb parrot on the abandoned Boroowa railway line.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Ecosystem restoration for the [[superb parrot]] on an abandoned railway line in Australia]]

===Rationale===
There are many reasons to restore ecosystems.  Some include:

*Restoring [[natural capital]] such as drinkable water or wildlife populations 
*Mitigating [[climate change]] (e.g. through [[carbon sequestration]])
*Helping threatened or [[endangered species]]&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., &amp; Lucas, M. C. (2017). Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages? A test with lampreys. Ecological engineering, 102, 291-302&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aesthetic reasons &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris JA, Hobbs RJ, Higgs ES, and Aronson JA.|first=|year=2006|title=Ecological restoration and climate change|url=|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=14|pages=170–76.|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00136.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moral reasons: Human intervention has unnaturally destroyed many habitats, and there exists an innate obligation to restore these destroyed habitats

[[File:Restoration in action at Buffelsdraai.jpg|250px|right|thumb|alt=Buffelsdraai Community Reforestation Project.|Forest restoration in action at the [[Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project]] in South Africa]]

There exist considerable differences of opinion in how to set restoration goals and how to define their success among conservation groups. Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]]. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, "ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium…. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target."

Some conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable than its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987).  One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. [[Afforestation]] involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. [[Carbon dioxide]] is a leading cause of [[global warming]] (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/compensatory-mitigation-methods|title=Compensatory Mitigation Methods|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological restoration challenges ==
Some view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals.  Hilderbrand et al. point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for 'complete' restoration are unreasonably short, while other critical markers for full-scale restoration are either ignored or abridged due to feasibility concerns.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hilderbrand, R. H., A. C. Watts, and A. M. Randle 2005. The myths of restoration ecology. Ecology and Society 10(1): 19. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol10/iss1/art19/&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances an ecosystem may be so degraded that abandonment (allowing a severely degraded ecosystem to recover on its own) may be the wisest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HOLL|first=KAREN D.|last2=HAYES|first2=GREY F.|date=2006-02-27|title=Challenges to Introducing and Managing Disturbance Regimes for Holocarpha macradenia, an Endangered Annual Grassland Forb|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1121–1131|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local communities sometimes object to restorations that include the introduction of large predators or plants that require [[disturbance regimes]] such as regular fires, citing threat to human habitation in the area.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=David|date=2002|title=The ecological context: a species population perspective|url=|journal=Handbook of ecological restoration|volume=1|pages=47–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High economic costs can also be perceived as a negative impact of the restoration process.

Public opinion is very important in the feasibility of a restoration; if the public believes that the costs of restoration outweigh the benefits they will not support it.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Many failures have occurred in past restoration projects, many times because clear goals were not set out as the aim of the restoration, or an incomplete understanding of the underlying ecological framework lead to insufficient measures. This may be because, as Peter Alpert says, "people may not [always] know how to manage natural systems effectively".&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, P. 2002. Managing the wild: should stewards be pilots? Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 9(2): 494-499.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many assumptions are made about myths of restoration such as [[carbon copy]], where a restoration plan, which worked in one area, is applied to another with the same results expected, but not realized.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Science-practice gap ===
One of the struggles for both fields is a divide between restoration ecology and ecological restoration in practice. Currently, many restoration practitioners as well as scientists feel that science is not being adequately incorporated into ecological restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickens|first=Sara Jo M.|last2=Suding|first2=Katharine N.|date=2013-06-01|title=Spanning the Science-Practice Divide: Why Restoration Scientists Need to be More Involved with Practice|url=http://er.uwpress.org/content/31/2/134|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=31|issue=2|pages=134–140|doi=10.3368/er.31.2.134|issn=1522-4740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|last2=Clewell|first2=Andre|last3=Ingram|first3=Mrill|last4=McDonald|first4=Tein|last5=Temperton|first5=Vicky|date=2010-11-01|title=Bridging Restoration Science and Practice: Results and Analysis of a Survey from the 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International Meeting|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00743.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=18|issue=6|pages=783–788|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2010.00743.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Erica|last2=Dixon|first2=Kingsley W.|last3=Menz|first3=Myles H.

There are a variety of theories about the cause of this gap. However, it has been well established that one of the main issues is that the questions studied by restoration ecologists are frequently not found useful or easily applicable by land managers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|date=2007-03-01|title=Science-Driven Restoration: A Square Grid on a Round Earth?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00183.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00183.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many publications in restoration ecology characterize the scope of a problem in depth, without providing concrete solutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally many restoration ecology studies are carried out under controlled conditions and frequently at scales much smaller than actual restorations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Whether or not these patterns hold true in an applied context is often unknown.

There is further complication in that restoration ecologists who want to collect large-scale data on restoration projects can face enormous hurdles in obtaining the data. Managers vary in how much data they collect, and how many records they keep. Some agencies keep only a handful of physical copies of data that make it difficult for the researcher to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernhardt|first=Emily S.|last2=Sudduth|first2=Elizabeth B.|last3=Palmer|first3=Margaret A.|last4=Allan|first4=J.

== Contrasting restoration ecology and conservation biology ==

Restoration ecology may be viewed as a sub-discipline of [[conservation biology]], the scientific study of how to protect and restore biodiversity. Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting [[conservation movement]].

Both restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, [[conservation biology]] is primarily rooted in [[population biology]]. Because of that, it is generally organized at the [[Population genetics|population genetic]] level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. [[endangered species]]). Restoration ecology is organized at the [[Community (ecology)|community]] level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P|date=2000-01|title=Restoration ecology and conservation biology|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320799000579|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=92|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00057-9|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, conservation biology often concentrates on [[vertebrate]] animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on [[plant]]s. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have "poster species" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, the [[Monarch butterfly]] is a poster species for conserving and restoring [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on [[soil]]s, [[soil structure]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[microorganism]]s because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Craig D|date=2002|title=Ecological restoration of southwestern Ponderosa pine ecosystems: A broad perspective|url=|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1418–1433|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1418:EROSPP]2.0.CO;2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=J.

==Natural Capital Committee's recommendation for a 25-year plan==
The UK [[Natural Capital Committee]] (NCC) made a recommendation in its second State of Natural Capital report published in March 2014 that in order to meet the Government's goal of being the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it was inherited, a long-term 25-year plan was needed to maintain and improve England's natural capital.  The UK Government has not yet responded to this recommendation.

The Secretary of State for the UK's [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Owen Paterson]], described his ambition for the natural environment and how the work of the Committee fits into this at an NCC event in November 2012:  "I do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. I want us to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC's innovative work is geared towards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/owen-paterson-s-speech-to-royal-society-on-natural-capital-committee|title=Owen Paterson’s speech to Royal Society on Natural Capital Committee|last=Paterson|first=Owen|date=27 November 2012|work=gov.uk|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16713">'''Righteousness''' is defined as "the quality of being morally correct and justifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/righteousness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be considered synonymous with "rightness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rightness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[concept]] that can be found in Dharmic traditions and Abrahamic traditions as a theological concept. For example, from various perspectives in [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Judaism]] it is considered an [[Property_(philosophy)|attribute]] that implies that a person's actions are justified, and can have the connotation that the person has been "judged" or "reckoned" as leading a life that is pleasing to God.. It is also found in [[Tamil language|tamil literature]]  in the name of அறம்(aram).Tamil Custom known for it's righteousness.In Tamil literature there is separate section called [[அற நூல்கள்]] righteous books for example [[thirukkural]] [[Nālaṭiyār|nalatiyar]] and many more books.[[tirukkural]] dedicated 1-38 chapters [[Book of Virtues|Book of aram]] for righteousness.A poem in [[purananuru]] written by [[Kaniyan Pungundranar|kaniyanpoongundranar]] it showcases the practice of righteousness leads to [[World peace|worldpeace]] and harmony in society.

[[William Tyndale]] ([[Tyndale Bible|Bible translator]] into English in 1526) remodelled the word after an earlier word ''rihtwis'', which would have yielded [[modern English]] *''rightwise'' or *''rightways''. He used it to translate the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root צדקים (''TzDYQ''), ''[[Tzadik|tzedek]]'', which appears over five hundred times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|δίκαιος}} (''dikaios''), which appears more than two hundred times in the [[New Testament]].

==Philosophy, history, linguistics, meanings, and translation==
In the word "righteousness," the suffix "-ness" modifies the adjective "righteous," which is "right" modified by "-ous." Righteousness is a [[phenomenon]] or state or condition of: resembling or displaying the nature of moral, good, correct, true, factual, excellent, just, virtuous, natural, morally upright, correct for situations, balanced, and honorable being or being in such a state. 

Origin
Old English rihtwīs, from riht ‘right’ + wīs ‘manner, state, condition’ (as opposed to ''wrangwise'', "wrongful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=78|year=1855|issue=6|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The change in the ending in the 16th century was due to association with words such as bounteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/righteous|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics or moral philosophy==
Ethics is a major branch of philosophy, encompasses right conduct and good living.
" Rushworth Kidder states that "standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character' or 'the science of moral duty'".[3] Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define ethics as "a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behavior helps or harms sentient creatures".[4] The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the word [[Ethics#Defining_ethics|ethics]] is "commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' ... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual."

==Connections of concepts in world history==
Righteousness is one of the chief [[Attributes of God in Christianity|Attributes of]] [[God]] as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible.
"[[Eusebeia]]" enters the New Testament in later writings, where it is typically translated as "godliness," a vague translation that reflects uncertainty about its relevant meaning in the New Testament. In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker,[34] on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In common parlance, dharma means ‘''right'' way of living’, 'laws of nature' and ‘path of ''rightness''’.

"The word εὐσέβεια as it is used in the Greek New Testament carries the meaning of "godliness", and is distinct from θρησκεία (thrēskeia), "religion". Eusebeia relates to real, true, vital, and spiritual relation with God, while thrēskeia relates to the outward acts of religious observances or ceremonies, which can be performed by the flesh. The English word "religion" was never used in the sense of true godliness. It always meant the outward forms of worship. In 1Ti 3:16, the Mystery, or secret connected with true Christianity as distinct from religion, it is the Genitive of relation. (This specific meaning occurs only in Act 3:12.)] This word arises in the Greek New Testament in 1 Tim 2:2, 1 Tim 3:16, 1 Tim 4:7, 1 Tim 4:8, 1 Tim 6:3, 1 Tim 6:5, 1 Tim 6:6, 1 Tim 6:11, 2 Tim 3:5, Tit 1:1, 2 Pt 1:3, 2 Pt 1:6, 2 Pt 1:7, 2 Pt 3:11.[7]"

==Yi (Confucianism)==
{{main article|Yi (Confucianism)}}
[[Yi (Confucianism)|Yi]], (Chinese: 義; simplified Chinese: 义; traditional Chinese: 義; pinyin: yì; Jyutping: Ji6; Zhuyin Fuhao: ㄧˋ), literally "justice, righteousness; meaning," is an important concept in Confucianism. It involves a moral disposition to do good, and also the intuition and sensibility to do so competently. Yi resonates with Confucian philosophy's orientation towards the cultivation of benevolence (ren) and skillful practice (li). Yi represents moral acumen which goes beyond simple rule following, and involves a balanced understanding of a situation, and the "creative insights" necessary to apply virtues "with no loss of sight of the total good. Yi represents this ideal of totality as well as a decision-generating ability to apply a virtue properly and appropriately in a situation." 

  In application, yi is a "complex principle" which includes:
    skill in crafting actions which have moral fitness according to a given concrete situation
    the wise recognition of such fitness
    the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from that recognition.

==Dharmic traditions==

Dharma is a key concept with multiple meanings. There might not be a [[Untranslatability|single-word translation]] for dharma in Western languages. ''Dharma'' धर्म  can be translated as righteousness, religion, faith, duty, law, and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#en/hi/righteousness|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of dharma include rightness, good, natural, morality, righteousness, and virtue. It means moral, right, just, balanced, or natural etc. In common parlance, dharma means ‘''right'' way of living’ and ‘path of ''rightness''’. Dharma encompasses ideas such as duty, rights, character, vocation, religion, customs and all behaviour considered appropriate, correct or ''morally upright''. It is explained as law of righteousness and equated to satya (truth, Sanskrit: satya सत्यं). "...when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks the Dharma"; and if he speaks Dharma, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one." — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 1.4.xiv

Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4: TEXT 7
   "yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata
   abhyutthanam adharmasya tadatmanam srjamy aham" 

"Whenever there is decay of righteousness, O Bharata, 
And there is exaltation of unrighteousness, then I Myself come forth"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asitis.com/4/7.html|title=Bhagavad Gita As It Is, 4.7: Transcendental Knowledge, Text 7.|website=asitis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2014/05/bhagavad-gita-chapter-4-verse-7-8.html|title=Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4, Verse 7-8: Yada Yada Hi Dharmasya|website=www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in righteousness/religious practice, Oh descendant of Bharata, and a rise of evil/irreligion— Then at that time I manifest Myself.

In Hindu philosophy and/or religion, major emphasis is placed on individual practical morality. In the Sanskrit epics, this concern is omnipresent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew27136.htm|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Including duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ‘‘right way of living’. The Sanskrit epics contain themes and examples where right prevails over wrong, the good over evil. 

In mid 20th century, an inscription of the Indian Emperor Asoka from the year 258 BC was discovered. This rock inscription contained Sanskrit, Aramaic and Greek text. According to Paul Hacker, on the rock appears a Greek rendering for the Sanskrit word dharma: the word eusebeia. In his 250 BCE Edicts used the word "[[eusebeia]]" as a Greek translation for the central Buddhist and Hindu concept of "dharma". This rock inscription, concludes Paul Hacker,[34] suggests dharma in India, about 2300 years ago, was a central concept and meant not only religious ideas, but ideas of ''right,'' of ''good'', of one’s duty.

For Sikhs, the word Dharm means the path of ''righteousness'' and proper religious practice.

The major Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra mentions Das-dharma with the meaning of "ten righteous virtues".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=wikipedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Attributes of God}}
{{main|Tzadik}}
Righteousness is one of the chief [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attributes]] of [[God]] as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible. Its chief meaning concerns [[ethics|ethical]] conduct (for example, [[Leviticus]] 19:36; [[Deuteronomy]] 25:1; [[Psalm]] 1:6; [[Proverb]]s 8:20). In the [[Book of Job]] the title character is introduced to us as a person who is perfect in righteousness.

==Christianity==
{{see also|Sola fide|Christian views on the Old Covenant}}

The New Testament continues the Hebrew Bible's tradition of the ethical ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|2:10}}) and legal ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|4:4}}) aspects of righteousness. [[William Lane Craig]] argues that we should think of God as the paradigm, the locus, the source of all righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 19)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-19|publisher=Reasonable Faith|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew's gospel contains the most utterances of the word. In Matthew's account of the baptism encounter Jesus tells the prophet "it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness" as Jesus requests that John perform the rite for him. The Sermon of the Mount contains the memorable commandment "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness". The Greek word ''dikaiosune'' also means justice&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert. (May 2011) Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible. p. 819. {{ISBN|978-1-56563-810-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sole translation using this rendering for [[Matthew 6:33]] is the [[New English Bible]].

Jesus asserts the importance of righteousness by saying in Matthew 5:20, "For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." Jesus also re-affirms the [[Law of Moses|Laws of Moses]] by saying in Matthew 5:19, "Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

However, [[Paul the Apostle]] speaks of [[dual-covenant theology|two ways]], at least in theory, to achieve righteousness: through the [[Law of Moses]] (or [[Torah]]); and through [[faith]] in the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] made possible through the death and [[resurrection]] of Jesus Christ ({{bibleverse||Romans|10:3-13}}). Some interpret that he repeatedly emphasizes that faith is the only effective way. Reference ({{bibleverse||Romans|4:5}}). ({{bibleverse||Romans|3:21-24}}). For example, just a few verses earlier, he states the Jews did not attain the law of righteousness because they sought it not by faith, but by works ({{bibleverse||Romans|9:30-33}}). The New Testament speaks of a salvation founded on God's righteousness, as exemplified throughout the history of salvation narrated in the [[Old Testament]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|9-11}}).
Paul writes to the Romans that righteousness comes by faith: "...a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'" ({{bibleverse||Romans|1:17}})

In [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209&amp;version=NRSV II Cor. 9:9] the New Revised Standard Version has a footnote that the original word has the meaning of 'benevolence' and the Messianic Jewish commentary of David Stern affirms the Jewish practice of 'doing ''tzedakah''' as charity in referring to the Matt. 6 and II Cor. 9 passages.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, David H. (1992) Jewish New Testament Commentary: A companion volume to the 'Jewish New Testament'. p. 30 and p. 512. {{ISBN|965-359-008-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{bibleverse||James|2:14-26}} speaks of the relationship between works of righteousness and faith, saying that "faith without works is dead." Righteous acts according to James include [[Good works|works of charity]] ({{bibleverse||James|2:15-16}}) as well as avoiding [[Christian views on sin|sins]] against the Law of Moses ({{bibleverse||James|2:11-12}}).

{{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7-8}} describes [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] as a righteous man.

===Type of saint===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], "Righteous" is a [[List of Eastern Orthodox saint titles|type of saint]] who is regarded as a holy person under the [[Old Covenant]] (Old Testament Israel) but also sometimes used for married saints of the [[New Covenant]] (the Church). According to [[Orthodox theology]], the Righteous saints of the Old Covenant were not able to enter into heaven until after the [[death of Jesus]] on the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]] ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|11:40|KJV}}), but had to await salvation in the [[Bosom of Abraham]] (see: [[Harrowing of Hell]]).

==Islam==
Righteousness is mentioned several times in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wefound.org/texts/Islam_files/IslamRighteousness.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an says that a life of righteousness is the only way to go to Heaven.
{{quote|We will give the home of the Hereafter to those who do not want arrogance or mischief on earth; and the end is best for the righteous.| Qur’an Sura 28: Verse 83}}

{{quote|O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).| Qur'an Surah 49: Verse 13}}

{{quote|Righteousness is not that you turn your faces to the east and the west [in prayer].  But righteous is the one who believes in God, the Last Day, the Angels, the Scripture and the Prophets; who gives his wealth in spite of love for it to kinsfolk, orphans, the poor, the wayfarer, to those who ask and to set slaves free.  And (righteous are) those who pray, pay alms, honor their agreements, and are patient in (times of) poverty, ailment and during conflict.  Such are the people of truth.  And they are the God-Fearing.| Qur'an Surah 2: Verse 177}}

'''Samuel Ramos Magaña''', Ph.D. (1897 &amp;ndash; June 20, 1959), was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[writer]].

Ramos was born in [[Zitácuaro]], [[Michoacán]], and in 1909 entered the Colegio de San Nicolás in [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]. He published his first works in the school's student publication ''Flor de Loto''. In 1915 he began to study philosophy under the tutelage of his mentor, [[José Torres Orozco]].

He spent 1915, his first year of medical school in [[Morelia]], and his second and third years at the Military Medical School in [[Mexico City]]. In 1919 he became part of the faculty of higher learning and taught introductory philosophy at the [[National Preparatory School]] and [[logic]] and [[ethics]] at the National Teachers School.

He pursued specialized degrees at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], the [[Collège de France]], and a University in [[Rome]]. Upon his return to Mexico, he continued to teach and served in the [[Secretary of Education (Mexico)|Ministry of Public Education]].

In 1944 he earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in philosophy from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and became head of the [[Faculty of Philosophy and Literature]] there. On July 8, 1952 he began a lifelong term as a member of the prestigious [[Colegio Nacional (Mexico)|Colegio Nacional]].

==Philosophy==
His work concerns itself with the [[ontology]] of the Mexican [[nation]]. He sees the ''[[pelado]]'', the "urban bum" of the 1920s and 1930s, as "the most elemental and clearly defined expression of national character". The [[machismo]] of the pelado, he argues, is the result of an [[inferiority complex]]  (based on [[Alfred Adler]]'s concept) and, since the pelado represents the entire country, the "character study" is extended to all of Mexico, and was one of the first post-[[Mexican Revolution|Revolutionary]] attempts to define and assess the national character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11260">'''Secondary Causation'''&lt;ref&gt;“Causality Primary and Secondary”, Mariano Artigas, Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, ©2003 Gale Cengage; online at http://www.enotes.com/causality-primary-secondary-reference/causality-primary-secondary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Kant’s Theory of Divine and Secondary Causation”, Des Hogan, University of California at San Diego; online at http://philosophy.ucsd.edu/_files/facultysites/watkins-conference/hogan.pdf;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Causation as a Secondary Quality”, Peter Menzies and Huw Price, Br. J. Philos. Sci., 44 (1993), 187-203.&lt;/ref&gt; is the philosophical proposition that all material and corporeal objects, having been created by God with their own intrinsic potentialities, are subsequently empowered to evolve independently in accordance with natural law.  Traditional Christians would slightly modify this injunction to allow for the occasional miracle as well as the exercise of free will.  Deists who deny any divine interference past the creation event would only accept free will exceptions.  That the physical universe is consequentially well-ordered, consistent, and knowable subject to human observation and reason, was a primary theme of [[Scholasticism]] and further molded into the philosophy of the Western Tradition by [[Augustine]] and later by [[Aquinas]].

Secondary causation has been suggested as a necessary precursor for scientific inquiry into an established order of natural laws which are not entirely predicated on the changeable whims of a supernatural Being.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Toby E. The Rise of Early Modem Science: Islam, China and the West, Cambridge University Press, (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor does this create a conflict between science and religion for, given a Creator, it is not inconsistent with the paradigm of a [[clockwork universe]].   It does however remove logical contradictions concerning the unfettered expression of man’s free will which would otherwise require not just God’s acquiescence but rather His direct intervention to implement.

==Opposing Philosophies of Volunteerism and Occasionalism against Secondary Causation==

According to the Jewish Torah which brought down the original idea in Genesis, the phrase "free will" is a mistranslation from the Torah, rather what humans are given is "freedom to choose".
Freedom to choose to do God's Will at all times even though God gave us a good inclination and a not-good inclination to use in choosing, we are told "Therefore choose life".

Occasionalism itself was derived from the earlier school of thought of “volunteerism” emanating from [[Al-Ash'ari]] who held that every particle in the universe must be constantly recreated each instant by God’s direct intervention.

==Kabbalahistic Interpretation==

According to the Kabbalah and brought down in Chasidic philosophy in the book "[[Tanya|Tania]], the Book of Intermediates" composed by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (Russia) at the beginning of the 19th century, 
the will and desire to create the universe is integral to the Creator's very essence &amp; thought this being the source for all the physical and spiritual worlds.

Once the Creator has created the universe and God knows &amp; wants the Creation as the One who created it in His very essence, God then enlivens and vivifies all parts of the universe at every moment or the physical universe &amp; the many spiritual worlds would revert instantly to their source in the Creator from where they came.
At the same time as molecules move, human cells divide the Creator must know the Creation as it was a moment ago and makes allowance for the finite Creations to grow  and later slowly wither, and by the evaporation of water, the wearing down of rocks and soil, the birth, growth and weakening of the flesh of fish, animals and humans all Creations as they are built from the 4 main spiritual worlds which also break down, they have a mirror on earth of air, fire, water, dust and slowly all created beings wear down by God's constant  enlivening of them until each of the 4 elements return to their spiritual source which mirror the 4 elements. This is not an independent of God  activity, rather it is all controlled by God's Will.

Torah explains that before Creation there was only God and nothing else as is seen in  the highest Name the letter "Yud".
When it came time for Creation the want and will of God to Create a universe
which meant expansion of the Holy Name the Holy Name Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey  how this Creation came about by G-D's use of the 10 Sefirot would be too great a task to explain here but basically we find "And God said let there be..."

The Creation made no change in the Creator God was, is and always will be but the Creation is available to those Created as an order always vivified by God since God must know the Creation in order to keep it as it is, yet allow for His change according to his will. The body sees a Creation while the soul sees only The Infinite One God.

Having the gift from God, "the Freedom to choose" to serve God and always do God's Will here on earth makes us partners in creation. Being that God's Will was revealed to the People of Israel on Mount Sinai and spread to the world in the Torah we have Freedom to choose to do so.  If a human does the opposite of God's Will it is in God's realm to alter the cosmic plan of Creation that He Himself devised, that He Himself wants but since nothing exists but God, including the universe and this "nothing" is not above the knowledge that "nothing is too hard for God" and "Our wisdom is not His Wisdom",  it is a fundamental theme in Torah that we must do God's will yet we have Freedom to serve or not and if we go against God's will, it is still a lack on our part as partners with God here on earth but this itself is God's Will and will not upset the cosmic original plan.

We see this when Shimi cursed King David and threw stones at him that King David did not get angry since he realized that Shimi was an agent from God himself or Shimi could not possibly use his physical God given talents to speak or throw stones if God did not want. Even though Shimi was not told by God,  Shimi used his Freedom to Serve in the wrong way, but if Shimi had not cursed David at God's Will, "God has many messengers to do His will"

In fact, with Adam and Eve there in, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was created before Adam himself by God and this is all part of His plan, to turn away from evil.

==Opposing Philosophy of  ”Dual Truth” against Secondary Causation==
The concept of there being two distinct truths, even concerning the same object or phenomena, was most notably developed by [[Averroes]] (1126-1198 from Spain).  By thus separating the sanctity of religious revelation from the practical world of physical observation, it was an attempt to circumvent proscriptions on the discredited rationalist heresy of [[Muʿtazila]], which had heretofore not gained traction in any venue.

Following [[Augustine]] and many others, this concept of [[double truth]] was soundly rejected by Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae which reiterated the long established view in the West that there can be only one truth.   The original quote from Augustine was
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In matters that are obscure and far beyond our vision, even in such as we may find treated in Holy Scripture, different Interpretations are sometimes possible without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such a case, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;“St. Augustine, the Literal Meaning of Genesis”. vol. 1, Ancient Christian Writers., vol. 41. Translated and annotated by John Hammond Taylor, S.J. New York: Paulist Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of Philosophy in Support of Secondary Causation==
The assignment of intrinsic qualities to objects which can mutate and evolve of their own accord without divine intervention was a crucial step in the transformation of the rational logic of the Greeks into the scientific method&lt;ref&gt;“The Origin of Science”, by Stanley L. Jaki.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Western Tradition of the late Middle Ages.   Because man could thus observe and characterize the natural flow of events without impugning the prerogatives of supernatural forces, burgeoning philosopher-scientists became free to experiment and especially to question and debate the results.

In Western Europe this rationale was further strengthened by the motivation that science was uniquely able not only to efficiently manage the world as charged to do so in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] but also to be able to distinguish miracles from natural occurrences.

One of the first to take advantage of this opportunity was [[Albertus Magnus]] of Cologne (1193-1206), who wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In studying nature we have not to inquire how God the Creator may, as He freely wills, use His creatures to work miracles and thereby show forth His power; we have rather to inquire what Nature with its immanent causes can naturally bring to pass."&lt;ref&gt;“De vegetabilibus etplantis”, by Albertus Magnus(1193-1206)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sentiment was echoed in various European forums of the day notably by the secular Professor of Theology at the University of Paris, John [[Buridan]] (1300-1361) who liberally commented on the works of Aristotle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“It should also be noted that [when we ask whether metaphysics is the same as wisdom,] we are not comparing metaphysics to theology, which proceeds from beliefs that are not known, because although these beliefs are not known per se and most evident, we hold without doubt that theology is the more principal discipline and that it is wisdom most properly speaking. In this question, however, we are merely asking about intellectual habits based on human reason, [i.e.,] those discovered by the process of reasoning, which are deduced from what is evident to us. For it is in this sense that Aristotle calls metaphysics ‘theology’ and ‘the divine science’. Accordingly, metaphysics differs from theology in the fact that although each considers God and those things that pertain to divinity, metaphysics only considers them as regards what can be proved and implied, or inductively inferred, by demonstrative reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Dialectic [Summulae de dialectica]. by Buridan (&lt;1300-1361)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, John Buridan online at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of perception]], the theory of '''sense data''' was a popular view held in the early 20th century by philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[H. H. Price]], [[A. J. Ayer]], and [[G. E. Moore]].  Sense data are taken to be mind-dependent objects whose existence and properties are known directly to us in perception.  These objects are unanalyzed experiences inside the mind, which appear to subsequent more advanced mental operations exactly as they are.

Sense data are often placed in a time and/or causality series, such that they occur after the potential unreliability of our perceptual systems yet before the possibility of error during higher-level conceptual analysis and are thus incorrigible. They are thus distinct from the 'real' objects in the world outside the mind, about whose existence and properties we often ''can'' be mistaken.

Talk of sense-data has since been largely replaced by talk of the closely related [[qualia]]. The formulation ''the given'' is also closely related. None of these terms has a single coherent and widely agreed-upon definition, so their exact relationships are unclear. One of the greatest troubling aspects to 20th century theories of sense data is its unclear rubric nature.

== Examples ==

Bertrand Russell heard the sound of his knuckles rapping his writing table, felt the table's hardness and saw its apparent colour (which he knew 'really' to be the brown of wood) change significantly under shifting lighting conditions.

[[H. H. Price]] found that although he was able to doubt the presence of a tomato before him, he was unable to doubt the existence of his red, round and 'somewhat bulgy' sense-datum and his consciousness of this sense-datum.

When we twist a coin it 'appears' to us as elliptical.  This elliptical 'appearance' cannot be identical with the coin (for the coin is perfectly round), and is therefore a sense datum, which somehow represents the round coin to us.

Consider a reflection which appears to us in a mirror.  There is nothing corresponding to the reflection in the world external to the mind (for our reflection appears to us as the image of a human being apparently located inside a wall, or a wardrobe).  The appearance is therefore a mental object, a sense datum.

== The nature of sense data ==

The idea that our perceptions are based on sense data is supported by a number of arguments. The first is popularly known as the [[argument from illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/ Sense-Data (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From a subjective experience of perceiving something, it is theoretically impossible to distinguish perceiving something which exists independently of oneself from an hallucination or mirage. Thus, we do not have any direct access to the outside world that would allow us to reliably distinguish it from an illusion that caused identical experiences. Since (the argument claims) we must have direct access to some specific experiential entity in order to have the percepts that we do, and since this entity is not identical to the real object itself, there must be some sort of internal mental entity somehow correlated to the real world, about which we afterwards have perceptions, make judgments, etc. This entity is a sense-datum.

==Abstract sense data==
Abstract sense data is sense data without human judgement, sense data without human conception and yet evident to the senses, found in [[aesthetic]] experience. As opposed to; imaginary sense data which is more like a quasi substance and does not really exist; Imaginary sense data is abstract sense data as presented from the aestheticized senses to [[consciousness]]; i.e. imagination, power of reason and inner subjective states of [[self-awareness]] including: emotion, self-reflection, ego, and theory.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://gradworks.umi.com/14/73/1473509.html "Cubist paintings 1910-1912 and Piaget's theory of the development of object permanence: On the existence of abstract and imaginary sense data" by Jackson, Scott]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of abstract and imaginary sense data operates on the tacit definition of imagination as "a power mediating between the senses and the reason by virtue of representing perceptual objects without their presence".&lt;ref&gt;Brann, Eva T. H. The World of the Imagination: Sum and Substance. Savage, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginary sense data are 'imaginary' per [[Immanuel Kant]]'s analysis that imagination is the primary faculty of mind capable of synthesizing input from the senses into a world of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. Immanuel Kant's: Critique of Pure Reason. London: Macmillan and Co.  Limited, 1933. pg 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Richard. The Wake of Imagination: Ideas of Creativity in Western Culture.  London: Hutchinson, 1988. pg 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Collin. Mindsight.: Image, Dream, Meaning. Cambridge, Mass. Harvard  University Press, 2004. pg 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Code, Murray. Myths of Reason: Vagueness, Rationality, and the Lure of Logic. Atlantic  Highlands, N.J.:Humanities Press, 1995. pg 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Abstract and imaginary sense data are key to understanding abstract art's relationship with the conscious and unconscious mind.

== Criticisms ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Sense data theories have been criticised by philosophers such as [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (Sellars diagnosing in them [[Wilfred Sellars#Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind|The Myth of the Given]]), and more recently by [[Kevin O'Regan]], [[Alva Noë]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. Much of the early criticism may arise from a claim about sense data that was held by philosophers such as A. J. Ayer. This was that sense data really do have the properties they appear to have. Thus, in this account of sense data, the sense data that are responsible for the experience of a red tomato really "are red".

In one sense this is ridiculous, since there is nothing red in a brain to act as a sense datum. However, in another sense it is perfectly consistent—in the sense that the data "are red" when experienced directly, even though the physical processes of perception may not appear red if they were experienced in a contrived and inappropriately indirect way, such as by examining the brain of the experiencer with scientific instruments.

On some theories, the tomato itself is not red except in the eyes of a red-seeing being. Thus when one says that a neural state is or is not 'red' without referring the judgement of redness to the owner of the neurons concerned, there is an assumption that things can have innate appearances without reference to perceivers—which is implicitly denied by the sense data theory. Thus the criticism that sense data cannot really be red is made from a position of presupposition inconsistent with a theory of sense data—so it is bound to seem to make the theory seem wrong. More recent opposition to the existence of sense data appears to be simply regression to [[naïve realism]].

By objectifying and partially externalising a Subject's basic experiences of the world as 'sense-data', positing their necessity for perception and [[Higher-order thinking|higher order thinking]] and installing them permanently between the perceiving Subject and the 'real world', sense-data theories tend towards [[Solipsism]]. Attempts to repair this must avoid both obscurantism and over-dependence on psychology (and therefore empiricism, and potentially circularity).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4151">The '''Seventeen Rules of Enjuin'''　({{lang-ja|延寿院医則十七ヶ条}}) are a [[code of conduct]] developed for students of the [[Japan]]ese ''[[Ri-shu]]'' school of [[medicine]] in the 16th century [[Common Era|CE]]. They contain the same number of rules as the [[seventeen-article constitution]] of [[Prince Shōtoku]].&lt;ref&gt;京都府医師会医学史編纂室『』思文閣出版, 1980, pages 230-250&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules are similar to the [[Vejjavatapada]], the Buddhist medical doctor's oath, the [[Oath of Asaph]] and the [[Hippocratic Oath]], in that they stress the rights of the physicians' teachers, require the physician to respect the patient's privacy rights, and prohibit both [[euthanasia]] and [[abortion]]. They also emphasize that physicians should love their patients and that they should work together as a brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wisdomtools.com/poynter/codes.html | title = Codes of Medical and Human Experimentation Ethics | accessdate = 2007-06-19 | author = Victoria Berdon  |author2=Jennifer Flavin  | work = The Least of My Brothers | publisher = Poynter Center for the Study of Ethics, American Institutions at Indiana University-Bloomington, and WisdomTools, Inc. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928201651/http://wisdomtools.com/poynter/codes.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ephesus37.jpg|thumb|[[Anthropomorphism|Personification]] of [[Wisdom]] ({{lang-grc-koi|Σοφία}}, {{transl|el|Sophía}}) at the [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]] (second century).]]
'''Sophia''' ({{lang-grc-koi|[[wikt:σοφία|σοφία]]}} ''sophía'' "[[wisdom]]") is a central idea in [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and [[Hellenistic religion|religion]], [[Platonism]], [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Gnosticism]], and [[Christian theology]]. Originally carrying a meaning of "cleverness, skill", the later meaning of the term, close to the meaning of ''[[Phronesis]]'' ("wisdom, intelligence"), was significantly shaped by the term ''[[philosophy]]'' ("love of ''sophia''") as used by [[Plato]].

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches, [[Holy Wisdom]] ({{lang|grc|Αγία Σοφία}} ''Hagía Sophía'') is an expression for [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus]]) in the [[Trinity]] (as in the dedication of the church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]) and, rarely, for the [[Holy Spirit]].

References to ''Sophia'' in [[Koine Greek]] translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]] translate to the [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] term ''[[Chokhmah]]''.

==Greek and Hellenistic tradition==
{{Further|Logos|Phronesis|Seven Sages of Greece|Gnosis}}
The [[Ancient Greek]] word ''sophia'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφία|σοφία]]}}, {{transl|grc|sophía}}) is the [[abstract noun]] of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφός|σοφός]]}} ({{transl|grc|sophós}}), which variously translates to "clever, skillful, intelligent, wise". These words share the same [[Proto-Indo-European root]] as the [[Latin]] verb {{lang|la|[[wikt:sapere|sapere]]}} ({{Literal translation|"to taste; discern"|lk=on}}), whence {{lang|la|[[wikt:sapientia|sapientia]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pokorny (1959)]] [[s.v.]] [https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/lex/master/1652  sap-, sab- "to taste, savvy, perceive"].&lt;/ref&gt; The noun {{lang|grc|σοφία}} as "skill in handicraft and art" is [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]] and in [[Pindar]] is used to describe both [[Hephaestos]] and [[Athena]].

Before [[Plato]], the term for "sound judgement, intelligence, practical wisdom" and so on, such qualities as are ascribed to the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], was ''[[phronesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις|φρόνησις]]}}, {{transl|grc|phrónēsis}}), from ''[[phren]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρήν|φρήν]]}}, {{transl|grc|phrēn}}, {{Literal translation|"mind"}}), while ''sophia'' referred to technical skill. 

The term ''[[Philosophy|philosophia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φῐλοσοφῐ́ᾱ}}, {{transl|grc|philosophíā}}, {{Literal translation|"love of wisdom"}}) was primarily used after the time of [[Plato]], following his teacher [[Socrates]], though it has been said that [[Pythagoras]] was the first to call himself a philosopher. This understanding of ''philosophia'' permeates Plato's dialogues, especially the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In that work, the leaders of the proposed [[utopia]] are to be [[philosopher king]]s: rulers who are lovers of wisdom. According to Plato in ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates himself was dubbed "the wisest [{{lang|grc|σοφώτατός}}, {{transl|grc|sophṓtatós}}] man of Greece" by the [[Pythia|Pythian Oracle]]. Socrates defends this verdict in ''Apology'' to the effect that he, at least, [[I know that I know nothing|knows that he knows nothing]]. Socratic [[skepticism]] is contrasted with the approach of the [[sophist]]s, who are attacked in ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' for relying merely on [[eloquence]]. [[Cicero]] in {{lang|la|De Oratore}} later criticized Plato for his separation of wisdom from eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, James (2005). ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction''. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. p. 103. {{ISBN|0-205-41492-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sophia'' is named as one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] (in place of ''phronesis'') in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]''.

[[Philo]], a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenized Jew]] writing in [[Alexandria]], attempted to harmonize Platonic philosophy and Jewish scripture. Also influenced by [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophical concepts]], he used the Koine term ''[[logos]]'' ({{lang|grc|λόγος}}, {{transl|grc|lógos}}) for the role and function of Wisdom, a concept later adapted by the author of the [[Gospel of John]] in the opening verses and applied to Jesus as the Word ([[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]) of [[God the Father]].&lt;ref name="Harris John"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "John". pp. 302–310&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gnosticism]], Sophia is a feminine figure, analogous to the [[soul]], but also simultaneously one of the [[emanation]]s of the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]]. Gnostics held that she was the [[aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]] of Jesus (i.e. the [[Bride of Christ]]) and was the [[Holy Spirit]] of the [[Trinity]]. She is occasionally referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent of {{transl|grc|Achamṓth}} ({{lang|grc|Ἀχαμώθ}}; {{lang-he-n|[[wikt:חוכמה#Hebrew|חוכמה]]}}, {{transl|he|[[Chokhmah|ḥokhmāh]]}}) and as {{transl|grc|Proúnikos}} ({{lang|grc|Προύνικος}}).

==Christian theology==
{{main|Holy Wisdom}}
[[File:Holy Wisdom (16th c., Vologda museum).jpg|thumb|220px|Icon of  Divine Wisdom {{lang|ru|София Премудрость Божия}}) from St George Church in [[Vologda]]  (16th century)]]
[[Christian theology]] received the Old Testament personification of Divine Wisdom ([[Septuagint]] ''Sophia'', [[Vulgate]] ''Sapientia''). The connection of Divine Wisdom to the concept of the Logos resulted in the interpretation of "Holy Wisdom" (''Hagia Sophia'') as an aspect of Christ the Logos.&lt;ref name="GOC"&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]], ''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]''. Oxford:Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 35-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression {{lang|grc|Ἁγία Σοφία}} itself is not found in the [[New Testament]], even though passages in the [[Pauline epistles]] equate Christ with the "wisdom of God" ({{lang|grc|θεοῦ σοφία}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] 1:24b {{lang|grc|Χριστὸν θεοῦ δύναμιν καὶ θεοῦ σοφίαν}} "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God", 1:30 {{lang|grc| ἐξ αὐτοῦ δὲ ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ ὃς ἐγενήθη ἡμῖν σοφία ἀπὸ θεοῦ δικαιοσύνη τε καὶ ἁγιασμὸς καὶ ἀπολύτρωσις}} "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption"&lt;/ref&gt; The clearest form of the identification of Divine Wisdom with Christ comes in 1 Corinthians 1:17-2:13. In 1 Cor. 2:7, Paul speaks of the Wisdom of God as a [[Sacred mysteries|mystery]] which was "ordained before the world unto our glory". 

===Christology===
Following 1 Corinthians, the [[Church Fathers]] named Christ as "Wisdom of God".&lt;ref&gt;"Following St. Paul's reference to 'Christ who is the wisdom of God and the power of God', all the rest of the Church Fathers identified Sophia-Wisdom with Christ, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity"  Dennis O'Neill, ''Passionate Holiness: Marginalized Christian Devotions for Distinctive Peoples'' (2010), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qjl1H9GcetMC&amp;pg=PA6  p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, when rebutting claims about Christ's ignorance, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] insisted that, inasmuch as he was divine, Christ knew everything: "How can he be ignorant of anything that is, when he is Wisdom, the maker of the worlds, who brings all things to fulfilment and recreates all things, who is the end of all that has come into being?" (''Orationes'', 30.15). [[Irenaeus]] represents another, minor patristic tradition which identified the Spirit of God, and not Christ himself, as "Wisdom" (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'', 4.20.1–3; cf. 3.24.2; 4.7.3; 4.20.3). He could appeal to Paul's teaching about wisdom being one of the gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]] (1 Cor. 12:8). However, the majority applied to Christ the title/name of "Wisdom". 

[[File:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] basilica (section)]]
[[Constantine the Great]] set a pattern for Eastern Christians by dedicating a church to Christ as the personification of Divine Wisdom.&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; In [[Constantinople]], under [[Justinian I]], the Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") was rebuilt, consecrated in 538, and became a model for many other Byzantine churches. 
In the Latin Church, however, "the Word" or ''Logos'' came through more clearly than "the Wisdom" of God as a central, [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|high title of Christ]].  

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Holy Wisdom is understood as the Divine Logos who became [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] as Jesus;&lt;ref name="PMP"/&gt; this belief being sometimes also expressed in some Eastern Orthodox icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=108957 |title=OCA - Feasts and Saints |publisher=Ocafs.oca.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}

There is a hagiographical tradition, dating to the late sixth century,&lt;ref name=Saxer&gt;V. Saxer, "Sophia v. Rom" in: ''Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche'' vol. 9 (1993), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=3n7YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA733#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 733f.]&lt;/ref&gt; of a Saint Sophia and her three daughters, [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity]]. This has been taken as the [[veneration]] of [[allegory|allegorical figures]] from an early time, and the group of saints has become popular in Russian Orthodox iconography as such (the names of the daughters rendered as {{lang|cu|Вѣра, Надежда, Любовь}}). The veneration of the three saints named for the three [[theological virtues]] probably arose in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|f/fides_spes|band=17|autor= Ekkart Sauser|year=2000|artikel= Fides, Spes und Charitas: hl.

===Iconography===
{{See|Holy Wisdom (iconography)}}
[[File:Holy Wisdom created home.jpg|thumb|"Wisdom hath builded her house" ([[:ru:Премудрость созда Себе дом|Премудрость созда Себе дом]], Novgorod, 16th century).]]
The Christological identification of Christ the Logos with Divine Wisdom (''Hagia Sophia'') is strongly represented in the iconographic tradition of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. A type of icon of the [[Theotokos]] is "Wisdom hath builded Her house" ([[:ru:Премудрость созда Себе дом|Премудрость созда Себе дом]]), a quote from Proverbs 9:1 ("Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars") interpreted as prefiguring the incarnation, with the Theotokos being the "house" chosen by the "[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatic]] Wisdom" (i.e. "Wisdom" as a person of the [[Trinity]]).

===Christian mysticism===
{{see|Sophiology}}
In [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox mysticism]], ''Sophia'' became increasingly indistinguishable from the person of the ''Theotokos'' (rather than Christ), to the point of the implication of the ''Theotokos'' as a "fourth person of the Trinity".

Such interpretations became popular in the late nineteenth to early twentienth century, forwarded by authors such as  [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], and [[Sergei Bulgakov]].
Bulgakov's theology, known as "[[Sophiology|Sophianism]]", presented Divine Wisdom as "consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity", operating as the aspect of consubstantiality (ousia or physis, substantia or natura) or "hypostaticity" of the Trinity of the three hypostases, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, "which safeguards the unity of the Holy Trinity". &lt;ref&gt;[[Sergei Bulgakov]], "Sophia. The Wisdom of God" (1937/1993), p. 23-25; see also: [[Sergei Bulgakov]], "Hypostasis and hypostaticity: scholia to the unfading light" In: St Vladimir's Theological Quarterly 49(1-2)(2005), 5-46.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the topic of a highly political controversy in the early 1930s and was condemned as heretical 
in 1935.&lt;ref name="PMP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomazansky|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Pomazansky|title=Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n6DoAEACAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood|isbn=978-0-938635-69-7 | pages=357 ff}}; online at {{cite web |title=Orthodox dogmatic theology: text - IntraText CT |url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0824/_P2O.HTM |website=Intratext}}&lt;/ref&gt;online [ Intratext.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Sophianism |title=Orthodoxwiki states this also as heresy |publisher=Orthodoxwiki.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] tradition in England, [[Jane Leade]], seventeenth-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]], [[Christian universalism|Universalist]], and founder of the [[Philadelphians|Philadelphian Society]], wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the "Virgin Sophia" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirst|first=Julie|authorlink=Julie Hirst|title=Jane Leade: Biography of a Seventeenth-century Mystic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_afNy02glYC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|isbn=978-0-7546-5127-7|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Leade was hugely influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] writings of sixteenth century [[Germany|German]] Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], who also speaks of the Sophia in works such as ''The Way to Christ'' (1624).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob Böhme]], ''The Way to Christ'' (1622) [http://www.passtheword.org/DIALOGS-FROM-THE-PAST/waychrst.htm Passtheword.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jakob Böhme was very influential to a number of [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]] and religious leaders, including [[George Rapp]] and the [[Harmony Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Versluis,  "Western Esotericism and The Harmony Society", ''Esoterica I'' (1999) pp. 20-47 [http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/Versluis.html MSU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personification==
''Sophia'' is not a "goddess" in classical Greek tradition; Greek goddesses associated with wisdom are [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] and [[Athena]] (Latin [[Minerva]]). By the [[Roman Empire]], it became common to depict the [[cardinal virtues]] and other abstract ideals, as female [[allegory|allegories]]. Thus, in the Library of Celsus in [[Ephesus]], built in the 2nd century, there are four statues of female allegories, depicting wisdom (Sophia), knowledge ([[Episteme]]), intelligence ([[Ennoia]]) and valour ([[Arete]]). In the same period, ''Sophia'' assumes aspects of a goddess or angelic power in [[Gnosticism]].

In [[Christian iconography]], Holy Wisdom or ''Hagia Sophia'' was depicted as a female allegory from the medieval period. In Western (Latin) tradition, she appears as a crowned virgin; in [[Holy Wisdom (iconography)|Russian Orthodox tradition]], she has a more supernatural aspect of a crowned woman with wings in a glowing red colour.
The virgin martyrs [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Faith Hope and Charity with their mother Sophia]] are depicted as three small girls standing in front of their mother in widow's dress.

''[[Allegory of Wisdom and Strength]]'' is a painting by [[Paolo Veronese]], created circa 1565 in [[Venice]]. It is a large-scale allegorical painting depicting Divine Wisdom personified on the left and [[Hercules]], representing Strength and earthly concerns, on the right.

==Modern reception==
[[File:Statue_of_Sveta_Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sophia in Sofia, Bulgaria]] 
A goddess ''Sophia'' was introduced into [[Anthroposophy]] by its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], in his book ''The Goddess: From Natura to Divine Sophia''&lt;ref name="Steiner "&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=o7XNn_THKKAC&amp;vq=Sophia&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=The Goddess: From Natura to the Divine Sophia : Selections from the Work of Rudolf Steiner | publisher=Sophia Books, Rudolf Steiner Press | author=Steiner, Rudolf | authorlink=Rudolf Steiner | year=2001 | page=96 | isbn=1855840944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a later compilation of his writings titled ''Isis Mary Sophia.'' Sophia also figures prominently in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], a spiritual movement which Anthroposophy was closely related to. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of Theosophy, described it in her essay ''What is Theosophy?'' as an esoteric wisdom doctrine, and said that the "Wisdom" referred to was "an emanation of the Divine principle" typified by "...some goddesses—Metis, Neitha, Athena, the Gnostic Sophia..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/theosophy/what_is_theosophy.html |title=What is Theosophy? |publisher=Age-of-the-sage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, Sophia has also been invoked as a goddess in [[Dianic Wicca]] and related currents of feminist spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Books relating to the contemporary pagan worship of the goddess Sophia include: ''Sophia, Goddess of Wisdom'', by Caitlin Matthews, ''The Cosmic Shekinah'' by Sorita d'Este and David Rankine (which includes Sophia as one of the major aspects of the goddess of wisdom), and ''Inner Gold: Understanding Psychological Projection'' by Robert A. Johnson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 installation artwork ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' features a place setting for Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings "Place Settings"]. Brooklyn Museum. Retrieved on 2015-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Statue of Sveta Sofia|monumental sculpture]] of Holy Wisdom depicted as a "goddess" in [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria (the city itself is named after [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgtraveller.com/en/sofia/sights/stsophia.html|title=The Church of St Sophia, Sofia, Bulgaria|website=www.bgtraveller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was erected in 2000 to replace a statue of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2158">'''''Trairūpya''' (''Sanskrit; English: "the triple-character of inferential sign") is a conceptual tool of [[Buddhist logic]]. The Trairūpya, ‘three conditions’, is oft accredited to [[Dignaga]] (c. 480-540 CE) though is now understood to have originated with his teacher [[Vasubandhu]] (fl. 4th century) in the ''Vāda-vidhi'',&lt;ref&gt;Anacker, Stefan (2005, rev.ed.). ''Seven Works of Vasubandhu: The Buddhist Psychological Doctor. '' Delhi, India: Motilal Banarsidass. (First published: 1984; Reprinted: 1986, 1994, 1998; Corrected: 2002; Revised: 2005), p.31&lt;/ref&gt; post-reconstruction of this work by [[Erich Frauwallner|Frauwallner]] (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Frauwallner, Erich (1957). 'Vasubandhu's Vādavidhiḥ'. ''Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde Süd-und Ost-Asiens'' 1, 1957, 104ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trairūpya is a logical argument that contains three constituents which a logical ‘sign’ or ‘mark’ (linga) must fulfill to be 'valid source of knowledge' ([[pramana]]):
#It should be present in the case or object under consideration, the ‘subject-locus' (pakṣa)  
#It should be present in a ‘similar case’ or a homologue (sapakṣa)  
#It should not be present in any ‘dissimilar case’ or heterologue (vipakṣa)  
When a ‘sign’ or ‘mark’ (linga) is identified, there are three possibilities: the sign may be present in all, some, or none of the sapakṣas. Likewise, the sign may be present in all, some or none of the vipakṣas. To identify a sign, we have to assume that it is present in the pakṣa, however; that is the first condition is already satisfied. Combining these, Dignaga constructed his ‘Wheel of Reason’ (Sanskrit: [[Hetucakra]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna (author), Ganeri, Jonardon (editor) &amp; (Tiwari, Heeraman)(1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8594">[[Max Weber]] distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority.  He wrote about these three types of domination in both his essay ''[[The Three Types of Legitimate Rule]]'' which was published in his masterwork ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic speech "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138).
# '''[[charismatic authority]]''' (''character'', ''heroism'', ''leadership'', ''religious''),
# '''[[traditional authority]]''' (''patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism'') and
# '''[[legal authority]]''' (''modern law and state, bureaucracy'').

These three types are [[ideal type]]s and rarely appear in their pure form.

According to Weber, authority is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. These three forms of authority are said to appear in an "hierarchical development order". [[Sovereign state|States]] progress from ''charismatic authority'', to ''traditional authority'', and finally reach the ''state of rational-legal authority'' which is characteristic of a modern [[liberal democracy]].

==Charismatic domination==
{{main|Charismatic domination}}
Charismatic authority grows out of the personal charm or the strength of an individual personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.12manage.com/methods_weber_charismatic_leadership.html Charismatic Leadership (Weber)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Weber in a lecture as "the authority of the extraordinary and personal gift of grace (charisma)"; he distinguished it from the other forms of authority by stating "Men do not obey him [the charismatic ruler] by virtue of tradition or statute, but because they believe in him."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/weber/lecture/politics_vocation.html Politics as a Vocation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the actual power or capabilities of the leader are irrelevant, as long as the followers believe that such power exists. Thus, according to Weber, it is particularly difficult for charismatic leaders to maintain their authority because the followers must continue to legitimize the authority of the leader.

Charismatic domination is insofar different from legal-rational and traditional power as it does not develop from established tradition but rather from the belief the followers have in the leader.

According to Weber, once the leader loses his charisma or dies, systems based on charismatic authority tend to transform into traditional or legal-rational systems.

==Traditional domination==
{{main|Traditional domination}}
In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the [[authority]] comes from [[tradition]] or custom; Weber described it as "the authority of the eternal yesterday" and identified it as the source of authority for [[monarchy|monarchies]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this type of domination, the traditional rights of a powerful individual or group are accepted by the subordinate, or at least not challenged. The dominant individual could be a clan leader, eldest, the head of a family, a patriarchal figure or dominant elite. Historically this has been the most common type of government.

According to Weber, inequalities are created and preserved by traditional authority. Should this authority not be challenged, the dominant leader or group will stay in power. For Weber, traditional power blocked the development of rational-legal authority.

==Rational-legal domination==
{{main|Legal domination}}
Legal authority, also known as rational-legal authority, is where an individual or institution exerts power by virtue of the legal office that they hold. It is the authority that demands obedience to the office rather than the officeholder; once they leave office, their rational-legal authority is lost. Weber identified ''"rationally-created rules"''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as the central feature of this form of authority. Modern [[democracy|democracies]] contain many examples of legal-rational regimes. There are different ways in which legal authority can develop. Many societies have developed a system of laws and regulations and there exist many different principles of legality. With the development of a legal-rational system, the political system is likely to be rationalized similarly. [[Constitution]]s, written documents, established offices and regular elections are often associated with modern legal-rational political systems. These in the past have tended to develop in opposition to earlier traditional systems such as monarchies, where the set of rules are not well developed. As these systems develop in a rational manner, authority takes on a legal-rational form. Those who govern have the legitimate legal right to do so and those subordinated accept the legality of the rulers.

Albeit rational-legal authority may be challenged by those subordinated, it is unlikely to result in a quick change in the nature of the system. Such power struggles, according to Weber, are mostly political struggles and may be based on nationalism or ethnicity.

==The classification of authority in the context of history==
Weber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones, because the instability of charismatic authority inevitably forces it to "routinize" into a more structured form of authority. Likewise he notes that in a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a master can lead to a "traditional revolution". Thus he alludes to an inevitable move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilizing a bureaucratic structure. This ties to his broader concept of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the [[social evolutionism]] theory.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the [[authority]] comes from [[tradition]], in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual ([[charisma]]), and in legal (or rational-legal) authority from powers that are [[bureaucracy|bureaucratically]] and legally attached to certain positions. A classic example of these three types may be found in religion: [[priests]] (traditional), [[Jesus]] (charismatic), and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (legal-rational). Weber also conceived of these three types within his three primary modes of conflict: traditional authority within status groups, charismatic authority within [[social class|class]], and legal-rational authority within party organizations.

In his view every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained elements that can be analyzed on the basis of the above distinction.

'''Vibhu''' ([[Sanskrit]]:विभु) means – 'mighty', 'powerful', 'eminent', 'supreme', 'able to', 'capable of', 'self-subdued', 'firm' or 'self-controlled'; in [[Nyaya]] philosophy, it means – 'eternal', 'existing everywhere', 'all-pervading', 'pervading all material things'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=1455|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.5:125.apte}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word also refers to ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]'' or mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Origin and Development of Yoga from Vedic times|author=Suresh chander Banerjee|publisher=Punthi Pustak|page=469|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fKfWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=vibhu+vedas&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtGsVKiVCojmuQT9t4CwDA&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; This word has its root in the term, '''bhū''' ( भू), meaning – 'become', 'arise', 'come into existence'; thus ''vibhu'' means – 'expand', 'become manifest', 'appear', 'pervade'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Artful Universe|author=William K.

==Vedic significance==

From [[Atharvaveda]] it is learnt that Sudhanvan Angirasa had three sons, Ribhu, Vibhu and Vaja, collectively known as [[Ribhus]] who were intelligent sages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Mythology|author=Nagendra Kumar Singh|publisher=APH Publications|page=196|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jXw7-PdwZ7oC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; They carried the luminous power of knowledge to this world, which knowledge pervaded the world as nectar. Ribhu or Ribhukshan was skillful at handling knowledge; Vibhu or Vibhawa was skillful in pervading and diffusing, and Vaja handled embodied plenitude with similar skill; all three dwelled in the solar-region and are considered to be the rays of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mertowney Mountain Interviews|author=Richard Leviton|publisher=iUniverse|page=383|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IhhOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the three leaders of rites and the possessors of opulence, and the three deities of several Rig Vedic hymns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Samhita|publisher=N.Trubner|page=115|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6tf0xYQRrsgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mantra of the [[Rig Veda]] reads as follows:-

:एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजो या नु दधृष्वान् कृणवै मनीषा |
:अहं ह्युग्रो मरुतो विदानो यानि चयवमिन्द्र इदीश एषाम् || ([[Rig Veda]] I.165.10)

In the Rig Veda, the word, ''vibhu'', means – 'all-pervading unified entity that permeates or extends throughout a spatial expanse', as is in the afore-cited mantra wherein the phrase - एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजः which means -  " Though I be but one, let my might be extensive. " &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Ideals of Sovereignty and the Poetics of Power|author=Theodore Nicholas Proferes|publisher=American Oriental Society|page=27|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qXzXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=vibhu+vedas&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XBauVPTRGNiRuASP3YLoCA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCDgo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the words, ''vibhu'' and ''[[prabhu]]'', appear in the [[Rig Veda]] but these words have a fixed psychological significance – ''vibhu'' means - 'coming into existence to pervade the whole being as ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|ānanda]]'', and ''prabhu'' means - 'coming into existence as a specific object or particular experience within the range of one’s consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Secret of the Vedas|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|page=355|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fTJb_Y1Tp94C&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sage of the Rig Veda (II.xxiv.11) asserts that:-

:विभु प्रभु प्रथमं मेहनावतो बृहस्पतेः सुविदत्राणि राध्या |
:इमा सातानि वेन्यस्य वाजिनो येन जना उभ्यें भुञ्जते विशः ||

[[Brihaspati]], the lord of the heaven of light and the guardian of ''[[Ṛta|rta]]'', is present in all things and beings (''vibhu'') same as the [[Brahman]] of the [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Religion and Philosophy of the Vedas and Upanishads|author=A.B.Keith|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=448|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p9zCbRMQbyEC&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ac-sVL-MMtLbuQTp0ICQAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical significance==

In the [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]], while describing the world of Brahman, there is the mention of the hall of Brahman called ''Vibhu'' (or built by ''Vibhu'' here meaning – 'egoism') arriving at which hall the glory of Brahman reaches the one who seeks liberation, where the seeker thinks himself to be Brahman, and thinking thus approaches the throne ''Vikakshanā'' ('perception'), in other words, the seeker having become liberated experiences Brahman, his own true nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=sacred Books of the East|publisher=The Floating Press|pages=262, 263|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hoV-aiNlwbgC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Js6sVI-PMJCGuATRmoCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaudapada]] in his ''kārikā'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] stating:-

:निवृत्तेः सर्वदुःखानामीशानः प्रभुरव्ययः  |
:अद्वैतः सर्वभावानां देवस्तुर्यो विभु स्मृतः ||

describes the fourth state (''[[turiya]]'') as the ordainer (''iśana''), as the supreme lord (''prabhu''), as the non-dual (''advaita'') and the all-pervading (''vibhu'') god (''devata'') of all beings. Here, the word, ''avyaya'', means that which is not subject to change; and ''turiya'' is ''vibhu'' because it pervades all the three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=67|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=vibhu+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8tesVICFHIyRuASEvoK4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to all six orthodox [[Vedic]] ''darśanas'' which comprise [[Hindu philosophy]], with the exception of [[Ramanuja]]’s 'theory of atomic dimensionless soul', the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|ātmān]]'' is ''vibhu'' ('omnipresent'). The followers of [[Jainism]], who believe that the ''ātmān'' assumes the size corresponding to the size of the body it occupies, also believe that in the final state of liberation it remains unalterable, but they reject the Hindu theory of ''vibhu'' which to them does not explain if the soul is same at all times everywhere why for is there the experience individual self. Vedāntists argue that for the atman to be unchangeable in the state of liberation then it must be regarded either as ''anu'' ('minute') or as ''vibhu'' ('pervasive').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions|publisher=University of California Press|page=219|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahmasutram|author=Sitanath Tattvabhushan|publisher=Genesis Publishing

[[Advaita Vedanta]] rests on the premise that only the substratum ([[Brahman]]) is real, the phenomenal world all with its properties and relations is unreal and due to ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. Substance, in its pure subtle state is the constitutive cause of things, and in its rational state it is the substratum of qualities, actions, etc., and exists in nine forms – earth (''prithivi''), water (''jala''), fire (''agni''), air (''vayu''), space (''akasha'') ('which five constitute the physical world'), direction (''disha'') ('without which no movement is not possible'), time (''kaal'') ('the substratum and the causal factor of all psycho-physical product and worldly behaviour'), mind (''manas'') and self (''ātmān''); the first four and mind are ''paramanus'' ('infinitesimal') and the rest are ''vibhu'' ('ubiquitous'), simple and infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy and Religion|publisher=Global Vision|page=557|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0TBTVPax4E8C&amp;pg=PA557&amp;dq=vibhu+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_tusVNfMFdijugSUiIH4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vindhyāvāsī, giving up the doctrine of the three psychical organs, associates the processes of the faculty of knowledge (''buddhi'') and I-consciousness with the thinking organ (''manah'') which three were the great all –penetrating ''vibhu''. Vyasa too held mind (''citta'') to be all-penetrating (''vibhu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=history of Indian Philosophy|author=Erich Frauwallner|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=323|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CMINXvxHU0sC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=vibhu+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vMysVN_LJ8yzuASxk4GoAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vibhu%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] explains that " the Self (Brahman), which is by nature all-pervasive (''vibhu'') assumes the form and qualities of the ''buddhi'' when apparently moving in the cycle of empirical existence.
