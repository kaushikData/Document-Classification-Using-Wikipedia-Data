'''Abbas Al Omran''' is a Bahraini human rights and labor activist. He currently resides in London, England after his arrest, torture,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and conviction in Bahrain for political crimes.

==Early life==
Prior to his entry into political activism, Abbas Al Omran worked in the oil industry at [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]], also known as Bapco. His time, however, was short-lived after Al Omran was found communicating to the media regarding poor reviews on Bapco. The company then proceeded to dismiss him from his position after they had already banned him from the company's e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil company whistleblower dismissed for denouncing corruption, communicating with media, says BCHR|url=https://www.ifex.org/bahrain/2008/10/07/oil_company_whistleblower_dismissed/|website=iFex|accessdate=22 April 2015|date=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Activism==
Abbas Al Omran is a member of the British-based [[Bahrain Centre for Human Rights]]. He is a primary activist for Bahrain that now resides in the United Kingdom after he was arrested and tortured. Although he has recently resided in London, he was put on the list of wanted persons in 2011 in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="10/5/2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Governments still cracking down hard on Media|url=http://www.dp-news.com/en/detail.aspx?articleid=83270|website=DP News|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement===
In 2009, Al Omran was physically abused, along with [[Death of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima|Ali Mushaima]], by a group of three that were said to be of African descent. In this attack, Al Omran suffered several injuries including swelling of his right eye, lower right shoulder, knees and elbow. Al Omran and Mushaima were known in the London area for their peaceful protests because Al Omran is a human rights activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attack on 3 Bahraini activists in London- BCHR calls the British government for an urgent investigation in the attacks|url=http://bahrainrights.org/en/node/2934|website=Bahrain Center for Human Rights|accessdate=22 April 2015|date=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bahrain in 2013, the use of protest masks, also known as [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s, have been banned and the country has strictly shut down the import of these masks. Al Omran became involved in this issue, as he stated in an interview with The Cutting Edge News that "he didn't think the ban would have much effect, as there are already many of the masks already in Bahrain, and the masks can still be sneaked in or even made at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew Hilburn|title=Bahrain Bans Import of Protest Masks|url=http://www.thecuttingedgenews.com/index.php?article=79099&amp;pageid=&amp;pagename|website=The Cutting Edge News|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew Hilburn|title=News/Middle East Bahrain Bans Import of Protest Masks|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/bahrain-bans-guy-fawkes-mask-importation/1611885.html|website=Voice of America|accessdate=22 April 2015|date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction===
On September 29, 2013, roughly 50 individuals were tried under the terrorism laws, including many Bahrain Centre of Human Rights members. Among the accused was Al Omran. This case is known as the "February 14th Coalition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The member of the Bahraini national movement:  Al-Khalifa and Al-Saud are frightened from Ayatollah Khamenei’s words |url=http://www.rasanews.ir/en/NSite/FullStory/News/?Id=323 |website=RASA News Agency |accessdate=22 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305045730/http://www.rasanews.ir/en/NSite/FullStory/News/?Id=323 |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Omran was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Scott Lucas|title=Bahrain Special: The 21 Activists Sentenced Today|url=http://www.enduringamerica.com/home/2011/6/22/bahrain-special-the-21-activists-sentenced-today.html|website=EA WorldView|accessdate=22 April 2015|location=EA Middle East and Turkey, Middle East and Iran|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview regarding the court case, [[Maryam al-Khawaja]], who is the President of the Bahrain Centre of Human Rights,  was quoted saying, "There was no due process in the entirety of this case which is why the defendants and their lawyers decided to boycott. From the time that the defendants were abducted, tortured and then sentences, nothing was done according to international standards of a fair trial. If these fifty people were really guilty of a crime, why was the only evidence presented confessions extracted under torture? This was a sham trial with a political verdict, they should be released immediately." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain Court Sentences 50 Defendants, Including Human Rights Defenders, Under Terrorism Law, and Reduces Sentence For Two Police Officers Convicted of Torturing Detainee to Death|url=http://bahrainrights.org/en/node/6418|website=Bahrain Center for Human Rights|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann E. Wehrle''' is an astronomer currently studying black holes and quasars at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, CO. More specifically, she studies energy emission mechanisms from relativistic jets near black holes in quasars and active galactic nuclei.&lt;ref name="Space Science Institute"&gt;[http://www.spacescience.org/about_ssi/staff/wehrle.html], "Space Science Institute." Space Science Institute. Web..&lt;/ref&gt; Ann lives in La Canada Flintridge, CA with her husband and their two children.&lt;ref name="Space Science Institute" /&gt; Ann says that she is fascinated by black holes because they embody the most extreme conditions in the known universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=593], "Peering into the Heart of Galaxies." NASA/JPL. 13 Mar. 2002. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her school career, math and physics were always Wehrle's favorite subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sci.csueastbay.edu/~jseitz/liftoff/activities/pq_activity_guide.pdf], “PlantQuest The Search for Another Earth: Actives for Students." http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov. July 2007. Web. .&lt;/ref&gt; At 17, Ann meet Alma Zook,&lt;ref name="brynmawr" /&gt; a professor of astronomy at Pomona College.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physastro.pomona.edu/people/alma-zook/], Zook, Alma. "Faculty and Staff: Alma Zook." Department of Physics and Astronomy. Pomona College. Web. .&lt;/ref&gt; Because there were very few girls in math and science at the time, meeting Zook was very influential for Wehrle. As of 2016, Zook and Wehlre have collaborated on 13 different publications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alma_Zook], "Alma C. Zook." ResearchGate. 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
: Wehrle is currently a Senior Research Scientist at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, CO, a position she has held since 2006. Prior to this appointment, she was a Research Scientist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).&lt;ref name="Wehrle CV"/&gt;  As of 2016, she has been either an author or a co-author of over 126 publications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/researcher/6632624_Ann_Wehrle], "A. E. Wehrle." ResearchGate.com. 2016. Web..&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, NASA appointed Wehrle to the Science Team of the Space Interferometry Mission, since renamed SIM PlanetQuest, as a principal investigator for one of the mission's 10 key science projects. She was the only women to be appointed principal investigator.&lt;ref name="brynmawr"&gt;[http://www.brynmawr.edu/sandt/2008_february/galaxies.shtml], Wright, Dorothy.

'''Benjamin Jonson''' (''c''. 11 June 1572 – ''c''. 16 August 1637&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bland|first=Mark|date=2004|title=Ben Jonson and the Legacies of the Past|jstor=10.1525/hlq.2004.67.3.371|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|volume=67|pages=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English playwright, poet, actor, and literary critic, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the [[comedy of humours]]. He is best known for the [[satire|satirical]] plays ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Jonson, Ben |volume=15 |pages=502–507 |first=Adolphus William |last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1598), ''[[Volpone|Volpone, or The Fox]]'' (c. 1606), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610) and ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and for his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[epigram]]matic poetry; he is generally regarded as the second most important English playwright during the reign of [[James VI and I]] after [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|306058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonson was a [[Classics|classically educated]], well-read and cultured man of the [[English Renaissance]] with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the [[Jacobean era]] (1603–1625) and of the [[Caroline era]] (1625–1642).&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"&gt;"Ben Jonson", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 10, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StewartHarp2000"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Robert C |year=2000 |editor=Harp, Richard |editor2=Stewart, Stanley |title=The Cambridge companion to Ben Jonson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-64678-2 |pages=189–202 |chapter=Jonson's critical heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Westminster School]] master [[William Camden]] cultivated the artistic genius of Ben Jonson.]]

[[File:Attributed to Abraham van Blijenberch - William Drummond of Hawthornden, 1585 - 1649. Poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Scottish poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] was friend and confidant to Jonson.]]
In midlife, Jonson claimed that his paternal grandfather, who 'served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the extended Johnston family of [[Annandale]] in the [[Dumfries and Galloway|Dumfries and Galloway]], a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles ([[rhombus|rhombi]]) in the Jonson family [[coat of arms]]: one spindle is a diamond-shaped [[Heraldry|heraldic]] device used by the Johnston family. 

Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and suffered [[forfeiture (law)|forfeiture]] under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]; having become a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's mother married a master [[bricklayer]] two years later.&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"&gt;Robert Chambers, Book of Days&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, pp. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson attended school in [[St Martin's Lane]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Later, a family friend paid for his studies at [[Westminster School]], where the [[antiquarian]], historian, [[topographer]] and [[officer of arms]], [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) was one of his masters. In the event, the pupil and the master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and [[style (fiction)|literary style]] remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.

On leaving Westminster School, Jonson was to have attended the [[University of Cambridge]], to continue his book learning but did not, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather.&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"/&gt; According to the churchman and historian [[Thomas Fuller]] (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in [[Lincoln's Inn]]. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Ben Jonson went to the [[Netherlands]] and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of [[Francis Vere]] (1560–1609) in [[Flanders]].

The ''Hawthornden Manuscripts'' (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in [[single combat]], and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier.&lt;ref name=Hawthornden&gt;{{Cite book |last=Drummond |first=William |year=1619 |title=Heads of a Conversation betwixt the Famous Poet Ben Johnson and William Drummond of Hawthornden, January 1619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubHPBcMk2OMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22William+Drummond%22+jonson&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=S0PASPT7GY-2iwGjjPTsDQ&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA43,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, Jonson was the protagonist “Hieronimo” (Geronimo) in the play ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (ca. 1586), by [[Thomas Kyd]] (1558–94), the first [[revenge tragedy]] in English literature. Moreover, by 1597, he was a working playwright employed by [[Philip Henslowe]], the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Kyd", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 11, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his marriage Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as "a shrew, yet honest". The identity of Jonson's wife has always been obscure, yet she sometimes is identified as "Ann Lewis", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of [[St Magnus-the-Martyr]], near [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the family of Anne Lewis and Ben Jonson, the St. Martin's Church registers indicate that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. Then a decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of [[Bubonic plague]] when he was seven years old; to lament and honour the dead boy, Benjamin Jonson ''père'' wrote the elegiac ''[[On My First Sonne]]'' (1603). Moreover, 32 years later, a second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. In that period, Ann Lewis and Ben Jonson lived separate lives for five years; their matrimonial arrangement cast Ann Lewis as the housewife Jonson, and Ben Jonson as the artist who enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Sir Robert Townshend and Lord Aubigny, [[Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"/&gt;

==Career==
By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the [[Admiral's Men]], then performing under [[Philip Henslowe]]'s management at [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[John Aubrey]] reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was evidently more valuable to the company as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=Fredson T.|title=Ben Jonson the Actor|journal=Studies in Philology|date=July 1937|volume=34|issue=3|pages=392–406|jstor=4172372|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] in his ''Palladis Tamia'' as one of "the best for tragedy."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', may be his earliest surviving play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miola|first=Robert S.|year=2012|title=The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|chapter=The Case Is Altered, Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1597 a play which he co-wrote with [[Thomas Nashe]], ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'', was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen [[Elizabeth I]]'s so-called interrogator, [[Richard Topcliffe]]. Jonson was jailed in [[Marshalsea Prison]] and charged with "Leude and mutynous behaviour", while Nashe managed to escape to [[Great Yarmouth]]. Two of the actors, [[Gabriel Spenser]] and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in [[Newgate Prison]], for killing Gabriel Spenser in a [[duel]] on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields&lt;ref name=Hawthornden/&gt; (today part of [[Hoxton]]). Tried on a charge of [[manslaughter]], Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by [[benefit of clergy]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief bible verse (the [[neck-verse]]), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded on his left thumb.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father [[Thomas Wright (writer)|Thomas Wright]], a [[Jesuit]] priest.&lt;ref name="ID2008"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Donaldson |first=Ian |year=2008 |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |chapter=Benjamin Jonson (1572–1637) |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which [[George Chapman]] had begun with ''[[An Humorous Day's Mirth]]''. [[William Shakespeare]] was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', a pedantic attempt to imitate [[Aristophanes]]. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of [[Elizabeth I]]'s reign was marked by fighting and controversy. ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' was produced by the [[Children of the Chapel]] Royal at [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in 1600. It satirised both [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in ''[[Histriomastix (play)|Histriomastix]]'', and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. Jonson attacked the two poets again in ''[[Poetaster (play)|Poetaster]]'' (1601). Dekker responded with ''[[Satiromastix]]'', subtitled "the untrussing of the humorous poet".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

This "[[War of the Theatres]]" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a [[procession|pageant]] welcoming [[James I of England|James I]] to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated ''The Malcontent'' to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gossett|first1=Suzanne|title=Marston, Collaboration, and "Eastward Ho!"|journal=Renaissance Drama|date=2004|volume=33|pages=181–200|jstor=41917391|accessdate=|series=New series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal patronage==
At the beginning of the English reign of [[James VI and I]] in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for [[masque]]s and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Anne of Denmark]]. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland|Elizabeth Sidney]] (daughter of [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]]) and [[Lady Mary Wroth]]. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the [[country house poems|country house poem]] ''To [[Penshurst Place|Penshurst]]''.

In February 1603 [[John Manningham]] reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of [[Roger Townshend (died 1590)|Sir Roger Townshend]], and "scorns the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Donaldson|2011|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] about ''[[Sejanus His Fall|Sejanus]]'', a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] conspirators. After the plot's discovery he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and the [[Privy Council]]. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt; (Teague, 249).
[[File:Jonson 1616 folio Workes title page.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of ''The Workes of Beniamin Ionson'' (1616), the first [[Folio (printing)|folio]] publication that included stage plays]]
At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. ''[[The Entertainment at Althorp|The Satyr]]'' (1603) and ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'' (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at [[Apethorpe Palace]] when the King was in residence. ''The Masque of Blackness'' was praised by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.

On many of these projects he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer [[Inigo Jones]]. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]'' performed at [[Whitehall]] on 1 January 1611 in which [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]], eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.

In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 [[Mark (money)|marks]] (about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first [[Poet Laureate]]. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: [[Ben Jonson folios]])

On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the great north road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884139272|title=Ben Jonson's walk to Scotland : an annotated edition of the 'foot voyage'|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Loxley, James, 1968-, Groundwater, Anna,, Sanders, Julie, 1968-|year=|isbn=9781107003330|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=94, 96|oclc=884139272}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; sited on the [[River Esk, Lothian|River Esk]]. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was "a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

On returning to England, he was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] [[academic degree|degree]] from Oxford University.

The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy ''[[Catiline His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and the comedies ''[[Volpone]]'' (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]'' (1609), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), ''[[Bartholomew Fayre: A Comedy|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' (1616).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ''The Alchemist'' and ''Volpone'' were immediately successful. Of ''Epicoene'', Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet ''Epicoene'', along with ''Bartholomew Fair'' and (to a lesser extent) ''The Devil is an Ass'' have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.

==Religion==
Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous [[Protestant]] landowner until the reign of "[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s accession he was freed and was able to travel to London to become a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 56)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riggs (1989: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; (All that's known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to [[St Martin-in-the-Fields#Medieval and Tudor|St Martin-in-the-Fields]] parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at [[Westminster School]], then part of [[Westminster Abbey]].

Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 176)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R51&gt;Riggs (1989: 51–52)&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in [[Newgate Prison|Newgate Gaol]] charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a [[Jesuit]] priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England.&lt;ref name=D134&gt;Donaldson (2011: 134–140)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp; Stewart (2000: xiv)&lt;/ref&gt; Wright, although placed under [[house arrest]] on the orders of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons.&lt;ref name="D134" /&gt; It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal [[Absolution#Roman Catholic Church|
absolution]] that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="R51" /&gt; Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 143)&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.

Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play ''[[Sejanus His Fall|Sejanus]]'' was banned for "[[Papist|popery]]", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut.&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt; In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the [[Consistory Court]] in London to answer a charge of [[recusancy]], with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to "seduce" citizens to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 229)&lt;/ref&gt; This was a serious matter (the [[Gunpowder Plot]] was still fresh in mind) but he explained that his failure to take [[Eucharist|communion]] was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (65p) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maxwell |first=Julie |year=2010 |editor=Sanders, Julie |title=Ben Jonson in context |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=978-0-521-89571-2 |page=231 |chapter=Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading church figures, including [[John Overall (bishop)|John Overall]], [[Dean of St Paul's]], were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.&lt;ref name=D228&gt;Donaldson (2011: 228–9)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1610 [[Henry IV of France]] was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=Anita |year=1995 |author2=Dickerman, Edmund |title=Mind of an Assassin: Ravaillac and the Murder of Henri IV of France |journal=Canadian Journal of History |location=Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |volume=30 |pages=201–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=D272&gt;Donaldson (2011: 272)&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of [[communion wine]] at the [[eucharist]] to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Morrill (historian)|Jon Morrill]], quoted in Donaldson (2011: 487)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R177&gt;Riggs (1989: 177)&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of the ceremony is unknown.&lt;ref name=D272/&gt; However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=van den Berg |first=Sara |editor=Harp, Richard |editor2=Stewart, Stanley |title=The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-64678-2 |page=10 |chapter=True relation: the life and career of Ben Jonson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and death==
Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well known.  In that time, rose to the prominence the [[Sons of Ben (literary group)|Sons of Ben]] or the "[[Tribe of Ben]]" - those younger poets such as [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Lovelace]], and [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]] who took their bearing in verse from Jonson. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s England. ''[[The Staple of News]]'', for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of ''[[The New Inn]]''; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (the ''Ode to Myself''), which in turn prompted [[Thomas Carew]], one of the "Tribe of Ben," to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a [[English units of wine casks#Tierce|tierce]] of wine and beer.

Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, ''The Sad Shepherd''. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into [[pastoral]] drama. During the early 1630s he also conducted a correspondence with [[James Howell]], who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.

Jonson died on or around 16 August 1637, and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by 'all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in [[Westminster Abbey]], with the inscription "O Rare Ben Johnson ''[sic]''" set in the slab over his grave.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCWA&gt;{{cite web |title=Monuments &amp; Gravestones: Ben Jonson |work=Westminster Abbey 1065 to today |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |accessdate=26 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107172342/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |archivedate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Aubrey]], in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of [[Great Milton]], [[Oxfordshire]], saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from [[William Davenant]], Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used.&lt;ref name=DCWA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hunt |first=Leigh |date=9 April 1828 |title=Life of Sir William Davenant, with specimens of his poetry |series=The Companion |volume=XIV |page=187 |chapter=His epitaph, and Ben Jonson's |oclc=2853686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Quincy Adams|Adams, J.

It has been claimed that the inscription could be read "Orare Ben Jonson" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of [[Roman Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England) but the carving shows a distinct space between  "O" and "rare".&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stubbs |first=John |date=24 February 2011 |title=Reprobates |publisher=Viking Penguin |location=London |isbn=978-0-670-91753-2 |page=182 |quote=…a plea for the passerby's prayers (the Latin imperative ''orare'')…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Angus |year=2007 |title=Time, space, and motion in the age of Shakespeare |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-02308-6 |page=95 |chapter=Structure of an epitaph |quote=At first sight the words seem clear enough…but some…have believed that the words intended to say, in Latin, "Pray for Ben Jonson"…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's [[Poets' Corner]]. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone.

===Drama===
Apart from two tragedies, ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'', that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for [[boy player]]s, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poet's War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, plot mostly takes second place to variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. [[Thomas Davies (bookseller)|Thomas Davies]] called ''Poetaster'' "a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of [[Augustus Caesar]], [[Maecenas]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Tibullus]], are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment." Another early comedy in a different vein, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.

The comedies of his middle career, from ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' to ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' are for the most part [[city comedy]], with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to ''[[Volpone]]'' to "mix profit with your pleasure". His late plays or "[[dotages]]", particularly ''[[The Magnetic Lady]]'' and ''The Sad Shepherd'', exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan comedy]].

Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the [[folio (printing)|folio]] version of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'': he promises to represent "deeds, and language, such as men do use." He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], he intended to apply those premises with rigour.&lt;ref&gt;Doran, 120ff&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment entailed negations: after ''The Case is Altered'', Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of [[new comedy]]. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and [[jealousy]]. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the [[farce|farcical]] (as [[William Congreve]], for example, judged ''Epicoene''.) He was more diligent in adhering to the [[classical unities]] than many of his peers—although as [[Margaret Cavendish]] noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters, and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.

===Poetry===
[[File:Houghton MS Lowell Autograph File 185, Jonson.jpg|thumb|"Epitaph for Cecilia Bulstrode" manuscript, 1609]]
Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as [[Thomas Campion]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]]. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.

"Epigrams" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson’s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, "[[On My First Sonne]]" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called "lyric poetry." It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the [[sonnet]] form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of "The Forest" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem “[[To Penshurst]]” and the poem “[[To Celia]]” ("Come, my Celia, let us prove") that appears also in ''[[Volpone]]''.

''Underwood'', published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains ''[[A Celebration of Charis]]'', Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; [[Encomium|encomiastic poems]] including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on [[Mary Wroth]]; the ''[[Execration against Vulcan]]'' and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).

==Relationship with Shakespeare==
[[File:Shakespeare and Jonson at the Mermaid Tavern.jpg|thumb|A 19th century engraving illustrating [[Thomas Fuller]]'s story of [[Shakespeare]] and Jonson debating at the "[[Mermaid Tavern]]".]]

There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with [[Shakespeare]], some of which may be true.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and the setting of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare "wanted art" (i.e., lacked skill). Whether Drummond is viewed as accurate or not, the comments fit well with Jonson's well-known theories about literature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In [[s:On Shakespeare|"De Shakespeare Nostrat"]] in ''Timber'', which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was "Would he had blotted a thousand!"{{efn|Jonson's claim is interesting, since early printings of Shakespeare's work suggest that he tended to start a scene before giving up and trying again. His failure to cross the original attempts out left his printers unsure what needed to be deleted, though also allowed an insight into his creative process.}} However, Jonson explains, "He was, indeed, honest and of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dscv10h.htm#footnote11 Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson concludes that "there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned." Also when Shakespeare died, he said, "He was not of an age, but for all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pogue |first1=Kate Emery |year=2006 |title=Shakespeare's Friends |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oy29eyCMNycC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22praised+than+to+be+pardoned%22+%22age+but+for+all+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22praised%20than%20to%20be%20pardoned%22%20%22age%20but%20for%20all%20time%22&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Praeger |page=99 |isbn=0275989569 |access-date=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Fuller]] relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the [[Mermaid Tavern]]; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' and ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]'') Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's [[First Folio]]. This poem, [[s:To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us|"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us"]], did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite "small Latine, and lesse Greeke",&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Baldwin [https://web.archive.org/web/20060904145150/http://durer.press.uiuc.edu/baldwin/vol.1/html/2.html 's ''William Shakspere's Smalle Latine and Lesse Greeke'', 1944]&lt;/ref&gt; had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:
:Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,
:My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.

Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the "Sweet Swan of Avon", the "Soul of the Age!" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the [[First Folio]], and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Reception and influence==
Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Henry, Introduction to ''Discoveries Made Upon Men and Matter and Some Poems'' 1892 kindle ebook 2011 ASIN B004TOT8FQ&lt;/ref&gt; Before the English Civil War, the "Tribe of Ben" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of "humour characters" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. [[John Aubrey]] wrote of Jonson in "[[Brief Lives]]." By 1700 Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.

In 2012, after more than two decades of research, [[Cambridge University Press]] published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9423214/Why-should-William-Shakespeare-have-the-last-word-over-Ben-Jonson.html|title=Why should William Shakespeare have the last word over Ben Jonson?|date=24 July 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama===
As G. E. Bentley notes in ''Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared'', Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]]'s, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance dramatists]]. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in ''Timber'', and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.

For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] drew the same comparison in his [[commonplace book]] later in the century.

At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. [[Charles de Saint-Évremond]] placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and [[Charles Gildon]] called Jonson the father of English comedy. [[John Dryden]] offered a more common assessment in the "Essay of Dramatic Poesie," in which his [[Avatar]] Neander compares Shakespeare to [[Homer]] and Jonson to [[Virgil]]: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But "artifice" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with "art"; Jonson, for instance, used "artificer" as a synonym for "artist" (''Discoveries,'' 33). For [[Lewis Theobald]], too, Jonson "ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,” in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of ''Every Man in his Humour'' to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, [[Edward Young]] casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, [[Aphra Behn]], writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from [[Sallust]] and [[Cicero]], [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his [[aesthetic]] judgment.

In this period, [[Alexander Pope]] is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: "It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Johnson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Johnson wanted both."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Pope, ed. ''Works of Shakespeare'' (London, 1725), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, [[Sarah Fielding]] could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a "man of sense" encountered by David Simple.

Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg]] translated parts of [[Peter Whalley (clergyman)|Peter Whalley]]'s edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, [[Edward Capell]] offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) "has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Craig, D. H., ed. ''Jonson: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1995). p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The disastrous failures of productions of ''Volpone'' and ''Epicoene'' in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Earl Camden]] and [[William Gifford]], he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.

The [[Romanticism|romantic]] revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's "laborious caution." Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: “He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.” Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as [[Thomas Middleton]] or [[John Heywood]], who were in some senses "discoveries" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; [[William Gifford]], Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], who was more interested in Jonson than most [[Victorians]], wrote, "The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance” – by “fragrance,” Swinburne means spontaneity.

In the 20th century, Jonson’s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in ''The Sacred Wood'', [[T. S. Eliot]] attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his "surface", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by [[E. E. Stoll]] and [[M. C. Bradbrook]], provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.

The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived [[New Historicism|sociopolitical criticism]]. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of [[patronage]] and in the rising culture of mass consumption.

===Poetry===
Jonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael, ''Lives of the Poets'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 1998 {{ISBN|9780753807453}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of [[John Donne]]. In this comparison, Jonson represents the [[Cavalier poet|cavalier]] strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the [[Metaphysical poets|metaphysical]] school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, [[baroque]] metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison ([[Herbert Grierson]] for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.

In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian [[Edmund Bolton]] named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the "father" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his "sons" or his "tribe". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]] described meetings at "the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of [[wit]]. In these respects Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English [[Augustan literature|neoclassicism]].

The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: "[[On My First Sonne]]"; "[[To Celia]]"; "[[To Penshurst]]"; and the [[epitaph]] on Salomon Pavy, a [[boy player]]  abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.

It is in Jonson's ''Timber, or Discoveries...'' that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:

{{quote|Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man’s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.|Ben Jonson, 1640 (posthumous)&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, B., "Discoveries and Some Poems," Cassell &amp; Company, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'' (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: ''Richard Crookback'' (1602); ''Hot Anger Soon Cold'' (1598), with Porter and [[Henry Chettle]]; ''Page of Plymouth'' (1599), with Dekker; and ''Robert II, King of Scots'' (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: ''The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors'' (1607); ''The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I'' (1608); and ''The May Lord'' (1613–19).

Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy|Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother]]'', a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy ''[[The Widow (play)|The Widow]]'' was printed in 1652 as the work of [[Thomas Middleton]], Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as ''[[The London Prodigal]]'', have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 82–92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard R. LeBlanc''' (born 1949) is a [[politician]] in the [[province (Canada)|province]] of [[New Brunswick]], Canada. He was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] in the [[New Brunswick general election, 2006|2006 election]] as the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal]] MLA for the new district of [[Memramcook-Lakeville-Dieppe]].

He was appointed to [[Executive Council of New Brunswick|cabinet]] on November 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/ex/2008e1667ex.htm Premier announces additions/changes to cabinet]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2010, LeBlanc resigned from cabinet, amid allegations that an email he sent violated the privacy rights of a Fredericton-area woman by revealing private information about her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/n-b-justice-minister-resigns-over-privacy-issue-1.899402 "N.B. justice minister resigns over privacy issue"].

In 1999 Utemuratov was a member of The Bureau of the Economic Commission for Europe ([[UNECE]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/press/pr1999/99gen4e.htm|title=Press Releases 1999|website=www.unece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Bulat Utemuratov has been the President of the [[Kazakhstan Tennis Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktf.kz/?m=article&amp;id_rod=80&amp;lng=eng|title=Kazakhstan Tennis Federation -|website=www.ktf.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public and charity activity ==

In the frame of his mandate of President of the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation, Bulat Utemuratov has developed various charity associations in relation with this sport for Kazakh youth. Upon his initiative, the “Team Kazakhstan” tennis Academy was created specifically to train promising players of the national tennis team. Since 2010, Kazakhstan is regularly ranked among the world's top tennis nations. 
From September 2015, Utemuratov has been a board member of the [[International Tennis Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itftennis.com/news/215120.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the International Tennis Federation and [[Asian Tennis Federation]] awarded Bulat Utemuratov for transcendent merit in the development of tennis in the region&lt;ref&gt;http://asiantennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Newsletter-November_ATF-AGM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 he founded the Private Charity Fund of Bulat Utemuratov&lt;ref&gt;http://utemuratovfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been a
member of the Board of Trustees ever since. The main goal of the Fund is working towards the
healthy development of autistic children and providing adequate child support.

== Entrepreneurial activity ==
Bulat Utemuratov is one of the most prolific entrepreneurs of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; His first large project was the development of the “ATF Bank” and its successful sale to [[UniCredit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-09/kazakh-billionaire-said-to-consider-bid-for-alliance-temirbank|title=Kazakh Billionaire Said to Weigh Bid as State Sells Banks|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from 1995 until November 2007). During that time, the bank grew from a small financial institution to a large multi-regional and multi-product financial group with 160 branches. 
After the 2009 crisis, the following banks were created: Kassa Nova, the first microcredit bank in Kazakhstan and ForteBank, a business bank. In May 2014, Samruk-Kazyna SWF closed a sale of its shares in Temirbank and part of its shares in Aliance Bank to businessman Bulat Utemuratov.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">'''Charles L. Meach, III''' (1948–2004) was a [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]] [[United States of America|American]] [[murderer]] who killed five people in [[Alaska]].

He was born in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], to a mother who battled with [[schizophrenia]]. He left home at sixteen to travel and accumulated a long record of minor crimes.&lt;ref name="brennan2001"&gt;Brennan, Tom. Murder at 40 Below: True Crime Stories from Alaska. [[Epicenter Press]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his way to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], and in 1973 he beat 22-year-old Robert Johnson who worked as a grocery clerk to death in Earthquake Park.&lt;ref name="brennan2001" /&gt; He was charged with murder and found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital in California. In 1980 psychiatrists decided that his illness was in remission and he was returned to Alaska under the supervision of the [[Alaska Psychiatric Institute]]. On May 3, 1982, he shot four teenagers to death in [[Russian Jack Springs Park]]; two 19-year-old boys while robbing their campsite and two 16-year-old girls who came to investigate the gunshots.&lt;ref name="turner1982"&gt;Wallace Turner (June 22, 1982). [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/us/new-law-on-insanity-plea-stirs-dispute-in-alaska.html "New law on insanity plea stirs dispute in Alaska".] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Toomey (1990). "MURDERS CAUSED DEEP PUBLIC, PRIVATE CHANGES". Anchorage Daily News.&lt;/ref&gt; He confessed to the killings when confronted and was charged.&lt;ref&gt;"Mental patient admits shootings". ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]'', 5/8/1982.&lt;/ref&gt; He again pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but was convicted and sentenced to 396 years in prison without the possibility of parole &amp;mdash; the longest sentence in the state's history.&lt;ref&gt;"Multiple Murders Shake Alaska's Idyllic Linage". ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'', Mar 31, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the shootings, the [[Alaska Legislature]] revised the criminal statutes on the sentencing of the mentally ill, providing for a new verdict "guilty, but mentally ill" where the convicted will serve their time in a mental institution until deemed healthy, then be transferred to prison for the rest of their sentence. This revision did not apply to Meach's trial, though.&lt;ref name="turner1982" /&gt; The legislature also narrowed the definition of insanity and tightened the burden of proof for the basic [[insanity defense]]. This resulted in Alaska having one of the most strict conditions for the insanity defense of all the US states.&lt;ref&gt;DeBusk, Suzan E. "Alaska's Insanity Defense and the Guilty but Mentally Ill Verdict." Alaska L. Rev. 4 (1987): 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of natural causes on December 9, 2004 in the [[Cook Inlet]] jail.&lt;ref&gt;Shelia Toomey (December 10, 2004). "Murderer dies in city jail cell". ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cornelius Rea Agnew''' (August 8, 1830 – April 18, 1888) was an American [[surgeon]].&lt;ref name="AMB"&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Agnew, Cornelius Rea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnew was born in [[New York City]], the son of William Agnew and Elizabeth Thompson Agnew. He graduated from [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] in 1849, and from the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in 1852. That same year, he was appointed surgeon-general of [[New York State]]. He began to practice medicine in 1854, and served as a surgeon at the Ear and Eye Infirmary in New York City from 1855 through 1864. In 1856, he married Mary Nash.

During the [[American Civil War]], he was medical director of the New York Volunteer Hospital, treating wounded soldiers from the [[Union army]]. He was prominent in the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], which administered supplies and medical assistance to the field armies.

After the war, he assisted in establishing the [[Columbia School of Mines]] in 1864. He then founded the [[Brooklyn Eye and Ear Hospital]] in 1868 and the [[Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital|Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital]] in 1869. He served as a professor of diseases of the eye and ear through 1888 until his death that year in New York City.

His papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/agnew272|title=Cornelius Rea Agnew Papers 1857-1888|publisher= National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kearny attended [[TMI — The Episcopal School of Texas|Texas Military Institute]] in the 1930s, where he became the commanding officer of the cadet corps, a champion runner and rifle shot, and [[valedictorian]] of his class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junglesnafus.com/page2.html Page Title&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Mercersburg Academy]] in Pennsylvania before earning a degree in [[civil engineering]] at [[Princeton University]], graduating [[Latin honors|summa cum laude]] in 1937.  He won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and went on to earn two degrees in [[geology]] at the [[University of Oxford]].  During the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudeten Crisis]] he acted as a courier for an underground group helping [[German Resistance|anti-Nazis]] escape from [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="oism.org"&gt;[http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p909.htm About the Author - Nuclear War Survival Skills&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation from Oxford, Kearny joined a [[Royal Geographical Society]] expedition in the [[Peru]]vian [[Andes]]. He then worked as an exploration geologist for [[Standard Oil]] in the [[Orinoco]] jungles of [[Venezuela]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homelandcivildefense.org/view/homelandcivildefense/s141p1522.htm Cresson Kearny - Homeland Civil Defense&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; where he became familiar with equipment and tools of the native inhabitants of the region.&lt;ref name="Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 8-9"&gt;Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 8-9, 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He later used the information gained from this experience to develop specialized jungle equipment for U.S. military forces.&lt;ref name="Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 8-9"/&gt;

In 1940, Kearny went on active duty as an infantry reserve lieutenant in the [[United States Army]].  Recognized for his knowledge of jungle travel and use of specialized tools and equipment, Kearny was soon assigned to [[Panama]] as the Jungle Experiments Officer of the Panama Mobile Force, and was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]].&lt;ref&gt;Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  In that capacity he was able to invent, improve, and/or field test much of the specialized jungle equipment and rations used by U.S. infantrymen in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 55, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  Adoption of the [[Jungle ration|jungle field ration]] and the jungle [[hammock]] as standard equipment by the US Army in World War II is credited to Kearny, along with improvements to many other items of tropical gear, such as the Panama-soled [[jungle boot]] and the [[Machete|M1942 Machete]].&lt;ref&gt;Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 95, 244-45, 289&lt;/ref&gt;  In recognition of his service, he was soon promoted to [[Major (United States)#Army|major]] and awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].&lt;ref name="oism.org"/&gt;

In 1943, he married May Willacy Eskridge of [[San Antonio]].&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

Kearny later volunteered for duty with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), where he served as a [[demolition]] specialist in southern [[China]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="oism.org"/&gt;  As [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces threatened to overwhelm Chinese defenses in southeast China, he walked night and day to escape capture.  After contracting a serious [[Virus|viral]] disease during that [[Second Sino-Japanese War|campaign]], he was bedridden for many months and partially crippled for several years.  After a long convalescence, he retired from active duty with the U.S. Army.

In 1961 he took a position doing civil defense research with the [[Hudson Institute]]. In 1964 he joined the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] civil defense project.  During the [[Vietnam War]], Kearny served as a civilian advisor to the U.S. Army, making several trips to the theater of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute (1996), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the supporting research that went into his most famous work, [[Nuclear War Survival Skills]] (NWSS), was conducted during the 1970s. Including a study on how the US might be affected by a potential nuclear war from the [[Sino-Soviet split]], specifically focusing on the question; what would be the severity and how might the US deal with contamination of [[CONUS]] milk supplies that might result from the "trans-[[pacific]]" nuclear [[fallout]] that would originate over China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osti.gov/scitech/search/author:%22Kearny,%20C.H.%22 A list of Kearny publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other more long-term survival publications such as "Maintaining nutritional adequacy during a prolonged food crisis [Basic foods for post-nuclear attack use]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/5968023-maintaining-nutritional-adequacy-during-prolonged-food-crisis-basic-foods-post-nuclear-attack-use Maintaining nutritional adequacy during a prolonged food crisis. [Basic foods for post-nuclear attack use]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 2003.

In a ''New York Times'' obituary, his daughter Stephanie commented: "Throughout his life he believed in being prepared for trouble."&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Published work==
Kearny's most notable work is ''Nuclear War Survival Skills'' (NWSS).  It describes [[civil defense]] research to determine the methods for ordinary citizens to build effective expedient [[Fallout shelter|shelters]] in a short period of time.  It includes "[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]-like" plans for the [[Kearny air pump]] (KAP), [[Kearny fallout meter]] (KFM) and [[Blast shelter|blast doors]] designed to be published in a newspaper prior to an attack.  This book is in the public domain and is available for purchase, as well as free download online, from the [[Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine]].

His other works include ''Jungle Snafus ... and Remedies'', a book on the history of development of specialized equipment for use by military forces in jungle regions, and ''Will Civil Defense Work?''

[[File:Arms of David de Brechin, Lord Brechin (d.1320).svg|thumb|250px|Coat of arms of the Lord of Brechin]]
'''Sir David de Brechin''' (died 1320) was a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] knight who fought on both sides during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]].

==Life==
He was the son of Sir William de Brechin by Elena Comyn, daughter of [[Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan]] and Elizabeth de Quincy. Sir William was the son of Henry, an illegitimate son of [[David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Archie Duncan (historian)|A. A. M. Duncan]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3306 Brechin, Sir David (b. before 1278, d. 1320)], in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Brechin is first attested to as a ward of a Sir John de Callendar in 1292.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun02pauluoft#page/218/mode/2up Balfour Paul, vol ii, p 218]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brechin fought in the [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]]'s army at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]], and was granted lands previously owned by [[Alan Durward]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun02pauluoft#page/218/mode/2up Balfour Paul, vol ii, p 218]&lt;/ref&gt;

He name appears twice on the 1296 [[Ragman Rolls]] for [[Forfarshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/198/mode/2up Cal. Doc. Scot. vol. ii, pp 199,209]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the train of [[Robert the Bruce]], he was present at Peebles when the Bruce, [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]], and [[William Lamberton]] were sworn in as [[Guardians of Scotland]]. Brechin returned to Galloway with Bruce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/524/mode/2up Cal. Doc. Scot. vol ii, p 525]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1301, Sir David was still active in south western Scotland. On 8 September Brechin was in a force led by [[John de Soules (died 1310)|Sir John de Soulis]] and [[Ingram de Umfraville|Sir Ingram de Umfraville]], that attacked [[Lochmaben Castle]], and was wounded in the fight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/documentsillust03stevgoog#page/n455/mode/2up Stevenson vol ii, p 432]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brechin returned to English service when he did homage to [[Edward I of England]] at the [[Siege of Stirling Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/410/mode/2up Cal. Doc. Scot. vol ii, p 410]&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing in English service, Brechin was present at the [[Battle of Inverurie (1308)|Battle of Inverurie]], and according to [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], he retired after the battle to [[Brechin Castle]] where he was besieged by [[David II Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl|David Earl of Atholl]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/brusfromacollat00barbgoog#page/n256/mode/2up ''Brus'', pp 198-203]&lt;/ref&gt; However this is contested by the historian and genealogist Sir [[James Balfour Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scotspeeragefoun02pauluoft#page/218/mode/2up Balfour Paul, voll ii, p 219 notes]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 1320, Brechin appended his seal to the [[Declaration of Arbroath]].

At a parliament at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]] (later known as the ''Black Parliament'') in August that year, Brechin was found complicit along with [[William de Soules]], the [[Maol Íosa III, Earl of Strathearn|Countess of Strathearn]] and others in a conspiracy to depose the king.  For this offence Brechin was executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/johannisdefordun02ford#page/340/mode/2up Fordun, p 341]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he may very well have been guilty, his execution surprised some people, as he was seen as a "flower of chivalry", having acquitted himself well in battle against the Saracens in the past.

==Marriages and issue==
Brechin appears to have married Margaret de Bonkyll, widow of [[John Stewart of Bonkyll (d.1298)|Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll]], by 1304 when she is recorded as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/calendarofdocume02grea#page/410/mode/2up ''Cal. Doc. Scot.'' vol ii, pp410-411]&lt;/ref&gt; and had issue.

*Margaret de Brechin, married in 1315 to Sir David de Barclay

David de Brechin appears to have married secondly a Margaret Ramsay.

'''Reverend Deodat Lawson''' was the minister of [[Salem Village]] from 1684 to 1688. He believed that several members of his family may have previously died there under "the malicious operations of the infernal powers". After hearing about the [[Salem witch trials]] in 1692, he returned in March of that year to find out what was happening. His [[courtroom]] observations from March and April were recorded in a 10-page pamphlet entitled ''A Brief and True Narrative of Some Remarkable Passages Relating to Sundry Persons Afflicted by Witchcraft, at Salem Village ''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=witch;cc=witch;rgn=full%20text;idno=wit121;didno=wit121;view=image;seq=00000003;node=wit121%3A3 Cornell University Library Witchcraft Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

Colonel '''Eduardo Abaroa Hidalgo''' (October 13, 1838, [[San Pedro de Atacama]] – March 23, 1879) was [[Bolivia]]'s foremost hero of the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879&amp;ndash;1883), which pitted [[Chile]] against [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. He was one of the leaders of the civilian resistance to the Chilean invasion at the [[Battle of Topáter]].

Abaroa was an engineer by trade, working in a silver mine located in the coastal region of Litoral, which Chile took from Bolivia during the [[War of the Pacific]]. During the [[Battle of Topáter]] (23 March 1879), the first armed clash of the war, Colonel Abaroa was part of a badly outnumbered Bolivian force defending a bridge that crossed the [[Topáter River]] and gave access to the city of [[Calama, Chile|Calama]], an important desert oasis on the road to Bolivia. Refusing to surrender, after the outnumbered Bolivian military forces withdrew, he fought to his last breath, a feat that later transformed him into a revered national hero.

When, injured and surrounded, he was asked to surrender by the Chilean forces, he provided an answer that has gone into Bolivian folklore: "¿Rendirme yo? ¡Que se rinda su abuela, carajo!" ("Surrender? Your grandmother [is who] should surrender, you bastard!", or "Surrender, me? Let your grandmother surrender, dammit!", or, more literally, "Surrender, me? That your grandmother surrender herself, fuck!"), equivalent to saying "Surrender? Surrender my ass!". According to Chilean folklore he answered: "¿Quién, Yo?" ("Who, me?")

==Legacy and critical discussion==
In 1952, on the 73rd anniversary of his death, the Bolivian Government repatriated Abaroa's body, burying it with full honors and in the midst of an impressive crowd (numbering in the tens of thousands) in the popular [[La Paz]] square that bears the hero's name. Plaza Abaroa (''Abaroa Square'') also contains a large bronze statue of the Bolivian martyr, presented in full pose and defiance, as he would have looked the moment before his death. His country honored him with a series of stamps (Scott#365-370 and C157-162). The stamps quoted his last words, eliding ''"carajo"'' with an [[ellipsis]].

[[Eduardo Abaroa Province]] is named in his honor, as is [[Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve]]. The anniversary of Abaroa's heroic death (March 23) is the national holiday in Bolivia ''Día del mar''.

'''Edwin Washington Edwards''' (born August 7, 1927) is an American politician and member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] who served as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|LA|7}} from 1965 to 1972 and as the 50th [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor of Louisiana]] for four terms (1972–1980, 1984–1988 and 1992–1996), twice as many elected terms as any other [[Louisiana]] chief executive. He served a total of 16 years in office, the sixth-longest serving gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,784 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2013/04/10/the-top-50-longest-serving-gov/ |title= The Top 50 Longest-Serving Governors of All Time |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date= April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colorful, powerful, and legendary figure in Louisiana politics, Edwards, who has been dubbed the "very last of the line of [[New Deal]] [[Southern Democrats]]",&lt;ref name=laststand&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/edwin-edwards-louisiana-2014-elections-105563.html|title=Edwin Edwards’ last stand|publisher=Politico |date=April 10, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2014 | author=Bill Nichols}}&lt;/ref&gt; was long dogged by charges of [[political corruption|corruption]]. In 2001, he was found guilty of [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] charges and sentenced to ten years in federal prison. Edwards began serving his sentence in October 2002 in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and was later transferred to the federal facility in [[Oakdale, Louisiana]]. He was released from federal prison in January 2011, having served eight years. He was released from probation in 2013.

==Early life and career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2009}}
Edwin Washington Edwards was born in rural [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles Parish]], near [[Marksville, Louisiana|Marksville]]. His father, Clarence Edwards, was a half-French Creole{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[Presbyterian]] [[sharecropping|sharecropper]], while his mother, the former Agnès Brouillette, was a [[French language|French]]-speaking Catholic. Edwards' ancestors were among early Louisiana colonists from France who eventually settled in Avoyelles Parish, referred to as the original French Creoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avoyelles.com |title=Avoyelles Family Name Origins |last1=DeCuir |first1=Randy |date=September 12, 1996 |access-date=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards, like many 20th century politicians from Avoyelles, assumed that he had Cajun ancestry, when in fact he may have had none. His father was descended from a family in [[Kentucky]], who came to Louisiana during the [[American Civil War]]. His great-great-grandfather, William Edwards, was killed in Marksville at the beginning of the American Civil War because of his pro-Union sentiment.&lt;ref name="William Edwards"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/13/news/funeral-lieut-dekay-disgraceful-exhibitions-rebel-sympathizers-resistance-cotton.html |title=The Funeral of Lieut. Dekay Disgraceful Exhibitions by the Rebel Sympathizers Resistance to Cotton-Burning-Shameful Outrages-Louisiana in a State of Auarchy. |date=July 13, 1862 |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoyelles Parish has been known for colorful politicians; another who stood out, [[F.O. "Potch" Didier]], actually spent seven days in his own jail after being convicted of [[malfeasance]] in office during his own heated reelection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070318/COMMUNITIES/703160358 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209123227/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070318/COMMUNITIES/703160358 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |title=Philip Timothy, "Ex-governor [Edwin Washington Edwards] tops list of colorful parish politicians" |work=[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|The Town Talk]], March 18, 2007 |accessdate=December 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Edwards had planned on a career as a preacher. As a young man, he did some preaching for the Marksville [[Church of the Nazarene]]. He served briefly in the [[U.S. Navy Air Corps]] near the end of [[World War II]]. After his return from the military, he graduated at the age of twenty-one from [[Louisiana State University Law Center]] and began practicing law in [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]], the seat of [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia Parish]]. He relocated there in 1949 after his sister, Audrey E. Isbell, who had moved there with her husband, told him there were few French-speaking attorneys in the southwestern Louisiana community.

Edwards' career was thus helped by his being bilingual and articulate in both [[English language|English]] and [[Cajun French]]. He learned to cultivate the goodwill of the media, working reporters and editorial page editors. One of his favorites was [[Adras LaBorde]], longtime managing editor of the ''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]'' in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. LaBorde even influenced Edwards in regard to environmental policy.

Edwards entered politics through election to the Crowley City Council in 1954.&lt;ref name=returnguv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/return-of-the-guv-20140711 |title=Return of the Guv |work=National Journal |author=Eric Benson |date=July 12, 2014 |accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] which, in that era, had a monopoly on public offices in Louisiana, but which fell out of favor in the late 20th century. Edwards remained on the Crowley council until his election to the [[Louisiana State Senate]] in 1964; in that race he defeated in a major political upset in the Democratic primary the incumbent [[Bill Cleveland]], a Crowley businessman who had served for twenty years in both houses of the Louisiana legislature. Years later as governor, Edwards appointed Cleveland's daughter, Willie Mae Fulkerson (1924–2009), a former member of the Crowley City Council, to the Louisiana Board of Prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geesey-ferguson.com/memsol.cgi?user_id=786248|title=Willie Mae Cleveland Fulkerson Life Legacy|publisher=geesey-ferguson.com|date=September 15, 2009|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in the state Senate for less than two years as a floor leader for Governor [[John McKeithen]], Edwards was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Louisiana's 7th congressional district]], a position that he held from 1965 until 1972. He won the congressional seat in a [[special election]] called when the incumbent, [[T. Ashton Thompson]] of [[Ville Platte, Louisiana|Ville Platte]], was killed in an automobile accident near [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Edwards was easily reelected to three full terms in the House in 1966, 1968 and 1970.

In 1968, he defeated Republican Vance William Plauché (1924–2013) of Lake Charles, son of former one-term Democratic Congressman [[Vance Plauché|Vance Gabriel Plauché]], who was also a native of Avoyelles Parish. Edwards received more than 80 percent of the [[general election]] vote. While in Congress, Edwards served on the Public Works, Judiciary, and Internal Security committees. In 1970, he was one of the few Southern congressmen to support the extension for five years of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

==1971–1972 campaign for governor==

In the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1971-72|election of 1971–1972]], Edwards won the governorship after finishing first in a field of seventeen candidates in the Democratic primary, including the final race of former governor [[Jimmie Davis]] and [[Gillis William Long|Gillis Long]], a relative of Huey Long. His greatest support came from southern Louisiana, particularly among its large numbers of Cajun, Creole, and [[African-American]] voters. In the first primary, Edwards led with 276,397 (23.8 percent). [[J. Bennett Johnston|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]]., a state senator from [[Shreveport]], followed with 208,830 (17.8 percent). In third place was former Congressman Gillis Long of Alexandria, with 164,276 (14 percent). Former Governor Jimmie Davis finished fourth with 138,756 (11.8 percent). Far to the rear of the pack was Congressman [[Speedy O. Long]] of [[Jena, Louisiana|Jena]] in rural [[La Salle Parish]] with only 61,359 (5.2 percent).

Both Edwards and Johnston ran on reform-oriented platforms during the primary, but Edwards was more adept at making political deals and building alliances for the runoff round of voting. Edwards said that the major philosophical difference that he held with Johnston was in regard to their "awareness of problems of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;Leo Honeycutt, ''Edwin Edwards: Governor of Louisiana'', Lisburn Press, 2009, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston won the endorsement of Edwards' legislative colleague, [[Joe D. Waggonner]] of [[Bossier Parish]], but the Shreveport state senator declined to accept Edwards' offer of a televised debate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Honeycutt, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards defeated Johnston in the runoff, 584,262 (50.2 percent) to 579,774 (49.8 percent), less than one vote per precinct. The victory showed that south Louisiana was eclipsing the north in both population and in the future political domination of the state.

On election night, Edwards gave public credit to the African American [[New Orleans]] political organization [[SOUL]] for his extremely narrow victory, stating that the 12,000 vote lead SOUL had bought him in New Orleans had put him over the top. Such public recognition of black political power by a Democratic governor of Louisiana was unprecedented.

In the general election held on February 1, 1972, Edwards faced Republican gubernatorial nominee [[Dave Treen|David C. Treen]], then of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]. He did not run as the candidate who would continue the Democratic policies of his predecessor, John McKeithen, for whom Edwards had been a state senate floor leader. Instead he derided McKeithen as a "[[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] governor who doesn't want the new administration to do well. It'll make him look bad," considering a $30 million budget shortfall facing the next governor.&lt;ref&gt;"Treen Gets Support in State Race", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', January 13, 1972, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the campaign, Edwards repeatedly insisted that Treen had no chance of victory. He said the climate was not right for a Republican governor in Louisiana. He ridiculed Treen as having "never held a public office. He has run for office four times and has been defeated all four times. He can't even generate enough enthusiasm in his home district ([[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]]), where he is best known."&lt;ref name=MPH&gt;"GOP Doesn't Have a Chance, Edwards Says", ''Minden Press-Herald'', January 7, 1972, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He accused Treen of having adopted Edwards' own reform platform characterized as the "Era of Excellence."&lt;ref name=MPH/&gt;

Though Treen ran a vigorous campaign, Louisiana's Democratic tradition favored Edwards from the start, as Edwards had predicted. Edwards polled 641,146 (57.2 percent) to Treen's 480,424 (42.8 percent). Edwards also overcame the south Louisiana "jinx" that had doomed former New Orleans Mayor [[deLesseps Story Morrison|deLesseps Story "Chep" Morrison, Sr.]], in his three gubernatorial bids. Edwards picked up the enthusiastic backing of his runoff rival, J. Bennett Johnston, later a U.S. senator.

One of Edwards' campaign strategists, [[Charles E. Roemer, II]], of [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]], was appointed as the full-time commissioner of administration, a position that Roemer retained from 1972 to 1980. Roemer's son, [[Buddy Roemer]], would serve as governor from 1988 to 1992, sandwiched between the third and fourth Edwards terms.

[[Bill Dodd]], who was defeated for state superintendent of education in the same election cycle that Edwards was winning the governorship for the first time, attributed the Edwards victory in part to political kingmaker [[Louis J. Roussel Jr.]], of New Orleans. According to Dodd, Roussel "can do more than any other individual in Louisiana to elect any candidate he supports for any office in this state.... He is such a good administrator and motivator that he can put together an organization that will win in business and in politics."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Dodd]], ''Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics'' (Baton Rouge: Claitor's Publishing, 1991), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==First two terms as governor, 1972–1980==
Both in his political rhetoric and in his public persona, Edwards cast himself as a Louisiana [[populism|populist]] in the tradition of [[Huey P. Long]] and [[Earl K. Long]].&lt;ref name=laststand/&gt; He was inaugurated as governor on May 9. One of his first acts was to call for a constitutional convention to overhaul Louisiana's bulky charter. Many of the sections on state government were written by delegate [[Robert G. Pugh]], a prominent Shreveport attorney, who became an advisor to Edwards and two other governors thereafter. Voters approved the new constitution by a three-to-two margin in 1974, and government reorganization resulted. For the first time Louisiana operated with a "cabinet style" executive department in lieu of the hundreds of boards and commissions that had existed for decades, each its own fiefdom.

During his first two terms in office, Edwards developed a reputation for being one of the most colorful and flamboyant politicians in the history of a state known for its unorthodox political figures. Charismatic, well-dressed, and quick with clever one-liners and retorts, Edwards maintained wide popularity.

On taking office, Edwards hired [[J. Kelly Nix]] as his executive assistant and in 1974 elevated him to first executive assistant. In the second term, however, Nix left the administration to take office as the Louisiana state school superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapoliticalmuseum.com/inductees.php?viewID=79|title=J. Kelly Nix|publisher=lapoliticalmuseum.com|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dale Thorn]], who had been Edwards' press secretary while he was in Congress, continued in that position for the first and most of the second Edwards terms. He was later associate commissioner of higher education for the [[Louisiana Board of Regents]], and an LSU journalism professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/clarionledger/obituary.aspx?n=jesse-dale-thorn&amp;pid=170968700#sthash.g1JbouVI.dpuf|title=Jesse Dale Thorn|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards also depended heavily on state Senator [[Sixty Rayburn]] of [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]], whose 44-year service earned him the [[sobriquet]] as "Dean of the Louisiana Senate." He also rewarded political friends, such as former legislative colleague [[Fred L. Schiele]], whom he appointed in 1973 to succeed the embattled [[Noah W. Cross]] as [[sheriff]] of [[Concordia Parish]] in eastern Louisiana.

Under Edwards, [[Michael O'Keefe (Louisiana politician)|Michael H. O'Keefe]] of New Orleans in 1976 was named president of the state Senate, an office that was held by the lieutenant governor prior to the implementation of the state Constitution of 1974. In 1983, as Edwards prepared to return to office, O'Keefe was engulfed in scandal and forced to leave the Senate. He was as replaced by the Edwards loyalist, [[Samuel B. Nunez Jr.]], of [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]] in [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]]. In 2013, O'Keefe was still serving time in prison for a 1999 conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Michael&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=O%27Keefe&amp;Race=W&amp;Sex=M&amp;Age=81&amp;x=53&amp;y=26|title=Inmate Locator: Michael O'Keefe, Sr.|publisher=bop.gov|accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and achievements===
[[File:Gerald Ford Edwin Edwards 1976.jpg|right|thumb|Edwards shakes hands with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]], April 1976]]

After enduring three grueling rounds of voting in the 1971–1972 campaign, Edwards pushed a bill through the legislature that limited state elections to two rounds by having Democratic, Republican, and independent candidates run together on the same ballot in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]]. Though the [[jungle primary]] system was intended to benefit Edwards' own political career, many observers cite it as being a major factor in the eventual rise of the state's Republican Party and the creation of a genuinely competitive two-party system. For this, Edwards was facetiously christened "father of Louisiana's Republican Party."

[[William Denis Brown, III]], a lawyer and a state senator from [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], was Edwards's floor leader in the upper legislative chamber in the first term as governor. A native of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] reared on a plantation north of [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]] in [[East Carroll Parish, Louisiana|East Carroll Parish]], Brown was instrumental in drafting the Louisiana Mineral Code. Thereafter from 1980 to 1988, Brown was the chairman of the Louisiana Board of Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thenewsstar/obituary.aspx?n=william-denis-brown&amp;pid=156381763|title=Obituary of William Denis Brown, III|work=''[[The News-Star|Monroe News Star]]''|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the first gubernatorial term, Edwards initiated the creation of the first new Louisiana state constitution in more than a half century. He intended to replace the Constitution of 1921, an unwieldy and outmoded document burdened with hundreds of amendments. A constitutional convention was held in 1973; the resulting document was put into effect in 1975. {{as of|2009}}, the 1973 Constitution remains in effect. Edwards also undertook a major reorganization of the state government, abolishing over 80 state agencies and modeling the remaining structure after that of the federal government.

In his first year in office, Edwards appointed his wife [[Elaine Edwards]], also a native of Avoyelles Parish, to complete the Senate term of the deceased [[Allen J. Ellender]]. Mrs. Edwards served from August–November 1972, and during that time, the small town of Crowley boasted the governor, a U.S. Senator, and a U.S. Representative (former Edwards aide [[John Breaux]]), who all lived within a few blocks of each other.

An outspoken supporter of civil rights, Edwards appointed more blacks and women to high positions in his administration than had his predecessors.

Edwards named State Representative [[J. Burton Angelle]] of [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana|Breaux Bridge]] as his director of the [[Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries]], a key appointment which Angelle filled for Edwards's first three terms of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/politics/state/2015/08/29/angelle-local-guy-long-term-vision/71398046/|title=Angelle: Local guy with a long-term vision|author=Ken Stickney|date=August 29, 2015|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Town Talk]]|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards' tenure in the 1970s coincided with a huge boom in the state's oil and gas industry after the gas pricing crisis of 1973. Edwards was able to greatly expand the state's oil revenues by basing [[severance tax]]es on a percentage of the price of each barrel rather than the former flat rate. This oil money fueled a massive increase in state spending (a 163% increase between 1972 and 1980), and Edwards was able to consistently balance the state budget due to the boom in oil revenue. Much of this increased spending went toward health and human services program and increased funding for vocational-technical schools and higher education.

Edwards easily won reelection in 1975, with 750,107 votes (62.3 percent). In second place was Democratic State Senator [[Robert G. "Bob" Jones]] of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], son of former Governor [[Sam H. Jones|Sam Houston Jones]], with 292,220 (24.3 percent). Secretary of State [[Wade O. Martin, Jr.]], ran third with 146,363 (12.2 percent). Thereafter, Jones and Martin became Republicans. [[Addison Roswell Thompson]], the perennial segregationist candidate from New Orleans, made his last race for governor in the 1975 primary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louisiana Secretary of State]], Louisiana election returns, November 1, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early scandals===
Though arguably minor compared to the Edwards scandals of the 1980s and 1990s, the governor was embroiled in several ethics controversies during his first two terms in office. At the time, Edwards was remarkably candid about his questionable practices. When questioned about receiving illegal campaign contributions, he replied that "It was illegal for them to give, but not for me to receive."&lt;ref name=returnguv/&gt; He also insisted he saw no problem with investing in a proposed New Orleans office building called "One Edwards Square" (it was never actually named that) while still governor, and demonstrated his gambling prowess to the press on one of his frequent gambling trips to [[Las Vegas]]. Later, Edwards' commissioner of administration Charles Roemer{{spaced ndash}}father of future governor [[Buddy Roemer]]&amp;nbsp;– was convicted of taking bribes and having connections with [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] boss [[Carlos Marcello]]. Edwards managed to avoid direct implication in the Roemer case.

During the governor's first term, a disaffected former Edwards bodyguard named [[Clyde Vidrine]] made several high-profile accusations of corruption, including the sale of state agency posts. The accusations were investigated by a grand jury, but the Edwards administration attacked Vidrine's credibility and the investigation stalled. Later, Vidrine published a tell-all book called ''Just Takin’ Orders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|magazine = Amazon.com|title = Just takin' orders: A southern governor's watergate |asin = B0006CZEYY|date = 1977|accessdate = 2013-09-19|url = https://www.amazon.com/Just-takin-orders-Governors-watergate/dp/B0006CZEYY}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included salacious details of Edwards' frequent gambling trips and extramarital escapades. Vidrine was murdered in December 1986 by the husband of a woman he was guarding, who believed Vidrine was having an affair with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-17/news/mn-3282_1_bodyguard.htm |title = Gov.

In a 1976 scandal known as [[Koreagate]], it came to light that Edwards and his wife Elaine had received questionable gifts in 1971, while Edwards was a U.S. representative. [[South Korea]]n rice broker [[Tongsun Park]] was under investigation for trying to bribe American legislators on behalf of the South Korean government, and for making millions of dollars in commissions on American purchases of South Korean rice. Edwards admitted that Park gave Elaine an envelope containing $10,000 in cash, but insisted that the gift was given out of friendship and that there was nothing improper about it. In the course of the controversy, Edwards stated that he thought it was "super moralistic" for the U.S. government to prohibit American businessmen to accept gifts from foreign officials in the course of their business dealings. The scandal also engulfed Edwards's former congressional colleague [[Otto Passman]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], who was later acquitted of all charges in the case.

==First political comeback: Edwards vs. Treen, 1983==
Barred by the state constitution from seeking a third term immediately after his second, Edwards temporarily left politics in 1980 but made it clear he would run again for governor in 1983. He began raising money and touring the state long before the 1983 election, maintaining what supporters called "the government in waiting." Early in 1982, Edwards said that he was so committed to running again for governor that "only death alone can separate me from this.... We are being led by a governor whose only answer to unemployment is to buy a $350,000 jet."&lt;ref&gt;"Edwards Denies Wrongdoing - Keeps Running", ''Minden Press-Herald'', March 15, 1982, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Republican [[David Treen]] was narrowly elected governor on a pledge of [[good government]] reform. Edwards had supported Treen's opponent, Democratic Public Service Commissioner [[Louis Lambert]] of [[Ascension Parish]]. As widely expected, Edwards in 1983 defeated Treen's re-election attempt. The election offered a clear contrast between the flamboyant, charismatic Edwards and the low-key, policy-oriented Treen. While Treen focused on Edward's reputation for corruption and dishonesty, Edwards sought to portray Treen as incompetent and unresponsive to the public. Treen said of Edwards: "It's difficult for me to understand his popularity", which indicated in the eyes of many that he did not fully comprehend Louisiana politics.&lt;ref name=roll/&gt; The two major candidates spent over $18 million between them; the election became renowned as one of the most expensive campaigns ever conducted in a state the size of Louisiana. [[John Maginnis (Louisiana political writer)|John Maginnis]]' 1984 book, ''The Last Hayride'', chronicles this colorful but lopsided campaign.

Treen's commissioner of administration, former legislator [[E. L. Henry|E. L. "Bubba" Henry]], told the [[Louisiana Democratic Party|Democratic State Central Committee]] that Edwards had created a "smoke screen ... to divert attention from his own 'sweetheart deals' for his political friends," a reference to controversy which arose in the financing of a new baseball stadium for the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] (then known as Northeast Louisiana University).&lt;ref&gt;"Bubba Henry Says Edwards Creating a 'Smoke Screen'", ''Minden Press-Herald'', March 25, 1982, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Dead girl or a live boy}}
Before election day, Edwards joked with reporters: "The only way I can lose this election is if I'm caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy".&lt;ref name=returnguv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blagojevich Fatigue? Get Used to It |author=Warren, James |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 21, 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/us/22cncwarren.html |page=A23A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards zinged Treen many times, once describing Treen as "so slow it takes him an hour and a half to watch ''[[60 Minutes]]''." During a gubernatorial debate in 1983, Treen asked Edwards, "How come you talk out of both sides of your mouth?" Edwards instantly responded, "So people like you with only half a brain can understand me."

Then ''[[Shreveport Journal]]'' editor [[Stanley R. Tiner]] reported after the campaign of 1983 that Edwards does not believe in the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and does not personally expect to go to heaven. There was an uproar in conservative religious circles, but the comments did not stop Edwards from finishing his term or winning a fourth election eight years later.

Edwards' brother, [[Marion Edwards|Marion David Edwards]] (1928–2013),&lt;ref name=marde&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obits.nola.com/obituaries/nola/obituary.aspx?n=marion-d-edwards&amp;pid=162308325&amp;fhid=16696#fbLoggedOut|title=Marion D. Edwards|publisher=''New Orleans Times-Picayune''|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was part of the 1983 campaign and of the entourage that headed to [[France]] and [[Belgium]] early in 1984 to raise money to repay a lingering $4.2 million campaign debt.&lt;ref name=marion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/viewart/20130113/NEWS01/130113002/Marion-Edwards-brother-ex-Louisiana-governor-dies-84|title=Marion Edwards, brother of ex-Louisiana governor, dies at 84|publisher=''Alexandria Daily Town Talk''|accessdate=January 13, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216223231/http://www.thetowntalk.com/viewart/20130113/NEWS01/130113002/Marion-Edwards-brother-ex-Louisiana-governor-dies-84|archivedate=February 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six hundred supporters joined the Edwardses on an eight-day tour that included dinner at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and gambling in [[Monte Carlo]]. Each paid $10,000. Edwards expected a 70 percent profit on the contributors' tickets to retire the debt. Bumper stickers were printed in blue and gold campaign colors and distributed to those who contributed to the retirement of this debt. For years afterwards, motorists saw on vehicles bearing the slogan, "I did Paris with the Gov."&lt;ref name=roll&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Paul |date=April 3, 1985 |title=Louisianans just let good times roll |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=892&amp;dat=19850403&amp;id=1jlPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=908DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6792,465776 |newspaper=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Courier]] |location=Prescott, Arizona |access-date=May 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees ranged from [[Sheriff]] [[Don Hathaway]] of [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]] to the [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] artist [[George Rodrigue]], known at the time for his oak tree symbol, later replaced by the widely recognized blue dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgerodrigue.com/january11-2-2004.htm |title=Blue Dog Artist Visits Shreveport With Portrait of Governor Blanco |publisher=[[KTAL-TV]] |author=Justin Herndon |date=January 11, 2004 |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808130837/http://georgerodrigue.com/january11-2-2004.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third term as governor, 1984–1988==
State finances nosedived during the third Edwards administration. Money from petroleum [[severance tax]]es decreased sharply in the middle 1980s because of plummeting oil prices. In 1984, Edwards attempted to deal with the erosion of state revenue by approving $730 million—Edwards had requested $1.1 billion—in new personal taxes, including a 1 percentage point increase in the state [[sales tax]], $61 million in higher [[corporate income tax]]es, and $190 million in additional [[gasoline tax]]es.&lt;ref name=taxes&gt;"Legislators buckle under EWE threat", ''Minden Press-Herald'', March 23, 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature, overwhelmingly dominated by lawmakers beholden to Edwards, passed these taxes into law, but the taxes were highly unpopular and damaged Edwards' level of public support. Republican State Representative [[Terry W. Gee]] of New Orleans said at the time, "Nobody realized the magnitude of what's going on; I've had 180 phone calls in two days against the higher taxes."&lt;ref name=taxes/&gt;

Much of Edwards' support in the 1970s had been fueled by high levels of social spending during times of economic prosperity; with economic conditions worsening, his popularity waned. To obtain passage of the higher taxes, Edwards first submitted Treen's 1984–1985 proposed budget as a warning to lawmakers. The Treen budget, he claimed, would cut state spending too drastically and cause roads to fall apart, bridges to collapse, and insurance premiums to skyrocket. Edwards predicted that if lawmakers passed Treen's budget instead of the higher taxes the voters would rebel and blame the legislature itself for the results.&lt;ref&gt;"Edwards submits Treen's budget in attempt to force legislators' hands", ''Minden Press-Herald'', April 17, 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Edwards got most of what he wanted and was able to use the excuse of teacher pay increases to put pressure on lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;"Edwards wins tax battle", ''Minden Press-Herald'', June 30, 1984, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Volz indictment and trials===
In February 1985, soon after his third term began, Edwards was forced to stand trial on charges of [[mail fraud]], [[obstruction of justice]], and [[bribery]], brought by U.S. Attorney [[John Volz]]. The charges were centered around an alleged scheme in which Edwards and his associates received almost $2 million in exchange for granting preferential treatment to companies dealing with state hospitals. Edwards proclaimed his innocence and insisted that the charges were politically motivated by Volz and the Republican Party. The first trial resulted in a mistrial in December 1985, while a second trial in 1986 resulted in an acquittal. After Edwards and his four co-defendants were acquitted, the hotel where the jurors had been sequestered revealed that half of the jurors had stolen towels as they left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Jurors-Accused-Of-Swiping-Hotel-Towels/id-6f5ac09e80c78785988072ee896ed40d |title=Jurors Accused Of Swiping Hotel Towels |publisher=Apnewsarchive.com |date=1986-05-22 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards quipped that he had been judged by a "jury of my peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/us/21iht-letter.html | work=The New York Times | first=Albert R. | last=Hunt | title=Kooky Politics Make for Entertaining Races | date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell B. Long]] had correctly predicted in March 1985 that Edwards would indeed be acquitted by a Louisiana jury and that the ensuing trial would not disrupt state government.&lt;ref&gt;"Long predicts EWE acquittal", ''Minden Press-Herald'', March 14, 1985, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; When Long announced his retirement from the U.S. Senate seat that he had held since 1948, he indicated his preference for Edwards as his senatorial successor but added, correctly, that he did not think Edwards would enter the 1986 Senate election.&lt;ref&gt;"Sen. Long doesn't think Edwards will run (for U.S. Senate)", ''Minden Press-Herald'', March 29, 1985, p. 7A&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors referred to Marion Edwards, also indicted in the alleged health care scheme, as a "bag man" for his brother. Marion ridiculed this characterization at a [[French Quarter]] bar in New Orleans, when media representatives were present. He placed a shopping bag on his head to resemble a crown and tossed about phony $100 bills.&lt;ref name=marion/&gt;

Edwards later recited during a toast at a French Quarter bar, though his beverage was non-alcoholic as he is a teetotaler, a rhyming invitation for Volz to "kiss my ass". The trials were rather lengthy, and at one point during the first trial but before the mistrial Edwards rode to the Hale Boggs U.S. Courthouse on a mule from his hotel. When asked by reporters why he did so, he replied something to the effect that it was symbolic of the speed and intellect of the federal judicial system, but also that he supported 'tradition.' Marion Edwards, an attorney, often wore a pinstripe suit with a top hat and cane and held comedic press briefings at the end of each court session on the steps of the courthouse. Marion Edwards mocked the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney Volz, and United States Judge Marcel Livaudais, who presided over the trials.

Even after beating the Volz indictment, Edwin Edwards' popularity was in decline. Despite his acquittal, the trial brought many sordid details of Edwards's conduct under public scrutiny. It was revealed that during frequent gambling trips to Las Vegas, Edwards lost hundreds of thousands of dollars under aliases such as T. Wong and E. Lee, later paying these gambling debts using suitcases stuffed with cash of unknown origin.&lt;ref name=laststand/&gt;

After the trial, Edwards' support for the legalization of [[gambling]] as a solution to the state's severe revenue shortages contributed to a further decline in his popularity. He had made unpopular budget cuts to education and other social programs earlier in his term. Beginning in January 1986, he argued that legalizing casino gambling in up to fifteen locations and creating a [[Louisiana Lottery (modern)|state lottery]] would be a way to restore the programs, but the state legislature rejected his gambling proposals. Entering a tough re-election campaign in 1987, Edwards seemed vulnerable. Going into the election, his disapproval ratings ranged from 52 to 71 percent.

At first Edwards had predicted that a casino and a state lottery would net the state $600 million; then he lowered the expectations to $150 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Edwards hedges on gambling expectations", ''Minden Press-Herald'', February 14, 1986, p. 8B&lt;/ref&gt; Both gambling measures would eventually be implemented, but not in the third Edwards term.

==Defeat: Edwards vs. Roemer, 1987==
Several notable candidates lined up to face Edwards in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1987|1987 gubernatorial election]]. Perhaps his strongest early challenger was Republican Congressman [[Bob Livingston]]. Also in the race were [[Billy Tauzin]], a then-Democratic Cajun congressman from [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]] who was a strong Edwards supporter while serving in the state legislature from 1972–80; Democratic Secretary of State [[James H. "Jim" Brown|Jim Brown]] of [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], and a Democratic congressman from [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]], [[Buddy Roemer]], the son of former Commissioner of Administration Charles Roemer, who climbed up from a series of low poll rankings early in the campaign.

Louis J. Roussel, Jr., the businessman from New Orleans who began his career as a bus driver, contributed $600,000 to Edwards in the losing race in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~rivgate/notes_ch7anote4.html|title=Notes|publisher=tulane.edu|accessdate=October 31, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825122834/http://www.tulane.edu/~rivgate/notes_ch7anote4.html|archivedate=August 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roussel had been a large donor to Bill Dodd,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Dodd]], ''Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics'', Baton Rouge: Claitors Publishing Company, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; whose son, William Ford Dodd, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the same 1987 primary election.

==="Anyone But Edwards"===
Edwards was the issue of the campaign. Because of his name recognition, his resilient supporters, and unmatched political skill, even a weakened Edwards could safely assume he would win a place in Louisiana's unique primary election system runoff. The question was whether his opponent in the runoff would be someone who could beat him.

There was a prevailing sense in the race that Edwards needed Livingston in the runoff. Livingston was a Republican in a state that had at that point elected only one Republican governor since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. And Livingston was widely perceived as lacking in charisma and personality, which would work to Edwards's advantage. Any other opponent, a moderate Democrat without the ethical problems, would be dangerous. To that end, Edwards talked up Livingston. Perhaps the key moment in the 1987 race came at a forum between the candidates. As usual, the main topic of discussion was Edwin Edwards. His challengers were asked, in succession, if they would consider endorsing Edwards in the general election if they did not make it to the runoff. The candidates hedged, particularly Secretary of State Brown, a reliable Edwards supporter in the state Senate who in his 1979 election drew many of the same voters who supported fellow Democrat [[Louis Lambert]] in his failed gubernatorial bid in the same general election vs. Treen. The last candidate to speak was Buddy Roemer: "No, we've got to slay the dragon. I would endorse anyone but Edwards." The next day, as political commentator John Maginnis put it, Jim Brown was explaining his statement while Buddy Roemer was ordering "Slay the Dragon" buttons. Boosted by his endorsement as the ‘good government candidate’ by nearly every newspaper in the state, Roemer stormed from last place in the polls and on election night, overtook Edwin Edwards and placed first in the primary election, with 33 percent of the vote compared with Edwards' 28 percent. This marked the first time Edwin Edwards ever finished other than in first place in an election.

In what seemed to be the end of Edwards' political career, the governor withdrew from the contest in his concession speech, automatically electing [[Buddy Roemer]] governor. In fact, he was cleverly setting a trap for Roemer. By withdrawing, Edwards denied Roemer the opportunity to build a governing coalition in the general election race, and denied him the decisive majority victory that he surely would have attained. In one stroke, Edwards made Buddy Roemer a minority governor. Also, Edwards virtually ceded control of the state to Roemer even before his inauguration. By doing so, he passed on the burden of the state's problems to the new governor, who was essentially under the gun even before assuming office. For four years, Roemer struggled to be a reform governor of Louisiana as so many had before him. And although virtually no one realized it at the time, Edwin Edwards quietly waited in the wings for a return to power.

==Second comeback: Edwards vs. Duke, 1991{{anchor|Second comeback}}==
{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1991}}
As the 1991 governor's race drew near, many of Edwards' friends encouraged him to abandon his planned comeback, believing that he had no chance to win. After Edwards' loss in 1987, a journalist for the defunct ''Shreveport Journal'' wrote that the only way Edwin Edwards could ever be elected again was to run against [[Adolf Hitler]]. These words turned out to be shockingly prophetic, since after the 1991 primary Edwards discovered his runoff opponent to be former [[Imperial Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[David Duke]]. Edwards received 34 percent of the vote while Duke received 32 percent. Governor Roemer placed third, 80,000 votes behind Duke.

The runoff between an avowed white supremacist and a former governor who was corrupt but was also perceived as minority-friendly, gained national attention. Support for Edwards grew in between the primary and the runoff. [[Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism]], an [[interest group]], appeared to challenge Duke, with its leadership including longtime Treen supporter [[Beth Rickey]], a member of the [[Louisiana Republican Party|Louisiana Republican State Central Committee]] from New Orleans. The coalition revealed through a recording of Duke at a White Nationalist conference that he was still involved in Ku Klux Klan activities.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Sullivan, "Beth Rickey dies with an immune disorder and Crohn's disease," ''[[Washington Post]]'', September 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with the alternative of Duke, many who were otherwise lukewarm for Edwards found him looking ever better. Edwards found himself receiving endorsements from Treen and Roemer; even Republican President [[George H. W. Bush]] urged that Edwards, the Democrat, be elected over Duke. A popular bumper sticker urging support for Edwards (although clearly not produced by his campaign) read "Vote For the Crook. It's Important."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974345,00.html "The No-Win Election"], TIME Magazine, November 25, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=70UbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6U4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=vote%20for%20the%20crook%20it's%20important&amp;pg=4928%2C3605557 "Voters to pick 'scoundrel' or ex-KKK Grand Wizard"], ''Milwaukee Sentinel'', November 15, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.nola.com/tpphotos/2011/12/175duke.html Photo of bumper sticker] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925004604/http://photos.nola.com/tpphotos/2011/12/175duke.html |date=September 25, 2012 }}, ''New Orleans Times-Picayune''&lt;/ref&gt; Another read "Vote for the Lizard, not the [[Grand Wizard|Wizard]]." Edwards said that this would be his final term as governor and that he cared about leaving a good legacy, which made many hope that the corruption of his previous administrations would not be repeated. Edwards won by a wide margin. Continuing his artful use of humor to deflate an opponent, and referring to his considerable reputation as a ladies' man, Edwards said of Duke that "the only thing we have in common is that we both have been wizards beneath the sheets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Usborne |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/former-louisiana-governor-edwin-edwards-yesterdays-man-at-87-maybe-not-yet-9700489.html |title=Former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards: Yesterday's man? At 87, maybe not yet... |publisher=The Independent |date=2014-08-29 |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also feigned concern for Duke's health due to smoke inhalation "because he's around so many burning crosses"&lt;ref name=laststand/&gt; and when a reporter asked Edwards what he needed to do to triumph over Duke, Edwards replied "stay alive." On Election Day, Edwards defeated Duke in a landslide, 61 to 39 percent, a margin of nearly 400,000 votes.

==Fourth term as governor, 1992–1996==
In his last term, Edwards asked his boyhood friend, [[Raymond Laborde]], to leave the state House after twenty years to serve as commissioner of administration. Laborde, who had once defeated Edwards for class president at Marksville High School and had earlier been his legislative floor leader, agreed to join the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070318/COMMUNITIES/703160358 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209123227/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070318/COMMUNITIES/703160358 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |title=Philip Timothy, "Ex-governor [Edwin Washington Edwards] tops list of colorful parish politicians" |publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|The Town Talkl]]'', March 18, 2007 |accessdate=December 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He invited former Representative [[Kevin Reilly (Louisiana politician)|Kevin P. Reilly, Sr.]], of Baton Rouge, former CEO of [[Lamar Advertising Company]] to serve as secretary of economic development. Reilly had been removed in 1986 as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee after having criticized Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsu.com/UNV002.NSF/%28NoteID%29/0EB8760B2EBFB14986256BC3005ADE30?OpenDocument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714000652/http://www.lsu.com/UNV002.NSF/%28NoteID%29/0EB8760B2EBFB14986256BC3005ADE30?OpenDocument |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |title=Kevin and Dee Dee Reilly receive honorary degrees from LSU |publisher=lsu.com |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Edwards appointed the professional [[penology|penologist]], [[Richard Stalder]], as secretary of the [[Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections]], a position that used to be given to political supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYGF3ZDsmEYC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Richard+Stalder&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pHkepxj0Wa&amp;sig=2SJfQr4Lxq_jYBkCDx4m_PQxJEM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8DetUvGdGYnR2AWC4oHgCQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Richard%20Stalder&amp;f=false|title=Dennis Shere, Cain's Redemption: A Story of Hope and Transformation in America's Bloodiest Prison |pages= 44-45|publisher=[[Moody Publishers|Northfield Publishing Company]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-881273-24-0|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalder remained secretary until 2008, completing three subsequent gubernatorial terms in the office.

In the last term, Edwards promoted casino gambling in Louisiana, which had been a major part of his platform in the 1991 campaign. In June 1992, his heavy lobbying led the state legislature to pass a bill calling for a single large land-based casino in New Orleans. He also appointed a board that, at his private direction, awarded 15 floating riverboat casinos that had been authorized by the Legislature and the Roemer administration. He appointed a political ally, Paul Fontenot, to head the State Police; he would oversee the licensing and investigation of casino operators. On another front he again demonstrated his broad commitment to civil rights by becoming the first Southern governor to issue an executive order protecting lesbian, gay and bisexual persons from discrimination in state governmental services, employment and contracts.&lt;ref&gt;La. Executive Order EWE 92-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the discovery that some licensees had links to organized crime or other unsavory ties, Edwards blocked the revocation of their licenses. But a political backlash against gambling-related corruption began. Though he had originally planned to run for re-election in 1995, he announced in June 1994, shortly after marrying his second wife Candy Picou, that he would be retiring from politics at the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?57742-1/governor-retirement-address |title=Governor Retirement Address |publisher=C-SPAN |date=June 6, 1994 |accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards was succeeded as governor by State Senator [[Murphy J. Foster Jr.]], who ran as an opponent of gambling interests. Edwards retired to a newly purchased home in [[Baton Rouge]], intent on returning to a private law practice and living out his remaining days in contentment with his young wife, Candy (born 1964).

[[Ron Gomez]], whose second term in the legislature corresponded with Edwards' third term as governor, describes Edwards, accordingly:

"Somehow, his brashness and arrogance over the years, traits that would have destroyed the average politician, have only seemed to endear him to his core constituency: minorities, [[organized labor]], Cajuns and lower-income voters. It is exactly those groups who suffered the most over the quarter of a century he was in and out of the governor's office. Except for some black leaders who attached themselves to his entourage and gained political clout and monetary rewards through favors and appointments, the minority population as a whole has made very little progress culturally, educationally or socially because of his leadership."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Gomez]], ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]: Zemog Publishing, 2000, {{ISBN|0-9700156-0-7}}, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez continued:

:Organized labor, once a powerful force in the state, has fallen to its lowest membership in history. And, overall, when he finally left office in 1996, the state was near the bottom in teacher pay and college and university funding (among other things). It was also near the top in high school dropouts, [[teen pregnancy|teen pregnancies]], welfare recipients, prison population, and virtually every other negative category.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictment and conviction==
Former Congressman [[Cleo Fields]] achieved considerable notoriety in 1997 when an FBI surveillance videotape showed him accepting a large amount of cash (about $20,000) from Edwards and stuffing it in his pockets. At the time Fields stated that the incident was just an innocent business transaction between friends, and said there was a humorous explanation, which he would make public shortly thereafter. A cloud hung over Fields as an unindicted co-conspirator in Edwards' criminal trial and in the end Fields refused to deliver the promised "humorous" explanation, stating that at the time of the cash transfer, he was not an elected official, and therefore under no obligation to explain publicly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestofneworleans.com/archives/2000/1024/news-pol.html]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} DuBos, Clancy, "Questions for Cleo", ''[[Gambit Weekly]]'' newspaper / Best of New Orleans web site, October 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestofneworleans.com/archives/2000/1024/news-pol.html]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} DuBos, Clancy and Sam Winston, "An Epic Tale", ''[[Gambit Weekly]]'' newspaper / Best of New Orleans web site, March 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After being fingered by Texas for-profit prison entrepreneur Patrick Graham, who allegedly gave him $845,000 in conjunction with a scheme to locate a private juvenile prison in [[Jena, Louisiana|Jena]] in [[La Salle Parish]], Edwards was indicted in 1998 by the federal government with prosecution led by U.S. Attorney [[Eddie Jordan (attorney)|Eddie Jordan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The prosecution soon released transcripts of audio conversations, and excerpts of video surveillance that seemed to indicate dubious financial transactions. The Edwards investigation also resulted in the conviction of [[San Francisco 49ers]] owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.]], who admitted to paying Edwards a $400,000 bribe in exchange for Edwards's assistance in securing a riverboat casino license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/10/07/MN4647.DTL |title=DeBartolo Guilty of Felony / $1 million fine, 2 years of probation |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=October 7, 1998 |accessdate=March 18, 2017 | first1=David | last1=Dietz | first2=Howard | last2=Arceneaux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards was found guilty on seventeen of twenty-six counts, including [[racketeering]], [[extortion]], [[money laundering]], [[mail fraud]] and [[wire fraud]]; his son Stephen was convicted on 18 counts. "I did not do anything wrong as a governor, even if you accept the verdict as it is, it doesn't indicate that," Edwards told the press after his conviction. On his way to prison he said, "I will be a model prisoner, as I have been a model citizen". From 2002 to 2004 Edwin Edwards was incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]].

Edwards' sometime co-conspirator, Cecil Brown, a Eunice cattleman, was convicted for his part in the payoffs in 2002.

In 2004, Edwards filed for divorce from his second wife Candy, saying that Mrs. Edwards had "suffered enough" during his incarceration. In June 2005, the former Mrs. Edwards was arrested for threatening a police officer at a traffic stop in [[Port Barre, Louisiana|Port Barre]], screaming "don't you know who I am?"

In 2005, Edwards was moved to the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Oakdale|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Oakdale, Louisiana|Oakdale]] in [[Allen Parish, Louisiana|Allen Parish]], where he served his sentence as inmate #03128-095. According to the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], he was scheduled to be released on July 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;LastName=edwards&amp;Middle=&amp;FirstName=edwin&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=M&amp;Age=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=Federal Bureau of Prisons |publisher=Bop.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In prison, he served as the facility's librarian: "I did what I could for my fellow inmates. I helped a number of them get their GEDs and I was helping several more when my term expired. Now, I have to be honest; I didn't stick around to see if they succeeded...."&lt;ref name=laststand/&gt;

Two men whom Edwards defeated in Louisiana elections—David C. Treen and J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.—and a third who was his protégé and successor in the Seventh District U.S. House seat, U.S. Senator John Breaux, confirmed in July 2007 that they intended to approach then [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] to seek a pardon or [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] for Edwards, who celebrated his 80th birthday in prison in August 2007. Bush denied a pardon for Edwards before he left the presidency on January 20, 2009.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/28/nation/na-pardons28 |title=Bush rejected pardons for Duke Cunningham, Edwin Edwards and Michael Milken&amp;nbsp;– Los Angeles Times |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 28, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2010 | first=Josh | last=Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards supporters also lobbied U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] for a pardon for Edwards so he might run in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2011|2011 Louisiana gubernatorial election]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwl.com/Edwards-says-he-would-win-another-race-for-governo/10655990 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915202514/http://www.wwl.com/Edwards-says-he-would-win-another-race-for-governo/10655990 |archivedate=September 15, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama did not reply to petitions by supporters of Edwards and without a pardon, Edwards remains ineligible to seek the governorship until fifteen years have passed from the end of his sentence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In 2009, Edwards was listed as an "honorary [[pallbearer]]" at the funeral of perennial political candidate [[L. D. Knox]] of [[Winnsboro, Louisiana|Winnsboro]], who in the 1979 gubernatorial contest, when Edwards was not on the ballot, legally changed his name to "None of the Above" Knox to dramatize his support for the "None of the Above" option in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/dclassifieds?Dato=20090531&amp;Kategori=OBITUARY&amp;Class=30&amp;Type=CAT30200&amp;Lopenr=90500234&amp;Selected=6 |title=Obituary of L.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and family===
In 1949, Edwards married [[Elaine Edwards|Elaine Schwartzenburg]], whom he had met at Marksville High School. The couple had four children: Anna, Victoria, Stephen, and David.  In 1972, Edwards appointed her as an interim U.S. senator to complete the unfinished term of [[Allen J. Ellender]] of [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]], who died while campaigning for his seventh term in office. On July 1, 1989, the couple divorced after forty years of marriage. They had begun living apart on March 15, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press-Herald'', July 12, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Edwards married Candy Picou (born 1964). In 1997, the couple entered the headlines when they attempted to have a child. Edwards had a [[vasectomy reversal]], and the couple froze sperm to attempt to have a baby but were not successful.&lt;ref name=returnguv/&gt; While in prison, Edwin Edwards filed for divorce, which was finalized in 2004.

In July 2011, Edwards married Trina Grimes, his prison pen pal. They began corresponding while he was serving his sentence for corruption. At the time of the wedding, he was 83, and she was 32.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-ex-la-gov-83-marries-32-year-old-prison-pen-pal-2011jul29-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2013, Grimes gave birth to their child, Eli Wallace Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/trina_scott_edwards_34_wife_of.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Edwards and Trina co-starred in an [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] reality show, ''[[The Governor's Wife]]'' based on their life together.&lt;ref name="kondolojy1"&gt;{{cite press release|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|title=A&amp;E Network Premieres 'The Governor's Wife' on Sunday October 27 at 10PM|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/26/ae-network-premieres-the-governors-wife-on-sunday-october-27-at-10pm/204998/|work=TV by the Numbers|date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanley1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|title=Real Politician of Louisiana, at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/arts/television/the-governors-wife-on-ae-follows-life-of-edwin-edwards.html|work=The New York Times|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended family===
One of Edwards's brothers, Nolan Edwards, a former assistant district attorney in Acadia Parish, was murdered in Crowley by an irate client in 1983, the same year that Edwards was engineering his comeback bid for a third term as governor. Nolan's killer, Rodney Wingate, Jr., of [[Church Point, Louisiana|Church Point]], Louisiana, then killed himself. Wingate had been pardoned by Governor Edwards in 1980 for two drug convictions in the 1970s, a pardon procured through the intervention of Nolan Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19830819&amp;id=pvtEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5444,1126713|title=Former client kills self, ex-governor's brother in Louisiana|publisher=''[[Lakeland Ledger]]'', August 19, 1983|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan's murder halted the 1983 politicking.

Marion Edwards, an insurance agent and political consultant, was a cancer survivor and counseled other patients for many years. Born on July 10, 1928, in Marksville, he died on January 12, 2013, at the age of eighty-four at his home in [[Broussard, Louisiana|Broussard]] near [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], Louisiana. The cause of death was not released. The Marion D. Edwards Fellowship in Hepatic Oncology at the [[M.D. Anderson Hospital]] and Tumor Institute in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas, is named in his honor. Marion Edwards, who was [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]], was survived by his second wife, the former Deborah "Penny" Meaux, and three daughters from his first marriage to Aline Luther Edwards: Wanda Edwards, Elizabeth Kersten, and Donna Edwards.&lt;ref name=marde/&gt;&lt;ref name=marion/&gt;

Another brother, Allen Edwards, the longtime owner of a farm and heavy equipment company in [[Quitman, Arkansas|Quitman]] in northern [[Arkansas]], died in 2009, while Edwards was in prison. Edwards did not attend the funeral because of security difficulties.

Edwards is an uncle by marriage to former U.S. Representative [[Charles Boustany]], a Republican from Lafayette, whose district includes much of the territory represented from 1965 to 1972 by then-U.S. Representative Edwin Edwards. Boustany's wife is the former Bridget Edwards, a daughter of Nolan Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowleypostsignal.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Boustany-+Dugal+-to+unite+in+holy+matrimony%20&amp;id=12832286&amp;instance=secondary_stories_left_column |title=Boustany, Dugal to unite in holy matrimony, May 2011 |publisher=''Crowley Post Signal'' |accessdate=December 9, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third wife and reality television show===
On July 29, 2011, Edwards married Trina Grimes Scott (born August 1978) from Baton Rouge, at the [[Hotel Monteleone|Monteleone Hotel]] in New Orleans. A prison pen pal, she is fifty-one years his junior and was born midway in his second term as governor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/edwin_edwards_trina_griems_sco.html] "Edwin Edwards, Trina Grimes Scott marry in private ceremony", [[The Times-Picayune]], July 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.bestofneworleans.com/blogofneworleans/archives/2014/03/17/former-gov-edwin-edwards-announces-run-for-us-congress |title = Former Gov.

Edwin and Trina Edwards were the subjects of the [[reality show]] ''The Governor's Wife'', which premiered October 27, 2013, on the [[Arts &amp; Entertainment Network]].&lt;ref name="kondolojy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanley1"/&gt; The program focuses on Trina's rearing of teenaged sons and acting as stepmother to Edwards' daughters who are almost twice her age. According to the A&amp;E description of the program: "Between school projects, running for president of the Homeowner's Association, fending off skeptics who think she's a gold digger, and thoughts of adding a baby of their own to the mix, the Edwards clan truly represents a new take on the modern family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/01/ex-gov_edwin_edwards_and_wife.html|title=Ex-Gov.

===Health===
In 2015, Edwards was hospitalized for [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/local/former-gov-edwin-edwards-in-hospital-with-pneumonia/369311837|title=Former Governor Edwin Edwards in Hospital With Pneumonia|publisher=WWLTV.com|accessdate=December 14, 2016|date=December 13, 2016|author=Dominic Messa}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, 2016, Edwards was hospitalized under stable condition again for pneumonia in Baton Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/12/edwin_edwards_pneumonia_hospit.html|title=Former Gov.

==2014 Congressional election==
In February 2014, Edwards announced that he was contemplating running in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2014|2014 election]] to represent the Louisiana Sixth District in Congress, which is centered on the state capital of Baton Rouge. With U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy exiting the seat to run for the Senate, Edwards said of the solidly Republican district: "I'm the only hope the Democrats have here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/02/ex-con-ex-louisiana-gov-edwards-eyes-political-comeback/|title=Ex-Con Ex-Louisiana Gov. Edwards Eyes Political Comeback, February 20, 2014|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formally declared his candidacy at a March 17 meeting of the Press Club of Baton Rouge, saying, "I want you to know, I'm going to give it every effort."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdsu.com/politics/edwards-im-running-for-congress/25017476|title=Edwards: I'm running for Congress: Former governor downplays concerns about troubled past|publisher=[[WDSU-TV]]|accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff would be held on December 6, 2014, between the top two candidates. Two other Democrats, a Libertarian and nine Republicans, most notably [[Garret Graves]], a former aide to Governor [[Bobby Jindal]], State Senator [[Dan Claitor]], businessman Paul Dietzel, II, and State Representative [[Lenar Whitney]], also sought the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/path_to_victory_for_republican.html|title=Path to victory for Republicans in the 6th Congressional District is coming in 2nd in the primary|publisher=Nola.com|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Edwards' announcement, Cassidy told [[KEEL]] radio news in Shreveport that he doubted that Edwards "has a chance. It's a conservative district, and he's obviously not a conservative. But it kind of shows, I think, to a certain extent that the Democratic bench is weak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://710keel.com/baton-rouge-congressman-bill-cassidy-edwin-edwards-doesnt-have-a-chance-in-6th-district-race/?trackback=tsmclip|title=Cassidy: Edwards 'Doesn't Have A Chance' In 6th District|publisher=[[KEEL]]|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana political writer [[John Maginnis (Louisiana political writer)|John Maginnis]] said that Edwards was "likely to make the runoff" because of his name recognition, but "I don’t see how he could win in a strong GOP-performance district like the 6th. But it should be entertaining." State pollster Elliott Stonecipher says that "the most basic math of the Edwards race yields an 'it is not impossible' answer" and former Governor [[Buddy Roemer]] said that while it is unlikely, "yes, [Edwards] can win".&lt;ref name=laststand/&gt;

An April 2014 article in ''[[Politico]]'' that discussed his chances noted that he was "still sharp as a razor" and "in remarkably vigorous health".&lt;ref name=laststand/&gt; He pronounced himself "disappointed" with President Obama for "sitting" on the [[Keystone Pipeline]] and has listed his campaign priorities as "Building support for a high-speed rail system between Baton Rouge and New Orleans and emphasizing the good aspects of [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]], while doing what I can to change or amend the provisions that I think are onerous."&lt;ref name=laststand/&gt; He said that he would have voted against the Affordable Care Act, but criticized Governor Jindal for not accepting the Medicaid expansion. If elected, he hoped to serve on the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]], to spur the construction of elevated roadways in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsureveille.com/news/politics/former-gov-edwards-returns-to-politics-in-th-district-race/article_f5a0fd66-d0c2-11e3-99d6-0017a43b2370.html|title=Former Gov. Edwards returns to politics in 6th District race|publisher=The Daily Reveille|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2014 survey of statewide Louisiana voters by [[Public Policy Polling]] found that 40% had a favourable opinion of Edwards, 44% did not and 17% were unsure. Asked whether they would rather have Edwards as governor than incumbent Republican governor [[Bobby Jindal]], 47% said they would prefer Edwards, 43% preferred Jindal and 10% were not sure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2014/PPP_Release_LA_9301205.pdf|title=Cassidy has small edge over Landrieu head to head|publisher=Public Policy Polling|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards finished first in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2014#Polling 2|every poll taken]] of the race, though only with a plurality. Runoff polls showed him losing to all of his Republican opponents. An article in ''[[The New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' in late October 2014 noted that he had run a vigorous, serious campaign and noted that, as previously, analysts were split on whether he could actually win. David Wasserman of ''[[The Cook Political Report]]'' said that for Edwards, "mathematically, victory is something close to impossibility." Conversely, a spokesman for Republican opponent Lenar Whitney and political analyst Michael Beychok both said that he had a chance to win and Republican candidate Garret Graves said "There's no one alive anymore in this state that has the experience or, quite frankly, the tactics (of) Edwin Edwards." Edwards was expected to make the runoff, with his chances dependent on which Republican joins him, with several analysts saying that Edwards' best chance would come if Whitney, the most conservative Republican running, does so. Edwards' strategy was to appeal to black and Cajun voters and conservative Democrats, also campaigning on college campuses to appeal to younger voters. Columnist Bob Mann predicted that if Edwards made the runoff, the media would decry Louisiana voters' toleration for corruption when, "in truth (Edwards) never really had a chance to win."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/does_edwin_edwards_have_an_act.html|title=Does Edwin Edwards have a legitimate shot at being elected to Congress?|publisher=Nola.com|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As expected, Edwards as the principal Democratic candidate led the 2014 primary field for Congress with 77,862 votes (30.1 percent), winning every parish in the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/11/edwin_edwards_takes_most_paris.html|title=Edwin Edwards takes most parishes, but Dems only got 35% of vote in 6th Congressional primary|publisher=Nola.com|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then faced the Republican runner-up, [[Garret Graves]], in the December 6 runoff election. Graves had received 70,706 "[[jungle primary]]" votes (27.4 percent). Losing Republican candidates were [[Paul Dietzel II]], with 35,013 votes (13.6 percent), state Senator [[Dan Claitor]] with 26,520 (10.3 percent), and state Representative [[Lenar Whitney]] with 19,146 votes (7.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11042014/11042014_Congressional.html|title=Election results 11/4/2014|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards lost to Graves by a 62–38 percent margin in the runoff. It was only the second loss of his political career.

==Edwards' record of longevity==
Edwards has the sixth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,784 days.&lt;ref name="Ostermeier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/04/the_top_50_longest_serving_gov.php |title=The Top 50 Longest-Serving Governors of All Time |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=April 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130053528/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/04/the_top_50_longest_serving_gov.php |archivedate=November 30, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few governors have served four four-year terms. Edwards followed [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]], [[Jim Hunt]] of [[North Carolina]], [[Bill Janklow]] of [[South Dakota]], [[Terry Branstad]] of [[Iowa]] and [[Jim Rhodes]] of [[Ohio]] as 16-year governors. However, Branstad was elected to a fifth nonconsecutive term as governor of Iowa in 2010, placing him second to [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] (21 years) as the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, and won a sixth term as governor in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/2014/11/04/iowa-governor-terry-branstad-reelected-historic-win/18490693/ |title=Terry Branstad re-elected to historic sixth term |publisher=desmoinesregister.com |accessdate=2014-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran journalist [[Iris Kelso]] once described Edwards as clearly "the most interesting" of the six governors that she had covered while working for three newspapers and [[WDSU]], the NBC television affiliate in New Orleans. Kelso declared Edwards more colorful than [[Earl Long]], whom she covered for less than a year in the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.wpcf.org/oralhistory/kelsoint.html|title=Iris Turner Kelso: Introduction|publisher=beta.wpcf.org|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family tree mapping''' is the process of [[geocoding]] places in [[family tree]] files to produce [[geospatial]] data suitable for viewing with a [[virtual globe]] or 2D mapping program.

==Overview==
The availability of several free applications for viewing geographic data has led to a growing interest in the use of this technology by [[genealogists]] and family history researchers.

The ability to share [[Keyhole Markup Language|keyhole markup language]] (KML) files through sites such as [[Google Maps]] means that researchers can find matches based on geographic location rather than just a place name.

==Family tree mapping applications==
Genealogy software that can be used for family tree mapping include:&lt;ref&gt;[[Comparison of genealogy software#Features |Genealogy software that do mapping]], see the Features table and refer to the Mapping column, Comparison of genealogy software, Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ahnenblatt]] using the supplied Google-Earth [[Plug-in (computing)|Plug-In]].
* [[Ancestral Quest]]
* [[Family Historian]]
* [[MyHeritage#Genealogy software|Family Tree Builder]]
* [[Family Tree Maker]]
* [[GEDitCOM ]]II
* [[GenealogyJ]]
* [[GenoPro]] - a [[Windows]] [[Genealogy]] software, whose Report Generator has ability to convert Places and geographical locations and export them in [[Google Maps]].
* [[Gramps]]
* Heredis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heredis.com/en/heredis-2014-for-windows/new-features-heredis-2014-for-windows/ The new features of Heredis 2014 for Windows]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Legacy Family Tree]] automatically map where your ancestors lived.
* [[MacFamilyTree]]
* [[RootsMagic]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rootsmagic.com/RootsMagic/ RootsMagic 6 - Map Your Family]&lt;/ref&gt;

Utility applications that can be used for family tree mapping include:
* ''AniMap''- contains historical maps that show the changing county boundaries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldbug.com/store/animap3.html AniMap], County Boundary Historical Atlas, The Gold Bug&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Centennia Historical Atlas'' - the map forward or backward in time from the year 1000 to present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalatlas.com/ The Centennia Historical Atlas] -- Europe and the Middle East 1000AD to the Present, software for Windows and Mac OS X, HistoricalAtlas.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Family Atlas'' - a [[Windows]] application that imports data from genealogy software for mapping with its own internal maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsmagic.com/family-atlas/ Family Atlas], Genealogy Mapping &amp; Publishing Software, RootsMagic, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Map My Ancestors]](Note as of 3 Oct 2011 this application was withdrawn from sale and no longer available, due to closure of Yahoo Mapping services see the source site for details) - a [[Windows]] application that imports [[GEDCOM]] files or [[comma-separated values]] (CSV) files and converts them to [[Keyhole Markup Language|keyhole markup language]] (KML) files for viewing with KML compatible programs such as [[Google Earth]] or [[Google Maps]].
* ''Map My Family Tree'' - a [[Windows]] application that imports data directly from a number of popular [[Genealogy]] programs. The program uses its own location database to resolve places from the source family tree. Viewing data is generally undertaken from within the program using the internal viewer but individual placemarks can be viewed using [[Google Earth]], [[Google Maps]], [[TerraServer-USA]] or [[MapQuest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://progenygenealogy.com/Products/FamilyMaps.aspx Map My Family Tree], Progeny Genealogy Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Félix Evaristo Mejia''' (September 27, 1866 &amp;ndash; July 1, 1945) was a [[Dominican people (Dominican Republic)|Dominican]] writer, diplomat, and educator. He was a member of the Union Nationalist group representing an important role in the struggle for Dominican sovereignty against [[United States]] military intervention (1916&amp;ndash;1924). In the Superior Institute of Teacher Education Salomé Ureña there is a site that bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Félix Evaristo Mejía y Abreu, formador de formadores|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=125667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biografia Félix Evaristo Mejía|url=http://www.bachillere.com/biografia-felix-evaristo-mejia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Félix Evaristo Mejia was born on September 26, 1866 in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]]. He studied at the Colegio San Luis Gonzaga, from where he went to the School of Santo Domingo, becoming director of the latter, a position he held subsequently in public education.

In 1884, he went into exile in [[Caracas, Venezuela]] in opposition to the dictatorial [[Ulises Heureaux]]. In Venezuela, he devoted himself to teaching, shortly after returning to the Dominican Republic where he continued his career as a teacher.

==Career==
In 1890, on his return to [[Santo Domingo]] he had to replace his teacher [[Eugenio Maria de Hostos]] in the direction as head of the school. As the general superintendent of education, Félix Evaristo had the opportunity to contribute his ideas to the progress of Dominican culture during the period characterized by violence, uncertainty and growing political and economic aggression by the [[United States]] in the country. School organization of the time and its relative expansion is due largely to his activity with secular and positivist orientation of Hostos guy who had bequeathed Hostos. Also, many of his published mainly in the fields of history and literature, as well as its activity as an organizer and owner of the first Dominican library, the Library Selecta, works especially addressed his heartfelt desire to fill bibliographic needs as a means of contributing to the intellectual and moral formation of the Dominican youth.

==Personal life==
Félix Evaristo Mejía was married to Natalia Pérez Ricart, with whom he had three children; Ofelia, Gustavo and Publio. His son Gustavo was also a prominent Dominican writer.

'''Hindkowans''' ([[Pashto]]/{{lang-pnb|{{Nastaliq|هندکوان}}}}; "Hindko-speakers") are an linguistic-cultural group native to the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pothohar Plateau]] and [[Azad Kashmir]] regions of [[Pakistan]]. Hindkowans have mixed origins and almost all speak various [[Hindko dialect]]s. They were originally settled in the northern regions of Pakistan primarily concentrated near the [[Pakistan]]-[[Afghanistan]] border. At present, Hindkowans mainly inhabit [[Peshawar]],  [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]], [[Swabi]], [[Mansehra]], [[Abbottabad]], [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]] and [[Attock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Qadeer|first=Mohammad A.|title=Pakistan: Social and Cultural Transformations in a Muslim Nation|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0415375665|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who live in [[Afghanistan]] are known as [[Hindki]]s. Most of the Tribes residing in [[Hazara Division]] of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa such as; [[Tareen]], [[Tanoli]], [[Jadoon]], [[Tahirkheli]], [[Dilazak]], [[Mashwani]], [[Swatis]]  and Utmanzais, speak Hindko and constitute an integral part of Hindkowans. Those who resides in urban centers of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of Pakistan such as: [[Peshawar]], [[Kohat]], Nowshera and Swabi are alternatively termed as "Kharian/Kharay" or ''city-dweller''. Some Hindkowans  have left the region and now live in other parts of South Asia,&lt;ref name="Daily Times-Hindu Hindkowans at Partition of India"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_29-12-2003_pg7_25| title = Peshawarites still remember the Kapoor family|publisher = Daily Times |accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as; Indian-controlled [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] and Pakistani-controlled [[Azad Kashmir]].

== Origin ==
The [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|NWFP]] Imperial Gazetteer of India (1905) regularly refers to their language as Hindko, which refers to the "Hindu Kush mountain range."&lt;ref name="JSTOR-Hindko"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Hindko in Kohat and Peshawar |author=C.

{{Quote|"More than one interpretation has been offered for the term Hindko.

In [[Afghanistan]], a group of Hindus still continue to speak Hindko and are referred to as Hindki,&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39353/39353-h/39353-h.htm#ar201 | title = Hindki|encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]|edition=11th |editor-last=Chisholm |editor-first=Hugh |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; which according to Grierson is a variant of the term Hindko.&lt;ref name=jstor615737&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shackle|first=C.|title=Hindko in Kohat and Peshawar|journal= Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=43|issue=3|date=1980|pages=482–510|jstor=615737|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00137401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethnologue-Hindko"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hno| title = Ethnologue Report for Hindko|publisher = Ethnologue|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindkis are also sometimes applied in a historical sense to the Buddhist inhabitants of the Peshawar Valley north of the [[Kabul River]], who were driven thence about the 5th or 6th century C.E. and settled in the neighbourhood of Kandahar.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; However, in [[Pakistan]] the term is considered slightly pejorative and hence Hindkowan or Hindkun is preferred on par with the term Pashtun (the 2nd largest ethnic group after hindkowans in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province).&lt;ref name=jstor615737/&gt;

== Religion ==
Hindkohwans are predominantly [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]]. However, some Hindu Hindkowans converted to Islam, mostly settled in [[Pothohar Plateau]], due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose ''[[dargah]]s'' dot the landscape.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt; There are a number of [[Hindu]] Hindkowans.&lt;ref name="O.

'''''Houngan''''' is the term for a male [[priest]] in [[Haitian Vodou]] (a female priest is known as a ''[[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbett|first=Bob|title=INTRODUCTION TO VOODOO IN HAITI|url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/voodoo/overview.htm|accessdate=14 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006144910/http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/voodoo/overview.htm|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from the [[Fon language|Fon]] word "''[[hùn gan|Hounnongan]]''. There are two ranks of ''houngan'': '''''houngan asogwe''''' (high priest) and '''''houngan sur pwen''''' (junior priest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORD MEANINGS AND REFERENCES|url=http://theoriginalpapabones.com/blog/?page_id=1004|work=THE AMERICAN VOODOO SOCIETY &amp; THE GEDE NATIONS|accessdate=14 October 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''houngan asogwe'' is the highest member of clergy in voodoo and the only one with authority to ordain other priests.
 
It is the ''houngan'''s role to preserve the rituals and songs and maintain the relationship between the spirits and the community as a whole (though some of this is the responsibility of the whole community as well). They are entrusted with leading the service of all of the spirits of their lineage. Sometimes they may also be ''[[bokor]]'' (sorcerers).

'''Howard Barton Unruh''' (January 21, 1921 – October 19, 2009) was an American [[mass murder]]er&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/howard_unruh/index.html "All about mass murderer Howard Unruh"] by [[Katherine Ramsland]] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519084501/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/howard_unruh/index.html |date=2011-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes classified as a [[spree killer]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2rdEgUIMLcC&amp;pg=PA139 ''Sexual homicide: Patterns and Motives'']; by [[Robert Ressler]], et al., Free Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; who shot and killed 13 people (including three children) during a 12-minute walk through his neighborhood on September 6, 1949, in [[Camden, New Jersey]], when he was 28 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/19/first.mass.murderer/ Suspect in historic mass murder dies at 88]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident became known as the "Walk of Death". Unruh was found to be [[criminally insane]], and died in 2009 after a lengthy illness at the age of 88, following 60 years of confinement.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/64889962.html?c=r|title= Camden mass murderer Howard Unruh dies at 88|publisher=philly.com|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and possible motives for killings==

Unruh was the son of Samuel Shipley Unruh and Freda E. Vollmer. He had a younger brother, James; they were raised by their mother after the parents separated. Unruh grew up in East Camden, attended Cramer Junior High School, and graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (New Jersey)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvrbs.com/camden/CamdenNJ-HowardUnruh.htm Howard Unruh], dvrbs.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The Woodrow Wilson High School yearbook from 1939 indicated that he was shy and that his ambition was to become a government employee.&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;[[Katherine Ramsland|Ramsland, Katherine]]. [http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/howard_unruh/6.html Rampage in Camden], ''truTV.com''. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612072425/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/howard_unruh/6.html |date=2008-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He enlisted in the Army on October 27, 1942, and from October 1944 to July 1945 saw active service in the Rhineland.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive1949"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/racine-journal-times-sep-07-1949-p-1/ |title=Racine Journal Times Newspaper Archives, Sep 7, 1949 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was awarded the European Theater of Operations Medal, the Victory Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal.  He was remembered by his Section Chief, Norman E. Koehn, as a first-class soldier who never drank, swore, or chased girls, a smart but quiet man who spent much time reading his bible and writing long letters to his mother.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/madison-wisconsin-state-journal-sep-07-1949-p-1/ |title=Madison Wisconsin State Journal Archives, Sep 7, 1949 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date=1949-09-07 |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But his hobby was guns, and his marksmanship, noted Koehn, was deadly.  He was honorably discharged at the end of the war, after which he returned to New Jersey to live with his mother.

He briefly found work as a sheet-metal worker before enrolling at Temple University in Philadelphia in their School of Pharmacy, but quit after a month citing "poor physical condition" as the reason, after which, supported by his mother's income working in a soap factory, he hung about the house, decorating it with his medals, reading his bible, and practicing his shooting in the basement, which he turned into a practice range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/mt-vernon-register-news-sep-07-1949-p-1/ |title=Mt Vernon Register News Newspaper Archives, Sep 7, 1949 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was around this time that his relations with his neighbors began to deteriorate, and his resentment grew over what he regarded as "derogatory remarks made about my character".  The evening prior to the killings, he went to a movie theater in Philadelphia, where he sat through several shows before returning home about 3 a.m. It was the following morning that he decided to kill.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive1949"/&gt;  Both his brother, James, and his father Samuel, indicated that Howard's wartime experiences had changed him, making him moody, nervous and detached, although James also pointed to the ongoing feud his brother had been having with his neighbor, the pharmacist Maurice Cohen, as a possible trigger for the killing spree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/indiana-evening-gazette-sep-13-1949-p-6/ |title=Indiana Evening Gazette Archives, Sep 13, 1949, p. 6 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For several months he had been engaged in a dispute with Cohen relating to use of the pharmacist's backyard as a means of egress to his apartment.  As well as Cohen, he also planned to kill John Pilarchik, a local shoemaker, Clark Hoover, a local barber, and Thomas Zegrino, a local tailor.

==Walk of Death==
&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive1949"/&gt; At about 7 a.m. he ate a breakfast of cereal, bacon, and eggs prepared by his mother whom he may have argued with, because she left without finishing her ironing to visit a neighbor, Carolina Pinner.  At about 9:20am, armed with his Luger P08, 8 round magazine, and more ammunition stored in his pockets, he left his apartment and walked out onto River Road.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/racine-journal-times-sep-07-1949-p-3/ |title=Racine Journal Times Newspaper Archives, Sep 7, 1949, p. 3 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date=1949-09-07 |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first stopped at the shop of shoemaker John Pilarchik, whom he shot and killed instantly.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive3"/&gt;  He next visited the barber shop of Clark Hoover, who was cutting the hair of a six-year old boy.  He shot Hoover in the head and the boy in the neck, killing both instantly.  He then ran to the River Road pharmacy, intending to kill Maurice Cohen.  Outside he encountered James Hutton, an insurance man.  Unruh asked him to excuse him, but Hutton didn't move fast enough for the gunman's liking, so he shot and killed him.  Entering the drugstore he found it empty, so he went to the rear of the premises and then upstairs to Cohen's apartment.  There he found Cohen and his son attempting to climb out of a window.  He shot and killed Cohen.  The boy managed to escape.  He then walked into a bedroom where he shot and killed Cohen's mother, Minnie.  Then he went back onto River Road where he walked in the middle of the road causing a sedan to slow for fear of hitting him.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/lowell-sun-sep-07-1949-p-22/ |title=Lowell Sun Newspaper Archives, Sep 7, 1949, p. 22 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date=1949-09-07 |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unruh walked up to the car and shot the driver, Alvin Day, killing him instantly and causing the car to careen onto the sidewalk.  He then visited the tailor shop of Thomas Zegrino, the only one of Unruh's intended targets who would survive his murder spree.  Zegrino was absent, but his wife Helga was there and was shot and killed by the gunman.  He then went to a foodstore but found the door locked.  He shot through the door but failed to injure anyone.  Finding a car waiting at the intersection, he walked up to it and shot everyone inside, Helen Wilson, her son John, and mother Emma Matlack.  The two women died instantly.  The boy died later in hospital.  He then shot at someone through an apartment window, claiming he didn't know who it was or whether he hit them.  It was 2-year old Thomas Hutchinson who was killed instantly.  His caregiver Irene Rice, witnessing this, collapsed and was treated for severe shock.  As another car came down the street he shot at the occupants, Charles Peterson and James Crawford. They survived and managed to escape to a nearby tavern, the same one Roxy de Marco had found refuge in.  Another witness, William McNeely, saw a man run out of the tavern and shoot at the gunman, but he apparently missed and then ran back inside.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/chester-times-sep-06-1949-p-1/ |title=Chester Times Newspaper Archives, Sep 6, 1949 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact he had succeeded in shooting Unruh in the leg, a fact which police would only discover at the end of a lengthy interview with the gunman.  He then shot at several other people across the street but missed.  Finding a woman and her son, Madeline and Armand Harris outside their home hanging out blankets to dry, he shot at them.  Both were injured but survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/madison-wisconsin-state-journal-sep-07-1949-p-2/ |title=Madison Wisconsin State Journal Archives, Sep 7, 1949, p. 2 |publisher=Newspaperarchive.com |date=1949-09-07 |accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing police sirens in the distance, Unruh returned to his apartment, which was soon surrounded by police. A gunfight ensued &lt;ref name="newspaperarchive4"/&gt;  during which journalist Philip Buxton of the Camden Evening Courier, located Unruh's number in the local telephone directory and called it.  Unruh answered in what he described as "a strong, clear voice", and had the following conversation with Buxton.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Is this Howard?"
"Yes ... what's the last name of the party you want?"
"Unruh."
(Pause) "What's the last name of the party you want?"
"Unruh.  I'm a friend, and I want to know what they're doing to you."
"They're not doing a damned thing to me, but I'm doing plenty to them."
(In a soothing, reassuring voice) "How many have you killed?"
"I don't know yet, because I haven't counted them ... (pause) but it looks like a pretty good score."
"Why are you killing people?"
"I don't know.  I can't answer that yet, I'm too busy."
(At that point Buxton heard Unruh move away from the phone as gunfire was heard in the background)
"I'll have to talk to you later ... a couple of friends are coming to get me" ... (voice trails off).&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive5"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The gunfight ended when police threw two tear gas bombs into the apartment, the second of which ignited, filling the room with gas.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive1949"/&gt;  Two armed officers, Charles Hance and Edward Joslin, went up to the first floor of the building and shouted "Come down with your hands up", to which Unruh replied "I give up.  Don't shoot."  He emerged from the room and stumbled down the stairs falling at the feet of the two officers.  Detectives found an apartment filled with what was described as an arsenal of weapons, guns, knives, bullet-making equipment and more than 700 bullets.  In a drawer were several marksmanship medals, and in the basement was Unruh's target range.  On a table was a Bible opened to Matthew Chapter 24.  Police also found books relating to sex hygiene.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive2"/&gt;

==Arrest and incarceration==

Under police interrogation Unruh gave a meticulous account of his actions, which was later released by Camden County prosecutor Mitchell Cohen.  Only at the end of this interrogation did police discover that he had a bullet wound in his left thigh.  He was subsequently taken to Cooper Hospital for treatment, while his 13th victim, John Wilson, lay dying in the same hospital.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive1949"/&gt;

Charges were filed for 13 counts of "willful and malicious slayings with malice aforethought" and three counts of "atrocious assault and battery". He was eventually diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] by psychologists, and found to be [[insane]], making him immune to criminal prosecution. When he was able to leave Cooper Hospital, Unruh was sent to the New Jersey Hospital for the Insane (now [[Trenton Psychiatric Hospital]]), to be held in a private cell in the maximum-security Vroom Building.&lt;ref name="trutv"/&gt; He remained incarcerated there for the rest of his life until his death in 2009. Unruh's last public words, made during an interview with a psychologist, were, "I'd have killed a thousand if I had enough bullets."&lt;ref name="History of World Crime"&gt;Nash, Jay. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TbelG-xZjwC&amp;lpg=PA775&amp;pg=PA965#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false History of World Crime]. (p. 965)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibrahim Imam''' (1916 &amp;ndash; April 1980) was a [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] politician from [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Nigeria]] who was the secretary of the Northern People's Congress and later became a patron of the [[Borno Youth Movement]]. He was elected into the Northern House of Assembly in 1961, representing a [[Tiv people|Tiv]] district. Prior to his election in 1961, he had represented his district of Yerwa in 1951 after supporting a strike of Native Administration workers.

==Early life and education==
Imam was a Kanuri man from the Yerwa district of Borno. He was born in 1916 into an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family and his [[half-brother]] was the district head of Yerwa.  He attended [[Katsina]] College and after completing his studies joined the Borno Native Administration as an assistant and later became the supervisor of works in 1950.

==Political career==
While working as an [[engineering]] assistant for the Borno [[Native Authority]], he entered the [[political]] arena as the founder of the Borno Youth Improvement Association in 1949.&lt;ref name=".Dudley"&gt;Billy J. Dudley. Parties and Politics in Northern Nigeria, Routledge, 1968. p 88-90. {{ISBN|0-7146-1658-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he contested and won a seat to the [[House of Assembly]] defeating the Waziri Mohammed. A year later at the inception of the [[Northern People's Congress]], which later became the dominant party in the [[region]], he was nominated as the party's secretary-general; he joined a large number of his colleagues from the [[regional]] house who enlisted on the [[political platform]] of the new NPC. As the general secretary of NPC, he became one of the party's prominent [[Political campaign|campaign]]ers  and was involved in political tours, traveling for thousands of miles while providing support for the extension of the party through the establishment of branches in various towns and cities in the region. 

After leaving the Native Authority, he became a [[building]] [[General contractor|contractor]] to supplement his income as an honourable member of the House.

===Borno Youth Movement===
In 1954, however, Imam resigned his position from NPC and left the party, citing the lack of a [[revolutionary]] platform for political [[reform]] of the local government in the north&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;K. W. J. Post, The Nigerian Federal Election of 1959: Politics and Administration in a Developing Political System,  Oxford University Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and also NPC's movement towards a [[reactionary]] and [[imperialistic]] political union. A year later, he joined [[Aminu Kano]]'s Northern Elements Progressive Union  and in 1956, he became the patron of the [[Borno Youth Movement]], a young organization that had grown out of its members disappointment with the native authority in Borno and the scandal of the Waziri, Mohammed. In 1956, he encouraged a fruitful alliance of the movement with NEPU particularly in Borno where the alliance later won two regional seats. But in a few years, Imam an ambitious [[politician]] was in need of resources to organize the alliance in Bornu and in the Northern region left the merger due to the inability of NEPU to contribute enough resources to strengthen the party in the region. He left NEPU and established an alliance with the Action Group and later became the leader of opposition in the regional House of Assembly.

'''James H. Coon''' (9 November 1914 – 10 March 1996) physicist at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, made significant contributions to the science and study of neutron interactions. Worked on the Vera satellite project.

==Life and Times==
James Huntington Coon was born on 9 November 1914 and died on 10 March 1996. He was interred at the Guaje Pines Cemetery, burial plot of Section 5, Lot 146C in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]].

==Education==
Coon attended [[Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana]] and graduated in 1937 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[chemistry]]. Outside of studies, he had membership in the Chemistry Dolphin Club, Der Deutsche Verein (The German Club) and the Varsity Swimming team.&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (1937). Class of 1937. Arbutus Yearbook. Indiana University. Bloomington, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Coon received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]] from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Coon, James Huntington. (1942). Capture Cross Section of [[Silicon|Si]] for [[Neutron temperature|Thermal Neutrons]] (No. AECD-3375; C-107). University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Alamos==
In 1944, scientists at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] designed field experiments to measure the air blast and ground shock effects from the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] device. In March 1945, an exploration [[geophysicist]] Herbert M. Houghton, from Geophysical Research Corporation (GRC) and [[Tidewater Oil]], was hired to work with Coon.  The team of Coon and Houghton was tasked to make ready the earth shock instrumentation for the 7 May 1945 calibration rehearsal shot of a 100-ton [[TNT]] device and the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] test in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Lawyer, Lee C., Bates, Charles Carpenter, &amp; Rice, Robert B. (2001). Geophysics in the Affairs of Mankind: A Personalized History of Exploration Geophysics. Society of Exploration Geophysicists Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1954, Coon resided in New Mexico according to the 1954 National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel.&lt;ref&gt;United States National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel Files, 1954-1970. Database, James H Coon, New Mexico, United States, Mar 1954. 1954 National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel, 622629, National Archives. College Park, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Coon was P-4 group leader along with P-6 group leader [[Elizabeth Riddle Graves]] at Los Alamos. The Coon and Graves groups utilized a 250 kV [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]] to accelerate [[Deuterons]] to bombard [[Tritium]] ([[Tritium|H-3]]) inside a [[Zirconium]] target with [[Tritium]] to produce 14 MeV [[neutrons]]. The scientists at Los Alamos were interested in how neutrons interacted with assorted [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear fuels]], [[Neutron reflector|tamper materials]], and [[fissile material]]s. The 14 MeV neutrons were used to perform studies that included: [[elastic scattering|elastic]] and [[inelastic scattering]]; interaction [[Neutron cross section|cross sections]] for the (n, 2n) reactions; interaction cross sections for [[Lithium]] and the production of undesirable particles; interaction cross sections of elements; bombardment of several substances and the resultant [[gamma radiation]] yield; neutron production and yield from fission; and neutron multiplication factors. Coon's group, Group P-4, used a [[Atomic pile|graphite pile]] to [[calibrate]] [[neutron source]]s. A new 600 kV [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]] was under construction.&lt;ref&gt;Glasstone, Samuel. (January 1954). Weapons Activities of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory of the University of California. LA-1632.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vela Satellite==

'''James Eagan Holmes''' (born December 13, 1987) is an American convicted murderer responsible for the [[2012 Aurora shooting]] in which he killed 12 people and injured 70 others at a [[Century Theatres|Century 16]] [[movie theater]] in [[Aurora, Colorado]] on July 20, 2012.&lt;ref name=cbs1&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57476636/colo-shooting-suspect-james-holmes-apartment-booby-trapped-police-say/ | title = Colo. shooting suspect James Holmes' apartment booby trapped, police say | publisher = CBS News | date = July 20, 2012 | accessdate =July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had no known criminal background  before the shooting occurred.&lt;ref name=cbs1 /&gt; Holmes [[booby-trap]]ped his apartment with explosives before the shooting, which were defused one day later by a bomb squad.

Holmes was arrested shortly after the shooting and was jailed without bail while awaiting trial. Following this, he was hospitalized after attempting suicide several times while in jail. Holmes entered a plea of [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]], which was accepted.

According to Holmes, during his childhood, he was frightened of what he called "Nail Ghosts" that would hammer on the walls at night. He would also see shadows and "flickers" at the corners of his eyes, which would fight each other with firearms and other weapons.

==Education and career==
In 2006, Holmes worked as an intern at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] where he was assigned to write computer code for an experiment. Holmes, who was described by his supervisor as stubborn, uncommunicative and socially inept, presented his project to the other interns at the end of the internship, but never actually completed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0723/Colorado-shooting-suspect-James-Holmes-was-an-unusually-bad-intern | title= Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes was an 'unusually bad intern' |work= [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date= July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/suspected-aurora-shooter-james-holmes-brilliant-a-long-shot-salk-institute-supervisor-john-jacobson-article-1.1120132 |title= Suspected Aurora shooter James Holmes brilliant?

Completing the project and presenting my model at the end of the internship was exhilarating."&lt;ref name=HolmesResume&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=James|title=Resume submitted to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|url=http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/12/08/Resume.pdf |publisher=Reuters|accessdate=August 11, 2012|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCR letters also described Holmes as "a very effective group leader" and a person who "takes an active role in his education, and brings a great amount of intellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom".&lt;ref name=NBC5_Chicago_1&gt;{{cite news|title=Man accused in Colo. shooting was accepted to UIUC|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Man-Accused-in-Colo-Shooting-Was-Accepted-to-UIUC-165807536.html|accessdate=August 11, 2012|newspaper=5 NBC Chicago|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Holmes worked as a counselor at a residential summer camp in [[Glendale, California]], that catered to children aged 7–14. There, he was responsible for ten children and had no disciplinary problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBC News|first=Bill |last=Dedman |title=Photos of James Holmes, camp counselor for underprivileged kids |url=http://openchannel.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/21/12878372-photos-of-james-holmes-camp-counselor-for-underprivileged-kids?chromedomain=usnews&amp;lite| date=July 21, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2010, Holmes was employed at a pill- and capsule-coating factory in [[San Diego County]]. One of his coworkers said that Holmes was unsocial, and once acted strangely in a laboratory work station by staring at a wall and not verbally responding, only smirking when his coworker asked if he was okay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Keith|last=Coffman|url=https://news.yahoo.com/co-worker-recalls-colorado-movie-massacre-gunman-acting-170111355.html|title=Coworker recalls Colorado movie massacre gunman acting 'spaced out'|work=[[Yahoo!

In June 2011, Holmes enrolled as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student in neuroscience at the [[Anschutz Medical Campus|University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus]] in Aurora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.lex18.com/news/shooting-suspect-was-graduate-student-at-colorado-medical-school |title= Shooting Suspect Was Graduate Student At Colorado Medical School | publisher=[[WLEX-TV]] | date= July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a $21,600 grant from the [[National Institutes of Health]], according to agency records, which was disbursed in installments from July 2011 to June 2012. Holmes also received a $5,000 [[stipend]] from the [[University of Colorado, Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Holmes received thousands from grad-school grants ahead of deadly Aurora shooting|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57479463/james-holmes-received-thousands-from-grad-school-grants-ahead-of-deadly-aurora-shooting/|series=CBS This Morning|work=CBS News|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seattle Times 2012-07-21" /&gt; Though Holmes received a letter of acceptance to UIUC, where he was offered a $22,600 stipend and free tuition, he declined their offer without specifying a reason. Reviewers of Holmes' application at UIUC remembered his application because he submitted a picture of himself with a [[llama]].&lt;ref name="NBC5_Chicago_1" /&gt;

In 2012, Holmes' academic performance declined,&lt;ref name="WashPost 2012-07-20 Leonnig Achenbach" /&gt; and he scored poorly on the [[Comprehensive examination#Graduate|comprehensive exam]] in the spring. The university was not planning to expel him; however, Holmes was in the process of withdrawing from the university.&lt;ref name="ucdenver statement" /&gt; Three days after failing a key oral exam at the university in early June 2012, Holmes dropped out of his studies without further explanation.&lt;ref name=hours&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Dan|title=James Holmes Bought Rifle After Failing Oral Exam at University of Colorado|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/james-holmes-bought-rifle-failing-oral-exam-university/story?id=16850268#.UBDFcDG3CFc|accessdate=July 26, 2012|work=[[ABC News]]|date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his arrest, he gave his occupation as "laborer."&lt;ref name="booking report"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sickles|first=Jason|title=Judge accused of creating ‘unusual shroud of secrecy’ in movie theater shooting case|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/judge-asked-reconsider-gag-order-movie-theater-shooting-114639357.html|newspaper=Yahoo News|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aurora theater shooting==

===Events leading up to the shooting===
Holmes' defense attorneys stated in a [[motion (legal)|motion]] that he was a psychiatric patient of the medical director of Anschutz's Student Mental Health Services prior to the Aurora shooting. The prosecutor disagreed with that claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colorado shooting suspect was a psychiatric patient|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/27/justice/colorado-theater-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 27, 2012|date=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense: Shooting suspect was seeing psychiatrist |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h_lDyz8m3VLePnk8xpv07zKCaFxg?docId=883953506ff04481b079fa76082223ee |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730200236/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h_lDyz8m3VLePnk8xpv07zKCaFxg?docId=883953506ff04481b079fa76082223ee |archivedate=July 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days after the release of the defense attorney's motion, the judge required this information to be blacked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meyer|first=Jeremy P.|title=Holmes court document revised four days after its release|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_21204243/holmes-court-document-revised-four-days-after-its?source=googlenews|accessdate=August 1, 2012| newspaper= The Denver Post|date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS News]] later reported that Holmes had met with at least three mental health professionals at the [[University of Colorado]] before the massacre. One of them, who was informed by Holmes of his homicidal thoughts, considered placing him on an involuntary mental health hold, but decided against it, noting her belief that Holmes was borderline and the commitment would only inflame him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/psychiatrist-colorado-movie-gunman-thought-mental-hold-might-024609685.html|title=Psychiatrist for Colorado movie gunman thought mental hold might 'inflame' him|work=Yahoo!

One of Holmes' psychiatrists suspected that prior to the shooting, Holmes suffered from a mental illness that could have been dangerous. A month before the tragedy, Dr. Lynne Fenton told the campus police that he had also made homicidal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychiatrist told campus police before Colo. theater attack Holmes had homicidal thoughts|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/colorado-judge-orders-documents-on-theater-shooting-suspect-released-after-media-request/2013/04/04/6b8ea7fe-9d74-11e2-9219-51eb8387e8f1_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=April 4, 2013|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before the massacre, Holmes sent a text message asking a graduate student if the student had ever heard of the disorder [[dysphoric mania]], and warning the student to stay away from him "because [he was] bad news".&lt;ref name="nytimes20120826"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/us/before-gunfire-in-colorado-theater-hints-of-bad-news-about-james-holmes.html |title=Before Gunfire, Hints of 'Bad News' |work=The New York Times |first1= Erica |last1=Goode |first2=Serge F. |last2=Kovaleski |first3=Jack |last3=Healy |first4=Dan |last4= Frosch |date=26 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BOiTyT0Z |archivedate=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes was a fan of [[superhero]]es, including [[Batman]], and his apartment was even decorated with Batman [[paraphernalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-colorado-shooting-sider-20120723,0,5449845.story |title= Profile of Aurora shooting suspect keeps getting murkier | newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 22 July 2012 |first1=Sam |last1=Quinones |first2=Kim |last2=Murphy |first3=Joe |last3=Mozingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Aragón, an actor from the  [[MTV]] television series ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'', stated that Holmes called him twice the month before the shooting took place. Aragón is the writer, director, and star of an upcoming film entitled ''The Suffocator of Sins'', which depicts a vigilante who shoots criminals, and Aragón claimed that Holmes showed interest in his movie's trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2012/08/01/mtv-star-claims-alleged-aurora-theater-shooter-called-him-prior-to-massacre/ |title= MTV Star Claims Alleged Aurora Theater Shooter Called Him Prior To Massacre | newspaper= [[CBS]] |date= August 1, 2012|accessdate= December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler, Holmes chose the Century 16 theater for his attack because he liked movie theaters and the specific theater had doors that he could lock in order to increase the number of casualties, as well as being in an area where police response would take longer. He specifically chose to attack a midnight screening because he believed fewer children would be present, not wanting to kill them. Holmes allegedly considered other locations for a mass shooting, such as an airport, but ruled it out because an airport would have too much security. He also wrote his reasoning that an attack on an airport would be confused as an act of terrorism, saying, "Terrorism isn't the message. The message is, there is no message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Perry|url=http://www.aurorasentinel.com/news/aurora-theater-shooting-trial-day-1/|title=Aurora Theater Shooting Trial: Day 1|work=[[Aurora Sentinel]]|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Holmes' notebook read to jury in Colorado movie massacre trial|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/26/us/james-holmes-trial-notebook/|work=CNN|date=May 26, 2015|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/01/colorado-cinema-gunman-pi_n_7487848.html|title=James Holmes Picked Midnight Movie To Avoid Shooting Children, Psychiatrist Says|work=Huffington Post|date=June 1, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he had been considering using explosives, chemical agents, or biological agents in his attack, but rejected the scenario as he thought he might "blow himself up". Holmes had also considered serial killing as an option, but later reasoned it was "too personal, too much evidence, easily caught, few kills."&lt;ref name="Broken"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/05/us/james-holmes-theater-shooting-trial/|title=A look inside the 'broken' mind of James Holmes|work=CNN|date=June 5, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions prior to shooting===
On May 22, 2012, Holmes purchased a [[Glock 22]] pistol at a [[Gander Mountain]] shop in [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]]. Six days later, on May 28, he bought a [[Remington Model 870|Remington 870 Express Tactical]] shotgun at a [[Bass Pro Shops]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michelle|last=Castillo|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57477014/colo-shooter-purchased-guns-legally-from-3-different-stores/|title=Colo. shooter purchased guns legally from 3 different stores|work=[[CBS News]]|date=July 20, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, just hours after failing his oral exam at the university, he purchased a [[Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P15]] rifle.&lt;ref name=hours/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellenews.com/2012/07/23/world/us-news/james-holmes-appears-in-court-being-accused-of-killing-12-people-in-aurora-cinema-shooting/ |title=James Holmes appears in court being accused of killing 12 people in Aurora cinema shooting &amp;#124; BelleNews.com, Latest News |publisher=Bellenews.com |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the weapons were bought legally and background checks were performed.&lt;ref name=ABCNewsJuly2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Moreno|first=Ivan|title=Police: Colo.

On June 25, less than a month before the shooting, Holmes emailed an application to join a gun club in [[Byers, Colorado]]. The owner, Glenn Rotkovich, called him several times throughout the following days to invite him to a mandatory orientation, but could only reach his answering machine. Holmes left Rotkovich one voicemail in reply. Due to the nature of Holmes' voicemail, which Rotkovich described as "bizarre", "freaky", "guttural", "spoken with a deep voice", "incoherent and rambling", Rotkovich instructed his staff to inform him if Holmes showed up, though Holmes neither appeared at the gun range nor called back. "In hindsight, looking back&amp;nbsp;– and if I'd seen the movies&amp;nbsp;– maybe I'd say it was like [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]&amp;nbsp;– I would have gotten the Joker out of it...

===Shooting and arrest===

On July 20, 2012, police arrested Holmes without resistance while he was standing next to his car behind the [[Century Theatres|Century 16]] theater, moments after the shooting. Holmes had snuck out an exit door, propped it open, and returned with weapons and other gear, setting off several gas or smoke canisters and then opening fire on the theater audience, killing 12 and wounding 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/07/us/aurora.shooting/index.html|title=Timeline: Colorado theater shooting|work=CNN|accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Officials release complete list of injured victims in Aurora massacre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/01/10/officials-release-complete-list-injured-victims-in-aurora-massacre/|title=Officials release complete list of injured victims in Aurora massacre|work=Fox News|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to testimonies during the following trial, Holmes was initially "calm and detached" during the arrest, but became interested in watching the aftermath of the shooting after being placed in the back of a police car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/01/james-holmes-police-testify-theater-shooting-trial_n_7177430.html|title=Police Say James Holmes Was Keenly Interested In Aftermath Of Theater Shooting|work=Huffington Post|date=May 1, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The responding officers recovered several guns from inside the car and the theater.

According to two federal authorities, Holmes had dyed his hair orange and had called himself "The Joker".&lt;ref name="ABC 2012-07-21 Joker" /&gt; The claim that Holmes had called himself "The Joker" was later retracted by police&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcCZSkydtaE|title=James Holmes Said He Was the Joker -Turns out, Not True - Yes on the Hair, No On the Utterance|date=August 12, 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from news sources such as ''[[Face the Nation]]'' on the [[CBS News]] network.

Once apprehended, Holmes told the police that he had [[booby trap|booby-trapped]] his apartment with explosive devices before heading to the theater.&lt;ref name="abc120720e" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dench120720n" /&gt;&lt;ref name="locations" /&gt; Police later confirmed the presence of explosives in the apartment.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2012-07-20 booby-trapped" /&gt;

==Legal proceedings==

===Detention and pretrial court appearances===
Holmes was initially jailed at Arapahoe Detention Center, under [[suicide watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1 = Matthew | last1 = Lysiak | first2 = James | last2 = Arkin | first3 = Larry | last3 = Mcshane | title = Aurora shooting suspect James Holmes jailed in solitary: 'All the inmates were talking about killing him' | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/aurora-shooting-suspect-james-holmes-jailed-solitary-inmates-talking-killing-article-1.1119173 | accessdate =July 22, 2012|newspaper= Daily News | location = New York | date = July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was being held in [[solitary confinement]] to protect him from other inmates, a routine precaution for high-profile cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120723/james-eagan-holmes-will-appear-court-monday|title=James Eagan Holmes will appear in court on Monday|work=Global Post|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, Colorado prosecutors filed formal charges against Holmes that included 24 counts of [[first degree murder]], 116 counts of [[attempted murder]], possession of explosive devices, and inciting violence. The multiple charges expand the opportunities for prosecutors to obtain convictions. For each person killed in the shooting, Holmes was charged with one count of murder with deliberation and one count of murder with extreme indifference.&lt;ref name=Riccard&gt;{{cite web|last=Riccardi|first=Nicholas|title=Colo.

On August 9, Holmes's attorneys said their client was mentally ill and that they needed more time to assess the nature of his illness. The disclosure was made at a court hearing in Centennial where news media organizations were asking a judge to unseal court documents in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Banda|first=Solomon|title=LAWYERS: COLO.

On September 19, the prosecution filed a motion to add 10 new charges against Holmes and asked to amend 17 others. The additional charges would bring the total counts Holmes faces to 152.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingold|first=John|title=Prosecutors seek to add 10 charges against theater shooting suspect|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_21584139/prosecutors-add-10-new-charges-against-aurora-theater|work=The Denver Post|date=September 19, 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Holmes appeared in the Arapahoe County Court house the following day for the first time without his dyed-red hair, but with cropped hair revealing his natural brown color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-20/news/33982806_1_hair-james-holmes-prosecutors|author=Stephen Rex Brown|title=James Holmes has brown hair now|work=The New York Daily News|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, court documents released by prosecutors say Holmes was revoked access to the [[University of Colorado]] campus because he threatened a professor. The university has said Holmes was denied access to non-public parts of the campus because he had withdrawn from school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutors: Shooting suspect threatened professor| author=Gary Strauss|date=September 28, 2012| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012/09/28/court-to-release-documents-in-colorado-theater-shooting/57850760/1?csp=breakingnews| work=USA Today|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, Holmes's attorneys asked Judge William Sylvester to postpone a preliminary hearing scheduled for November. On October 25, the preliminary hearing was set for the week of January 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coffman|first=Keith|title=Preliminary hearing in Colorado movie rampage case set for January  |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-shooting-denverbre89o1mj-20121025,0,4281743.story|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes' lawyers filed an emergency motion on November 14 to delay a pre-trial hearing, citing an unspecified condition that has left him unable to appear in court: "As a result of developments over the past 24 hours, Mr. Holmes is in a condition that renders him unable to be present in court for tomorrow's hearing." They requested to delay the hearing, which they received. It was rescheduled for December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accused Colorado gunman cannot attend court due to condition: lawyer|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/14/us-usa-colorado-shooting-idUSBRE8AD1TE20121114|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=November 14, 2012|date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidently, Holmes made various suicide attempts referred to as "half-hearted" in the days before the scheduled hearing on November 15.&lt;ref name="suicideattempt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colorado massacre suspect has made half-hearted suicide attempts|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57550077/colorado-massacre-suspect-has-made-half-hearted-suicide-attempts/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes returned to court on January 7, 2013, at which [[9-1-1]] phone call recordings and videos from the cineplex were presented as evidence, information that up until then had not been released. Holmes' defense team continued to maintain that he was mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/01/accused-colo-shooter-james-holmes-in-court/ |title=Accused Colo.

It was not revealed what the prescriptions were or what they were for.

On January 10, 2013, a judge ruled that the evidence presented is sufficient for Holmes to face trial on all counts with which he has been charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge rules James Holmes should face trial in Colorado massacre |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/01/10/james-holmes-not-ready-for-arraignment-defense-attorneys-say/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=January 11, 2013|date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plea hearing was delayed until March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Delays Arraignment In Colo.

===Trial===
On February 27, 2014, Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour set the start of Holmes' trial for October 14. However, the trial was delayed to December 8 upon a defense request for a continuance to further evaluate Holmes mental condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25238865/new-trial-date-expected-aurora-theater-shooting-case |title=Judge sets October trial for James Holmes in Aurora theater shooting |work=The Denver Post |first=John |last=Ingold |date=February 27, 2014 |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/state-news/judge-sets-new-dec-8-trial-date-for-james-holmes Judge sets new Dec. 8 trial date for James Holmes]" ''The Denver Channel'', July 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On that date, the trial was again postponed as Holmes' lawyers asked for another continuance to further prepare their case and review the paperwork of evidence.&lt;ref name="Judge considering another James Holmes trial delay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/12/08/judge-could-consider-trial-delay-as-attorneys-in-colorado-theater-shooting-head/|title=Judge considering another James Holmes trial delay|work=Fox News|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jury selection eventually started on January 20, 2015, after a request by Holmes' lawyers for yet another continuance was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-james-holmes-trial-20150120-story.html|title=Jury selection gets underway in Colorado theater massacre trial|author=Los Angeles Times|date=January 20, 2015|work=latimes.com|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The juror selection process lasted three months and [[Summons|summoned]] 9,000 candidates, making it the largest jury summons in U.S. history. On April 15, selection ended, with a total of nineteen women and five men serving. There were concerns about the selection of the jurors since at least two from the pool of twelve primary jurors, along with twelve alternatives, had ties to the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]]: "Juror No. 535", the aunt of a Columbine survivor; and "Juror No. 737", a man who was a student there at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/details-emerge-about-jury-picked-for-colorado-theater-shooting-trial-192409225.html|title=Details emerge about jury picked for Colorado theater shooting trial|work=Yahoo!

The trial began on April 27 with opening arguments by the prosecution explaining that Holmes intentionally went to the movie theater that evening with the deliberate intent to kill as many people as possible in a mass shooting spree. The defense opened up their argument by admitting all the facts that Holmes was indeed the shooter, but that he is mentally ill with severe schizophrenia and was never in control of his right mind. Starting on April 28, and over the next few weeks, prosecution testimony included various survivors of the massacre and the after effects it had on the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-james-holmes-trial-20150428-story.html |title=James Holmes trial: 'It was a pool of blood my face was in ... somebody else's' |author=Maria L.

On May 26, the notebook Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist hours prior to the shooting was presented as evidence. There had previously been intense debate as to whether the notebook was eligible as evidence and should be admitted, since it details Holmes' thoughts. Prosecutors argued the content in Holmes' notebook, which detailed attack plans, proved the shooting was premeditated, while Holmes' attorneys argued that his writing indicated his mental illness.&lt;ref name="HolmesNotebook"/&gt;

On May 27, Dr. William Reid, a court-appointed psychiatrist who interviewed Holmes for a total of about 22 hours, testified that Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane, diagnosing him as having [[schizotypal personality disorder]], which is characterized by constricted behavior and difficulties relating to others. Reid and another doctor evaluated Holmes in December 2013, determining him to be legally sane, and that his mental illness did not prevent him from forming intent and knowing the consequences of his actions. Holmes's attorneys tried to call for a mistrial, saying that the jurors heard an unprompted opinion that complicated the legal standard for judging the sanity of a person, but the judge refused to grant the request.&lt;ref name="22Hours"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broken"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Elliot|url=http://m.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Theater-shooting-prosecutors-build-case-that-6290916.php|title=Psychiatrist: Colorado shooter knew what he was doing|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 27, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Killer James Holmes’s Notes: Detailed Plans vs. 'a Whole Lot of Crazy'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/us/james-holmess-notebook-and-insanity-debate-at-aurora-shooting-trial.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the videos, Holmes described his social awkwardness and the violent, paranoid thoughts he had been having prior to the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-holmes-recalls-his-state-of-mind-before-colorado-shooting/|title=James Holmes recalls his state of mind before Colorado shooting|work=CBS News|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated his belief that he was being followed by federal agents at the time of the massacre and hoped they would apprehend him at the theater before he could act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/aurora-shooter-james-holmes-loved-comedies-wanted-arrest-article-1.2240883|title=Aurora shooter James Holmes loved comedies, hoped feds would lock him away before killing spree|work=New York Daily News|date=May 30, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, he transitioned from suicidal thoughts to homicidal thoughts after becoming depressed from his breakup with Gargi Datta.&lt;ref name="FirstLove"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/latest-glitch-delays-video-theater-shooting-trial-31394400|title=The Latest: Holmes Says Depression Drove Him to Kill|work=ABC News|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3103237/Dark-Knight-gunman-said-hoped-FBI-STOP-Colorado-theater-massacre-said-depressed-breaking-girlfriend.html|title=Dark Knight gunman said he hoped FBI would STOP him before Colorado theater massacre... and said his 'mind was falling apart' after breaking up with girlfriend|work=Daily Mail|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, a second psychiatrist, Jeffrey Metzner, testified that Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane when he plotted and carried out the shooting, and that he suffers from [[schizoaffective disorder]].

On June 9, the trial came to a standstill after three jurors were dismissed by the judge for violating their orders to not talk about news reports regarding the trial: "Juror No. 872", a white woman in her twenties or thirties with three children; "Juror No. 412", a white woman in her twenties or thirties who is employed with a mental health company; and "Juror No. 495", a white woman in her late twenties to early thirties.

Judge [[Carlos Samour]] responded that he would consider it, and agreed to the motion by dismissing her on June 15. On June 17, a fifth juror was dismissed after Judge Samour was advised that she personally knew a wounded victim of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/theater-shooters-ex-didnt-see-future-him-071805977.html#|title=Theater shooter's ex asked him to see therapist|work=Yahoo!

On June 19, the prosecution called as their last witness Ashley Moser, the mother of slain victim Veronica Moser-Sullivan, who was critically injured and paralyzed in the shooting. Afterwards, they rested their case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-holmes-trial-prosecutors-wrap-up-case/|title=Woman who lost everything caps prosecution in Holmes trial|work=CBS News|date=June 19, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, Samour asked Holmes if he would testify in court, and advised him of his rights to do so.

On July 10, the defense showed two videos of Holmes' strange behavior in his jail cell. One video showed him running and slamming his head against the wall before sitting down, while the other showed him tethered to a bed while naked, attempting to cover his head with a blanket and then a sheet.

On July 14, closing statements were made following a delay that resulted when the defense claimed some of the images planned to be shown to the jury by the prosecution were improper.

However, the jurors decided that Holmes did not intend to kill children when he opened fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Maria L.|last=LaGanga|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-james-holmes-phase-one-deliberations-20150723-story.html|title=James Holmes jury find aggravating factors exist, moves on to second phase|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, Holmes' sister testified that her brother became withdrawn from the family after they moved from [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] to [[San Diego]] during his early teenage years. On July 28, Holmes' father pleaded for his son's life, stating that he is severely mentally ill and does not deserve to die, regardless of his crimes.

On August 7, Holmes was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after jurors failed to unanimously agree on a death sentence.

===Restitution===
On December 4, 2015, Judge Carlos Samour ordered Holmes to pay $955,000 in [[restitution]] to the victims. The judgment ordered $851,000 of the restitution to be sent to the state victim compensation fund, and $103,000 to be paid directly to the victims.&lt;ref name="Restitution"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wyatt, Kristen|url= http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/colorado-theater-shooter-ordered-pay-955k-restitution|title=Colorado theater shooter ordered to pay $955K in restitution|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 7, 2015|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
In September 2015, Holmes was moved to the [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] in [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]]. According to authorities, they have not determined what facility Holmes will be ultimately incarcerated at, but say it is possible he may be moved out of state due to his high profile.&lt;ref name="COSP"&gt;{{cite web|author=Coffman, Keith|url= https://news.yahoo.com/cinema-massacre-gunman-moved-colorado-state-penitentiary-005321238.html|title=Cinema massacre gunman moved to Colorado state penitentiary|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=September 11, 2015|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2015, Holmes was assaulted by another inmate, identified as Mark Daniels, who was convicted of auto theft. Daniels attacked Holmes after a prison guard inadvertently opened a gate separating the two of them; he struck Holmes twice before being subdued by prison staff. At the time, Holmes was not allowed interaction with other inmates. As a result of the attack, he was secretly transferred to an undisclosed location out of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/exclusive-inside-prison-assault-aurora-theater-shooter-james/story?id=37339691|title=Exclusive: Inside the Prison Assault on Aurora Theater Shooter James Holmes|work=ABC News|date=March 3, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the inmate locator on the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, Holmes is currently incarcerated at [[United States Penitentiary, Allenwood |USP Allenwood]] in [[Gregg Township, Union County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ |title=Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maia Estianty''' (born '''Maya Estianty''', 27 January 1976), known as '''Maia Ahmad''' during her marriage to fellow musician [[Ahmad Dhani]], is an Indonesian songwriter, music producer, singer, dancer and actress.

Estianty was born in [[Surabaya]], East Java, and showed interest in music at an early age, winning a [[marching band]] competition while still in elementary school. She began training as a [[disc jockey]] while still in junior high school; it was around this time that she first met Dhani. After studying at the [[University of Indonesia]], Estianty joined Dewa 19 as a [[backing vocalist]]. In 1999, she and Dhani came up with the idea for the musical duo [[Ratu (band)|Ratu]]. Estianty played the music, while other women&amp;nbsp;– first [[Pinkan Mambo]], then [[Mulan Jameela]]&amp;nbsp;– sang. Ratu was highly successful. After the dissolution of the band in 2007 and a bitter divorce in September 2008, Estianty formed Duo Maia with [[Mey Chan]]. She is currently focusing on producing music with her label, Le Moesik.

==Early life==
Estianty was born in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]], on 27 January 1976. She was the fifth of six children born to Harjono Sigit and his wife Kusthini.{{sfn|Asrianti 2009, Maia: Bearing it all}}{{sfn|Nova 2008, Tak Ada Kata Mundur}}{{sfn|Nova 2005, Prestasi Merosot Tajam}} She is the great-granddaughter of [[Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto|Tjokroaminoto]], a nationalist Muslim leader and [[National Hero of Indonesia|National Hero]], through her father's side.{{sfn|Tempo 2011, Ilmu Tjokroaminoto}}

As a child, Estianty often fought with her classmates; in an interview with the weekly entertainment magazine ''Tabloid Nova'', she recalled that, while at Yohanes Gabriel Catholic Elementary School in Surabaya, she once hit a classmate with an object so hard that the classmate began to bleed profusely.{{sfn|Nova 2005, Prestasi Merosot Tajam}} She also took up music during this time, leading her [[marching band]] to win a national championship; she also took up the piano.{{sfn|Nova 2005, Prestasi Merosot Tajam}}

As a student at State Junior High School 1 in Surabaya, Estianty took up modelling; in 1990 she won the Yess Modelling Competition for Teenagers, which provoked a number of modelling offers. She also began working part-time at a radio station and learned how to be a [[disc jockey]].{{sfn|Nova 2005, Prestasi Merosot Tajam}} At a birthday party while in junior high school, a friend introduced her to [[Ahmad Dhani]]; Estianty and Dhani began writing songs for the piano together.{{sfn|Nova 2005, Dapat Lagu Cinta}} Having received good marks in elementary school and junior high school, while in senior high school she began dating, first with a classmate then with Dhani, and her scores dropped drastically.{{sfn|Nova 2005, Prestasi Merosot Tajam}}{{sfn|Nova 2005, Dapat Lagu Cinta}}

Towards the end of senior high school, Estianty and her father began arguing about her work and poor performance at school. Estianty threatened to move out; in response, Sigit said he would support her, on the condition she continue her studies at a state university.{{sfn|Nova 2005, Dapat Lagu Cinta}} Estianty enrolled at the [[University of Indonesia]], first in the [[Dutch literature]] programme then in the communications programme. During this time she became a [[backing vocalist]] for Dhani's band [[Dewa 19]]; the two married in the late 1990s.{{sfn|Nova 2005, Dapat Lagu Cinta}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Dhani Dewa 2005 1.JPG|thumb|100px|Ahmad Dhani]]
Estianty and Dhani divorced on 23 September 2008. The separation of the couple, who had been married for twelve years and had three sons; Ahmad Al Ghazali, Ahmad El Jallaludin Rumi, and Ahmad Abdul Qodir Jaelani, was not amicable; Estianty filed a police complaint accusing Dhani of abuse,{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2011, Dhani Rages}} and Dhani refused to give Estianty custody of their children, appealing to the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]] after several lower courts ruled that the children were Estianty's.{{sfn|Jakarta Post 2010, Maia’s long battle}} In 2011 Dhani was reportedly in a relationship with Mulan and had a child with her,{{sfn|Asrianti 2009, Maia: Bearing it all}}{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2010, Maia Says New Hubby}}{{sfn|Jakarta Post 2011, Dhani, Maia blame each other}} and Dhani gave Estianty [[visitation rights]] in 2012.{{sfn|Okki 2012, Dapat Izin Ahmad Dhani}}
Maia submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court, because Maia could not easily meet her children. On May 14, 2013 the Supreme Court decided that the children could choose themselves since the children were considered capable to make a decision. Dhani agreed with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blitz.rmol.co/read/2013/05/28/112267/PK-Terkabul,-Anak-Pilih-Maia-Atau-Dhani- |title=PK Terkabul, Anak Pilih Maia Atau Dhani? |date=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2018, she married businessman Irwan Mussry in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].

==Ratu==
In 1999 Estianty and Dhani agreed to establish a musical duo consisting of a singer and musician, based on concepts pioneered by international bands like [[Roxette]] and [[Savage Garden]].{{sfn|Rusmitantri 2003, Duo Ratu, Dhani}} [[Pinkan Mambo]], a café singer, was chosen to be the second member of the newly formed group, named [[Ratu (band)|Ratu]], meaning Queen.{{sfn|Sondang 2008, Pinkan Mambo, Telepon}} After three years of training,{{sfn|Rusmitantri 2003, Duo Ratu, Dhani}} Ratu released its first album, ''Bersama'' (''Together''), in 2003, which was influenced by [[R&amp;B]].{{sfn|Asrianti 2009, Maia: Bearing it all}} Maia wrote seven songs on the album, while Dhani did the other three.{{sfn|Rusmitantri 2003, Duo Ratu, Dhani}} The album was a commercial success, selling 250,000 copies.{{sfn|SCTV, Maia Ahmad, Si Emak}}

Although Mambo and Estianty began work on another album, Mambo withdrew from the group in 2004 after widespread coverage of her being pregnant and unmarried.{{sfn|Nova 2008, Pinkan Mambo, Habis}} Maia and Dhani began looking for a replacement. They agreed on [[Mulan Jameela]], a café singer from [[Bandung]] who took the stage name Mulan Kwok; her appointment was announced on 7 April 2005.{{sfn|Yordenaya 2005, Mulan Vokalis Baru}} That August, Ratu released the album ''Ratu and Friends'' in collaboration with numerous other artists.{{sfn|Asrianti 2009, Maia: Bearing it all}} The album, which featured two songs by Ratu,{{sfn|Syamsudin W 2005, Menjawab Keraguan}} sold more than 400,000 copies and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] in Indonesia.{{sfn|Asmoro 2006, Ratu – No. Satu}} The title of the single "Teman Tapi Mesra", often abbreviated TTM and released to promote ''Ratu and Friends'', became widely used to describe those in a physical relationship without an emotional one.{{sfn|Suara Merdeka 2006, Dari TTM, Ganti}}

The following year Maia garnered a role in the [[Trans TV]]-funded comedy programme ''Extravanganza'', where she was the only non-[[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] cast member.{{sfn|Tempo 2006, Maia Ahmad: Canggung Melawak}} Also in 2006, Ratu released ''Nomor Satu'' (''Number One''), with pop-rock influences;{{sfn|Asrianti 2009, Maia: Bearing it all}} Maia wrote most of the songs.{{sfn|Tembang.com, No. Satu: Aih,}} The album was a commercial success; it sold 200,000 copies nationally on the day of its release, a record for a work by a female Indonesian group.{{sfn|Asmoro 2006, Ratu – No. Satu}} However, conflicts between Dhani and Estianty, as well as concerns over Jameela's payment, led Ratu to disband in 2007.{{sfn|Kartikawati 2006, November: Selebritis Kembali}}{{sfn|Kartikawati 2007, Babak Baru Maia-Dhani:}}

==Duo Maia and acting==
Estianty with [[Mey Chan]] made Duo Maia. Together they released the album ''Maia and Friends'' in 2008;{{sfn|Asrianti 2009, Maia: Bearing it all}} the album was in direct competition with Jameela's album. The songs on ''Maia and Friends'' were all written by Estianty. It featured duets with artists such as [[Gita Gutawa]], [[Gigi (Indonesian band)|Gigi]], and [[Glenn Fredly]].{{sfn|Soedarjo 2008, Former Ratu members}} That year she was one of ten women honoured at the Tribute To Women ceremony held by the [[ANTARA|Antara News Agency]]; other honourees included author [[Ayu Utami]] and economist [[Sri Mulyani Indrawati]].{{sfn|Gatra 2008, Maia Dianugerahi}}

Estianty played in ''Kata Maaf Terakhir'' (''The Last Apology'') in 2009 as Dania, the ex-wife to whom Darma ([[Tio Pakusadewo]]) must apologise before he dies. Marcel Thee, writing in ''[[The Jakarta Globe]]'', described her acting as well done.{{sfn|Thee 2009, 'Kata Maaf Terakhir'}} That same year she released ''Sang Juara'' (''The Champion'') as part of Duo Maia. In an interview with ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', she explained that she had written the titular song after hearing [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s power ballad "[[We Are the Champions]]" at a basketball match; she realised that there were no Indonesian songs which could be used in the same situation.{{sfn|Asrianti 2009, Maia: Bearing it all}} Along with [[Dewiq]] and Agus Wisman, she was a judge of the [[Global TV (Indonesia)|Global TV]]-sponsored musical talent show ''Dream Girls'', which was open exclusively to mothers.{{sfn|Gatra 2009, Maia Estianty}}

In early 2010 Estianty established the recording studio Le Moesiek; several established artists, including [[Krisdayanti]] and [[Julia Perez]], signed on quickly. At the time she owned five other business ventures, including a [[steakhouse]], an [[outsourcing]] company, and a cafe.{{sfn|Tempo 2011, Siap Banting Setir}} Estianty was reported in October 2010 to be working on a [[cover album]] which featured works originally sung by [[Nike Ardilla]], [[Hetty Koes Endang]], and Atiek&amp;nbsp;CB.{{sfn|Jakarta Post 2010, Maia Estianty Sings}} Later that year she was chosen as Ambassador on Domestic Violence by the Indonesian Ministry for Women's Issues. Dhani objected to the appointment and threatened to sue the ministry, as he took offence to suggestions that he had abused Estianty.{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2011, Dhani Rages}}

In April 2012 Estianty announced that, although Duo Maia would continue to perform, she intended to focus on her work as a producer; she had spent the previous several months focusing on her managerial duties at Le Moesik. Meanwhile, Chan would begin a solo career.{{sfn|Jakarta Globe 2012, Maia Estianty}}{{sfn|Okki 2012, Maia Estianty Bicara Karier}}

He worked as a pastor between 1984 and 1991, and from the 1990s onward he has also been a serial entrepreneur (IT, Internet, HR, energy, waste, utilities and infrastructure).&lt;ref name="pioneering energy news release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneering Energy from Waste Plant Proposed in Doncaster|url=http://www.waystone.co.uk/News/NEWS-RELEASE---Pioneering-Energy-from-Waste-Plant-Proposed-in-Doncaster|publisher=Waystone corporation|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vinzent has held academic posts as senior research fellow at King's College, Cambridge (1991-3), senior research fellow at the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaft (tenure), Berlin (1993-5), C4-professor (non-tenure) for history of theology in the times of the Reformation and Modernity, University of Mainz, Germany (1996-7), C4-professor for history of theology (tenure), University of Cologne, Germany (1997-9), HG Wood Professor of Theology, University of Birmingham (1999-2010), including a stint as head of department (1999-2001). He joined the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at King's College London in September 2010. During the years 2010 to 2015 he served as Adjunct Professor of Korea University, Seoul. Since 2012 he is Fellow of the Max Weber Centre for Advanced Social and Cultural Studies, Erfurt University. Additionally, in 2015/2016 Fellow of TOPOI, Humboldt University Berlin, and in 2017/2018 Guest scholar at Augsburg University, Germany.

In 2003 he initiated and co-authored the famous Birmingham study with Guidelines on the ‘Trialogue of Cultures’ as a result of a major 8-European-country study of teaching and learning about Islam, Judaism and Christianity in schools, funded by the ALTANA/BMW-Foundation (Herbert-Quandt-Stiftung) with a major research grant (2000-2002). This resulted in the creation of a 10-year initiative by the foundation in which during the years 2005 to 2015 around 200 German schools took part in a trialogue competition. The aim was, based on the Guidelines to develop creative projects in schools for a better co-cultural-living. The results have led to a long list of publications, a children broadcast teaching course by the Hessische Rundfunk and various other media.

Together with Professor Allen Brent, he has directed the major research project on 'Early Christian Iconography and Epigraphy', a project generously funded by the British Academy (2011–12); as prime investigator he was running the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funded major research project on ‘Meister Eckhart and the early 14th century Parisian University’ (2013-2016) following his re-discovery of new Parisian Questions of this famous medieval philosopher and theologian. He is now co-leading together with Marie-Anne Vannier (Université de Lorraine, Metz) a major research project on ‘Teaching and Preaching with Patristic auctoritates – Meister Eckhart in France and Germany, past and present’, funded by the French Agence National de la Recherche (ANR) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (2018-2021).
 
Since 2003 he has served as one of the directors of the [[International Conference on Patristic Studies]], is editor-in-chief of [[Studia Patristica]], the conference's official publication, and the editor of the series Eckhart: Texts and Studies. Together with Professor Allen Brent, he is directing the major research project on 'Early Christian Iconography and Epigraphy', a project generously funded by the British Academy (2011–12).

== Contributions ==

In a series of monographs he has published on early Christian beliefs (Monarchianism, Trinity, Apostles' Creed) and their reception in the Middle Ages, the Enlightenment and in contemporary theology. His main contribution to the field of historical theology is his radical attempt to read sources non-anachronistically. As a result, Christianity is seen as a religion which developed its contours much later than previously assumed. In his recent monograph on the Resurrection, he argues that its foundational writings, especially the canonical and non-canonical Gospels, all stem from the middle of the second century, and even Paul's letters, written around the mid first century, only became influential a hundred years later. The Roman teacher and businessman [[Marcion of Sinope]] is identified as one of the key thinkers and founders of Christianity. Key concepts like Christianity as a separate 'religion', being based not only on sayings of a Rabbi Jesus, but on the exemplary life of a divine messenger and saviour Jesus Christ who died on the cross and rose again, the 'Gospel' as a new literary genre that encapsulates the novelty of Christ's message and of Christianity, the 'New Testament' as the title of the collection of the foundational writings of this new religion (in antithesis to the 'Old Testament' of the Jewish law and the prophets), the introduction of sacraments, new ways of fasting and asceticism all go back to this Roman teacher.&lt;ref name="Resurrection pg 84-96"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vinzent|first=Markus|title=Christ's Resurrection in Early Christianity and the making of the New Testament|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409417927|pages=84–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Vinzent has shown that the Christian Creed is a later development and, like that of Christian festivals (except Easter which was adopted from Judaism, but was radically altered by Marcion – a change which was adopted only at a time when the other festivals were introduced) is a product of the fourth century. Especially the Apostles' Creed seems to have derived from the dogmatic disputes in the 340 AD.&lt;ref name="Resurrection pg 181, 226"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vinzent|first=Markus|title=Christ's Resurrection in Early Christianity and the making of the New Testament|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409417927|pages=181, 226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of Vinzent's views, the early history and the nature of Christianity looks very different from our common understanding. Christianity developed as one of the Jewish sects and did not move beyond this framework before the reconceptualization by Marcion of Sinope in the years after 140 AD. Moreover, the various theologies and communities that mushroomed from the mid second century became gradually influenced by the 'Gospel(s)' and 'Paul'.

A more recent research area of Vinzent is Meister Eckhart (c. 1260–1329), his writings and thinking. Vinzent argues that Eckhart was an extraordinarily creative Christian thinker who re-conceptualized almost every key idea of his religion. He shows that Eckhart challenged even core concepts like the 'Trinity', the 'Fall', the 'Sacraments' and other ideas that normally are taken for granted as being central to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Art of Detachment pg 1-26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vinzent|first=Markus|title=The Art of Detachment |year=2011|publisher= Peeters |isbn= 9789042925267 |pages=1–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both subject areas link to Vinzent's attempt to push the boundaries of theology and to develop a radical transformational theology by which this subject such as the resurrection are understood as being principally open to challenge, criticism and reformulation. He claims that theology is measured against its natural claim of dealing with the very first principle(s) and truth. As such, it cannot be conceived as a closed system, but needs to be co-essential with that of its own object.

== Boating accident and disappearance ==

{{Further information|Not Without Hope}}

On March 1, 2009, the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] reported that a 21-foot fishing boat was missing off the Gulf Coast near [[Clearwater, Florida]].  The boat was carrying four passengers: Cooper, [[Corey Smith (American football)|Corey Smith]], and two former [[South Florida Bulls football|University of South Florida football]] players, Nick Schuyler and Will Bleakley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2009/3/1/443250.html |title=Crews still searching for missing boaters |accessdate=2009-03-07 |date=2009-03-02 |work=[[Bay News 9]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304165519/http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2009/3/1/443250.html |archivedate=March 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four men left Clearwater Pass on February 28 at 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and were expected to return later that night. The Coast Guard began searching for the missing boat shortly after midnight on March 1, 2009. By 1:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time on March 2, 2009, the boat had been located, overturned, with Schuyler clinging to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2009/3/2/443443.html?title=Report:+Nick+Schuyler+found+clinging+to+boat |title=Report: Nick Schuyler found clinging to boat |accessdate=2009-03-07 |date=2009-03-02 |work=Bay News 9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306211602/http://www.baynews9.com/content/36/2009/3/2/443443.html?title=Report%3A%2BNick%2BSchuyler%2Bfound%2Bclinging%2Bto%2Bboat |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for the three missing men was called off by the Coast Guard, but friends and relatives organized their own search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/03/florida.missing.boaters/index.html |title=Coast Guard suspends search for NFL players, friend |accessdate=2009-03-07 |date=2009-03-04 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private search was called off on March 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3958269  |title=Cooper family: Time to begin healing |accessdate=2009-03-07 |date=2009-03-06 |work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper, Smith, and Bleakley are presumed dead.&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel/&gt; On March 11, Cooper's wife filed for a [[death certificate]] in civil court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,508999,00.html |title=Wife of NFL Player Lost at Sea Files for Death Certificate |accessdate=2009-03-12 |date=2009-03-12 |work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2009, a report was released based on a [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]] investigation into the capsizing; the investigation included interviews with Schuyler (the survivor) and an inspection of the boat.  The report concluded the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.myfwc.com/docs/Newsroom/FWC_BoatingAccidentInvestigationFWSW_09_OFF_1335.pdf |publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission |title=Florida Boating Accident Investigation Report |date=March 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331032546/http://www.myfwc.com/docs/Newsroom/FWC_BoatingAccidentInvestigationFWSW_09_OFF_1335.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the anchor line was tied to the port-side [[transom (nautical)|transom]] as part of a (mistaken) plan to free the anchor;
* the vessel, which had a {{convert|200|hp|kW}} motor, was then throttled forward;
* the rear of the vessel was pulled into the water because the vessel's motor had been throttled without enough slack in the anchor line; and
* the capsizing ejected the operator and occupants into rough Gulf waters.
The conclusions were accompanied by additional details from the Schuyler interviews. According to Schuyler, after the capsizing, he and the other three men, all wearing [[flotation device]]s, struggled overnight to remain on top of the capsized hull of the boat, with water reaching chest-high over the partially submerged hull and waves of approximately 6 feet. Cooper and Smith became non-responsive and separated from the vessel between 5:30 and 6:30 the morning of March 1, and Bleakley became non-responsive and separated about 24 hours later, which was less than six hours before Schuyler was rescued. The investigator described the symptoms Schuyler witnessed as characteristic of [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.myfwc.com/docs/Newsroom/FWC_BoatingAccidentInvestigationFWSW_09_OFF_1335.pdf |publisher=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission |title=Florida Boating Accident Investigation Report |date=March 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331032546/http://www.myfwc.com/docs/Newsroom/FWC_BoatingAccidentInvestigationFWSW_09_OFF_1335.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melford Obiene Okilo''' (30 November 1933 – 5 July 2008) had a long and distinguished career as a politician in [[Nigeria]] from the start of independence in 1960 until shortly before his death in 2008. 
He was a member of parliament (1956–1964) and a Minister in the [[Nigerian First Republic]].

==Early career==

Okilo was born on 30 November 1933 at Emakalakala, Ogbia, [[Bayelsa State]], and was of [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] origin.
He qualified as a lawyer, but entered politics at the age of 23.&lt;ref name=tday607&gt;{{cite web

Okilo was a member of Parliament between 1956 and 1959. In December 1959 he was re-elected to represent the Brass constituency on the [[Niger Delta Congress]] platform.
The Prime Minister, Sir [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]], later appointed him Parliamentary Secretary and Minister.&lt;ref name=ikein&gt;{{cite book

He played a significant role in the enactment of the Niger Delta Development Board (1961), which sought to address problems of the neglected Niger Delta region.&lt;ref name=yellowe&gt;{{cite web

While visiting New York in 1965, he came across a book about [[Walter Russell]], ''The Man Who Tapped the Secrets of the Universe'', which had a profound influence on his thought. Walter Russell's University of Science and Philosophy later published his books, and in the late 1990s he served as president of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the military regime of General [[Yakubu Gowon]], Okilo served in the government in Rivers State first as Commissioner of Education, and then of Agriculture, Fisheries and Natural Resources (1971–1975).&lt;ref name=yellowe/&gt;

==Second republic==

During General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s regime, he was a member of the Constituent Assembly (1977–78) leading to the [[Nigerian Second Republic]]. 
He was Chairman of the Rivers State branch of the [[National Party of Nigeria]] (NPN) (1978–1983), and was elected on the NPN platform as governor of Rivers States in 1979.
As governor, Okilo established the [[Rivers State University of Science and Technology]]. He opened the Independent Power Plant at Imiringi in [[Ogbia]] local government area, now in [[Bayelsa State]], a major gas turbine power station.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;
He created fifty development units for the much neglected rural areas, introducing a policy where local people were given the responsibility and power to govern and develop their local communities. He undertook programs to reclaim land, control erosion, construct roads and canals, and build rural housing scheme and industrial estates.&lt;ref name=yellowe/&gt;

President [[Shehu Shagari]] awarded him the honour of ''Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria'' in 1983.&lt;ref name=tday607/&gt;
He was re-elected on the NPN platform in 1983, losing office when General [[Muhammadu Buhari]] took power in a military coup in December 1983.&lt;ref name=tday607/&gt;
Soon after taking power, Buhari established military tribunals to try public officers from the Shagari era who had been accused of embezzling public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Later career==

In June 1989 Okilo was a speaker at a conference on World Balance: Action to Save our Planet held in [[Aspen, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |title=Vegetarian Times
 |date=May 1989
 |ISSN=0164-8497}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing in 1992 on the question of oil revenue sharing, Okilo referred to traditional morality, saying that "when an individual kills or finds a big fish or animal, the villagers or community expresses their appreciation ... by first giving him or her the best part of the animal or fish before the rest of the meat or fish is shared."&lt;ref name=ikein/&gt; 
He served as Minister of Commerce and Tourism during the General [[Sani Abacha]] regime.&lt;ref name=osaghae&gt;{{cite book

In January 1994 he was a member of a ministerial committee that toured Ogoniland following disturbances by [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]] protesters against [[Shell Nigeria|Shell]] activities in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although the committee's report was sympathetic to the plight of minorities in the oil-producing areas, little was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Okilo was dropped from the government in July 1995 as the military consolidated their power.&lt;ref name=osaghae/&gt;
Returning to the United States, he became president of the University of Science and Philosophy, which had earlier published his philosophical writings including his 1991 book ''The Law Of Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth republic==

In January 1999, shortly before the return to democracy and while running for office, Okilo was briefly detained by the outgoing military government following disturbances among the Ijaw in the Niger Delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Okilo was elected Senator for Bayelsa East on the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP) platform, serving from May 1999 to May 2003, but failed to be re-elected in 2003.&lt;ref name=tday607/&gt;
As senator, he served as vice-chairman of the committee on Natural Gas and chairman of the committee on Identify Card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2005 he read his own obituary after a mistaken story that he had died. Later he addressed a press conference, saying he was in a coma for four days and was mistaken for dead.&lt;ref name=tday607/&gt;
Speaking in July 2006 in [[Brixton]], [[London]], Okilo called on leaders of the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] to take their case over sharing oil and gas revenue to the [[International Court of Justice]]. At the same time, he asked youths of the area to give up violence, and seek peaceful means to address their grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He finished fifteenth in the series standings that year, with a best finish of fourth.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; He also made his debut in the [[Camping World Truck Series]], competing for [[Germain Racing]] and [[Red Horse Racing]] in four races.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; He finished ninth in his first race in the series, at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]], widely regarded as a difficult track for rookie drivers.&lt;ref name="Bristol2"/&gt;

In 2011, he ran full-time in the Camping World Truck Series for [[Red Horse Racing]], with a best finish of third;&lt;ref name="Bristol2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.speedtv.com/article/trucks-miguel-paludo-progressing-pumped-for-bristol-motor-speedway-return/|title=Paludo Progressing, Pumped For Bristol Return|last=Turner|first=Jared|date=August 23, 2011|work=SPEED Channel|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=2012-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202223529/http://nascar.speedtv.com/article/trucks-miguel-paludo-progressing-pumped-for-bristol-motor-speedway-return/|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he ended the season finishing seventeenth in the points standings and fourth in the series' [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie-of-the-Year]] competition.&lt;ref name="TS"/&gt;

Following the end of the 2011 season, Paludo left Red Horse Racing to drive for [[Turner Scott Motorsports]] in the No. 32 truck with teammates [[James Buescher]] and countryman [[Nelson Piquet, Jr.]].&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/truckseries/Turner_Motorsports_adds_Brazilians_Nelson_Piquet_Jr_Miguel_Paludo_to_2012_truck_lineup.html|title=Turner Motorsports adds Brazilians Nelson Piquet Jr., Miguel Paludo to 2012 truck lineup|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|date=November 29, 2011|work=SceneDaily.com|publisher=The Sporting News|accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paludo started off the season with a pole in the season-opener at [[Daytona International Speedway]], where he was the first Brazilian to win a pole in one of NASCAR's top-three series, and alongside Piquet Jr., comprised the first all-Brazilian front row in the history of NASCAR. Paludo's best finish of the season (fifth) came in the season finale at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]], and he ultimately finished 10th in the NCWTS driver point standings, his best points position to date.
Additionally, Paludo ran two [[NASCAR Nationwide Series]] races in 2012, competing at [[Road America]] and [[Watkins Glen International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/blog/eye-on-nascar/19216420/four-nationwide-entries-for-turner-motorsports-at-road-america|title=Miguel Paludo and Nelson Piquet Jr. join Turner Road America Nationwide plan|last=Pistone|first=Pete|date=May 31, 2012|work=Eye on NASCAR|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter of which he earned his best NNS finish of 13th.

In 2013, Paludo returned to the No. 32 Chevrolet Silverado with Turner Scott Motorsports for another complete NCWTS season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2012/12/3/3724338/miguel-paludo-nascar-truck-series-2013|title=NASCAR Trucks driver Miguel Paludo returning to Turner Motorsports in 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Talladega Superspeedway in October, Paludo was involved in a spectacular last-lap accident, his truck being flipped in the [[trioval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2013/10/19/kyle-busch-darrell-wallace-trucks-talladega/3069845/|title=Justin Lofton taken to hospital after Truck crash at Talladega|last=Ryan|first=Nate|date=October 19, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2013-10-19|location=McLean, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2013 season, Paludo was released by Turner Scott Motorsports, due to a lack of sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popularspeed.com/paludo-its-hard-to-believe-im-not-racing-this-year/|title=Paludo: ‘It’s Hard to Believe I’m Not Racing This Year’|last=Crandall|first=Kelly|date=January 31, 2014|work=PopularSpeed|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Number 32 truck at TMS.jpg|thumb|right|Paludo's No. 32 Unite for Diabetes/Duroline Chevrolet paint scheme at Texas Motor Speedway]]
Born in [[Nova Prata]] in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in southern Brazil,&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; Paludo currently resides in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="iG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandepremio.ig.com.br/outrascategorias/turismo/2011/12/27/stop+amp+go+miguel+paludo+10541777.html|title=Stop &amp; Go: Miguel Paludo|last=Silva|first=Fernando|date=December 27, 2011|work=Grande Prêmio|publisher=iG Esporte|accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married, and has one son, Oliver, with his wife Patricia.&lt;ref name="Bristol2"/&gt;

===Diabetes advocacy===
Paludo was diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] in 2004 at the age of 21 and has since become an advocate of [[diabetes]] awareness and care. In addition to a long-standing relationship with the [[American Diabetes Association]], Paludo announced in 2012 that he would become the next Blue Circle Champion for the [[International Diabetes Federation]], a worldwide alliance of some 200 diabetes associations in more than 160 countries. Paludo is the first representative of the organization from [[South America]].&lt;ref name="PaludoDia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turnermotorsportsllc.com/news/show/51016-miguel-paludo-partners-with-international-diabetes-federation/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319000510/http://turnermotorsportsllc.com/news/show/51016-miguel-paludo-partners-with-international-diabetes-federation/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 19, 2014 |title=Miguel Paludo Partners With International Diabetes Federation |date=May 30, 2012 |publisher=Turner Motorsports |accessdate=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paludo and his wife Patricia also learned in 2012 that their son Oliver, at the time only eight months old, was also a type 1 diabetic. In response to the news, Paludo ran a special No. 32 Unite for Diabetes/Duroline paint scheme in the June 2012 NCWTS race at [[Texas Motor Speedway]]. The scheme featured the blue circle, which is the international symbol for diabetes, and an image of Paludo and his son on the truck's [[tonneau]] cover. In November of that year, Paludo ran a [[World Diabetes Day]] paint scheme at both Texas Motor Speedway and [[Phoenix International Raceway]].&lt;ref name="PaludoDia"/&gt;

'''Neil Mallon Bush''' (born January 22, 1955) is an American businessman and investor.  He is the fourth of six children of former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Barbara Bush]] (née Pierce). His five siblings are [[George W. Bush]], the 43rd President of the United States; [[Jeb Bush]], a former governor of Florida; [[Pauline Robinson Bush|Pauline Robinson "Robin" Bush]], who died of [[leukemia]] at the age of three; [[Marvin Bush]]; and [[Dorothy Bush Koch]].&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore&gt;{{cite web| title=George H. W. Bush: Life Before the Presidency| last=Knott| first=Stephen| url=https://millercenter.org/president/bush/life-before-the-presidency| publisher=Miller Center, the University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Bush is currently a businessman based in [[Texas]].

== Early life ==
On January 22, 1955, Bush was born in [[Midland, Texas]].&lt;ref name="nndb"/&gt; Bush was named after a good friend of the family, [[Henry Neil Mallon]], chairman of [[Dresser Industries]], [[George H. W. Bush]]'s employer. As a child Bush spent some summers and holidays at his family's estate in [[Maine]], the [[Bush compound]].

At age 11, he entered the exclusive [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He struggled through school; a counselor told his mother that it was doubtful the boy had the potential to graduate. He was later diagnosed as having [[dyslexia]], and his mother spent much time coaching him through his [[learning disability]]. Eventually his grades improved and he graduated from St. Albans in 1973.

== Education ==
In 1977, Bush earned a degree in Economics from [[Tulane University]]. In 1979, Bush earned an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]. &lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/505/000026427/ |title=Neil Bush |publisher=nndb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and business dealings==
===Silverado Savings &amp; Loan===
Neil Bush was a member of the board of directors of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]-based [[Savings and loan crisis#Silverado Savings and Loan|Silverado Savings and Loan]] during the 1980s' larger [[savings and loan crisis]]. As his father, [[George H. W. Bush]], was [[Vice President of the United States]], his role in Silverado's failure was a focal point of publicity.

The US Office of Thrift Supervision investigated Silverado's failure and determined that Bush had engaged in numerous "breaches of his fiduciary duties involving multiple conflicts of interest." Although Bush was not [[indictment|indicted]] on criminal charges, a [[Civil law (common law)|civil action]] was brought against him and the other Silverado directors by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]; it was eventually [[Settlement (litigation)|settled out of court]], with Bush paying $50,000 as part of the settlement.&lt;ref name="WP-12-28-03"&gt;{{cite news| first= Peter |last=Carlson| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/12/28/the-relatively-charmed-life-of-neil-bush/388db316-f6b9-456e-8720-b4b2bf60a8ab/ |title= The Relatively Charmed Life Of Neil Bush| work= Washington Post| date= December 28, 2003| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A friend who also donated funds to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] set up a fund to help defer costs Neil incurred in his S&amp;L
legal defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A81085 |work=The Austin Chronicle| title= O, Brother! Where Art Thou?| first= Louis |last= DuBose| date= March 16, 2001| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignite! Learning===
{{main|Ignite!}}
In 1999, Bush co-founded [[Ignite!|Ignite! Learning]], an educational software corporation. Bush has said he started [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]-based Ignite! Learning because of his learning difficulties in middle school and those of his son, Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.mrt.com/import/article_6ea9b811-13b6-51c0-b45d-cab293c876f5.html | title= Bush brother visits Alamo Jr. High | date= August 29, 2006 | first= Ruth | last= Campbell | newspaper= Midland Reporter-Telegram | accessdate= April 10, 2016 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The software uses [[multiple intelligence]] methods to provide varying types of content to appeal to multiple learning styles.

To fund Ignite!, Bush raised $23 million from US investors, including his parents, as well as businessmen from [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[Kuwait]], the [[British Virgin Islands]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], according to documents filed with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Documented investors included [[Kuwaiti people|Kuwaiti]] company head Mohammed Al Saddah, and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] computer executive Winston Wong, as well as the late Russian billionaire expatriate [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], and Berezovsky's partner Badri Patarkatsishvili.

Bush's relationship with the late controversial oligarch [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], a political enemy of [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] who at the time of his death had been under indictment for [[fraud]] in Russia and an applicant for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name=profits /&gt; has been noted in the media. Berezovsky, who died in 2013, had been an investor in Bush's Ignite! program since at least 2003.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/13659/ | title= Berezovsky, Neil Bush, Latvian businessmen meet| work= [[Baltic Times]]| date= September 23, 2005| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush met with Berezovsky in [[Latvia]]. The meeting caused tension between that country and Russia due to Berezovsky's fugitive status.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Bush was also seen in Berezovsky's box at an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Emirates Stadium]] for a football game in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,1864950,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Berezovsky and Bush's brother in the crowd at the Emirates| first= Paul |last= Kelso|date= 4 September 2006 |accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prompted some stateside criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wonkette.com/politics/neil-bush/still-crooked-after-all-these-years-205862.php| title= Neil Bush: Still Crooked After All These Years| website= Wonkette.com| date= October 6, 2006| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061119014941/http://www.wonkette.com/politics/neil-bush/still-crooked-after-all-these-years-205862.php| archivedate= November 19, 2006 |accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had also been speculation in the [[English language]] ''[[Moscow Times]]'' that the relationship may cause tension in U.S.-Russian bilateral relations, "especially since Putin had taken pains to build a personal relationship with the U.S. president," George Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncrp.org/AR-100605-MoscowTimes.asp |publisher=republished online by National Committee for Responsible Philanthropy |deadurl=yes |title=Berezovsky Teams Up With Bush's Brother |first=Catherine |last=Belton |work=The Moscow Times |date=October 6, 2005 |accessdate=April 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102002017/http://www.ncrp.org/AR-100605-MoscowTimes.asp |archivedate=November 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Neil Bush commended his brother, George, for his efforts on education as President, but he questioned the emphasis on constant testing to keep federal aid coming to public schools: "I share the concerns of many that if our system is driven around assessments, pencil-and-paper tests that test a kid's ability to memorize stuff, I would say that reliance threatens to institutionalize bad teaching practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.madisone-zone.com/viewnews.php?current=31&amp;action=2 |	title= Neil Bush promotes brother, business| first= Cliff |last= Peale| work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |date= January 29, 2002| publisher= republished online by Madison E-Zone News &amp; Events| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040312005929/http://www.madisone-zone.com/viewnews.php?current=31&amp;action=2| archivedate= March 12, 2004| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2006, over 13 US school districts (out of over 14,000 school districts nationwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0074/tab10.pdf |title= Table 10. Number of School Districts and Distribution of the School-Age Population by the Total School District Population: 1990 and 2000| publisher= US Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have used federal funds made available through the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 in order to buy Ignite's portable learning centers at $3,800 apiece.&lt;ref name=profits&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-ignite22oct22,1,3219644.story | title= Bush's Family Profits From `No Child' Act | date= October 22, 2006| first= Walter F., Jr.| last= Roche | newspaper= Los Angeles Times| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2003 Style section article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Bush's salary from Ignite! was $180,000 per year.&lt;ref name="WP-12-28-03"/&gt;

===Kopin stock trades===
In July 1999, Bush made at least $798,000 on three stock trades in a single day of a company where he had been employed as a consultant. The company, [[Kopin Corporation]] of [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Massachusetts]], announced on the same day good news about a new [[Asia]]n client that sent its stock value soaring. Bush stated that he had no inside knowledge and that his financial advisor had recommended the trades. He said, "any increase in the price of the stock on that day was purely coincidental, meaning that I did not have any improper information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Pete |last= Yost| agency= Associated Press| url= http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/2329869.html | title= Neil Bush made 1-day stock profit of $171,370| newspaper= [[Houston Chronicle]]| date= December 31, 2003| accessdate= November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in January 2004 about the stock trades, Bush contrasted the [[capital gain]]s he reported in 1999 and 2000 with the capital losses on Kopin stock he reported ($287,722 in all) in 2001. In 2001 Kopin joined a broad decline in high-tech stock valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/01/elec04.neil.bush.ap/ |website=CNN.com |title= Neil Bush makes one-day profit over $170,000 |date=January 2, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192754/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/01/elec04.neil.bush.ap/ |archivedate=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speaking engagements===
Bush has often been invited to speak to audiences overseas. Bush says he has courtesy visits with world leaders but has no plans to wade into [[foreign policy]]. "Oftentimes because of my father's goodwill, and because of the president being who he is, people might extend an invitation, and it's enjoyable for me," Bush said. "Some of these folks are family friends."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/04/08/edu-software.htm | work=[[USA Today]] | title=Neil Bush enters educational software business | date=April 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at a Saudi Arabian economic forum in January 2002, Bush referred to growing [[anti-American]] sentiment in Arab countries and said the two peoples must communicate better. He said the Arab P.R. machine is not as good as Israel's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Jake| last= Tapper| url= http://www.salon.com/2002/01/24/neil_bush/ |title= Neil Bush says Arab P.R. machine not as good as Israel's | website=Salon.com| date= January 24, 2002| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush frequently travels to the Middle East, Europe and Asia to negotiate deals and raise capital for various businesses. According to court filings from his divorce, in 2000 he was paid $1.3 million for such work. This includes $642,500 as a commission for introducing an Asian investor to the owners of an American high-tech company.&lt;ref name="WP-12-28-03" /&gt; The George W. Bush-era [[White House]] Administration appeared unfazed by his world travel. "The president knows his brother will always do the right thing," press secretary [[Ari Fleischer]] said."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

===Other business engagements===
In 2002, Bush signed a consulting contract that paid $2 million in stock over five years to work for [[Grace Semiconductor|Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.]], a firm backed by [[Jiang Mianheng]], the son of former Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]], plus $10,000 for every board meeting he attends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/26/1069522647652.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Bush's younger brother quizzed over $2m deal | date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush serves as co-chairman of a company called Crest Investment. Crest pays him $60,000 a year to provide miscellaneous consulting services.&lt;ref name="Newsday"/&gt;&lt;ref name=romps&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/25/bush.brother.reut/ | work=CNN | title=Bush brother's divorce reveals sex romps | date=November 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Neil Bush incorporated an investment firm called LehmanBush with veteran China lawyer Edward Lehman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lehmanbush.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and charity involvement, volunteer work==
===Points of Light===
Neil Bush is the Chairman of [[Points of Light]]; an international nonprofit that works to increase volunteerism in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointsoflight.org/who-we-are Board of Directors], Points of Light Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Points of Light has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Points of Light 2012 Year in Review| url=http://www.pointsoflight.org/sites/default/files/site-content/files/pol_endofyearappeal_5x8_webversion.pdf|work=Points of Light|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue===
Bush was a founding director, along with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), of the [[Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue]] (FIIRD). The foundation promotes ecumenical understanding and publishes religious texts and was founded in 1999. Bush is no longer on the board of the foundation.&lt;ref name="Newsday"&gt;{{cite news| first1=Knut |last1=Royce |first2=Tom |last2=Brune| url= http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-wochar214226829apr21,0,2177757.story |title= Neil Bush, Ratzinger co-founders: President's younger brother served with then-cardinal on board of relatively unknown ecumenical foundation| work=Newsday| date= April 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Ritalin campaign===
In 2002, Neil Bush told the ''[[New York Post]]'' that he "endured his own [[Ritalin]] hell seven years ago when educators in a Houston private school diagnosed his son, Pierce, (then) 16, with [[Attention Deficit Disorder]] (ADD) and pushed medication."

In a September 26, 2002, episode of ''[[CNN Interview]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0209/26/cct.00.html | work=Connie Chung Tonight| title= TRANSCRIPT: Interview With Neil Bush; Interview With Magic Johnson| date=September 26, 2002  | publisher=CNN| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush told [[Connie Chung]]:

{{quote|You know, we have a knee-jerk reaction in this education system where, if the kid doesn't perform well, then the reaction is to try to assign a label. The label is followed by a drug. The drug allows the kid to sit cooperatively, to pay attention, to focus in school.}}

Bush spent years researching the issue and found that "the educators were wrong" about his son. "There is a systemic problem in this country, where schools are often forcing parents to turn to Ritalin," he said. "It's obvious to me that we have a crisis."

Also that year, Bush testified before a hearing of the [[United States Congress]] to speak out against over-medicating children for learning disorders.

He has suggested that many parents believe the ADD and [[ADHD]] diagnoses and subsequent medicating of their children because it explains why they aren't doing well in school, saying "it's the system that is failing to engage children in the classroom. My heart goes out to any parents who are being led to believe their kids have a disorder or are disabled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.eagleforum.org/educate/2002/sept02/ritalin.shtml |title=Ritalin Roundup Continues |date= September 2002 |work=Education Reporter| publisher=[[Eagle Forum]] |location= New York, New York| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil Bush (along with filmmaker [[Michael Moore]]) is credited in the cast of a 2005 documentary film, ''The Drugging of Our Children''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://imdb.com/title/tt0850665/ |title=The Drugging of Our Children (2005) (V)| website= IMDb.com| publisher= Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Gary Null]]. In the film's trailer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostrowandcompany.com/film_detail.php?film=The%20Drugging%20Of%20Our%20Children ''The Drugging of Our Children'' Film Detail] at Ostrow and Company&lt;/ref&gt; Bush says: "Just because it is easy to drug a kid and get them to be compliant doesn't make it right to do it."

===Unification Church===
In Asia, Bush accompanied [[Sun Myung Moon]], the founder of the [[Unification Church]], on his world peace tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=3689 | website=InformationLiberation.com| title= Neil Bush travels with Moon as 'peace leader'|date= December 2, 2005| accessdate= April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Bush congratulated Moon on the publication of his autobiography at a Unification Church sponsored event. He was quoted as saying: "Rev. Moon is presenting a very simple concept. We are all children of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.consortiumnews.com/2009/100209.html |title= WTimes, Bushes Hail Rev. Moon| first= Robert |last= Parry |authorlink=Robert Parry (journalist)| work= Consortium News| date= October 2, 2009| accessdate= April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ted Cruz presidential campaign===
After his brother Jeb dropped out of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race, Neil and his wife Maria signed on to the finance team of fellow Republican [[Ted Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/08/politics/neil-bush-ted-cruz-finance/index.html|title=Neil Bush, Jeb's brother, joins Ted Cruz's finance team|first=Theodore Schleifer|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bush was married to [[Sharon Bush]] (born May 19, 1952) for 23 years. The couple have three children: [[Lauren Bush|Lauren Pierce Bush]] (born June 25, 1984), Pierce Mallon Bush (born March 11, 1986) and Ashley Walker Bush (born February 7, 1989). The couple divorced in April 2003.

The first person in his family to qualify as a [[lawyer]], he was registered as Raphael Nii Amaa Ollennu in the [[Gold Coast (British Colony)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana) register in 1940.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judicial.gov.gh/history/list_lawyers/home.htm|title=Lawyers Enrolled in the Roll Books (1876 - 1997)|work=Official Website|publisher=Judicial Service of Ghana|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414064831/http://www.judicial.gov.gh/history/list_lawyers/home.htm|archivedate=2005-04-14|accessdate=2007-03-24|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a [[judge]] and a Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Ghana]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10136878|title=The Discovery Service|last=Archives|first=The National|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published books on various legal topics and was an authority on traditional African land-tenure system.

==Politics ==
Nii Amaa Ollennu was one of the Accra representatives in the Gold Coast [[Legislative Assembly]] during the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=okoampa/&gt; He once led the [[Ghana Congress Party]], which along with the [[United Gold Coast Convention]] and the National Democratic Party, was a party of the [[J.B. Danquah|Danquah]]-[[Kofi Abrefa Busia|Busia]] tradition. Ollennu was thus in opposition alongside Busia and Danquah to Nkrumah's [[Convention People's Party]].

==Interim President of Ghana==
During the second republic, Ollennu was the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Parliament of Ghana]] from October 1969 to January 1972. He also became the acting [[president of Ghana]] on 7 August 1970.  He was officially the chairman of the Presidential Commission. He took over from the previous military leader, [[Akwasi Afrifa|Lt. Gen. Afrifa]] and handed over on 31 August 1970 to [[Edward Akufo-Addo]] who was elected on 31 August 1970 by an electoral college. He polled 123 votes to 35 by Edward Asafu Adjaye. This was a [[ceremonial presidency]] as executive power was held by the prime minister, [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]]. During the Second Republic of Ghana, Ollennu served as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Parliament of Ghana]]. 

== Personal life and family ==
Nii Amaa Ollennu was married to a sister of Prime Minister [[Kofi Abrefa Busia|Busia]], Nana Afua Frema, the [[Queen mothers (Africa)|Queenmother]] of [[Wenchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawafoundation.org/personality%20talk.htm|title=Personality Talk|work=Official Website|publisher=The Hawa Foundation and Organization|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502190250/http://www.hawafoundation.org/personality%20talk.htm|archivedate=2007-05-02|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2007-03-25|quote=Mrs. Amerley Awua Asamoa"...."My father was the late Justice Nii Amaa Ollennu (a renowned Jurist and Speaker of Parliament, 2nd Republic of Ghana).

'''Nuha al-Radi''' (January 27, 1941, [[Baghdad]] – August 30, 2004, [[Beirut]]) was an [[Iraq]]i [[diarist]], [[ceramist|ceramicist]] and [[Painting|painter]] and noted author of the ''Baghdad Diaries'' which vividly recounts the horror of living through the first Gulf War.

==Life and career==

She was born into a distinguished Iraqi family which included [[Mahmoud Shawkat]], the last Prime Minister of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1919, her father [[Mohammed Selim al-Radi]] was one of the first Iraqis to be educated in the United States when he studied agriculture in [[Texas]]. He married [[Suad Abbas]], became an Iraqi [[diplomat]] and was appointed ambassador to [[Iran]] in 1947 and then to India from 1949 to 1958, where Nuha al-Radi grew up. She was educated at private [[English language|English-speaking]] schools in [[Delhi]] and [[Shimla|Simla]], except for a brief spell in 1956 when she attended a boarding school in [[Alexandria]] to improve her [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but this was interrupted by the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;al-Radi, N., ''Baghdad Diaries: A Woman's Chronicles of War and Peace,'' Vintage Books, 2003, p. 7; "Nuha al-Radi," [Obituary], ''The Guardian, 7 September, 2007 [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/07/guardianobituaries.iraq Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[14 July Revolution|Iraqi Revolution]] broke out in 1958 and the monarchy was overthrown, Nuha al-Radi became a ceramist, having joined the [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] in [[London]] and later worked with [[Chelsea Pottery]]. She returned to Baghdad and exhibited in Iraq, Britain and Europe. In  1969, her family moved to Beirut and where she graduated in liberal arts from the [[American University]] in [[Beirut]] She also taught there and continued to work and exhibit as a ceramist, but the outbreak of the [[Lebanese civil war]] forced her to return to Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuha al-Radi," [Obituary], ''The Guardian, 7 September, 2007 [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/07/guardianobituaries.iraq Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, after the first three days of bombing in [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]], she began writing a diary in English. This was first published as "''Baghdad Diary''” and then translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. She continued updating it until 1996. In 1998 her eyewitness account of the [[Gulf War]] and its aftermath was published as "''Baghdad Diaries''" and translated into several languages. The 2003 edition of the book includes a postscript with remarks on the American invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Radi|first=Nura|title=Baghdad Diaries: A Woman's Chronicle of War and Exile|year=2003|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-7525-4|pages=213–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in 2004 from [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nuha al-Radi," [Obituary], ''The Guardian, 7 September, 2007 [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/07/guardianobituaries.iraq Online:]; "''Baghdad Diaries'' author Nuha Al Radi dies in Beirut," ''Gulf News,'' 8 September, 2004, [https://gulfnews.com/news/mena/iraq/baghdad-diaries-author-nuha-al-radi-dies-in-beirut-1.331968 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; She and her family believed that the leukemia may have been caused by the depleted uranium allies had fired at the tanks during the Gulf war. &lt;ref&gt;"Memory of late Nuha al-Radi lives on through her art,"  ''Daily Star,'' (Lebanon), 8 September, 2004 [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Art/2004/Sep-08/93263-memory-of-late-nuha-al-radi-lives-on-through-her-art.ashx Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Her works have been exhibited throughout the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuha al-Radi," [Obituary], ''The Guardian, 7 September, 2007 [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/07/guardianobituaries.iraq Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been praised for offering a uniquely female perspective on the male-centred business of war, occupation and economic sanctions in both her writing and her artwork. &lt;ref&gt;Mehta, B., "Dissidence, Creativity, and Embargo Art in Nuha Al-Radi's ''Baghdad Diaries,''"  ''Meridians: Feminism, Race and Transnationalism,'' Vol. 6, No. 2, 2006, pp. 220-235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

A [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], Abu Musa joined the [[Jordanian Army]] in 1948 and rose to become commander of an [[artillery]] battalion in 1969.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt; During this period he was sent to receive a military education at the prestigious [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Sandhurst Military Academy]].&lt;ref name=victory&gt;{{cite book |title= Revolution until victory?: the politics and history of the PLO |last= Rubin |first= Barry M. |year= 1994 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn= 0-674-76803-5 |page= 62 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zbQKILIgAwQC&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1970, after the [[Black September in Jordan|Black September fighting]], Musa left the Jordanian army to join the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] and relocated with most of the Palestinian Resistance to [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt; Here Musa rose to command an alliance between the PLO and Lebanese militias, which fought the [[Syria]]ns when Syria intervened in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=musa&gt;{{cite news | title = Abu Musa | publisher = Encyclopedia of World Biography | date = 2004-01-01 | accessdate = 2010-07-31 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3404700038.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the Syrian government unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate him.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt;

==Split with Arafat==
Musa became deputy chief of operations for the PLO&lt;ref name=musa/&gt; and [[Siege of Beirut|led the PLO's defense of Beirut]] in 1982 from the [[Israel]]is.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt;
However Musa fell out with [[Yassir Arafat]], head of Fatah and PLO, in May 1983.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt; Musa publicly complained over corrupt practices within the PLO, especially the promotion of political appointees loyal to Arafat to important military posts.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt; He was also known for hardline views on [[Israel]], and outspoken in his opposition to what he saw as Arafat's attempt to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict (see [[Rejectionist Front]]).&lt;ref name=victory/&gt;

In November 1983 Musa was expelled from the PLO's military&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt; and he formed [[Fatah Uprising]] (or [[Fatah al-Intifada]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) in opposition to Arafat.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt; With the backing of Syria, who opposed any negotiations with Israel, Musa led his followers to drive Arafat's PLO from northern Lebanon.&lt;ref name=musa/&gt;

In 1984 Musa led Fatah Uprising to join the [[Palestinian National Alliance]] in [[Damascus]] in opposition to the PLO but failed to get a majority of Palestinian support.&lt;ref name=musa/&gt; He would join the [[Palestinian National Salvation Front]] in 1985 and oppose the [[Oslo Accords]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt; Abu Musa retreated from his leadership role in the 1990s and would no longer be active from then on.&lt;ref name=saeid/&gt;

'''Samuel Thompson Busey''' (November 16, 1835 – August 12, 1909) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Illinois]].

==Biography==
Samuel Busey was born in [[Greencastle, Indiana]] but moved with his parents to [[Urbana, Illinois]]. He attended the public schools and went on to study law where he attended commercial college and law lectures in 1859 and 1860.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he served as [[first sergeant]] and then [[first lieutenant]] of the [[Urbana Zouaves]] in 1861 and 1862.

He was appointed Town collector in 1862 and became a [[second lieutenant]] in the recruiting service in June 1862 and helped to organize the [[76th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|Seventy-sixth Regiment, Illinois Volunteer Infantry]] where he served as [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] of Company B of that regiment June 22, 1862.

He later served as a [[lieutenant colonel]] August 22, 1862 and was promoted to [[colonel]] January 7, 1863.

On July 20, 1866, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Busey for appointment to the grade of [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, to rank from April 9, 1865, and the [[United States Senate]] confirmed the appointment on July 26, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher]], ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-3641-1}}. p. 741.&lt;/ref&gt;

He mustered out of the service July 22, 1865, in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and engaged in banking from 1867 to 1888. He later served as mayor of Urbana 1880-1889.

Busey was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[52nd United States Congress|Fifty-second]] Congress (March 4, 1891 – March 3, 1893) defeating [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]].

He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1892 to the [[53rd United States Congress|Fifty-third]] Congress, losing to Cannon (who regained his seat). This pattern would be repeated 22 years later by fellow Democrat banker [[Frank T. O'Hair]].

After, his failed reelection he returned to banking.

He died in a boating accident in [[Mantrap Township, Hubbard County, Minnesota]] August 12, 1909 while on a family vacation. His niece, Annie McClain, was killed in the same accident.&lt;ref&gt;Champaign Daily Gazette, August 13, 1909, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery, [[Urbana, Illinois]].

[[File:Nekyia Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1494 n2.jpg|thumb|alt=Sisyphus depicted on a black-figure amphora vase |[[Persephone]] supervising Sisyphus in the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], [[Attica]] black-figure [[amphora]] (vase), {{circa|530}} BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]&lt;ref&gt;museum {{abbr|inv.|inventory number}} 1494&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Greek mythology]] '''Sisyphus''' or '''Sisyphos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ɪ|f|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Σίσυφος}}, ''{{transl|grc|Sísuphos}}'') was the king of [[Cichyrus|Ephyra]] (now known as [[Corinth]]). He was punished for his self-aggrandizing craftiness and deceitfulness by being forced to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll down when it nears the top, repeating this action for eternity. Through the [[classicism|classical influence]] on modern culture, tasks that are both [[wikt:laborious#Adjective|laborious]] and [[wikt:futile#Adjective|futile]] are therefore described as '''Sisyphean''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|f|iː|ən}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|sisyphean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Linguistics Professor [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[pre-Greek]] origin and a connection with the root of the word ''{{transl|grc|sophos}}'' (σοφός, "wise").&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; German [[mythographer]] [[Otto Gruppe]] thought that the name derived from ''{{transl|grc|sisys}}'' (σίσυς, "a goat's skin"), in reference to a rain-charm in which goats' skins were used.&lt;ref&gt;Gruppe, O. ''Griechische Mythologie'' (1906), ii., p. 1021&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Sisyphus was the son of King [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]] [[Thessaly|of Thessaly]] and [[Enarete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.7.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022:book=1:chapter=7&amp;highlight=Sisyphus Bibliotheca, 1.7.3]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was the father of [[Glaucus (son of Sisyphus)|Glaucus]], [[Ornytion]], [[Almus (son of Sisyphus)|Almus]], and [[Thersander]] by the nymph [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]], the brother of [[Salmoneus]], and the grandfather of [[Bellerophon]] through Glaucus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.9.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022:book=1:chapter=9&amp;highlight=Sisyphus 1.9.3]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homer Iliad VI 152ff"&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' VI 152ff&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
{{Greek myth (Hades)}}

=== Reign ===
Sisyphus was the founder and first king of Ephyra (supposedly the original name of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; King Sisyphus promoted navigation and commerce but was avaricious and deceitful. He also killed travellers and guests, a violation of ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', which fell under [[Zeus]]'s domain. He took pleasure in these killings because they allowed him to maintain his iron-fisted rule.

=== Conflict with Salmoneus ===
Sisyphus and his brother Salmoneus were known to hate each other, and Sisyphus consulted with the [[Oracle]] of [[Delphi]] on just how to kill Salmoneus without incurring any severe consequences for himself. From [[Homer]] onward, Sisyphus was famed as the craftiest of men. He seduced Salmoneus's daughter [[Tyro]] in one of his plots to kill Salmoneus, only for Tyro to slay the children she bore him when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on using them eventually to dethrone her father.

=== Cheating death ===
King Sisyphus also betrayed one of Zeus's secrets by revealing the whereabouts of [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], (an [[Asopides|Asopid]] who was taken away by Zeus) to her father (the river god [[Asopus]]) in return for causing a spring to flow on the Corinthian [[acropolis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Zeus then ordered [[Thanatos]], Death, to chain King Sisyphus down below in [[Tartarus]]. Sisyphus was curious as to why [[Hermes]], whose job it was to guide souls to the Underworld, had not appeared on this occasion. King Sisyphus slyly asked Thanatos to demonstrate how the chains worked. As Thanatos was granting him his wish, Sisyphus seized the opportunity and trapped Thanatos in the chains instead. Once Thanatos was bound by the strong chains, no one died on earth. This caused an uproar especially for [[Ares]] (who was annoyed that his battles had lost their fun because his opponents would not die), and so he intervened. The exasperated Ares freed Thanatos and turned King Sisyphus over to Thanatos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/0195153448/studentresources/chapters/ch25/?view=usa |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173245/http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/0195153448/studentresources/chapters/ch25/?view=usa |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another version, [[Hades]] was sent to chain Sisyphus and was chained himself. As long as Hades was tied up, nobody could die. Because of this, sacrifices could not be made to the gods, and those that were old and sick were suffering. The gods finally threatened to make life so miserable for Sisyphus that he would wish he were dead. He then had no choice but to release Hades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Death.htm |title=Ancient Greeks: Is death necessary and can death actually harm us? |publisher=Mlahanas.de |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702053105/http://mlahanas.de/Greeks/Death.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before King Sisyphus died, he had told his wife to throw his naked body into the middle of the public square (purportedly as a test of his wife's love for him). This caused King Sisyphus to end up on the shores of the river [[Styx]]. Then, complaining to [[Persephone]], goddess of the Underworld, that this was a sign of his wife's disrespect for him, King Sisyphus persuaded her to allow him to return to the upper world. Once back in Ephyra, the spirit of King Sisyphus scolded his wife for not burying his body and giving it a proper funeral (as a loving wife should). When King Sisyphus refused to return to the Underworld, he was forcibly dragged back there by Hermes.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;!-- (This version is alluded to by [[Albert Camus|Camus]] without citation and also appears in [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''2666'', in a context that indicates it may have been made up rather than traditional.) --&gt; In another version of the myth, Persephone was tricked by Sisyphus that he had been conducted to [[Tartarus]] by mistake, and so she ordered that he be released.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Evslin's ''gods, Demigods &amp; Demons'', 209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Philoctetes]]'' by [[Sophocles]], there is a reference to the father of [[Odysseus]] (rumoured to have been Sisyphus, and not [[Laërtes]], whom we know as the father in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') upon having returned from the dead.

=== Punishment in the Underworld ===
As a punishment for his trickery, King Sisyphus was made to endlessly roll a huge boulder up a steep hill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng2:11.13-11.13 |title=Homeros, Odyssey, 11.13 |publisher=Perseus Digital Library |date= |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Odyssey, xi. 593"&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'', xi. 593&lt;/ref&gt; The maddening nature of the punishment was reserved for King Sisyphus due to his [[hubris]]tic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. Zeus accordingly displayed his own cleverness by enchanting the boulder into rolling away from King Sisyphus before he reached the top, which ended up consigning Sisyphus to an eternity of useless efforts and unending frustration. Thus it came to pass that pointless or interminable activities are sometimes described as ''Sisyphean''. King Sisyphus was a common subject for ancient writers and was depicted by the painter [[Polygnotus]] on the walls of the [[Lesche]] at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] x. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:Johann-Vogel-Meditationes-emblematicae-de-restaurata-pace-Germaniae MGG 1020.tif|thumb|alt=Black and white etching of Sisyphus by Johann Vogel |Sisyphus as a symbol for continuing a senseless war. Johann Vogel: ''Meditationes emblematicae de restaurata pace Germaniae'', 1649]]
According to the [[solar theory]], King Sisyphus is the disk of the sun that rises every day in the east and then sinks into the west.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Sisyphus |volume=25 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars regard him as a personification of waves rising and falling, or of the treacherous sea.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; The 1st-century BC [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] philosopher [[Lucretius]] interprets the myth of Sisyphus as personifying politicians aspiring for political office who are constantly defeated, with the quest for power, in itself an "empty thing", being likened to rolling the boulder up the hill.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' III&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Welcker]] suggested that he symbolises the vain struggle of man in the pursuit of knowledge, and [[Salomon Reinach]]&lt;ref&gt;''Revue archéologique'', 1904&lt;/ref&gt; that his punishment is based on a picture in which Sisyphus was represented rolling a huge stone  [[Acrocorinthus]], symbolic of the labour and skill involved in the building of the Sisypheum. [[Albert Camus]], in his 1942 essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', saw Sisyphus as personifying the absurdity of human life, but Camus concludes "one must imagine Sisyphus happy" as "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."  More recently, [[J. Nigro Sansonese]],&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Nigro Sansonese|Sansonese, J. Nigro]]. ''The Body of Myth.'' Rochester, 1994, pp. 45–52. {{ISBN|0-89281-409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; building on the work of [[Georges Dumézil]], speculates that the origin of the name "Sisyphos" is onomatopoetic of the continual back-and-forth, susurrant sound ("siss phuss") made by the breath in the nasal passages, situating the mythology of Sisyphus in a far larger context of archaic (see [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]) trance-inducing techniques related to breath control. The repetitive inhalation–exhalation cycle is described esoterically in the myth as an up–down motion of Sisyphus and his boulder on a hill.

In experiments that test how workers respond when the meaning of their task is diminished, the test condition is referred to as the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder when their work seems more meaningful, and that people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ariely|first=Dan|title=The Upside of Irrationality|year=2010|isbn=0-06-199503-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking''&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Kopfer (2018); The Philosophy of Recursive Thinking, The recursive solution for Sisyphos problem. {{ISBN|978-3-7438-7149-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; German author Manfred Kopfer suggested a viable solution for Sisyphus punishment. Every time Sisyphus reaches the top of the mountain, he breaks off a stone from the mountain and carries it down to the lowest point. This way, the mountain will eventually be levelled and the stone cannot roll down anymore. In Kopfers interpretation, the solution turns the punishment by the gods into a test for Sisyphus to prove his worthiness for godlike deeds. If Sisyphus is able "to move a mountain", he shall be allowed to do what otherwise only gods are entitled to do.

[[File:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of Sisyphys by Titian |''Sisyphys'' (1548–49) by [[Titian]], [[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]
[[File:Syzyfki (Sisyphers) Wroclaw dwarf 01.JPG|''Syzyfki''|thumb|alt=Sisypher dwarves sculpture by Tomasz Moczek. Two small bronze figures stand either side of a stone sphere. |''Sisypher'' dwarves by {{Interlanguage link multi|Tomasz Moczek|pl}} in [[Wrocław]]]]
[[Homer]] describes Sisyphus in both Book VI of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and Book XI of the ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="Homer Iliad VI 152ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Odyssey, xi. 593"/&gt;

[[Ovid]], the Roman poet, makes reference to Sisyphus in the story of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]].  When Orpheus descends and confronts Hades and Persephone, he sings a song so that they will grant his wish to bring Eurydice back from the dead.  After this song is sung, Ovid shows how moving it was by noting that Sisyphus, emotionally affected, for just a moment, stops his eternal task and sits on his rock, the Latin wording being ''inque tuo sedisti, Sisyphe, saxo'' ("and you sat, Sisyphus, on your rock").&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'', 10.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates looks forward to the after-life where he can meet figures such as Sisyphus, who think themselves wise, so that he can question them and find who is wise and who "thinks he is when he is not"&lt;ref&gt;Apology, 41a&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Camus]], the [[French Algeria|French]] [[absurdism|absurdist]], wrote an essay entitled ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', in which he elevates Sisyphus to the status of absurd hero. [[Franz Kafka]] repeatedly referred to Sisyphus as a bachelor; [[Kafkaesque]] for him were those qualities that brought out the Sisyphus-like qualities in himself. According to Frederick Karl: "The man who struggled to reach the heights only to be thrown down to the depths embodied all of Kafka's aspirations; and he remained himself, alone, solitary."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Karl|Karl, Frederick]]. ''Franz Kafka: Representative Man.'' New York: International Publishing Corporation, 1991. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]] uses the myth of Sisyphus as a representation of a life made meaningless because it consists of bare repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard. "Time and Life's Meaning." ''Review of Metaphysics'' 40 (June 1987): 675–686.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfgang Mieder]] has collected cartoons that build on the image of Sisyphus, many of them [[editorial cartoons]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder. 2013. Neues von Sisyphus: Sprichtwortliche Mythen der Antike in moderner Literatur, Medien und Karikaturen. Vienna: Praesens.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
*Sisyphus is the main character in the video game ''[[Rock of Ages (video game)|Rock of Ages]]'' (2011), in which he travels through several time periods with a giant boulder defeating his enemies, including the Greek titan [[Cronus]], who serves as the main villain of the story. Sisyphus' appearance is based on the black figure Amphora.

===Literature===
*King Sisyphus is featured in ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', in ''[[The Demigod Files]]'' story titled "The Sword of Hades", in which Percy Jackson, Thalia Grace, and Nico di Angelo follow the trail of the person that stole the Sword of Hades to Sisyphus' area in the Fields of Punishment. Percy and Nico ask him for advice while Thalia pushes the boulder up the hill. As they leave, Sisyphus begs them to set him free.

'''Skinny Dennis Sanchez''' (September 3, 1946 &amp;ndash; March 20, 1975) was a country musician in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with James Szalapski done by Thomas W. Campell, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He played the upright bass, most famously accompanying Nashville musician [[Guy Clark]] during Clark's stay in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Michael K Harris: Booklet Heartworn Highway DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname is in reference to his having [[Marfan syndrome]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Saviano|first=Tamara|title=Without Getting Killed or Caught: The Life and Music of Guy Clark|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|page=126|ISBN=978-1623494544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanchez stood at 6'11", and weighed 135&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Lees: ''[http://www.noshow.freewire.co.uk/dvdheartwornhighways.htm Review of DVD Heartworn Highways] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630135941/http://www.noshow.freewire.co.uk/dvdheartwornhighways.htm |date=2007-06-30 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is most famously mentioned in the Guy Clark song "L.A. Freeway" (recorded by Guy Clark on his debut album, [[Old No. 1]] in 1975 and first recorded by [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] in 1972).  Clark's lyrics went as follows:

"Here's to you ol' Skinny Dennis&lt;br /&gt;
The only one I think I will miss&lt;br /&gt;
I can hear your ol' bass singin'&lt;br /&gt;
Sweet and low like a gift you're bringin'"

Sanchez was also friends with many in Clark's circle, including [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Richard Dobson]] and others. A documentary featuring the aforementioned songwriters, "Heartworn Highways," is dedicated to Sanchez. Richard Dobson recorded Sanchez' song "Bus Stop Coffee" for his albums ''In Texas Last December'' and ''One Bar Town''.

Sanchez died at age 28 of heart failure on stage, playing the bass at Captain Jack's in Sunset Beach with John Penn.

The Skinny Dennis Brooklyn bar in New York City is named after Sanchez.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skinnydennisbar.com/about/ (accessed March 24, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific disagreements==

Some of Sunil Ahuja's work has been questioned by the scientific community.  In July 2008 Sunil Ahuja's group reported that Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines ([[DARC (gene)]]) influenced HIV/AIDS susceptibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines Mediates trans-Infection of HIV-1 from Red Blood Cells to Target Cells and Affects HIV-AIDS Susceptibility|vauthors=He W, Neil S, Kulkarni H, Wright E, Agan BK, Marconi VC, Dolan MJ, Weiss RA, Ahuja SK |journal=Cell Host Microbe |year=2008 |volume=4|pages=52–62 |pmid=18621010 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2008.06.002|issue=1|pmc=2562426}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This finding was then questioned by four groups of scientists, reporting the failure to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines Null Promoter Variant Does Not Influence HIV-1 Acquisition Or Disease Progression |vauthors=Walley NM, Julg B, Dickson SP, etal |journal=Cell Host Microbe |year=2009 |volume=5|pages=408–410 |pmid=19454339 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2009.04.011|issue=5|pmc=2720554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Expression of Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) has no effect on HIV-1 acquisition or progression to AIDS in African Americans|vauthors=Winkler CA, An P, Johnson R, Nelson GW, Kirk G |journal=Cell Host Microbe |year=2009 |volume=5|pages=411–413 |pmid=19454340 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2009.04.010|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lack of Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines: No Influence on HIV Disease Progression in an African Treatment Naïve Population |vauthors=Julg B, Reddy S, van der Stok M, etal |journal=Cell Host Microbe |year=2009 |volume=5|pages=413–415 |pmid=19454341 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2009.04.009|issue=5|pmc=2749504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Duffy antigen polymorphisms do not alter progression of HIV in African Americans in the MACS cohort |vauthors=Horne KC, Li X, Jacobson LP, etal |journal=Cell Host Microbe |year=2009 |volume=5|pages=415–417 |pmid=19454342 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2009.04.013|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunil Ahuja replied to the questioning in the same issue of ''[[Cell Host &amp; Microbe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Author reply|journal=Cell Host Microbe |year=2009 |volume=5|pages=418–419 |doi=10.1016/j.chom.2009.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They practice a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] ancestral belief system and Pre-Islamic culture dating back to 3000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Jarde, A. (2013). The Formation of the Greek People (History of the Early Civilization) . Routledge. ISBN B00GO057H6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tach is one of the first literates among Kalasha People to have received BA in Political science &amp; Law at [[Edwardes College]] Peshawar Pakistan, a 2nd BA in English Literature &amp; Linguistics at [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] and MA Human Rights from [[Central European University]] Budapest, Hungary.

Tach has made first Kalasha indigenous documentary film Kalasha&lt;ref name="Film Kalasha"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmfestival.gr/docfestival/2003/uk/process_en.php?movieid=579&amp;eventid=103|title=Kalasha |date=March 3, 2003 |publisher=5th [[Thessaloniki Documentary Festival]]|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; about his people as part of anthropological documentation and advocacy for Kalasha people's linguistic rights in education and cultural autonomy. He is also writer of first hand report on "Kalasha Mythology, herbs &amp; Shamanic practices". Tach has been a spokesman for Kalasha with his exceptional linguistic skills speaking four Asiatic and three European languages besides his mother tongue.

Working in close collaboration with various international researchers and linguists Taj organized first Kalasha Orthography Conference 2000&lt;ref name="kalashaorg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kalasha.org/pages/the-kalasha-alphabet-book/orthography.php | title=Orthography Conference | publisher=Kalasha | accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Islamabad, Pakistan. In 2004 he was able to raise funds to publish first alphabet book of Kalasha language based on Roman script designed by an Australian linguist Gregory R. Cooper.

Tach's struggles for survival &amp; development of Kalasha language are featured in a recent documentary film called The Alphabet Book&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patternfilms.com/alphabet/home&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [http://www.patternfilms.com Pattern films]. He is currently working on developing Kalasha Literacy Project that involves documentation of [[Kalasha-mun|Kalash language]] and Oral historical data by compilation of textbooks and literacy materials in Kalasha language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1757">'''Takahashi Seisakusho''' is a Japanese manufacturer of telescopes and related equipment, such as eyepieces and mounts.

Often known simply as 'Tak', the brand is especially noted amongst amateur astronomers for its range of [[apochromatic]] [[refractor]]s, but also produces various types of [[Reflecting telescope|reflectors]], and instruments featuring compound optics.

Takahashi pioneered the use of [[fluorite]] crystal in place of one of the glass elements in the objective lens of an astronomical telescope, although this material had previously been used in other optical devices.&lt;ref&gt;Lizaso, Iñaki. "[http://www.astrosurf.com/ilizaso/Takahashi%20FCT-100/FCT.htm Fluorite Refracting Telescopes]".&lt;/ref&gt; The company's name would become synonymous with the use of this type of crystal.

In recent years however, Takahashi has produced some telescopes using [[Low dispersion glass|extra-low dispersion ("ED")]] FPL-53 glass&lt;ref&gt;FPL-53 is a type of glass manufactured by Ohara GmbH. "[http://www.ohara-gmbh.com/e/produkte/astro.html Optical Glass for Astronomical Applications]".&lt;/ref&gt; in place of fluorite in the [[objective lens]].

High-performance glass that contains fluorine should not be confused with fluorite crystal, which is not glass.

Some other telescope manufacturers use Takahashi refractors as collimating instruments for larger telescopes.

'''John Thomas "Tom" Paul''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CBE|size=85%}} (16 August 1874 – 25 July 1964) was a New Zealand compositor, trade unionist, politician, editor, journalist and censor.

==Biography==
Paul was born in [[Boort, Victoria]], Australia in 1874.&lt;ref name="DNZB Paul"&gt;{{DNZB|title=John Thomas Paul|first= Erik|last= Olssen|id=3p16|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to New Zealand in 1899.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=164}}

Paul was a journalist and printer and became President of the [[Otago]] Typographical Workers Union in 1902.

He was appointed to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council]] on 22 January 1907. At the expiry of his term, he was reappointed on 22 January 1914, but resigned on 25 November 1919 to stand for Labour in the general election after the popular [[Thomas Sidey]] had announced that he would retire from the [[Dunedin South]] electorate.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=155}} He was appointed again on 9 September 1946 and served until the abolition of the Legislative Council on 31 December 1950; thus serving for sixteen years in total.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=161}}

He was deeply involved with the early development of the Labour Party, from establishing the [[Independent Political Labour League]] via the [[New Zealand Labour Party (1910)|original New Zealand Labour Party]] and the [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] to the current [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] formed in 1916.&lt;ref name="DNZB Paul" /&gt; He was New Zealand Labour Party president 1918 to 1920, and stood as [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Dunedin South]] in [[New Zealand general election, 1919|1919]]; losing by only 84 votes against [[Thomas Sidey]] of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]]; he did not stand for parliament again.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=164}}{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=234}}

He was also involved in the WEA ([[Workers' Educational Association]]), and was Vice-President of the NZ Land Values League which expoused [[Georgism|Georgist]] policies. He was pro-conscription in World War I.

In the [[1958 New Year Honours]], Paul was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for services in the fields of journalism and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 41270 |date=1 January 1958 |page=44 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, he looked after his ailing wife, who died in 1961. Paul died on 25 July 1964 at [[Raumati]] on the [[Kapiti Coast]]. He was survived by their two sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Paul" /&gt;

'''Vasile Milea''' (1 January 1927, [[Lerești]], [[Argeș County|Argeș]] &amp;ndash; 22 December 1989) was [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s minister of defense during the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989 and was involved in the reprisal phase of the revolution that caused the deaths of 162 people.
[[File:Boulevard General Vasile Milea, Bukarest, Sektor 6.jpg|thumb|Boulevard General Vasile Milea, Bucharest, Sector 6]]
On 22 December 1989, Ceaușescu sacked him for not ordering his men to fire on the demonstrators who'd taken to the streets of Bucharest a day earlier.  According to the official account, Ceaușescu considered this an act of treason, and Milea committed suicide shortly afterward. However, several members of his family claim that he was killed on the orders of Ceaușescu. Milea was already in severe disfavour for sending troops to quell the uprising in [[Timișoara]] without ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|date=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever the case, Milea's death caused the rank-and-file soldiers to go over almost ''en masse'' to the revolution, effectively ending Communist rule in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bransten (1999), [http://interconnected.org/notes/2004/11/prague/mirrors/www.rferl.org/nca/special/10years/romania2.html "Romania: The Bloody Revolution in 1989: Chaos As The Ceausescus Are Executed"], Ten Years After: The Fall of the Communism in East/Central Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from 2005 after a full investigation including a postmortem concludes that Milea killed himself using the weapon of one of his attendants. It seems that he only tried to incapacitate himself in order to be relieved from office, but the bullet hit an artery and he died soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Cristian Marcau, [http://www.utgjiu.ro/revista/lit/pdf/2013-04/16_Flavius%20Cristian%20Marcau%20-%20Revolution%20of%201989%20-%20Milea%60s%20suicide.pdf "Revolution of 1989: Milea's Suicide"], University of Târgu Jiu, Letter and Social Science Series, Issue 4, 2013, Retrieved February 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
