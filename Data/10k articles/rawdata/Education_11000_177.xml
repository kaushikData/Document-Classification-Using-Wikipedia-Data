'''ActionQuest''' is an organization which offers adventure programs for teenagers during the months of June, July and August. These programs include sail training, marine science, and SCUBA training courses in locations throughout the [[Caribbean]], [[Australia]], [[Ecuador]] and the [[Galapagos]], [[Tahiti]], and the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/pf/0705/gallery.summer_camps/&lt;/ref&gt; ActionQuest is a member of the [[Global Expeditions Group]] family of brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalexpeditionsgroup.com/|title=Global Expeditions Group|website=Global Expeditions Group|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ActionQuest is a Tall Ships America affiliate member and participates in its annual conference in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sailtraining.org/membervessels/affiliates/actionquest.php|title=Actionquest/Actionsail Programs|website=www.sailtraining.org|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Mission ==
ActionQuest is an institution dedicated to "guiding diverse groups of young adults on exceptional global expeditions; challenging them with high action adventures that promote personal growth, teamwork and leadership".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actionquest.com/aboutus.html?pid=8&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ActionQuest began running programs in the [[British Virgin Islands]] in the mid-1980s; however, its seafaring history extends back to the [[Flint School]]. In his youth before starting ActionQuest, Jim Stoll worked as an educator and sailed with his mother and father at their family preparatory school known as the [[Flint School]]. Additionally, he had the opportunity to sail with [[Irving Johnson|Irving and Exy Johnson]], who are considered the pioneers of sea training and was inspired to continue creating sail training programs himself.

ActionQuest headquarters are located in [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]]. A large bulk of the summer programs are run out of West End, [[Tortola]], at Soper's Hole Marina using yachts chartered from [[TUI Travel|Sunsail]]. Sunsail has since moved its charter base from West End to Hodge's Creek and finally to [[Road Town]] in 2007. ActionQuest continues to charter boats through them.

When the founder's son decided to complete his goal of sailing around the world, he sailed to various locations in which ActionQuest later decided to expand their programs. By the late 1990s, ActionQuest included programs in satellite locations such as [[Tahiti]] and [[French Polynesia]], [[Fiji]], [[Australia]], and the [[Galapagos]].

In 2006, ActionQuest's sister company Sea|mester built the 112-foot [[staysail]] [[schooner]] [[Argo (Yacht)|''Argo'']] for college students; however, in the summertime, programs are opened to high school teenagers to sail aboard in either the Mediterranean or the Western Pacific.

ActionQuest uses [[PADI]] certified scuba instructors and offers courses from Open Water Diver through Divemaster. ActionQuest also works with [[International Yacht Training Worldwide|International Yachtmaster Training]] (IYT) for sailing certifications. The Majority of students gain an Open Water certification in the British Virgin Islands. Marine Biology is also offered for high school credit in the BVI's. [3]

From ActionQuest grew two other institutions, [[Seamester|Sea|mester]] Global Programs and [[Lifeworks|GoBeyond Student Travel]]. Sea|mester owns two schooners, [[Ocean Star (schooner)|''Ocean Star'']] and [[Argo (Yacht)|''Argo'']] to run full-time training programs for college students around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seamester.com/our-vessels/|title=Spend a semester at sea aboard Argo &amp; Ocean Star - Sea{{!}}mester|website=www.seamester.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifeworks|GoBeyond Student Travel]] runs community-service based programs in the [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Galapagos]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Thailand]].

[[File:Amy Biehl Foundation Trust Gugulethu 02.jpg|thumb|446x446px|[[Amy Biehl]] Foundation Trust monument in [[Gugulethu]]]]
The '''Amy Biehl Foundation Trust''' was the organization established in Cape Town, South Africa by Linda and Peter Biehl commemorate their daughter [[Amy Biehl]], a white American anti-[[apartheid]] activist who was killed by a black mob during racial violence in [[South Africa]] in 1993. 

Today two organizations are the successors to the Amy Biehl Foundation Trust.

The Amy Biehl Foundation USA is headed by Linda Biehl and based in the United States.

The Amy Foundation is based in Cape Town.

The reasons for the split into two organizations include Linda and Peter Biehl's desire for the South African organization to stand on its own as a sustainable organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/usaabf/photos/a.768982269786127.1073741828.730211996996488/1800439976640346/?type=3&amp;theater|website=Facebok|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the book, We Are Not Such Things, it is also reported that by 2013, Linda Biehl had been at odds with the South African foundation for several years, after mismanagement by its South African directors&lt;ref name="We Are Not Such Things"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Der Leun|first1=Justine|title=We Are Not Such Things|date=2016|publisher=Spiegel And Grau|isbn=9780812994506|page=435-436}},&lt;/ref&gt;

The original foundation strived to fulfil three rights in the South African Constitution: the right to education, the right to equal employment, and the right to health. The foundation's mission statement is "to weave a barrier against violence" and "to prevent youth violence through a holistic approach to community development in socio-economically disadvantaged communities in and around Cape Town."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amybiehl.co.za|title=Amy Foundation {{!}} Non Profit Organization - Home Page|website=Amy Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to do so by empowering the youths of the [[townships]] around Cape Town, mainly through after-school programs with activities like music, dance, drama, sports, crafts and HIV/AIDS peer education. These programs were run at several township-schools every afternoon, and in addition the foundation ran weekly activities outside the townships for some of the children, and they also have Saturday and Holiday programs. The Foundation initially received funding from USAID as well as private donations.

Linda Biehl, Amy's mother and a founder of the trust, speaks on the promise of [[restorative justice]], and continues the work of the foundation. She was awarded the [[Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo]] (bronze class) in 2008 by South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]].&lt;ref&gt;Bathandwa Mbola. [http://www.southafrica.info/about/democracy/nationalorders2008.htm "South Africa honours Linda Biehl"], ''SouthAfrica.info'', 23 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the four men convicted for Biehl's murder, Easy Nofemela and Ntobeko Peni, have since reconciled with her parents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/02/28/60II/main165933.shtml "Amy's Story"], ''CBS News'', 1999, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and are now working for the Foundation in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theforgivenessproject.com/stories/linda-biehl-easy-nofemela|title=Linda Biehl &amp; Easy Nofemela (South Africa) - Forgiveness Project|work=Forgiveness Project|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antiscience''' is a position that rejects [[science]] and the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Anti-science|author=Gerald Holton |year=1993|isbn=9780674792982|publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; People holding antiscientific views do not accept that science as an [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] method can generate [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] knowledge. They also contend that scientific [[reductionism]] in particular is an inherently limited means to reach understanding of a complex world.

==History==
In the beginnings of the [[scientific revolution]], scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]] found themselves in conflict with those such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], who were skeptical of whether science was a satisfactory way to obtain genuine knowledge about the world.

Hobbes' stance is sometimes regarded as an antiscience position:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In his ''Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematics,''...[published in 1656, Hobbes] distinguished 'demonstrable' fields, as 'those the construction of the subject whereof is in the power of the artist himself,' from 'indemonstrable' ones 'where the causes are to seek for.' We can only know the causes of what we make. So geometry is demonstrable, because 'the lines and figures from which we reason are drawn and described by ourselves' and 'civil philosophy is demonstrable, because we make the commonwealth ourselves.' But we can only speculate about the natural world, because 'we know not the construction, but seek it from the effects.'&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shapiro, ''[https://shapiro.macmillan.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/skinner-and-pettit.pdf Reflections on Skinner and Pettit],'' Hobbes Studies, 22 (2009), pp. 185–91, citation from pp. 190–91&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was also Hobbes who "put forth the idea of the significance of the nonrational in human behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;Richard H Jones, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sUgnio874NUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Reductionism: Analysis and the Fullness of Reality],'' Lewisburg, Pa: Bucknell University Press, 2000, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Jones goes on to group Hobbes along with others he classes as 'antireductionists' and 'individualists,' such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[J S Mill]], and then he adds [[Karl Popper]], [[John Rawls]], and [[E. O. Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in his ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'', claimed that science can lead to [[immorality]]. "Rousseau argues that the progression of the sciences and arts has caused the corruption of virtue and morality" and his "critique of science has much to teach us about the dangers involved in our political commitment to scientific progress, and about the ways in which the future happiness of mankind might be secured".&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.bc.edu/dissertations/AAI3176656/ Jeffrey J S Black, ''Rousseau's critique of science: A commentary on the Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts'', Boston College, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Rousseau does not state in his Discourses that sciences are ''necessarily'' bad, and states that figures like [[René Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]] should be held in high regard. In the conclusion to the Discourses, he says that these (aforementioned) can cultivate sciences to great benefit, and that morality's corruption is mostly because of society's bad influence on scientists.

[[William Blake]] reacted strongly against the work of Isaac Newton in his paintings and writings, and is seen as being perhaps the earliest (and almost certainly the most prominent and enduring) example of what is seen by historians as the [[aesthetic]] or [[Romanticism|romantic]] antiscience response. For example, in his 1795 poem [[Auguries of Innocence]], Blake describes the beautiful and natural [[European robin|robin redbreast]] imprisoned by the materialistic cage of Newtonian mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online-literature.com/blake/612/ William Blake, Auguries of Innocence]&lt;/ref&gt; In Blake's [[Newton (Blake)|painting of Newton]], he is depicted "as a misguided hero whose gaze was directed only at sterile geometrical diagrams drawn on the ground".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~his291/Newton.html Notes to Blake's ''Newton'', at Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt; Blake thought that "Newton, Bacon, and [[John Locke|Locke]] with their emphasis on reason were nothing more than 'the three great teachers of [[atheism]], or Satan's Doctrine'...the picture progresses from exuberance and colour on the left, to sterility and blackness on the right. In Blake's view Newton brings not light, but night".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learning/worksinfocus/blake/imagin/cast_05.html ''Newton: Personification of Man Limited by Reason'', Tate Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt; In a poem, [[W.H. Auden]] summarises Blake's anti-scientific views by saying that he "[broke] off relations in a curse, with the Newtonian Universe".&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Auden, "New Year Letter, 1940", in Collected Poems, Edited by Edward Mendelson, London: Faber, 1994, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent biographer of Newton&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isaac-newton.org/ Stephen D Snobelen, ''Writings on Newton'', 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; considers him more as a [[renaissance]] [[alchemy|alchemist]], natural philosopher, and magician rather than a true representative of scientific illuminism, as popularized by [[Voltaire]] and other illuminist [[Newtonianism|Newtonians]].

Antiscience issues are seen as a fundamental consideration in the transition from 'pre-science' or '[[protoscience]]' such as that evident in [[alchemy]]. Many disciplines that pre-date the widespread adoption and acceptance of the scientific method, such as [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], are not seen as anti-science. However, some of the orthodoxies within those disciplines that predate a scientific approach (such as those orthodoxies repudiated by the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) are seen as being a product of an anti-scientific stance.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated within [[The Gay Science]] that “in Science, convictions have no rights of citizenship, as is said with good reason. Only when they decide to descend to the modesty of a hypothesis, of a provisional experimental point of view, of a regulative fiction, maybe they be granted admission and even a certain value within the realm of knowledge—though always with the restriction that they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust. But does this not mean, more precisely considered, that a conviction may obtain admission to Science only when it ceases to be a conviction? Would not the discipline of the scientific spirit begin with this, no longer to permit oneself any convictions? Probably that is how it is. But one must still ask whether it is not the case that, in order that this discipline could begin, a conviction must have been there already, and even such a commanding and unconditional one that it sacrificed all other convictions for its own sake. It is clear that Science too rests on a faith; there is no Science ‘without presuppositions.’ The question whether truth is needed must not only have been affirmed in advance, but affirmed to the extent that the principle, the faith, the conviction is expressed: ‘nothing is needed more than truth, and in relation to it, everything else has only second-rate value.”&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=blfwSlxhjvAC&amp;pg=PT278&amp;lpg=PT278&amp;dq=Probably+that+is+how+it+is.+But+one+must+still+ask+whether+it+is+not+the+case+that,+in+order+that+this+discipline+could+begin,+a+conviction+must+have+been+there+already,+and+even+such+a+commanding+and+unconditional+one+that+it+sacrificed+all+other+convictions+for+its+own+sake.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ksQoq4RzJH&amp;sig=iJm1fCqz9j4amUVzWLes1SMpgD8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTucrynLLbAhUFmJQKHTS1CY8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Probably%20that%20is%20how%20it%20is.%20But%20one%20must%20still%20ask%20whether%20it%20is%20not%20the%20case%20that%2C%20in%20order%20that%20this%20discipline%20could%20begin%2C%20a%20conviction%20must%20have%20been%20there%20already%2C%20and%20even%20such%20a%20commanding%20and%20unconditional%20one%20that%20it%20sacrificed%20all%20other%20convictions%20for%20its%20own%20sake.&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '[[scientism]]' derives from [[science studies]] and is a term spawned and used by [[sociologist]]s and [[philosophers of science]] to describe the views, beliefs and behavior of strong supporters of science. It is commonly used in a pejorative sense, for individuals who seem to be treating science in a similar way to a religion. The term [[reductionism]] is occasionally used in a similarly pejorative way (as a more subtle attack on scientists). However, some scientists feel comfortable being labelled as reductionists, while agreeing that there might be conceptual and philosophical shortcomings of reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;George J. Klir, ''Facets of Systems Science,'' New York: Springer, 1991, pp. 263–65&lt;/ref&gt;

However, non-reductionist (see [[Emergentism]]) views of science have been formulated in varied forms in several scientific fields like [[statistical physics]], [[chaos theory]], [[Complex systems|complexity theory]], [[cybernetics]], [[systems theory]], [[systems biology]], [[ecology]], [[information theory]], etc. Such fields tend to assume that strong interaction between units produce new phenomena in higher levels that cannot be accounted for solely by reductionism. For example, it is not valuable (or currently possible) to describe a chess game or gene networks using quantum mechanics.

===Left-wing{{anchor|Left-wing antiscience}}===
One expression of antiscience is the "denial of [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] and... legitimisation of alternatives", {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and that the results of scientific findings do not always represent any underlying reality, but can merely reflect the ideology of dominant groups within society.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C. Wicks and R. Edward Freeman, ''Organization Studies and the New Pragmatism: Positivism, Anti-Positivism, and the Search for Ethics,'' Organization Science, 9.2, Mar–Apr. 1998, pp. 123–40&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, science is associated with the political Right and is seen as a belief system that is conservative and conformist, that suppresses [[innovation]], that resists change and that acts dictatorially. This includes the view, for example, that science has a "[[bourgeois]] and/or [[Eurocentric]] and/or [[masculinist]] world-view".&lt;ref&gt;Alan D Sokal, ''What the Social Text Affair Does and Does not Prove,'' Critical Quarterly, 40.2, July 1998, pp. 3–18&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{visible anchor|Right-wing|Right-wing antiscience}}===
The origin of antiscience thinking may be traced back to the reaction of [[Romanticism]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], this movement is often referred to as the '[[Counter-Enlightenment]]'. Romanticism emphasizes that intuition, passion and organic links to Nature are primal values and that rational thinking is merely a product of human life. There are many modern examples of [[conservative]] antiscience polemics. Primary among the latter are the polemics about [[evolution]]ary theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = William D. Anderson Jr. |date=September 2003 | title = Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science | journal = [[Copeia]] | volume = 2003 | issue = 3 | pages=675–77 | doi=10.1643/ot-03-047}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modern [[cosmology]] teaching in high schools, and [[environmental issues]] related to [[global warming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/06/30/climate_act/index.html Joseph Romm, "Anti-science conservatives must be stopped", Salon.com, June 30, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024037/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/06/30/climate_act/index.html |date=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]]| title = [[The Republican War on Science]]| publisher = Basic Books| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[energy crisis]].

Characteristics of antiscience associated with the right include the appeal to [[conspiracy theories]] to explain why scientists believe what they believe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Pascal Diethelm | author2 = Martin McKee | year = 2009 | title = Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond? | journal = European Journal of Public Health | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages=2–4 | doi = 10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 | pmid=19158101}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to undermine the confidence or power usually associated to science (e.g. in [[Global warming conspiracy theory|global warming conspiracy theories]]).

===Religious===
{{main article|Relationship between religion and science}}

In this context, antiscience may be considered dependent on religious,  moral and cultural arguments. For this kind of religious antiscience philosophy, science is an anti-spiritual and materialistic force that undermines traditional values, ethnic identity and accumulated historical wisdom in favor of [[reason]] and [[cosmopolitanism]]. In particular, the traditional and ethnic values emphasized are similar to those of [[white supremacist]] [[Christian Identity]] theology, but similar right-wing views have been developed by radically conservative sects of [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. New religious movements such as [[New Age]] thinking also criticize the scientific worldview as favouring a [[reductionist]], [[atheist]], or [[materialist]] philosophy.

A frequent basis of antiscientific sentiment is religious [[theism]] with literal interpretations of sacred text. Here, scientific theories that conflict with what is considered divinely-inspired knowledge are regarded as flawed. Over the centuries religious institutions have been hesitant to embrace such ideas as [[heliocentrism]] and [[planetary orbit|planetary motion]] because they contradicted the dominant understanding of various passages of scripture.  More recently the body of creation theologies known collectively as [[creationism]], including the [[teleological]] theory of [[intelligent design]], have been promoted by religious theists in response to the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon D. Miller, Eugenie C. Scott, Shinji Okamoto ''Public Acceptance of Evolution'' Science 11 August 2006: Vol. 313. no. 5788, pp. 765–66&lt;/ref&gt;

To the extent that attempts to overcome antiscience sentiments have failed, some argue that a different approach to science advocacy is needed. One such approach says that it is important to develop a more accurate understanding of those who deny science (avoiding stereotyping them as backward and uneducated) and also to attempt [[science outreach|outreach]] via those who share cultural values with target audiences, such as scientists who also hold religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davidson |first1=Gregg |last2=Hill |first2=Carol |last3=Wolgemuth |first3=Ken |title=We Need a Paradigm Shift in Science Advocacy |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas==
Historically, antiscience first arose as a reaction against [[scientific materialism]]. The 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had ushered in "the ideal of a unified system of all the sciences",&lt;ref name="Berlin"&gt;Isaiah Berlin, The Proper Study of Mankind, London: Pimlico, 1997, p328&lt;/ref&gt; but there were those fearful of this notion, who "felt that constrictions of reason and science, of a single all-embracing system... were in some way constricting, an obstacle to their vision of the world, chains on their imagination or feeling".&lt;ref name="Berlin" /&gt; Antiscience then is a rejection of "the scientific model [or paradigm]... with its strong implication that only that which was quantifiable, or at any rate, measurable... was real".&lt;ref name="Berlin" /&gt; In this sense, it comprises a "critical attack upon the total claim of the new scientific method to dominate the entire field of human knowledge".&lt;ref name="Berlin" /&gt; However, scientific positivism ([[logical positivism]]) does not deny the reality of non-measurable phenomena, only that those phenomena should not be adequate to scientific investigation. Moreover, [[positivism]], as a philosophical basis for the [[scientific method]], is not consensual or even dominant in the scientific community (see [[philosophy of science]]).

Three major areas of antiscience can be seen in philosophy, sociology, and ecology. The following quotes explore this aspect of the subject.

===Philosophy===
Philosophical objections against science are often objections about the role of reductionism. For example, in the field of psychology, "both reductionists and antireductionists accept that... non-molecular explanations may not be improved, corrected or grounded in molecular ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "epistemological antireductionism holds that, given our finite mental capacities, we would not be able to grasp the ultimate physical explanation of many complex phenomena even if we knew the laws governing their ultimate
constituents".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9653712&amp;dopt=Abstract Nagel T. "Reductionism and antireductionism". Novartis Found Symp. 1998; 213:3–10; discussion 10-4, 73–75.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some see antiscience as "common...in academic settings...many people see that there are problems in demarcation between science, scientism, and pseudoscience resulting in an antiscience stance. Some argue that nothing can be known for sure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://alliance1.org/Conferences/NLCCWI2006post/materials/80-4Gambrill.pdf Eileen Gambrill, Evidence based practice, an alternative to authority based practice, Families in Society, the Journal of Contemporary Human Services, 80.4, 1999, 341–50] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929202018/http://alliance1.org/Conferences/NLCCWI2006post/materials/80-4Gambrill.pdf |date=29 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers are "divided as to whether reduction should be a central strategy for understanding the world".&lt;ref name="ToddJones"&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00341.x?journalCode=meta Todd Jones, Reductionism and Antireductionism: Rights and Wrongs, Metaphilosophy, Volume 35, Number 5, October 2004, pp. 614–47]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many agree that "there are, nevertheless, reasons why we want science to discover properties and explanations other than reductive physical ones".&lt;ref name="ToddJones" /&gt; Such issues stem "from an antireductionist worry that there is no absolute conception of reality, that is, a characterization of reality such as... science claims to provide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csupomona.edu/~pwross/Sensibility%20Theory%20and%20Conservative%20Complacency.DOC Peter W. Ross and Dale Turner, "Sensibility Theory and Conservative Complacency"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619191036/http://www.csupomona.edu/~pwross/Sensibility%20Theory%20and%20Conservative%20Complacency.DOC |date=19 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is close to the Kantian view that reality is ultimately unknowable and all models are just imperfect approximations to it.

===Sociology===
Sociologist [[Thomas F. Gieryn|Thomas Gieryn]] refers to "some sociologists who might appear to be antiscience".&lt;ref name="Gieryn"&gt;{{cite journal
  |title = ''Real Science: What It Is and What It Means'' by John Ziman

  |doi=10.1086/374156
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some "philosophers and antiscience types", he contends, may have presented "unreal images of science that threaten the believability of scientific knowledge",&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; or appear to have gone "too far in their antiscience deconstructions".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; The question often lies in how much scientists conform to the standard ideal of "communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, originality, and... skepticism".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; Unfortunately, "scientists don't always conform... scientists do get passionate about pet theories; they do rely on reputation in judging a scientist's work; they do pursue fame and gain via research".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt; Thus, they may show inherent biases in their work. "[Many] scientists are not as rational and logical as the legend would have them, nor are they as illogical or irrational as some relativists might say".&lt;ref name="Gieryn" /&gt;

===Ecology and health sphere===
Within the ecological and health spheres, [[Richard Levins|Levins]] identifies a conflict "not between science and antiscience, but rather between different pathways for science and technology; between a commodified science-for-profit and a gentle science for humane goals; between the sciences of the smallest parts and the sciences of dynamic wholes... [he] offers proposals for a more holistic, integral approach to understanding and addressing environmental issues".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Levins, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/Q4TN-Q9U2-ER56-3T1R Whose Scientific Method? Scientific Methods for a Complex World], New Solutions: ''A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy'', Vol.13,3, 2003, 261–74&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are also common within the scientific community, with for example, scientists being prominent in environmental campaigns warning of environmental dangers such as [[ozone depletion]] and the [[greenhouse effect]]. It can also be argued that this version of antiscience comes close to that found in the medical sphere, where patients and practitioners may choose to reject science and adopt a [[pseudoscientific]] approach to health problems. This can be both a practical and a conceptual shift and has attracted strong criticism: "therapeutic touch, a healing technique based upon the laying-on of hands, has found wide acceptance in the nursing profession despite its lack of scientific plausibility. Its acceptance is indicative of a broad antiscientific trend in nursing".&lt;ref name="Glazer"&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1466-769X.2000.00061.x?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=nup Sarah Glazer, "Therapeutic touch and postmodernism in nursing", Nursing Philosophy (2001) 2(3), 196–212.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazer also criticises the therapists and patients, "for abandoning the biological underpinnings of nursing and for misreading philosophy in the service of an antiscientific world-view".&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; In contrast, Brian Martin criticized Gross and Levitt by saying that "[their] basic approach is to attack [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivists]] for not being [[Positivism|positivists]],"&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/96sss1.html Brian Martin, Social Construction of an 'Attack on Science', ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 26, No. 1, February 1996, pp. 161–73.]&lt;/ref&gt; and that science is "presented as a unitary object, usually identified with scientific knowledge. It is portrayed as neutral and objective. Second, science is claimed to be under attack by 'antiscience' which is composed essentially of ideologues who are threats to the neutrality and objectivity that are fundamental to science. Third, a highly selective attack is made on the arguments of 'antiscience'".&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Such people allegedly then "routinely equate critique of scientific knowledge with hostility to science, a jump that is logically unsupportable and empirically dubious".&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Having then "constructed two artificial entities, a unitary 'science' and a unitary 'academic left', each reduced to [[epistemology|epistemological]] essences, Gross and Levitt proceed to attack. They pick out figures in each of several areas – science studies, postmodernism, feminism, environmentalism, AIDS activism – and criticise their critiques of science".&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

The writings of Young serve to illustrate more antiscientific views: "The strength of the antiscience movement and of alternative technology is that their advocates have managed to retain Utopian vision while still trying to create concrete instances of it".&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;[http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/sisr1.html Robert M. Young, Science is Social Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; "The real social, ideological and economic forces shaping science...[have] been opposed to the point of suppression in many quarters. Most scientists hate it and label it 'antiscience'. But it is urgently needed, because it makes science self-conscious and hopefully self-critical and accountable with respect to the forces which shape research priorities, criteria, goals".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;

Genetically modified foods also bring about antiscience sentiment. The general public has recently become more aware of the dangers of a poor diet, as there have been numerous studies that show that the two are inextricably linked.&lt;ref name="Foreman"&gt;[http://www.biotech-info.net/CTF_remarks.html Carol Tucker Foreman, Genetic Modification of Foods: The Public's Mistrust of Science and Science's Misunderstanding of the Public, "Consumer Choice"]&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-science dictates that science is untrustworthy, because it is never complete and always being revised, which would be a probable cause for the fear that the general public has of genetically modified foods despite scientific reassurance that such foods are safe.

Antivaccinationists rely on whatever comes to hand presenting some of their arguments as if scientific, however a strain of antiscience is part of their approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885912000821 | doi=10.1016/j.humimm.2012.03.014 | volume=73 | issue=8 | title=The clinician's guide to the anti-vaccinationists' galaxy | journal=Human Immunology | pages=859–66 | pmid=22504410 | date=Aug 2012| author1=Poland | first1=G.

==Opposition to reductionism and positivism==
{{refimprove|date=February 2008}}

===On the limitations of models===
A common antiscientific point of contention arises from the fact that mathematical models do not capture the full reality of existence, as can be seen in this quote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The formulas of mathematical models are "artificial constructions, logical figments with no necessary relation to the outside world". These models always "leave out the richest and most important part of human experience...daily life, history, human laws and institutions, the modes of human self-expression".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Isaiah Berlin, ''Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder,'' Princeton: Princeton Univ Press, 2000, pp. 110–23&lt;/ref&gt; A failure to appreciate the subtle complexity of social worlds, means they get excluded from the formulas, even though, "no easy reductionism will do justice to the material". This approach often fails to concentrate "on social structures, processes, and actions in a specific sense (inequality, mobility, classes, strata, ethnicity, gender relations, urbanization, work and life of different types of people, not just elites)", and so tends to generate mostly meaningless oversimplifications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is also a common antiscientific point to state that ''verbal'' (say, literary and non-mathematical) models are  poor representations of reality. If it is clear that a particular [[statistical]] or [[psychological]] study about [[romantic love]] or [[religious ecstasy]] (see [[neurotheology]]) captures only a tiny fraction of such human experiences, literary accounts and simplified verbal models also cannot adequately convey their full complexity. Both verbal and mathematical models are (partial) maps of reality, providing different points of view, but inherently incomplete descriptions of the territory of human and [[universe]] existence (see [[map–territory relation]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Avicenna International College''' – AIC – (Hungarian: Avicenna Nemzetközi Kollégium) was founded in 1995 by Dr. Shahrokh MirzaHosseini and has been in operation as a preparatory college for [[higher education]] since 2000.

The college offers foundation programs in medicine, business, technical studies and English, as well as preparatory programs for [[Master's degree|Masters]] and [[PhD]] studies.

==History==
The predecessor to Avicenna International College was founded in 1995 and the college launched its first academic year in 2000. Since then more than 3000 students have successfully completed one of the institution’s preparatory programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avicenna.hu/colleges/avicenna AIC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 AIC established its International Advisory Board. The Advisory Board supervises and supports the educational activities and programs of the college. It observes and evaluates the educational plans and strategies, and advises the college officers on development of the quality management system.

In 2004 AIC opened the Avicenna Residential Complex for the college's growing international student population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avicenna.hu/colleges/our-facilities/residental-complex Residential Complex]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006 and 2007 the institution got its accreditation in [[Hungary]] and [[Iran]], and since 2007 the [[Sweden|Swedish]] governmental student agency recognizes AIC as well.

In 2006 AIC started a scholarship program to give aid to those students who have financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avicenna.hu/colleges/education/scholarship Scholarships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Advisory Board==
Avicenna’s advisory board was founded in 2003, and since then it helped the institution’s work immensely.

'''Bachelor of Film and Television''' (usually '''BF&amp;TV''' or '''BFTV''') is an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded to students who have studied elements of [[Filmmaking]] and [[Television production]] at a three-year accredited university, or a four-year accredited college. 

This degree is a relatively new degree program offered mainly in [[Australia]] and differs from most degrees by its practical focus. Many universities offer Film and Television as a single unit, or series of units (major) study in a [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] or [[Bachelor_of_Communications#BComn|Bachelor of Communications]].
Increasingly, colleges in Ontario granted degree-granting status, are delivering professional baccalaureate degrees combining practice and theory. [http://www.sheridancollege.ca Sheridan College,] (Oakville, Ontario) will be launching a Bachelor of Film and TV in September 2014. 

The degree usually consists of study in areas of [[Scriptwriting]], [[Film director|Film]] and [[Television director|Television]] Directing, [[Animation]], [[Sound]], [[Cinematography]], [[Lighting]] and [[Typography]].

'''Baskaran Pillai''', also known as Dattatreya Siva Baba or Siva Baba, is an accomplished master of the Tamil Siddha tradition and one of the first of his lineage to bring secretive knowledge of the Tamil Siddhas to the West. [[Wayne Dyer]] was the first celebrity to follow and publicize Pillai’s manifestation teachings through his book ''Manifest your Destiny'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Secrets to Manifesting Your Destiny by Wayne Dyer|url = http://www.nightingale.com/manifesting-your-destiny.html|website = nightingale|first = Manifest|last = Destiny}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he dedicated to Pillai.  The Tamil [[Siddhar]] are spiritual renegades who believed in 200% life, i.e. living a 100% material and 100% spiritual life simultaneously. Since March 2007 Pillai has attracted a large number of viewers as testified by his free YouTube videos teaching the Siddha knowledge.  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called Pillai the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The YouTube Guru |url = http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1847259_1847281_1847277,00.html|website = TIME| date = 3 October 2008|first = YouTube |last = Guru}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube guru. As a philanthropist he has initiated many projects across India, Mexico and the U.S., which include the Million Meals Project and educating underprivileged children. His educational programs in public schools and tuition centers improves the academic and social skills of disadvantaged students in India, Mexico and the United States through brain-enhancement sounds. These programs are implemented through the Tripura Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripurafoundation.org Tripura Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; established by Pillai in 1991, a consulting non-governmental organization to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).

==Early life==
Baskaran Pillai was born on 1 February 1949, in [[Rameswaram]], an island in Southern India that lies between [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. His father was Subramania Pillai, a painter and photographer who ran a small business for pilgrims who visited Rameswaram, which happens to be one of the most important holy places for all Hindus. His mother Nambu Lakshmi was a housewife and the daughter of the Village head of Rameswaram. Pillai grew up with four siblings, all boys, in an island without electricity, automobiles or any other modern amenities.  As a child, Pillai's mother, concerned with Pillai’s spiritual attractions and sleeplessness, consulted physicians who found no medical issues. His family dissuaded him from pursuing spiritual interests and instead encouraged academics and mundane pursuits.

==Education==
Pillai went to the government school in Rameswaram and later on to a government college in [[Ramanathapuram]]. In 1971 and 1977, he received his Bachelors and Master's degree respectively in English literature from the University of Madurai.  Pillai’s interest in spirituality led him to become a TM teacher under the guidance of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] during which time he spent a few years in and out of [[Rishikesh]], Himalayas. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi appointed Pillai as the head of his organization in the state of Tamil Nadu, a post which Pillai ultimately renounced.

During 1979-81 Pillai was awarded the University's Scholarship to do research on Comparative Literature. He received a second degree, a Master of Letters in 1982, writing a thesis comparing John Donne's poetry to that of Kalladanar, a Tamil poet of the 10th Century. Pillai recollects that the period of living with University wizards, planted the seeds of unquenchable thirst for knowledge and spirit of investigation which deeply impacted his personal teachings.

In 1983, he left for the US to pursue his PhD at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. His graduate work involved phenomenology of religion with a dissertation on [[Manikkavacakar]], a South Indian mystic. Pillai served as both faculty and teacher of the University of Pittsburgh's Informal Programs from 1985-1989.  After receiving his PhD in 1989, Dr. Pillai served as the Coordinator of Indian Studies under the Asian Studies program. He then moved on to the Indian Heritage Research Foundation and became the subject editor for the [[Encyclopedia of Hinduism]].

==Marriage==

In 1976, Baskaran married Vasantha. Being a householder, his spirituality met with challenges of running a family life.  He has one daughter.

==Teaching==
Although Pillai moved out of the TM movement, he continued spiritual pursuits.  From 1984-1988, Pillai taught at the Pitt Informal Program (PIP) a variety of Buddhist, Tantric and Yogic meditation courses.  While working on his Doctoral dissertation, Pillai lectured on Hinduism and Buddhism in and around the Pittsburgh area besides teaching undergraduate students a course on a Survey of World Religions.   Pillai made a decision to leave the academia and to teach spirituality and accordingly from 1989 onwards he has traveled extensively teaching spirituality and meditation.

In 1990 Pillai moved briefly to [[Los Angeles, California]] and began to teach meditation seminars. By the same time, he also established &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Tripura Foundation rewards children with hope|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tripura-foundation-rewards-children-with-hope/article5631846.ece|website = The Hindu| date = 30 January 2014|first = Tripura|last = hope}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tripura Foundation, a charitable educational organization to educate people on the value of spirituality in human life and culture. Tripura Foundation has charitable projects in USA, India and [[Mexico]].
[[File:Dr Pillai - Pittsburgh, PA 1992.jpg|thumb|Dr Pillai - Pittsburgh, PA 1992]]
[[File:Pillai2000.png|thumb|Dr Pillai - India, 2000]]

During this 10-year time (1990–2000) Dr. Pillai went through many personal transformations, changing his spiritual name many times. He was known as Sri Guruji, Brzee, Sri Siva, Siva Baba,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Dattatreya Siva Baba, the YouTube Guru, predicts a new age of enlightenment starting on this month's full moon|url = http://www.sfgate.com/living/article/Dattatreya-Siva-Baba-the-YouTube-Guru-predicts-2481690.php|website = SFGATE| date = 14 July 2008 |first = Dattatreya|last = moon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dattatreya Siva Baba and so on. Dr. Pillai jokingly calls his names as impersonations that he assumed based on divine palm leaves astrological readings that revealed his previous incarnations as Shirdi Baba, Dattatreya, Swami Ramalingam and others. Dr.Pillai was also independently listed in Walter Semkiw MD’s book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Born Again: Reincarnation Cases Involving International Celebrities, India's Political Legends and Film Stars|url = https://www.amazon.in/Born-Again-Reincarnation-International-Celebrities/dp/8185250375|website = Amazon| first = Born|last = Stars}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Born Again: Reincarnation Cases Involving International Celebrities, India’s Political Legends and Film Stars'' with these prior incarnations.

It was during this time that he gave Wayne Dyer the ‘ Ah’ meditation, which became popular through Dyer’s book ''Manifest Your Destiny''.  Dyer dedicated the book to Dr. Pillai who at the time was called Sri Guruji. Dr. Dyer paid tribute to Dr. Pillai in one of his last books ''I can See Clearly Now'', by writing of Dr. Pillai: "Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, Guruji, for being willing to bring this phenomenal teaching to me..."

==Publications and Media==
Pillai appeared briefly in the 1997 Italian movie ''[[Nirvana (film)]]'' as the guru to [[Christopher Lambert]]'s character.  During five years (2000–2005), Dr. Pillai self-published two books ''Life Changing Sounds: Tools from the Other Side'' and ''The One Minute Guide to Prosperity and Enlightenment''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pillaicenter.com/ebook-ebook-guide-to-prosperity-and-enlightenment-P35770.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; These books are out of print now. Pillai produced many hundreds of video clips for YouTube for which Time Magazine dubbed him as the YouTube Guru.

==Science and Religion==
In 2005, Pillai renamed his organization as Pillai Center for Mind Science and widened his vision to incorporate more scientific exploration of the spiritual principles.  Einstein’s saying that religion without science is blind and science without religion is lame, was cited frequently by Pillai and he changed his organizations and teachings to reflect that ideology.

Phonemic Intelligence is one of the first scientifically validated initiatives.  Phonemic Intelligence is based on the theory that sounds (phonemes) can change one's intelligence. The first scientific research on phonemic intelligence was carried out by SRM University Medical School, Chennai, India in 2006.  Medical students participated in the study and the results were published in a journal.  In 2011, Brain Science International in San Francisco conducted QEEG research on Phonemic Intelligence and found that Phonemic Intelligence can activate the anterior cingulate, a part of the brain associated with intelligence and compassion. Currently Phonemic Intelligence is being researched at World Care Clinical and Harvard Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcclinical.com/news/news-and-events/20150316/WorldCare%20Clinical%20to%20Lead%20Development%20of%20fMRI%20Brain%20Mapping%20Program&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot is expected to be completed by July 2016.

==Humanitarian Work==
Tripura Foundation has carried out a number of charitable activities in India, the US and Mexico, its current goal is to teach Phonemic Intelligences to under-privileged children. In India, at about 101 Tripura Hope Centers, children are actively practicing Phonemic Intelligence.  In the US, public schools in New York, Detroit and California have picked up instruction.

==Student organizations==
Washington University has over 300 [https://web.archive.org/web/20061217030031/http://su.wustl.edu/general/groupresources/directory.php registered undergraduate student organizations] on campus. All are funded by WUSTL's student government, the [[Washington University Student Union]], which has an approximately $2.5 million annual budget that is completely student controlled and is one of the largest student government budgets in the country. Known as SU for short, it sponsors large-scale campus programs including [[Walk In Lay Down|WILD]] (a semesterly concert in the quad), free copies of ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', and the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' through The Collegiate Readership Program; the [http://assemblyseries.wustl.edu Assembly Series], a weekly lecture series; and the campus television station, [[WUTV]] and the radio station, [[KWUR]] and Filmboard. [http://getinvolved.wustl.edu The Office of Student Activities] provides advisors, leadership training, counseling, and other support to the student groups on campus.

The University is home to one of the largest collegiate [[Relay For Life]] in the country, raising over $200,000 last year in total donations. Additionally, there are over 50 community service groups on campus such as a [[Habitat for Humanity]] Campus Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communityservice.wustl.edu/groups WU Community Service Groups - Community Service Office&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 10 national fraternities and 8 national sororities on campus; there are also 8 national black Greek organizations which have citywide [[St. Louis]] chapters. 9 of the fraternities have houses on the [[Danforth Campus]], while none of the sororities have houses by their own accord. Approximately 30% of Washington University students participate in Greek Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.glo.wustl.edu/students/greeklife.php# |title=Greek Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815024000/http://www.glo.wustl.edu/students/greeklife.php# |archive-date=2007-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek Organizations are governed by the principles of Arete, which focuses on Integrity, Loyalty, Philanthropy, Responsibility, Friendship, and Intellectual Curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.glo.wustl.edu/students/arete.php# |title=Our Community Values&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815022231/http://www.glo.wustl.edu/students/arete.php# |archive-date=2007-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington University Student Union===
The Washington University Student Union is the undergraduate student government of [[Washington University in St. Louis]].
Founded in 1967, Student Union carries out three major activities: representing student interests; registering, funding, and supporting student groups; and planning campus-wide events. It is divided into three branches: the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.www.studlife.com/media/storage/paper337/news/2007/02/07/News/Su.Aims.To.Rearrange.Exec.Board-2702334.shtml# |title=SU aims to rearrange exec board - News |access-date=2008-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234915/http://media.www.studlife.com/media/storage/paper337/news/2007/02/07/News/Su.Aims.To.Rearrange.Exec.Board-2702334.shtml# |archive-date=2007-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://studentunion.wustl.edu/executive/Pages/officers.aspx Student Union Executive Branch] comprises 5 elected individuals, who are the student body officials - the President, Vice President of Administration, Vice President of Finance, Vice President of Programming, and Vice President of Public Relations - who are charged with managing and allocating the budget, being the point of contact with University administration, and leading and setting the direction for Student Union. The Legislative branch includes the [http://studentunion.wustl.edu/treasury/Pages/default.aspx Treasury] and the [http://studentunion.wustl.edu/senate/Pages/default.aspx Senate]. The Treasury of the Student Union hears appeals for finances from various student groups. Approximately 300 student groups on campus are registered SU groups, utilizing a large portion of the over $2 million budget. Recent resolutions of the Senate include improving Wi-Fi capabilities, improving relations between Alumni &amp; Development and the Career Center, adding new capabilities to student ID cards, forming a LGBTQA task force, requiring all professors to distribute course syllabi and midterm grade progresses, and increasing the minimum wage of University workers.  The SU Judicial Branch includes a Constitutional Council comprising a Chief Justice, four Associate Justices, and one Alternate.  The Election Commissioners also fall under the Judicial Branch of Student Union. SU also publishes [https://web.archive.org/web/20080306041556/http://bearings.wustl.edu/ Bearings], the unofficial student handbook, and its supplemental website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://su.wustl.edu/general/groupresources/directory.php/all Directory of Student Groups]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
There is a large interest in [[A cappella]] music [[Collegiate a cappella|on campus]], spawning groups such as [[After Dark (Washington University in St. Louis)|After Dark]], The Amateurs, The Aristocats, Deliverance, The Ghost Lights, The Greenleafs, More Fools Than Wise], The Mosaic Whispers, The Pikers, SensAsian, Staam, The Stereotypes, and Sur Awaaz.&lt;ref&gt;http://acac.wustl.edu/groups&lt;/ref&gt; An umbrella organization known as [http://acac.wustl.edu/ ACAC] (A Cappella Advisory Council) oversees auditions for its member groups each fall. Many of these groups are continually selected for national collegiate a cappella compilations, such as [http://varsityvocals.com/boca BOCA] and [http://www.voicesonlyacappella.com Voices Only].  The Stereotypes have also made it to the top 8 groups of the Midwest for the past three consecutive years in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella and represented the Midwest as its sole competitor at the International Competition at [[Lincoln Center]] in 2011 where they placed 4th and received the award for Outstanding Arrangement.

Another student-run music group, [http://www.wupops.org/ the Wash U Pops Orchestra] (a.k.a. "WU Pops"), was founded in the '07-'08 school year in the spirit of traditional [[pops orchestra]]s.  It has grown significantly enough since founding to have spawned two chamber groups.  The full orchestra performs at least once a semester, with the chamber groups performing many smaller gigs both on and off campus.

The University also has a Department of Music that, in addition to providing concentrated study for music majors, also provides instrument and voice lessons to students. There are also a number of instrumental groups and ensembles in which students may participate.

Other student organizations, such as the [http://spb.wustl.edu Social Programming Board] bring in popular musical acts for [[Walk In Lay Down]] and lesser-known independent performers. Recent WILD performers include Karmin, Chance the Rapper, Wolfgang Gartner, and Matt Kearney.

== Residential life ==
[[Image:Clocktower on s40.jpg|right|thumb|The clocktower at the edge of the South 40.]]
75% of undergraduate students choose to live on campus.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Housing is guaranteed for a student for all four years if a student chooses. Most of the dormitories on campus are located on the ''South 40'', named because of its adjacent location south of the [[Danforth Campus]] and its size of {{convert|40|acre|m2}}. It is the location of all the freshman dorms as well as several upperclassman dorms, which are occupied almost exclusively by sophomores. The majority of freshman dorms consist of double rooms; two double rooms share one connecting bathroom. Upperclass dorms are available in 4-person, 6-person, and 8-person suites and apartment-style units. All of the dorms are co-ed. In coming years, the University will be allowing upperclass students the option of mixed-gender housing, whereby any combination of males and females can live in the same suite if they so choose. The University is nearing the end of an era of replacing older residence halls with newer construction. In 2007, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' rated Washington University in its top 20 list of schools whose dorms are "like palaces."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingDetails.asp?categoryID=6&amp;topicID=47 Register for The Princeton Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment where residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Wohl [[Student activity center|Student Center]], the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, Cornerstone: The Center for Advanced Learning, [[University police|University Police]] Headquarters, various student owned businesses (e.g. the [[Laundry Service|laundry service]], "Wash U Wash", and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40. Also in 2007, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' rated the University as 4th on its rankings for Best Quality of Life for students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingDetails.asp?categoryID=6&amp;topicID=51 Register for The Princeton Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nearly 20 dining locations on the Washington University campus. In addition to a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant, nearly all locations are operated by the catering service [[Bon Appétit Management Company]]. The cafeteria within the law school is operated by [[Aramark Corporation]], and the [[Einstein Bros. Bagels]] branch within Simon Hall is independently operated.  The University is one of the few that offer an abundance of Kosher food items available at the majority of dining locations on campus. The dining facilities and quality of food are consistently ranked highly by ''[[The Princeton Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingDetails.asp?categoryID=6&amp;topicID=45 Register for The Princeton Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential Colleges===
Residences on the South Forty ("the Forty") are subdivided into smaller groups: residential colleges ("res colleges"). A live-in university staff member—the residential college director ("RCD")—organizes social events within his or her residential college, comprising several houses, administratively a single unit. When originally organized, residential colleges consisted of a freshman dormitory and an upperclassman dormitory, though, currently, only five of the nine meet these criteria. Within each residential college, an elected group of students plans community-building activities and events. The [http://www.cs40.com Congress of the South 40] oversees the residential college Councils and plans a popular event "Residential College Olympics" each spring.

Residential Colleges include:
*Wayman Crow ([[Howard Nemerov]] and Nathan Dardick Houses)
*Robert S. Brookings (Arnold J. Lien and Kate M. Gregg Houses)
*[[William Greenleaf Eliot]] (WGE) (Elizabeth G. Danforth, [[Ethan A.H. Shepley]], and Butron M. Wheeler Houses)

*Kitchens - Each residential house contains a full kitchen

===South Forty Center===
The South Forty Center is a mixed-use facility consisting of dining locations, a small auditorium, fitness center, convenience store, lounges,  and residences on the upper floors. The dining location, known as Bear's Den, which includes stations such as the Cherry Tree Cafe (coffee and baked goods), Ciao Down (pasta and pizza), Grizzly Grill (burgers and other "American-style" food), WUrld Fusion (Indian inspired Global cuisine), L 'Chaim (fresh, Kosher meals), OSO Good (Mexican fare, such a tacos and burritos), and Sizzle &amp; Stir (Mongolian-style stir-fry). The Center also features convenience store, "Paws 'n' Go". More commonly known to students as "Bear Mart", the store serves as a miniature grocery store, selling snacks, drinks, fresh fruit and vegetables, and frozen meals, as well as baking goods. The area also features a soup and salad bar. The South Forty Center also houses the work-out facilities for the South 40, as well as Residential Life and Dining Services offices, and student residences on the upper floors.

===North Side===
Another group of residences, known as the [http://village.wustl.edu North Side], is located in the northwest corner of [[Danforth Campus]]. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East, and all fraternity houses except the [[Zeta Beta Tau]] house, which is off campus. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord.  The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites, as well as non-BLOC students. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn as well as its own student center.

==Greek life==
Washington University in St. Louis has eleven fraternities and eight sororities on-campus.

The '''Center for Excellence in Education''' (CEE) is an American private [[nonprofit]] organization that seeks to help academically outstanding [[high school]] and [[college]] students achieve successful careers in science and technology and fulfill [[leadership]] roles.  CEE administers three acclaimed programs: the [[Research Science Institute]] (RSI), an annual summer research program for 80 of the world's most accomplished high school students held at [[MIT]]; the [[USA Biology Olympiad]] (USABO), a national biology competition for high school students in the United States; and the Teacher Enrichment Program (TEP), a series of enrichment programs for STEM educators in the United States.

==History==
It was co-founded in 1983 by the late Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] and Joann P. DiGennaro, President of the Center for Excellence in Education.

==Goals==
The Center aims to keep the United States [[competitive]] in science and technology, and further international understanding among the future [[leader]]s.  CEE challenges students and assists them on a long-term basis to become the creators, inventors, scientists and leaders of the 21st century.

All CEE programs are open to students and teachers regardless of race, color, creed, or economic background; the only criterion is academic [[excellence]].  CEE's programs - the [[Research Science Institute]] and the [[USA Biology Olympiad]] - are offered cost-free to students competitively selected for participation. As a private nonprofit organization, CEE is not subject to federal and state mandates or political pressures.  

==Funding sources==
To date, CEE has received funds from the [[U.S. Department of State]], the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Information Agency]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[National Security Agency]], the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], the [[Small Business Administration]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]].  Private individuals and corporations, however, provide most of CEE's funding.

'''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' project, funded by the National Science Foundation, is a public integrated [[digital library]], database, and [[search engine]] for scientific papers in [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ChemXSeer|work=Critical Zone Exploration Network|publisher=National Science Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penn State (2007, July 26). Researchers Create Search Engine To Hunt Molecules Online |newspaper=ScienceDaily |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070726210910.htm|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' was conceived by Dr. Prasenjit Mitra, [[Lee Giles|Dr. Lee Giles]] and Dr. Karl Mueller as a way to integrate the chemical scientific literature with experimental, analytical, and simulation data from different types of experimental systems. The goal of the project is to create an intelligent search and database which will provide access to relevant data to a diverse community of users who have a need for chemical information. It is hosted on the [[World Wide Web]] at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The [[Pennsylvania State University]].

== Features ==
In order to provide access to relevant data to users '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' provides new features that are not available in traditional search engines or digital libraries.
# [[Chemical molecule|Chemical Entity]] Search: A tool capable of identifying [[Chemical formula|chemical formuale]] and [[chemical name]]s, and extracting and disambiguating them from general terms within documents. Those disambiguated terms are used for performing searches.
# TableSeer: In scholarly articles Tables are used to present, list, summarize, and structure important data. TableSeer automatically identifies tables in digital documents, extracts the table [[Metadata]] as well as the cells content, and stores them in such a way that allows users to either query the table content or search for tables in a large set of documents.
# Dataset search: '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' provides tools to incorporate datasets from different experiments sources. The system is able to manipulate results from multiple formats such as [[XML]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], and [[CHARMM]], create databases, to allow direct queries over the data, create [[Metadata]], using an annotation tool, which will allow users to search over the datasets, as well as a way to create links among datasets and/or between datasets and documents.

In addition to these tools, '''Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer''' will integrate the advances made by its sister project [[CiteSeerX|CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;]] to provide:
* Full text search
* Author, affiliation, title and venue search
* Citation and acknowledgement search

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9294">'''Culturology''' or '''science of culture''' is a branch of [[social sciences]] concerned with the scientific understanding, [[description]], [[analysis]], and [[prediction]] of [[culture]]s as a whole. While different cultural practices were studied by [[ethnology]] and [[anthropology]], these studies included [[interdisciplinarity|diverse aspects]]: [[sociology|sociological]], [[psychology|psychological]], etc. and the need was recognized in a discipline focused exclusively on cultural aspects.&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt; 
 
== In Russia ==
The notion of culturology ({{lang-ru|Культурология}}),  as an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] branch of the humanities, may be traced in Russia to the late 1960s and associated with  the work of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Aleksei Losev]], [[Sergey Averintsev]], [[Georgy Gachev]], [[Yuri Lotman]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein, Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of Creative Communication. New York: St. Martin's Press (Scholarly and Reference Division), 1969, [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/tc_1.html Chapter 1: From Culturology to Transculture]&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of research challenged  [[Marxist]] socio–political  approach to culture. 

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], culturology was reintroduced into the [[Higher Attestation Commission]]'s list of specialties for which scientific degrees may be awarded in the [[Russian Federation]] and is now a compulsory object of study during the first year at institutions of [[higher education]] and in [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.informika.ru/cgi-bin/vak/q2.plx?key1=24 specialties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407033910/http://db.informika.ru/cgi-bin/vak/q2.plx?key1=24 |date=2007-04-07 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defined as the study of human [[culture]]s, their integral systems, and their influence on human behavior, it may be formally compared to the Western discipline of [[cultural studies]], although it has a number of important distinctions.

Formation of Cultural Sciences in Russia is connected with the activities of the Soviet-Armenian scientist Edward S. Markarian (1929–2011) and his first research on cultural from 1960 to 1970, opening a new direction in science for the Soviet Union. Outside Russia, between 1980 and 1990, culturology in Russia received official recognition and was legalized as a form of science and a subject of study for institutions of higher learning.
Over the past decade the Russian Federation has created the following basic cultural schools:

*philosophy of culture (A.&amp;nbsp;Arnold, G.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Drach, N.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp; Zlobin, M.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Kagan, V.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Mezhuyev, Y.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Solonin, M.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Turov and others)
*theory of culture (B.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Yerasov, A.&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;.Karmin, V.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Lukov, A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Pelipenko, E.&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;Sokolov, A.&amp;nbsp;Ya.&amp;nbsp;Fliyer and others),
*cultural history (S.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Ikonnikova, I.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Kondakov, E.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Shulepova, I.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Yakovenko and others),
*sociology of culture (I.&amp;nbsp;Akhiezer, L.&amp;nbsp;G. Ionin, L.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Kogan, A.&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;Shendrik and others),
*cultural anthropology (A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Belik, Ye.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Orlova, A.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Orlov-Kretschmer, Yu.&amp;nbsp;M..&amp;nbsp;Reznik and others),
*applied cultural studies (O. Astaf'eva, I.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Bykhovskaya and others),
*cultural studies Art (K.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Razlogov, N.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Hrenov and others),
*[[semiotics of culture]] ([[Juri Lotman]], [[Vladimir Toporov|V.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Toporov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|V.&amp;nbsp;V.&amp;nbsp;Ivanov]], E.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Meletinsky and others),
*cultural education (G.&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;Zvereva, A.&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;Kravchenko, T.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Kuznetsova, L.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Mosolova and others).

From 1992, research was started by the Russian Institute for Cultural Research. Today, along the line of the central office located in Moscow, three branches have been opened RIC – Siberian (opened in 1993 in Omsk), St. Petersburg Department (opened in 1997) and the Southern Branch (opened in 2012 in Krasnodar)

=== Culturology studies at Moscow Lomonosov University ===
In 1990, at the faculty of philosophy, a chair of the history and theory of world culture was created. Many prominent Soviet and Russian scholars like V. V. Ivanov, S. S. Averintsev, A. Y. Gurevich, M. L. Gasparov, G. S. Knabe, E. M. Miletinskiy, V. N. Romanov, T. V. Vasilyeva, N. V. Braginskaya, V. V. Bibikhin, [[Alexander Dobrokhotov]] have worked there.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.philos.msu.ru/kaf/itmk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]] founded a school of Culturology at the Department of Language Studies of [[Moscow Lomonosov University]]. Rozhdestvensky's approach to the development of culture (accumulation and mutual influence of layers) can be compared to the approach used in [[media ecology]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Other uses==
In Anglophone contemporary [[social sciences]] the word ''culturology'' was coined by American anthropologist [[Leslie White]], who defined it as a field dedicated to the study of culture and cultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;White, L. (1959). ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome''. McGraw-Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Leslie, (1975) “The Concept of Cultural Systems: A Key to Understanding Tribes and Nations, Columbia University, New York&lt;/ref&gt; White notices that culturology was earlier known as "science of culture" as defined by English anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] in his book 1872 ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Leslie"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1754562 | title=Culturology | author=Leslie A. White | journal=Science |series=New Series | date= 21 November 1958| volume=128 | issue=3334 | pages=1246}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also notices that he introduced this term in 1939 and for the first time the term appeared in English dictionaries in 1954. He also remarks that the corresponding German term ''Kulturwissenschaft'' was introduced by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in 1909.&lt;ref name="Leslie"/&gt;

Following White, philosopher of science [[Mario Bunge]] defined culturology as the sociological, economic, political, and historical study of concrete cultural systems. "Synchronic culturology" is said to coincide with the [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[political ideology]] of cultures. By contrast, "diachronic culturology" is a component of [[history]]. According to Bunge, "scientific culturology" also differs from traditional [[cultural studies]] as the latter are often the work of idealist literary critics or pseudo-philosophers ignorant of the [[scientific method]] and incompetent in the study of social facts and concrete social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, Mario, (1998) Social Science Under Debate, Toronto: University of Toronto Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunge’s systemic and materialist approach to the study of culture has given birth to a variety of new fields of research in the [[social sciences]]. [[Fabrice Rivault]], for instance, was the first scholar to formalize and propose international political culturology as a subfield of [[international relations]] in order to understand the global cultural system, as well as its numerous subsystems, and explain how cultural variables interact with [[politics]] and [[economics]] to impact world affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturology.com/definition/  Rivault, Fabrice, (1999) ''Culturologie Politique Internationale : Une approche systémique et matérialiste de la culture et du système social global'', McGill Dissertation, Montréal, Culturology Press]&lt;/ref&gt; This scientific approach differs radically from [[culturalism]], [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], and cultural [[postmodernism]] because it is based on [[logic]], [[empiricism]], [[systemism]], and [[emergent materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, Mario, (2009) ''Political Philosophy - Fact, Fiction and Vision'', Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick&lt;/ref&gt; International political culturology is being studied by scholars around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-21/chapter-1.htm Xintian, Yu (2005) “Cultural Factors In International Relations”, Chinese Philosophical Studies.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410220456/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-21/chapter-1.htm |date=2010-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xintian, Yu (2009),"Combining Research on Cultural Theory and International Relations"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyprus College''' is a [[for-profit college]] in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]. It was founded in 1961 by Ioannis Gregoriou as a [[business school]], and thereafter it expanded into a number of other fields, including [[computer science]], [[graduate studies]], and [[social sciences]]. In 2006, when the College had an enrolment of 3,500, it submitted under the Deanship of [[Andreas G Orphanides]] an application to the Ministry of Education and Culture of the [[Republic of Cyprus]] to establish a private university with the name [[European University Cyprus]]. Approval for this came in September 2007, and Cyprus College continued its operation independently of [[European University Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Alexia | last =Saoulli | coauthors = | title =Cabinet approves three new universities | date =13 September 2007 | publisher = | url =http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34654&amp;cat_id=1 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090302173318/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34654&amp;cat_id=1 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =2 March 2009 | work =[[Cyprus Mail]] | pages = | accessdate =2007-09-13 | language = | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DCAF''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|i|ˌ|k|æ|f}}; '''Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Centre pour le contrôle démocratique des forces armées - Genève,'' [[German language|German]]: ''Genfer Zentrum für die demokratische Kontrolle der Streitkräfte'') is an intergovernmental [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]-based [[think tank]]&lt;ref name="thinktank"/&gt; that provides research and project support to states and international actors in improving [[security sector governance and reform]] (SSG and SSR).

DCAF was established in 2000 in the [[Canton of Geneva]] by the [[Switzerland|Swiss government]] and as of 2018 employs around 170 staff, has seven permanent offices and 63 member states.

== Mandate ==
DCAF was established in October 2000 under [[Law of Switzerland|Swiss law]] as a foundation and on the initiative of the [[Switzerland|Swiss government]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=DCAF By-Laws (unofficial translation from French)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization states that it is a [[good governance]]-promoting foundation focusing on a specific [[public sector]] area—the [[National security|security sector]]. DCAF is mandated by its intergovernmental Foundation Council to assist partner states and international actors in improving the governance of the security sector through [[reform]] based on international norms and good practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/geneva-centre-democratic-control-armed-forces-dcaf|title=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) {{!}} GPPlatform|website=www.gpplatform.ch|access-date=2017-05-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824012946/http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/geneva-centre-democratic-control-armed-forces-dcaf|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It hosted lectures, debates and conferences, and delivered courses and training, in various subjects such as Sociology and Adult Education.
Originally based in Eccles Street, it moved to Mountjoy Square Dublin.
After the Second Vatican Council, under the directorship of Fr. [[Liam Carey]] (of the Centre for Adult and Community Education at
[[Maynooth College]], who also founded [[Aontas]]), in 1966 the Institute was reconstituted into the Dublin Institute of Adult Education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lxoa.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/manual-of-social-ethics-dublin-institute-of-catholic-sociology-1956/ Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology: Manual of Social Ethics; 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in Scotland''' is overseen by the [[Scottish Government]] and has a history of universal provision of [[public education]], and the Scottish education system is distinctly different from those in the other countries of the United Kingdom. The [[Scotland Act 1998]] gives the [[Scottish Parliament]] legislative control over all education matters, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is the principal legislation governing education in Scotland. Traditionally, the Scottish system at secondary school level has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects, while the [[Education in England|English]], [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] and [[Education in Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] systems have emphasised greater depth of education over a smaller range of subjects.

Following this, [[List of universities in Scotland|Scottish universities]] generally have courses a year longer (typically 4 years) than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, though it is often possible for students to take more advanced specialised exams and join the courses at the second year. One unique aspect is that the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] issue a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] as the first [[academic degree|degree]] in [[humanities]]. State schools are owned and operated by the [[local government of Scotland|local authorities]] which act as ''Education Authorities'', and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school). Schools are supported in delivering learning and teaching by [[Education Scotland]] (formerly [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]]). There are also private schools across the country, although the distribution is uneven with [[List of independent schools in Scotland|such schools]] in 22 of the 32 Local Authority areas. At September 2011 the total pupil population in Scotland was 702,104, of which 31,425 pupils, or 4.5%, were being educated in independent schools.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish independent schools "Pupil Number Comparisons by Local Authority Area 2011/12" http://www.scis.org.uk/assets/files/2011%20Local%20Authority%20comparisons%20by%20region.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Qualifications at the secondary school and [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] ([[further education]]) level are provided by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]], which is the national awarding and accrediting body in Scotland, and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Political responsibility for education at all levels is vested in the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[Learning and Justice Directorates|Learning Directorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/People/Directorates/learning |title=About: People: Learning Directorate |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160941/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/People/Directorates/learning |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspections and audits of educational standards are conducted by three bodies: [[Care Inspectorate (Scotland)|Care Inspectorate]] inspects [[Social care in Scotland|care standards]] in pre-school provision; Education Scotland (formerly [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education]]) for [[pre-school]], primary, [[secondary education|education]], [[further education|further]] and [[adult education|community]] education; with the Scottish office of the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]] (QAA Scotland) responsible for higher education.

In 2014, research by the [[Office for National Statistics]] found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, above countries like [[Finland]], Ireland and [[Luxembourg]], with roughly 40% of Scots aged 16–64 educated to [[National Vocational Qualification#Levels|NVQ level 4]] and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotland 'most highly educated country in Europe' |author=ITV |url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-06-05/scotland-most-well-educated-country-in-europe/ |accessdate=8 June 2014 |date=5 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607235349/http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-06-05/scotland-most-well-educated-country-in-europe/ |archivedate=7 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children start primary school aged between 4½ and 5½ depending on when the child's birthday falls.&lt;ref name="FAQs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Scottish Government |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819035352/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish school policy places all those born between March of a given year and February of the following year in the same year group. Children born between March and August start school in August at between 5½ and 5 years old, and those born between September and February start school in the previous August at between age 4 years 11 months and 4½ years old. The Scottish system is the most flexible in the UK, however, as parents of children born between September and December can decide to defer for 1 year (but may or may not receive a funded  nursery place in the deferral year), whilst children born between January and February can opt to hold their child back a year and let them start school the following August, with guaranteed nursery funding. This usually allows those not ready for formal education to have an extra year at an early years centre (formerly known as nursery).

Pupils remain at primary school for seven years. Then aged eleven or twelve, they start secondary school for a compulsory four years with the following two years being optional. In Scotland, pupils sit National 4/5 exams (previously [[Standard Grade]] or [[Intermediate exams]]) at the age of fifteen/sixteen, normally for between 6 and eight subjects including compulsory exams in English and Mathematics. A Science subject (Physics, Biology or Chemistry) and a Social Subject (Geography, History or Modern Studies) were also compulsory, but this was changed in accordance with the new curriculum. It is now required by the Scottish Parliament for students to have two hours of physical education a week; each school may vary these compulsory combinations. The school leaving age is generally sixteen (after completion of National 4/5s), after which students may choose to remain at school and study for [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] and/or [[Advanced Higher (Scottish)|Advanced Higher]] exams.

A small number of students at certain private, [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] may follow the [[Education in England|English system]] and study towards [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] instead of National 4/5s (Standard Grades), and towards [[GCE Advanced Level|A and AS-Levels]] instead of (or alongside) Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams. The [[International Baccalaureate]] has also been introduced in some independent schools.

The table below lists rough equivalences with the year system in the rest of the United Kingdom (For England and Wales, the equivalence given is for children born before 1 September; the equivalence for those born from September to February [December for deferred pupils] is given in brackets):

===Access to early years centres, primary and secondary school===

Government funded schools are free for children aged 5–19.&lt;ref name="UK Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/student/accommodation_health.php|title=UKCISA - international student advice and guidance|author=|date=|website=www.ukcisa.org.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911115643/http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/student/accommodation_health.php|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, this applies to children of international post-graduate students,&lt;ref name="British Council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/learning-infosheets-choosing-state-funded-schools.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503154102/http://www.britishcouncil.org/learning-infosheets-choosing-state-funded-schools.pdf |archivedate=3 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other immigrants.

The age ranges specify the youngest age for a child entering that year and the oldest age for a child leaving that year. Playgroup can be described as a daycare centre for toddlers, then children may go on to attend an early years centre as soon as they have passed their third birthday, and progress to Primary 1 in the August of the year in which they turn five. 

In general, the cut-off point for ages is the end of February, so all children must be of a certain age on 1 March to begin class in August. 

All parents of children born between September and February (i.e. still 4 years old on the school start date) are entitled to defer entry to Primary School if they believe their child is not ready for school.

Only children whose birthdays fall in January or February will be considered for funding for a subsequent year at an early years centre, unless there are special circumstances.

Children may leave school once they reach their statutory school leaving date; this is dependent on date of birth.  For children born between 1 March and 30 September, this date is 31 May of their 4th year of secondary school.  For children born between 1 October and 28 February, the last day of June is the first date they may leave school if they have a placement at college and the school have signed the health &amp; safety forms.

Which high school the children go to depends on the area where they live, known as the "[[catchment area]]", which has a specific high school that takes children who live in that area.

Parents can also apply for a placement request if they would like their child to attend a school outside their catchment area and a panel will decide if the child is the most worthy (out of all placing requests) to take one of the spaces left after all children from the catchment area have been taken.

The table below lists list the numbers of children, schools and teachers in all publicly funded schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0044/00443414.pdf |title=Summary Statistics for Schools in Scotland, No.4 ¦ 2013 Edition |publisher=Scottish Government |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Home education in the United Kingdom|Home education]] is also legal in Scotland. Parents wishing to home educate do not need the permission of the Local Authority unless the children are already registered at a school. There are no exact numbers available for children being educated at home in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/yourchildatschool/choosingaschool/homeeducation/index.asp Education Scotland, Home Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001153601/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/yourchildatschool/choosingaschool/homeeducation/index.asp |date=1 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministers responsible==

Within the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills]] has overall responsibility for education provision in Scotland. The Cabinet Secretary is assisted by three junior ministers, currently the [[Minister for Childcare and Early Years]], the [[Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science]] and the [[Minister for Employability and Training]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/cabinet-secretary-education-skills/|title=Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills - gov.scot|author=|date=|website=beta.gov.scot|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912055234/https://beta.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/cabinet-secretary-education-skills/|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2003, work began on an education reform programme, to produce a new ''[[Curriculum for Excellence]]'' that would replace existing guidance on the school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp |title=How was the curriculum developed: Process of change: Timeline About Curriculum for Excellence |publisher=Education Scotland |accessdate=24 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113301/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum for Excellence was launched in Scottish secondary schools from school session 2012–2013.

In 2017, new reforms were introduced moving control over curriculum and schools more towards head teachers and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-and-tories-back-john-swinney-s-school-reforms-1-4489307|title=SNP and Tories back John Swinney’s school reforms|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628201324/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-and-tories-back-john-swinney-s-school-reforms-1-4489307|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of Scottish pupils take [[Scottish Qualifications Certificate]] qualifications provided by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA). Generally, most pupils take National 4/5s (previously [[Standard Grade]]s, but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in S3-S4, and [[Higher (Scottish)|Highers]] in S5. The number of National 4/5 qualifications a pupil enters can vary drastically depending on the individual, with the most common number of National 5s taken, per pupil, in 2017 being 6,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/ASR2017_National5.xls&lt;/ref&gt; however some may choose to untertake as few as one or two, or as many as eight or nine. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year (S6), more Highers and [[Advanced Higher]]s (formerly [[CSYS]]) in S6 can be taken. [[Intermediate 1]] and [[Intermediate 2]] qualifications – were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively, but in practice (although may vary from subject to subject), Intermediate 1 was easier than General, and Intermediate 2 harder than Credit – can also be taken in lieu of any of the aforementioned qualifications.

Pupils can go to university at the end of S5, as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities where degrees are normally four years long; however, recently it is more common for students to remain until S6, taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers. The majority of English universities, the most popular choice for Scottish students who wish to study university degrees outside of Scotland, require Advanced Higher qualification levels as these are deemed by the English universities to be most similar to A-levels.

All educational qualifications in Scotland are part of the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]].

==Scottish Attainment Challenge==

In 2015, the Scottish Government launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge which aims to achieve equity in educational outcomes throughout Scotland. The Scottish Government envisages equity being achieved by ensuring every child has the same opportunity to succeed, with a particular focus on closing the poverty-related attainment gap. It is underpinned by national Scottish educational policies such as [[Curriculum for Excellence]], Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) as well as the National Improvement Framework&lt;ref name="gov.scot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/Raisingeducationalattainment|title=Schools: Pupil attainment: closing the gap - gov.scot|author=|date=|website=www.gov.scot|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912055204/http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/Raisingeducationalattainment|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The attainment challenge focuses and accelerates targeted improvement activity in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing in specific areas of Scotland, known as "challenge authorities" (those councils with a higher percentage of children growing up in poverty and deprivation). At a cost of £750 million to the Scottish Government through the Attainment Scotland Fund, the challenge is a targeted initiative focused on supporting pupils in the local authorities of Scotland with the highest concentrations of deprivation. Currently, the nine 'Challenge Authorities' are [[Glasgow City Council]], [[Dundee City Council]], [[Inverclyde]], [[West Dunbartonshire]], [[North Ayrshire]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[North Lanarkshire]], [[East Ayrshire]] and [[Renfrewshire]]&lt;ref name="gov.scot"/&gt;.

On 1 February 2017 the share each primary and secondary school will receive for the academic year 2017–2018 from the Scottish Government's £120 million Pupil Equity Funding was announced by the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills [[John Swinney]].  This funding is provided through the Attainment Scotland Fund and allocated directly to schools, targeted at those children most affected by the poverty related attainment gap&lt;ref name="gov.scot"/&gt;.

==Secondary school naming==
[[File:Marr College, Troon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marr College]] in [[Troon]], [[South Ayrshire]], carries the name College rather than High School or Academy]]
There is not a set name for secondary schools in Scotland, but whatever they might be called, with just a few specific exceptions in mainly rural or island authorities, state secondary schools in Scotland are fully [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] and non-selective. Amongst the state-run secondary schools:

* 188 are nominally ''High Schools''. These are spread across the country. Almost all Catholic secondaries are high schools, with the majority of the other names being non-denominational schools. For example, in West Dunbartonshire, the non-denominational schools are Vale of Leven, Dumbarton, and Clydebank Academies while the Catholic schools are Our Lady &amp; Saint Patrick's High School and St Peter the Apostle's High School.
* 131 are nominally ''Academies''. These are spread across the country but are in high concentration in North-East Scotland and Ayrshire, an example is [[Aboyne Academy]]. There are also three Royal Academies, in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]]; [[Tain]]; and [[Inverness]].
* 15 are nominally ''Secondary Schools'' (colloquially abbreviated to "secondaries").
* 14 are nominally ''Grammar Schools''. Most of these schools were defined as [[grammar schools]] under a previous (now dissolved) system but their names remain. Popular areas for grammar schools are [[Argyll and Bute]], East Lothian and [[South Lanarkshire]].
* 13 are simply ''Schools''. These schools cater for Primary as well as Secondary school children. They are found in rural areas or islands.
* 8 are ''Junior High Schools''. These schools are found exclusively in the [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] Islands. They cater for school children from P1 to S4.
* 4 are ''Colleges''. These include [[Madras College]] (in [[St Andrews]], Fife), [[Marr College]] (in [[Troon]], [[South Ayrshire]]) and [[St Joseph's College, Dumfries|St Joseph's College]] (in [[Dumfries]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]]).

Other schools include The Community School of Auchterarder, [[Auchterarder]], [[Perth and Kinross]]; The Nicolson Institute, [[Stornoway]], [[Western Isles]]; North Walls Community School on [[Hoy]], [[Orkney Islands]] and Wester Hailes Education Centre, [[Wester Hailes]], Edinburgh. All of these are, equally, fully comprehensive non-selective schools, differing only in designation from all other state secondary schools in Scotland.

==School provision==
===Religion in schools===
The vast majority of schools are non-[[Religious denomination|denominational]], and include the parish schools, pioneered by the Church of Scotland and other Protestant Churches, which became state schools in 1872. Religious education is taught in non-denominational schools and in denominational schools. Of over 2,500 schools in Scotland, there are 366 state schools which are Roman Catholic, three Episcopalian and one Jewish. The [[Education (Scotland) Act 1918]] brought Roman Catholic schools within the State education system, ensuring the promotion of a Roman Catholic ethos within such schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs|title=Frequently Asked Questions|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|date=1 April 2003|website=www.gov.scot|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721174221/http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational education===
[[Vocational education]] is provided in [[Further Education College]]s and through [[apprenticeship]]s. Due to the growing surplus of university graduates in many fields of study, along with that of lower level apprentices, higher level apprenticeships are seen as providing the lowest risk of unemployment or underemployment. [[Skills Development Scotland]] has introduced ''Graduate Level Apprenticeships'' in order to promote this option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Music education===
[[Music education]] is available at several levels. Formal music education begins at 4½ years and can progress as high as postgraduate studies. Music education can take place within a [[Music schools in Scotland|Scottish Music school]]; through a music service or privately.

===Scottish Gaelic medium education===
{{main|Gaelic medium education in Scotland}}
Some schools in Scotland provide education given in the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language. They are mainly located in the main cities of Scotland and in areas with higher amounts of Gaelic speakers. Gaelic medium education is becoming increasingly popular throughout Scotland, and the number of pupils who are in Gaelic medium education at primary school level has risen from 24 in 1985, to 2500 in the 2012–13 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaidhlig.org.uk/bord/en/our-work/gaelic-education/ |title=Our Work: Gaelic education |publisher=Bord na Gaidhlig |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412150711/http://www.gaidhlig.org.uk/bord/en/our-work/gaelic-education/ |archivedate=12 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher Education==

[[File:Queen Margaret University main building.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Building of [[Queen Margaret University]]]]
There are fifteen universities in Scotland and three other institutions of higher education which have the authority to award [[academic degrees]].&lt;ref name=uniscot&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/index.php?page=briefing |title=Briefing |publisher=Universities Scotland |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723071847/http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/index.php?page=briefing |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest is [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews]], which was founded in 1413.

Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0748620273}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of the Highlands and Islands]] (UHI) gained full university status in 2011, having been created through the federation of 13 colleges and research institutions across the Highlands and Islands, a process that began in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/news/article/2239/uhi_is_awarded_taught_degree_awarding_powers |title=UHI is awarded taught degree awarding powers |publisher=Highland Council |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714193338/http://www.highland.gov.uk/news/article/2239/uhi_is_awarded_taught_degree_awarding_powers |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Scottish universities have the power to award degrees at all levels: undergraduate, taught postgraduate, and doctoral. Education in Scotland is controlled by the [[Scottish Government]] under the terms of the [[Scotland Act 1998]]. The minister responsible for higher education is the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]], currently [[Angela Constance|Angela Constance MSP]] of the [[Scottish National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/People/Ministers/Cabinet-Secretary-for-Education-and-Lifelong-Learn |title=Cabinet Secretary for Education &amp; Lifelong Learning: Angela Constance MSP |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405185559/http://www.gov.scot/About/People/Ministers/Cabinet-Secretary-for-Education-and-Lifelong-Learn |archivedate=5 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; University status in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom today is conferred by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] which takes advice from the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-3708.pdf |title=The Privy Council, Standard Note: SN/PC/3708 |date=5 July 2005 |publisher=The Privy Council |pages=5–6 |accessdate=6 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227183508/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-3708.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/assuring-standards-and-quality/daput |title=Degree-awarding powers and university title |publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]] (QAA) |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=26 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810142933/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/assuring-standards-and-quality/daput |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Scottish universities are [[public universities]] and funded by the [[Scottish Government]] (through its [[Scottish Funding Council]]&lt;ref name=scotgov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/UniversitiesColleges/16640 |publisher=The Scottish Government |title=Education and Training: Universities and Colleges: Universities |date=16 July 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830045609/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/UniversitiesColleges/16640 |archivedate=30 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and financial support is provided for Scottish-domiciled students by the [[Student Awards Agency for Scotland]]. Students ordinarily resident in Scotland or the [[European Union]] do not pay [[tuition fees]] for their first undergraduate degree, but tuition fees are charged for those from the rest of the United Kingdom. All students are required to pay tuition fees for postgraduate education (e.g. MSc, PhD), except in certain priority areas funded by the Scottish Government, or if another source of funding can be found (e.g. [[research council]] studentship for a PhD). A representative body called [[Universities Scotland]] works to promote Scotland's universities, as well as six other higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/ |title=Universities Scotland |accessdate=7 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211100535/http://www.universities-scotland.ac.uk/ |archivedate=11 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university sector in Scotland had a total income of £3.5 billion in 2014/15 with the Scottish Government giving approximately £623 million in funding for individual university student support. The Scottish Funding Council contributing £1.1 billion of public money to the fifteen universities, this was a six per cent reduction since 2010/11.&lt;ref name="Audit of Scottish universities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/uploads/docs/report/2016/nr_160707_higher_education.pdf |title=Audit of higher education in Scottish universities |access-date=18 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119064422/http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/uploads/docs/report/2016/nr_160707_higher_education.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Andrews gowns.jpg|thumbnail|right|St Andrews students in undergraduate gowns]]
In 2014–15, approximately 232,570 students studied at universities or institutes of higher education in Scotland, of which 56% were female and 44% male, with 66% being domiciled in Scotland, 12% from the rest of the United Kingdom, 9% from the EU and the remaining 13% being [[international students]]. Of all these, approximately 76% were studying for their first degree (i.e. undergraduate level) and 24% for a taught postgraduate degree (primarily a master's degree) or a doctoral research degree (primarily PhD). The remainder were mostly on other programmes such as [[Higher National Diploma]].&lt;ref name="Audit of Scottish universities" /&gt; 16,000 students were studying in Scotland with [[The Open University]] via distance-learning, and the Open University teaches 40 per cent of Scotland's part-time undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.open.ac.uk/near-you/scotland//index.asp |title=The Open University in Scotland |accessdate=6 July 2010 |publisher=The Open University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405092500/http://www3.open.ac.uk/near-you/scotland/index.asp |archivedate=5 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016–17 [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]], five Scottish universities are among the top 200 worldwide: [[University of Edinburgh]] (at 27), [[University of Glasgow]] (at 88), [[University of St. Andrews]] (at =110), [[University of Dundee]] (at =180), and the [[University of Aberdeen]] (at =188).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats |title=World University Rankings 2016-17 |access-date=18 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231113411/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats |archivedate=31 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14699">'''Emergent curriculum''' is a philosophy of teaching and way of planning [[curriculum]] that focuses on being responsive to children's interests to create meaningful learning experiences. It can be practiced at any grade level. This philosophy prioritizes active participation, relationship building, flexible and adaptable methods, inquiry, and play-based learning. Curriculum is child-initiated, collaborative and responsive to the children's needs. Proponents of this style of teaching advocate that knowledge of the children is the key to success in your program (Cassidy, Mims, Rucker, &amp; Boone, 2003; Crowther, 2005).

To plan an emergent curriculum requires observation, documentation, creative brainstorming, flexibility and patience.  Rather than starting with a lesson plan which requires a “hook” to get the children interested, emergent curriculum starts with the observation of the children for insight into their interests. Additionally, content is influenced by values held for the children's learning by the school, community, family and culture (MachLachlan, 2013). The classroom typically consists of learning centres that expand and facilitate children's learning (Crowther, 2005) and encourage independent learning skills (MachLachlan, 2013).

== Teacher as Facilitator of Learning ==
Teachers who employ emergent curriculum understand that the trajectory of learning happens as a consequence of the children's genuine interest, response, and connection to the subject (Crowther, 2005; Jones &amp; Reynolds, 2011, MachLachlan et al., 2013). In order for this to happen, the teacher must consider their position as a facilitator in the classroom. This role involves careful observations of the children and their play as well as flexibility and creativity in order to develop learning opportunities that align with their interests (Cassidy et al., 2003; Crowther, 2005; Jones &amp; Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2009a/2011b; Machlachlan et al., 2013; Wein, 2008; Wright, 1997). Carolyn Edwards notes:  “The teachers honestly do not know where the group will end up.  Although this openness adds a dimension of difficulty to their work, it also makes it more exciting.” (Edwards, Gandini &amp; Foreman, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;159). Teachers in these settings act as researchers who are constantly learning in their roles by collecting data, implementing strategies and assessing their outcomes (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Success in implementing emergent curriculum requires a curious disposition about children and their learning (Stacey, 2009).

It is the role of the teacher to be a participant-observer in the children's play (Wright, 1997). These programs give power to children's voices and are consistently scaffolding their learning (Stacey, 2009). The teacher is constantly going through the process of observing and documenting, planning learning experiences, implementing plans, documenting and beginning the cycle again (Crowther, 2005; MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009a/ 2011b). In these types of settings, a few educational initiatives are often implemented by teachers. For example, learning is viewed as a process-oriented experience where children are praised for their effort over final product (Stacey, 2011; Wright, 1997). Additionally, children in these settings are given options and choice about how they wish to spend their time, activities and learning centres they wish to participate in and how they engage in organized activities (Stacey, 2009). This is believed to develop curiosity, initiative, self-direction and persistence (MachLachlan et al., 2013).

Because the curriculum is continually changing, developing and growing, teachers need to ensure that they make time to reflect on their observations and strategies implemented (Stacey 2009a/2011b). One way to engage in reflection is through discussion with colleagues (Stacey, 2009). Reflection allows the teacher to think about what happens next in the child's learning, how to proceed, and what to look for in future observations (Stacey, 2011). It is important for teachers to be aware of their own knowledge and where it is lacking, as this type of environment can lead to investigations in an unlimited number of directions (Crowther, 2005). Teachers are also individuals with interests and passions, and sharing these with the class can provide a great opportunity to model knowledge and enthusiasm (MachLachlan et al., 2013).

These programs are meant to be culturally responsive and inclusive in nature, so that all children are able to work at their own pace (Crowther, 2005). To help facilitate this, teachers follow the children's lead, expand on their interests, provide meaningful and developmentally appropriate materials, and promote independent learning skills (Crowther, 2005; Stacey, 2009; Wien, 2008).

== Planning an Emergent Curriculum ==
Once teachers see an interest “emerging” they brainstorm ways to study the topic in depth. From these observations and brainstorming, the teacher comes up activities that compliment and build upon the emerging interest, with opportunities for play at multiple ability levels. Once activities have been implemented, the teacher observes the children's use of them, constantly modifying them to accommodate increasing interest or change in direction of the learning. The teacher documents these observations and reflects on the effectiveness of the activities. Then the process begins again. The teacher may be at different levels of this planning cycle for multiple activities or learning outcomes at once (Cassidy et al., 2003; Crowther, 2005; Jones &amp; Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2009a/2011b; Machlachlan et al., 2013; Wein, 2008; Wright, 1997).

In these settings, learning plans are often more of a loose outline because, in order for the program to be successful, there is often spontaneous deterrence from plans to support engagement (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Webbing is often used because of its flexible nature.  A web doesn’t show everything that will be learned, it shows many things that could be learned as well as connections to curriculum expectations (MachLachlan et al., 2013).  However, it is important to use the web as a tool to open the teacher to possibilities not a “plan.”  Teachers brainstorm many possibilities for study sparked from the particular interest, not as a plan but more as a ‘road map’ as one teacher put it:
To get a plan, we chose an idea and brainstormed ways that children could play it – hands-on activities we could provide.  Putting all the activities on a web gives you a road map full of possible journeys.  (Jones p.&amp;nbsp;129)

An idea for a curriculum topic may be sparked by things, people, events in the environment, issues that arise in the classroom, etc. (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009).  For instance, a teacher may overhear a group of students having a discussion about bugs that leads to the class sitting down and coming up with a web topic that explores all the possible directions the class could go in their quest to learn all they can about the topic of bugs.  Ideas may also be sparked by offering experiences such as taking a walk through the neighborhood, visiting local businesses, or reading books.

These classrooms are often organized into core curriculum areas, where activities may have a curricular theme while following student interest (Crowther, 2005). For example, while students are demonstrating an interest in restaurants, the literacy area may allow opportunity to write customer orders while the math area may have plastic money for the children to experiment with. These centres are meant to encourage active participation with the content (Crowther, 2005). In emergent curriculum settings, there should be opportunity to involve all the senses, challenge creativity, hear and use oral and written language, explore art media, practice solving interpersonal problems, conduct investigations and ask questions, explore and order material, and acquire various physical skills (Crowther, 2005; MachLachlan et al., 2013; Wright, 1997).

Teachers see learning as a process through which children first engage in exploration and physical action which then leads to mastery of skills (MachLachlan et al., 2013). Some researchers argue that this method of planning is more effective for learning because it relies on the intrinsic motivation of students, therefore facilitating increased engagement with the material (Stacey, 2011). However, because of this, it is normal to have multiple children or groups interested in completely different content (Stacey 2009a/2011b). This makes documentation and preparation very important.

Emergent learning classrooms still maintain much of the structure of a regular classroom. It is important for children to still experience schedule and organization. Therefore, in these classrooms you will often still find large and small group instructional times, but the implementation of them is more flexible (Stacey 2009a/2011b).

== The Learning Environment ==
Because emergent curriculum programs emphasize independence and persistence in their programs, learning centres are typically set up in very particular ways. Items and materials that are stored are easily accessible to the children visually and physically. Things are usually labeled with words and pictures to assist children, and clear storage containers are preferred (Crowther, 2005; Jones &amp; Reynolds, 2011; Stacey, 2011).

Students can be seen working in a variety of social environments. The learning environment should offer opportunities to work in groups of all different sizes, as well as individually (Crowther, 2005). Students are also given opportunities to experience materials in different ways, such as quiet reading corners and dramatic play areas (Stacey, 2011)

"[[Montessori]]" and [[Reggio Emilia approach|"Reggio Emilia"]] schools are two varieties of school that use emergent curriculum.

== Documentation ==
Documentation is a very important and very time consuming aspect of this type of programming (Stacey, 2011). Because teachers are held accountable to parents, licensing boards and colleagues, it is necessary that thorough documentation is kept (Crowther, 2005; Stacey, 2009).

=== Documentation for Observation and Assessment ===
Because of the reliance on observational methods to inform planning and assessment, it is crucial for teachers to have strategies in place to expedite the process. Some examples of tools use by teachers are sticky notes, observation baskets around the room to collect small anecdotal notes, file folder systems for each student or area of the classroom, clipboards, digital recorders, photography, and video and audiotaping. These methods allow learning to become visually represented and are good for reflection and validation of methods (Stacey, 2009).

These strategies can be effective in ensuring proper assessment procedures (Cassidy et al., 2003). The use of student portfolios can be a great way to assess learning and share it with parents/guardians (Stacey 2009a/2011b). Additionally, the use of pre populated data collection sheets can be helpful to keep good records (Stacey, 2011)

=== Documentation for Planning ===
Use of webs and other graphic organizers can be a good way to demonstrate how the students are being exposed to curriculum expectations and brainstorm related ideas (MachLachlan et al., 2013; Stacey, 2009). Keeping track of interest paths that develop in the classroom can help teachers demonstrate the process of learning, revise and reflect on it and develop future directions (Stacey, 2009).

Each learning or interest centre in the classroom usually has its own plan, as well as activities facilitated by the teacher (Stacey, 2011).

=== Documentation for Students ===
Emergent curriculum involved students being collaborative partners in their learning (Stacey, 2009), therefore it is important to incorporate children in displaying and documenting their learning (; Stacey, 2009; Wright, 1997). Some strategies teachers can use for this are audio and visual recordings, samples of children's work, photos, learning logs, and display boards (Stacey, 2009). These approaches can help students develop pride in their work, show off skills to parents/guardians, and display their interests (Crowther, 2005). These processes are not static, rather these projects grow as learning develops (Crowther, 2005).

There are two main European legal instruments covering the mutual recognition of [[professional certification|professional qualifications]]:  '''Directive 89/48/EEC''' and '''Directive 92/51/EEC'''.

'''Directive 89/48/EEC''' covers the mutual recognition of qualifications in recognised professions that require a [[academic degree|University degree]] or equivalent.  This [[European Union directive|directive]] is implemented in the UK by '''The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) (First General System) Regulations 2005''' and by similar regulations in other member states.

'''Directive 92/51/EEC''' covers the mutual recognition of qualifications in professions regulated below degree level.  This is implemented in the UK by '''The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) (Second General System) Regulations 2002''' and by similar regulations in other member states.

The Directives cover all twenty-eight member states of the [[European Union]] plus [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]].

They mean that any form of work that would normally be restricted in a member state to people who had gained a professional qualification in that member state are also open to nationals of the EU (and the other three states) who have gained a similar professional qualification in another member state.

This applies to all forms of work other than those covered by either

the '''Transitional Measures Directive''' (Directive 99/42/EC, covering crafts and trades people such as hairdressers and construction workers)

or the '''Sectoral Directives''' ([[Medicine]], [[Dentistry]], [[Pharmacy]], [[Nursing |General Care Nursing]],  [[Veterinary]] Surgery, [[Architect |Architecture]], and [[Lawyer |Law]] (This set of Directives was the original method of achieving mutual recognition but proved too slow)

Professions regulated in most or all EU states include:

Accountancy -  British-qualified [[Accountant |Accountants]] ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|Chartered Certified Accountant]] (ACCA) or [[Chartered Accountant]] (ACA or CA) or [[International Accountant]](AIA) in the UK)

Engineering - [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]], or [[Eur Ing]] (European Ingénieur), [[Incorporated Engineer |Incorporated Engineer (UK)]], Corporate membership of a UK professional engineering Institution such as [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|MIET - Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology]]

Teaching - [[Teacher]]s (Qualified Teacher Status in the UK)

Law - [[Lawyer |Lawyers]] ([[Barrister |Barristers]], [[Solicitor |Solicitors]] and [[Advocate |Advocates]] in the UK).

Note that the regulations only apply to nationals of the 27 countries - e.g. an American who gained Qualified Teacher Status in the UK would not be able, under these regulations, to teach in France, but an Irish citizen would. However, the situation would be different if the American were married to a European ''and'' they were living in a country other than the country of which the European is a national.

The Directives referred to above have been consolidated under Directive 2005/36/EC.  This was to be transposed by Member States in October 2007.

'''Filippo Taglioni''' (aka '''Philippe Taglioni'''; 5 November 1777 &amp;ndash; 11 February 1871) was an Italian [[dance]]r and [[choreography|choreographer]] and personal teacher to his own daughter, the famous Romantic [[ballerina]] [[Marie Taglioni]].  (He had another child who also danced ballet, Paul Taglioni.) Also, although [[August Bournonville]]'s version is better known, it was Taglioni who was the original choreographer of ''[[La Sylphide]]'', in 1832.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.the-ballet.com/sylphide.php | title=La Sylphide | work=Ballet Encyclopedia | publisher=The Ballet | accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Milan]] to father Carlo, he received his dance training predominantly with [[Carlo Blasis]] and [[Jean-François Coulon]]. He made his dancing debut at age 17 in [[Pisa]] performing female [[role (performing arts)|roles]]. He danced in other Italian cities before becoming a dancer (at age 22) with the [[Ballet de l'Opéra National de Paris|Paris Opera]].  With [[Auguste Vestris|Vestris]] firmly in control there, he readily accepted an invitation to be a principal dancer and [[ballet master]] for the [[Royal Swedish Ballet]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

In Stockholm, he married the dancer [[Sophie Karsten]], daughter of a famous Swedish [[opera]] singer [[Christoffer Christian Karsten]] and the Polish actress [[Sophie Stebnowska]], in 1803. Together, they had two children, [[Marie Taglioni]] and Paul Taglioni, both of whom became dancers themselves.

For several years the family lived in Vienna and Germany but to escape the dangers of the Napoleonic wars, Filippo moved them to Paris. He danced and choreographed throughout Europe, mostly in Italy, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Finally, he was invited to take a more permanent position with the [[Theater am Kärntnertor]] in Vienna.

Once settled in Vienna, he sent for Marie, who had been studying [[ballet]] in Paris. Upon her arrival, Filippo was discouraged by her artistic progress and began training her himself.  He had her practice ballet six hours a day for six months, using a level method of technique training. He was very strict with her, and had no sympathy for her aching and bleeding toes. He sought to make her style light and delicate, with an emphasis on jumps with ''ballon'' and [[en pointe|pointe work]], something that was unheard of before this time.  When she was ready he took her back to Paris.

After Marie's professional debut she became so popular that Filippo was able to negotiate a six-year contract for the two of them. The triumphant première of ''[[La Sylphide]]'' on 12 March 1832, made her the most acclaimed [[prima ballerina]] of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period and him the most renowned choreographer of the day. It is said that the great Romantic period of dance was ushered in on that night.  Because of this immense success, the two of them traveled widely together and toured both Europe and Russia.

As he grew older, he became eccentric and unpredictable, and eventually lost all of Marie's carefully amassed fortune in unwise speculations. Nevertheless, he must be recognized as a pioneer in a ballet style that was to alter forever the very nature of the art.

Taglioni died in [[Como, Italy]] on 5 February 1871, at the age of 93.

==Misconceptions about ''La Sylphide'' ==
{{main|La Sylphide}}
The ballet-going public knows the Romantic ballet ''[[La Sylphide]]'' as being choreographed by the Danish ballet master [[August Bournonville]].  That is indeed the ''La Sylphide'' audiences are most familiar with today but was not the version given in 1832.

The original production of ''La Sylphide'' was first presented by the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] at the [[Salle Le Peletier]] in 1832, and was choreographed by Filippo Taglioni himself to the music of [[Jean Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer]], with libretto by [[Adolphe Nourrit]] after a story by [[Charles Nodier]].  The leading roles were danced by [[Marie Taglioni]] and [[Joseph Mazilier]].

Bournonville originally intended to stage the 1832 version in Denmark, but the Paris Opéra demanded too high a price for the orchestral parts of Schneitzhoeffer's score. In light of this, Bournonville decided to stage his own version of ''La Sylphide'' on the same scenario, with a new score by [[Herman Severin Løvenskiold]]. The production premiered in 1836 with the [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] [[Lucile Grahn]] and Bournonville in the principal roles. Due to the strong tradition of the Royal Danish Ballet this version is still being performed in Denmark to this day, and has since been staged throughout the world.

In 1972 the ballet master [[Pierre Lacotte]] revived Filippo Talgioni's original ''La Sylphide'' for the Paris Opera Ballet, with the noted ballerina [[Ghislaine Thesmar]] as the Sylph. Schneitzhoeffer's original score was reconstructed from a manuscript held at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. As Taglioni's original choreography was lost long ago, Lacotte choreographed the ballet in the style of the [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. The Paris Opera Ballet has since released the production onto DVD/video twice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Funding bias''', also known as '''sponsorship bias''', '''funding outcome bias''', '''funding publication bias''', and '''funding effect''', refers to the tendency of a scientific study to support the interests of the study's financial sponsor. This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies. Funding bias has been associated, in particular, with research into chemical toxicity, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Krimsky Sheldon | authorlink = Sheldon Krimsky | year = 2013 | title = Do Financial Conflicts of Interest Bias Research? An Inquiry into the "Funding Effect" Hypothesis | url = http://www.tufts.edu/~skrimsky/PDF/Funding%20Effect%20and%20Bias.PDF | journal = Science, Technology &amp; Human Values | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 566–587| doi = 10.1177/0162243912456271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an instance of [[experimenter's bias]].

==Causes==

===Human nature===
The psychology text ''[[Influence: Science and Practice]]'' describes the act of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] as a trait in which a person feels obliged to return favors. This trait is embodied in all human cultures. [[Human nature]] may influence even the most ethical researchers to be affected by their sponsors, although they may genuinely deny it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cialdini, Robert B | title=Influence: Science and Practice (5th ed) |publisher=Prentice Hall |date=2008-08-08 |isbn=978-0-205-60999-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconduct===
{{main|scientific misconduct}}

[[Scientific malpractice]] involving shoddy research or data manipulation does occur in rare instances. Often, however, the quality of manufacturers' studies are at least as good as studies that were not funded by a special interest.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news | author=David Michaels |title=It's Not the Answers That Are Biased, It's the Questions |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/14/AR2008071402145.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, bias usually occurs for other reasons.

===Predetermined conclusion===

Research results can be selected or discarded to support a predetermined conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilmshurst |first=Peter |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tobacco industry]], for example, would publish their own internal research that invariably found minimal adverse health effects of [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

A company that hires researchers to perform a study may require the researchers to sign a nondisclosure agreement before they are funded, by which researchers waive their right to release any results independently and release them only to the sponsor. The sponsor may fund several studies at the same time, suppressing results found contrary to their business interests while publicizing the results that support their interests. Indeed, a review of pharmaceutical studies revealed that research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published, but the drug-company-funded research that was published was more likely to report outcomes favorable to the sponsor.&lt;ref name="lexchin"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Lexchin |last2=Bero |first2=Lisa A |first3=Benjamin |last3=Djulbegovic |first4=Otavio |last4=Clark |title=Pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and research outcome and quality: systematic review |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/326/7400/1167 |journal=BMJ |date=2003-05-31 |volume=326 |pmid=12775614 |issue=7400 |pages=1167–1170 |pmc=156458 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7400.1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[double-blind study]] with only objective measures is less likely to be biased to support a given conclusion. However, the researchers or the sponsors still have opportunities to skew the results by discarding or ignoring undesirable data, qualitatively characterizing the results, and ultimately deciding whether to publish at all. Also, not all studies are possible to conduct double-blind.

===Publication bias===
{{main|publication bias}}

Scientist researcher [[Anders Sandberg]] writes that funding bias may be a form of [[publication bias]]. Because it is easier to publish positive results than inconclusive or no results, positive results may be correlated with being positive for the sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Anders Sandberg | authorlink=Anders Sandberg | title=Supping with the Devil | url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/supping_with_th.html | publisher=OvercomingBias |date=2007-01-14}}&lt;!-- This is a science blog written by a notable scientist; therefore it can be considered a reliable source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporting bias|Outcome reporting bias]] is related to publication bias and selection bias, in which multiple outcomes are measured but only the significant outcomes are reported, while insignificant or unfavorable outcomes are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Bias |url=http://www.chalmersresearch.com/bmg/types_bias.html |publisher=Cochrane Bias Methods Group |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection of subjects or comparators===
{{main|selection bias}}
[[Selection bias]] may result in a non-representative population of test subjects in spite of best efforts to obtain a representative sample. Even a double-blind study may be subject to biased selection of dependent variables, population (via inclusion and exclusion criteria), sample size, statistical methods, or inappropriate comparators, any of which can bias the outcome of a study to favor a particular conclusion.&lt;ref name="lexchin" /&gt;

==Examples==
*A 1996 study on the effects of [[nicotine]] on [[Cognitive deficit|cognitive performance]] revealed that findings of nicotine or smoking improving performance were more likely to be published by scientists who acknowledged tobacco industry support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christina Turner |author2=George J Spilich |title=Research into smoking or nicotine and human cognitive performance: does the source of funding make a difference? |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119158100/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |journal=Addiction |year=1997 |volume=92 |issue=11 |pmid=9519485 |pages=1423–1426 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1997.tb02863.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2003 study of published research on antidepressants found that studies sponsored by manufacturers of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRI) and newer antidepressants tended to favor their products over alternatives when compared to non-industry-funded studies. Also, modelling studies funded by industry were more favorable to industry than studies funded by non-industry sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.183.6.498 |author=C.

*The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) determined in 2008 that the [[Bisphenol A#September 2008|bisphenol A]] (BPA) in [[plastic container]]s is safe when leeched into food, citing chemical industry studies.

*Two opposing commercial sponsors can be at odds with the published findings of research they sponsor.

* In 2016, an analysis of studies exploring health effects of sugary soda consumption published between 2001 and 2016 found a 100% probability that a study was funded by sugar-sweetened beverage companies if it found no link between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and poorer metabolic health.

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Humanitarian education''' teaches various social topics from a [[humanitarian]] perspective.  A desire to reduce suffering, save lives and maintain [[human dignity]] is central to understanding humanitarian education. It is based on the assumption that people have an innate desire to help others, so is centrally concerned with our shared [[Human condition|humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Tawil, Sobhi. Humanitarian Education and the British Red Cross programme for Schools. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and context ==

Humanitarian education is an area of learning that concentrates on the desire or impulse to save lives, protect human dignity and reduce suffering. It particularly relates to offering assistance to others in an emergency or crisis and is also used to refer to the skills, knowledge and attitudes needed for individuals and communities to help themselves. In the UK it may appear within curriculum subjects such as [[citizenship]] and [[Personal, Social and Health Education]]. It began to be developed and encouraged in the UK by the British Red Cross during 2005.

== Goals and outcomes ==

The goal of humanitarian education is that communities increase their [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] and that individuals and groups are more confident, able and willing to help themselves and others when faced with a crisis.

== Curriculum content ==

By exploring crisis situations humanitarian education enables students to recognise that people can overcome adversity. It develops their understanding of humanitarian issues, the skills that build resilience and encourages them to intervene to support others in crisis.

The way in which educators explore with students any topic, issue or event must be within the framework of the principles of [[Humanitarianism|humanity]] and impartiality. It does not directly address causes and explicitly avoids exploring [[political]], [[religious]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], [[economic]], [[Social environment|environmental]] or other factors that might contribute to or create a crisis.

== Difference from other forms of education ==

Its origins in the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] mean that humanitarian education is sometimes confused with development education or global education, or simply teaching about the work of aid or development [[NGO]]s. Adherents also stress that humanitarian education is philosophically and practically distinct from [[human rights education]], since the humanitarian impulse is founded on needs rather than rights or entitlement.

Humanitarian education is linked to, but distinct from, education about [[international humanitarian law]], often referred to as the laws of war. Aspects of IHL are often topics within humanitarian education.

'''Ivo H. Daalder''' (born March 2, 1960 in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]),&lt;ref name=WhoWho&gt;"Ivo H. Daalder." Marquis Who's Who TM. ''Marquis Who's Who'', 2007. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2008. http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC. Retrieved November 25, 2008.  Document Number: K2017750885.&lt;/ref&gt; has served as President of the [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] since July, 2013. He was the U.S. Permanent Representative on the Council of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) from May 2009 to July 2013. He is a specialist in European security. He was a member of the staff of [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC) during the administration of President [[Bill Clinton]], and was one of the foreign policy advisers to President [[Barack Obama]] during his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130510223322/http://nato.usmission.gov/mission/ambassador.html Bio on United States Mission to NATO's homepage]. Through ''Wayback Machine'', archived May 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academic career==
Daalder was educated at the [[University of Kent]], [[Oxford University]], and [[Georgetown University]], and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[political science]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

He was fellow at [[Harvard University]]'s Center for Science and International Affairs and the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] in London. He received a [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] Faculty Fellowship in International Affairs and an International Affairs Fellowship of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. Daalder was an associate professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s School of Public Affairs, where he was also director of research at the Center for International and Security Studies. He was a Senior Fellow in foreign policy studies at the [[Brookings Institution]] from 1997 to 2009, where he was a specialist in European security, transatlantic relations, and national security affairs.

==National Security Council and Hart-Rudman Commission==
In 1995–1997, Daalder served as a director for European Affairs on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff under President [[Bill Clinton]], where he was responsible for coordinating U.S. policy toward Bosnia. From 1998–2001, Daalder served as a member of the Study Group of the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century (the [[Hart-Rudman Commission]]), a multi-year examination of U.S. national security requirements and institutions.

==Permanent Representative to NATO==
On March 11, 2009, President Obama nominated Daalder to become the [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO]], a post commonly referred to as "U.S. Ambassador to NATO".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts |publisher=Office of [[White House Press Secretary|the Press Secretary, the White House]] |date=2009-03-11 |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-Administration-Posts-3/11/09/ |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315192450/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-Administration-Posts-3/11/09/ |archivedate=2009-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the issues that Daalder has addressed is the lack of communication on security issues between NATO and the [[European Union]]. In October 2010 he wrote in the ''International Herald Tribune'': "NATO and E.U. capabilities need to be in synch, and their operations need to be complementary. We should regularly engage in a robust and transparent exchange of views on a wide range of shared interests. Policy should support work in the field; those in harm's way shouldn't have to work around our failures in Brussels."&lt;ref&gt;"Breaking Brussels' Logjam," ''International Herald Tribune'', October 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO intervention in Libya===
Daalder was U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO in February 2011 when the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] began with uprisings against [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in several cities, followed by a military crackdown by the Gaddafi regime. On March 17, 2011, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed a resolution calling upon the international community to take "all necessary measures" to protect civilians in Libya. On March 19, following UN authorization, the United States led a coalition of allied countries, including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom, launching air strikes against Gaddafi's forces, destroying his air defense system and imposing a no-fly zone and a naval blockade to prevent shipments of arms.&lt;ref name="James Stavridis 2012"&gt;Ivo Daalder and James Stavridis, ''NATO's Victory in Libya - the Right Way to Run an Intervention'', March/April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this first success, Daalder led the U.S. efforts to persuade NATO to take over command and control of the operation. On March 27, the North Atlantic Council voted unanimously to take charge of what became known as [[Operation Unified Protector]]. The Operation had three missions; to police the arms embargo, to patrol the no-fly zone, and to protect civilians. Fourteen NATO allies took part in the actual operations, along with contingents from [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], [[Qatar]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. In Libya, unlike other military intervention in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States played a largely supporting role, providing intelligence, aerial surveillance and refueling, while other NATO allies, including France, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Belgium, flew most of the bombing missions.&lt;ref name="James Stavridis 2012" /&gt;

The first two missions were quickly put into place, but, due to the presence of Gaddafi forces in or near civilian areas, NATO was unable to strike with full force. By August 2011, however, the opposition forces were strong enough to seize Tripoli and within two months had taken control of the entire country. On October 23, 2011–233 days after Operation Unified Protector had begun—the NATO North Atlantic Council declared its mission complete.&lt;ref name="James Stavridis 2012" /&gt;

In February 2012, Daalder and Admiral [[James Stavridis]], the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, wrote their own verdict on the operation in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'': "NATO's operation in Libya has rightly been hailed as a model intervention. The alliance responded rapidly to a deteriorating situation that threatened hundreds of thousands of civilians rebelling against an oppressive regime. It succeeded in protecting those civilians and, ultimately, in providing the time and space for local forces to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. And it did so by involving partners in the region and sharing the burden among the alliance's partners".&lt;ref name="James Stavridis 2012" /&gt;

==Chicago Council on Global Affairs==
In July 2013, Daalder became President of the [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]] – an independent, nonpartisan think tank that convenes leading global voices, conducts independent research, and engages the public to provide insights and influence the public discourse on critical global issues. Under Daalder, the Council has extended the reach and relevance of its global work by increasing its roster of experts and portfolio of issues; extending the Council's historic platform for global leaders to engage the public; building a global audience by connecting through digital and social media channels; revitalizing the Council's brand; and growing its financial, foundation, and membership support. Daalder also conceived and spearheaded the 2015 Chicago Forum on Global Cities, a now annual conference in partnership with the [[Financial Times]] that convenes leaders and delegates from around the world for a cross-sector exploration of the influence and impact of global cities in shaping the world's future. Following this rapid growth, the Council was ranked the top "Think Tank to Watch" by the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s 2015 Global Go To Think Tank Index.

==Biography==
Nalo was born in on Johnson Island in the [[Admiralty Islands]] in [[Manus Province]], Papua, New Guinea.&lt;ref name=CFAA/&gt; Whilst at school, Nalo won the Carriapa Art Shield.&lt;ref name=Papua /&gt; After graduating from teachers college he taught expressive arts and other subjects at Wau International Primary School. From 1970 to 1972 he was headmaster of Salamaua Boarding School and during this period continued to study art privately with artist Lucy Walker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=es&amp;id=k23lAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=lucy+walker+joe+nalo&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lucy+walker|title=Bung wantaim: the role of the National Arts School in creating national culture and identity in Papua New Guinea|last=Rosi|first=Pamela Christine|date=1994|publisher=Bryn Mawr College|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nalo had already received several painting commissions when he was offered a scholarship in 1974 to study the Creative Arts Centre in Port Moresby and later went on to teach at the National Arts School as well as a professional artist. In 1975, Nalo represented Papua New Guinea at the 10th World Crafts Conference in Montreal, Canada. He travelled with Jakupa to Stuttgart, Germany in 1979 where their art was featured in an exhibition of contemporary Papua New Guinean art held in association with the 9th occasions since 1976. Nalo became a full time artist in 1991. He did his Primary Education at Kalalo Community School 1975, and then attended Siassi High School 1979. His talent was noticed by the Expressive Arts teacher and was encouraged to pursue studies in the arts.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2007, Nalo was cited as an authority on the symbolism of traditional New Guinea carvings in a book published by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kjellgren | first =Eric | authorlink = | title =Oceania: Art of the Pacific Islands in the Metropolitan Museum of Art | publisher =[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2007 | location = | pages =109 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=_tnC5UxkeukC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=joe+nalo+artist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DXcAMpf82Q&amp;sig=1uwHXTQt70NMcZJG6W-ALQ7RyV4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih-tCyz4DWAhXCzVQKHX5rAqw4ChDoAQgrMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=joe%20nalo%20artist&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn =9781588392381| mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, his work was included as part of an exhibit called "Altogether: Contemporary Papua New Guinea Art"
at the [[East–West Center]] in [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.eastwestcenter.org/news-center/news-releases/altogether-contemporary-papua-new-guinea-art | title =Altogether: Contemporary Papua New Guinea Art| last = | first = | date = 2008| website =[[East–West Center]] | publisher = | access-date =August 30, 2017 | quote =Papua New Guinea’s independence from Australia in 1975 marked the explosion of a contemporary art movement through which artists explored the visual interpretation of nationalism in this new country of more than 6 million people, which occupies the eastern half of New Guinea, the second largest island in the world. Artists began to conceptualize a new national identity through their art, illustrating what it meant to be a Papua New Guinean as opposed to a clan member.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Nalo was one of the artists whose work was shown at the first comprehensive exhibition of Melanesian art in [[Auckland, New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pacificarts.org/node/256 | title =SPIRIT of the PEOPLE - New Melanesian Art: An exhibition of contemporary art from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands &amp; Vanuatu | last = | first = | date = 2009| website =Pacific Arts Center | publisher = | access-date =August 30, 2017| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intelligent Design}}
The '''Kansas evolution hearings''' were a series of hearings held in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], [[United States]] from May 5 to 12, 2005 by the [[Kansas State Board of Education]] and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how [[evolution]] and the [[origin of life]] would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were arranged by the [[Board of Education]] with the intent of introducing [[intelligent design]] into science classes via the [[Teach the Controversy]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/kansas/kangaroo6.html |title=Kansas Evolution Hearings: Roger DeHart, Jill Gonzalez-Bravo, and John Millam |publisher=Talkorigins.org |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://machinist.salon.com/news/feature/2005/05/13/kansas] {{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearings raised the issues of [[creation and evolution in public education]] and were attended by all the major participants in the [[intelligent design movement]] but were ultimately boycotted by the scientific community over concern of lending credibility to the claim, made by proponents of intelligent design, that evolution is the subject of wide dispute within the scientific and science education communities.

The [[Discovery Institute]], hub of the intelligent design movement, played a central role in starting the hearings by promoting its [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2112&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Science%20and%20Education%20Policy%20-%20School%20District%20Policy%20-%20MainPage |title=Key Resources for Parents and School Board Members &amp;#124; Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery.org |date=May 7, 2014 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and campaigning on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ |title=Channel 6 Lawrence, KS - A Division of WOW |publisher=6newslawrence.com |date=November 5, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714233945/http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ |archivedate=July 14, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local science advocacy group [[Kansas Citizens for Science]] organized a [[boycott]] of the hearings by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a [[kangaroo court]] and argued that their participation would lend an undeserved air of legitimacy to the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Wichita Eagle, "Scientists Right to Boycott Evolution Hearings," March 30, 2005; "Evolution Hearings Rejected by Scientists," April 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kansas Board of Education member Kathy Martin declared at the beginning of the hearings, "Evolution has been proven false. ID ([[Intelligent Design]]) is science-based and strong in facts." At their conclusion she proclaimed that evolution is "an unproven, often disproven" theory. "ID has theological implications. ID is not strictly Christian, but it is theistic," asserted Martin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/rb/rb052505.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222032/http://www.reason.com/rb/rb052505.shtml |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[scientific community]] rejects teaching intelligent design as science; a leading example being the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], which issued a policy statement saying "Creationism, intelligent design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or of species are not science because they are not testable by the [[Scientific method|methods of science]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309064066/html/25.html |title=Reading: Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition &amp;#124; The National Academies Press |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design]])

On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.

==Background==
The hearings were one of a number of [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns]] that sought to establish new science education standards consistent with [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] beliefs, both in the state and nationwide, and reverse what they saw as a domination in science education by actual science, specifically the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]], which they viewed as [[atheism|atheistic]], in direct conflict to their religious beliefs.

Kansas Board of Education elections in 2004 gave religious conservatives a 6-4 majority. In 2005, prompted by the Kansas [[Intelligent Design Network]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligentdesignetwork.org]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217155557/http://www.intelligentdesignetwork.org/ |date=December 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Discovery Institute]], the board sought new high school science standards. The revisions did not entirely eliminate evolution from instruction, but presented it as a theory greatly challenged and disputed, in line with the Discovery Institute's [[Teach the Controversy]] campaign. The new standards presented intelligent design as an alternative to evolution through the Institute's ''Critical Analysis of Evolution''. Board member Connie Morris sent a taxpayer-funded newsletter to constituents calling evolution an "age-old fairy tale" that was defended with "anti-God contempt and arrogance." Describing herself as a Christian who believes in a literal interpretation of Genesis, Morris wrote that evolution was "biologically, genetically, mathematically, chemically, metaphysically and etc. wildly and utterly impossible."&lt;ref&gt;David Klepper, "Kansas School Board's Hearings on Evolution End in Acrimony," Knight Ridder Newspapers, May 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intelligent Design Network originally proposed over 20 pages of revisions to the science standards. Their proposals were rejected by the science standards committee (made up of Kansas scientists and educators) appointed by the Board of Education, and were also rejected by 12 independent scientists who reviewed the proposed revisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/sciencestdreview.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208045135/http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/sciencestdreview.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each side was invited to provide witnesses to testify before the board for intelligent design or evolution, with the taxpayers of Kansas covering the travel expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cartwright|first1=Reed A.|title=The Panda's Thumb: Kansas Evolution Hearings|url=http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000874.html|website=pandasthumb.org|publisher=[[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]]|accessdate=September 26, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202072458/http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000874.html|archivedate=December 2, 2008|date=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific community refused to participate ''en masse''. The pro-intelligent design group, the Intelligent Design Network, invited 22 witnesses. Among these were a number of non-scientists, and a number of scientists with no professional experience in biology.

==New science standards==
On November 8, 2005 the Kansas Board of Education approved the following changes to its science standards:&lt;ref name=2005_standards&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/sciencestd.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kansas Science Education Standards |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=September 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206043320/http://www3.ksde.org/outcomes/sciencestd.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Add to the mission statement a goal that science education should seek to help students make "informed" decisions.
#Provide a definition of science that is not strictly limited to natural explanations. We also emphasize that the Science Curriculum Standards do not include Intelligent Design, the scientific disagreement with the claim of many evolutionary biologists that the apparent design of living systems is an illusion. While the testimony presented at the science hearings included many advocates of Intelligent Design, these standards neither mandate nor prohibit teaching about this scientific disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/sciencestd.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807061138/http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/sciencestd.pdf |date=August 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The new definition adopted: "Science is a systematic method of continuing investigation that uses observations, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, logical argument and theory building, to lead to more adequate explanations of natural phenomena."}}
# Allow intelligent design to be presented as an alternative explanation to evolution as presented in mainstream biology textbooks, without endorsing it.
# State that evolution is a theory and not a fact.
# Require informing students of purported scientific controversies regarding evolution.

===Opposition to new standards===
In addition to the over 70 scientific societies, institutions and other scientific professional groups that have issued statements supporting evolution education and opposing intelligent design, the Kansas Board of Education was presented a letter from 38 Nobel laureates, the ''Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity Nobel Laureates Initiative'', calling upon the Board of Education to reject intelligent design and support the teaching of evolution. It stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Logically derived from confirmable evidence, evolution is understood to be the result of an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection. As the foundation of modern biology, its indispensable role has been further strengthened by the capacity to study DNA. In contrast, intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific; it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ljworld.com/pdf/2005/09/15/nobel_letter.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209120655/http://media.ljworld.com/pdf/2005/09/15/nobel_letter.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Discovery Institute has consistently insisted that its ''Critical Analysis of Evolution'' lesson plan is not another attempt to open the door of public high school science classrooms for intelligent design, and hence [[supernatural]] explanations. Discovery Institute spokesman Casey Luskin in February 2006 coined the term "false fear syndrome" of those who said it was, and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is simply another instance of Darwinists attempting to oppose critical analysis of evolution by pretending that it is equivalent to teaching intelligent design. This is a political tactic based upon misinformation, misrepresentation, emotions, and false fears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/02/false_fear_epidemic_spreads_to.html |title=False Fear Epidemic over Critical Analysis of Evolution Spreads to Wisconsin - Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=Evolutionnews.org |date=February 7, 2006 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response, [[Nick Matzke]] says that it has proved that ''Critical Analysis of Evolution'' is a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/no_one_here_but.html |title=The Panda's Thumb: No one here but us Critical Analysis-ists |publisher=Pandasthumb.org |date=July 11, 2006 |accessdate=September 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906051325/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/no_one_here_but.html |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kansas science standards as proposed by the Discovery Institute and adopted by the state were said to be "ID in disguise" by an assistant of a Discovery Institute Fellow, confirming the criticisms of opponents to the standards. In discussing Discovery Institute radio commercials supporting their campaign airing in Kansas on the blog of [[William A. Dembski]], Dembski's research assistant and co-moderator of the site, Joel Borofsky, said:

{{quote|My hope is that ID will be taught properly in Kansas. Having been born and raised there I would love to claim to be from the first state to teach ID. There is a lot of movement among science high school teachers to never teach ID, even if it becomes a law because "we don't know how to teach philosophy.

It would be nice to see them learn. I worked in a school and grew tired of hearing them speak of how it's wrong to point out the weaknesses in Darwin's theory because, "even if it is weak, it's still the best theory out there." (Shades of Dawkins anyone?)"&lt;ref name=borofsky&gt;[http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/1370 Radio Commercials Air in Kansas Supporting Standupforscience.com’s Approach to Teaching Evolution] Joel Borofsky. Uncommondescent.com, July 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To the statement that the Kansas science standards had nothing to do with intelligent design but were only about teaching evolution in a "balanced" way, Borofsky responded: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It really is ID in disguise. The entire purpose behind all of this is to shift it into schools ... at least that is the hope/fear among some science teachers in the area. The problem is, if you are not going to be dogmatic in Darwinism that means you inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an alternative to Darwinism. So far, the only plausible theory is ID. If one is to challenge Darwin, then one must use ID. To challenge Darwin is to challenge natural selection/spontaneous first cause ... which is what the Kansas board is attempting to do. When you do that, you have to invoke the idea of ID.&lt;ref name=borofsky/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the reception to his comments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/revealing_slip_of_the_keyboard.php Revealing slip of the keyboard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313112305/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/revealing_slip_of_the_keyboard.php |date=March 13, 2007 }}. [[PZ Myers]]. Pharyngula, July 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://recursed.blogspot.com/2006/08/which-creationist-is-lying.html Which Creationist is Lying?] Jeffrey Shallit. Recursivity, August 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Dembski's research assistant issued a clarification, stating that he was only voicing his personal opinion, not that of others in the movement, and that he is Dembski's "assistant on theological work, not necessarily the ID movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncommondescent.com/index.php/archives/1389 |title=Archives &amp;#124; Uncommon Descent - Part 1389 |publisher=Uncommon Descent |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Discovery Institute continues to deny allegations that its true agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of [[Stephen C. Meyer]] when ABC News asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying "I don't think we want to go down that path."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1297170&amp;WNT=true |title=Small Group Wields Major Influence in Intelligent Design Debate - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=November 10, 2005 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[National Science Teachers Association]] spoke out against the new science standards; in addition to separate statements from each opposing the standards, the two groups issued a joint statement that the new Kansas standards are improved, but as currently written, they overemphasize controversy in the theory of evolution and distort the definition of science. The National Academy of Sciences and National Science Teachers Association offered to work with the board to resolve these issues so the state standards could use text from the National Research Council's ''National Science Education Standards'' and National Science Teachers Association's ''Pathways to Science Standards'', though they ultimately declined to grant use of the text due to Kansas State Board of Education members insisting on language "emphasizing controversy in the theory of evolution" and "distorting the definition of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kansas Denied Use of National Science Education Standards |url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/morenews/20051027.htm |publisher=The National Academies |date=October 27, 2005 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the scientific community is that there is no controversy to teach, that evolution is widely accepted within the scientific community as a valid, well-supported theory and that such disagreements that do exist are about the details of evolution's mechanisms, not the validity of evolution itself.

For example, the [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] in a statement endorsing evolution as noncontroversial quoted [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] "[[nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]" and went on to state that the quote "accurately reflects the central, unifying role of evolution in biology. The theory of evolution provides a framework that explains both the history of life and the ongoing adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges and changes." They emphasized that "Scientists have firmly established evolution as an important natural process" and that "The selection of topics covered in a biology curriculum should accurately reflect the principles of biological science. Teaching biology in an effective and scientifically honest manner requires that evolution be taught in a standards-based instructional framework with effective classroom discussions and laboratory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bisconti |first=Michael J. |title=NABT's Statement on Teaching Evolution |url=http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp |publisher=National Association of Biology Teachers |work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=September 27, 2006 |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927160040/http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp |archivedate = September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for new standards===
The hub of the [[intelligent design movement]], the [[Discovery Institute]] and its [[Center for Science and Culture]], played a central role in bringing about the Kansas evolution hearings, first by supporting ID proponents in their bids for seats on the board, and later in aggressively lobbying for a "[[Teach the Controversy]]" solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Views%20and%20News&amp;id=2570 |title=Darwinists Snub Kansas, Refuse to Answer Questions About Scientific Problems with Evolutionary Theory &amp;#124; Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery.org |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teach the Controversy is a controversial political-action campaign originating from the Discovery Institute that seeks to advance an education policy for US public schools that introduces intelligent design to public school science curricula and seeks to redefine science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html |title=Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism |publisher=Infidels.org |date=May 26, 1999 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow for supernatural explanations by eliminating "[[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]]" from science and replacing it with "[[theistic realism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phillip E. Johnson |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/ratzsch.htm |title=Starting a Conversation about Evolution: Johnson, Phillip |publisher=Arn.org |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teach the Controversy proponents portray evolution as a "theory in crisis."

As well as proposing its own draft science standards to the Kansas State Board of Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=3164&amp;program=CSC%20-%20Science%20and%20Education%20Policy%20-%20School%20District%20Policy%20-%20MainPage |title=Discovery Institute's Science Education Policy &amp;#124; Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery.org |date=February 11, 2013 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Critical Analysis of Evolution'' high school lesson plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/ohio/docs/modellesson.pdf |format=PDF |title=Critical analysis of Evolution - Grade 10 |publisher=Discovery.org |accessdate=September 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106113806/http://www.discovery.org/csc/ohio/docs/modellesson.pdf |archive-date=November 6, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Discovery Institute participated in presenting a letter to the Kansas State Board of Education from Institute associate, Dr. [[Philip Skell|Philip S. Skell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2568&amp;program=CSC ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033605/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2568&amp;program=CSC |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable intelligent design proponent, Dr. Skell's letter to the board touts the alleged benefits of the Teach the Controversy approach, as well his credentials as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, despite the fact the National Academy of Sciences issued a policy statement against the Teach the Controversy solution and intelligent design as a concept.

Two intelligent design proponents, John H. Calvert, a lawyer and a Managing Director of Intelligent Design Network, Inc., and William S. Harris, Ph.D., co-author with Calvert of ''Intelligent Design: The Scientific Alternative to Evolution'' (National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly, Autumn 2003) were instrumental in pushing for the successful adoption of the new standards, including submitting a ''Suggested Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansasscience2005.com/Findings%20of%20fact%20final.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530003803/http://www.kansasscience2005.com/Findings%20of%20fact%20final.pdf |date=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/sci_standards.htm |title=SCIENCE STANDARDS - Intelligent Design Network :: Seeking Objectivity in Origins Science |publisher=Intelligent Design Network |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are active participants in the intelligent design movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentdesignnetwork.org/people.htm |title=Seeking Objectivity in Origins Science |publisher=Intelligent Design Network |date= |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovery Institute fellows used the media coverage of the hearings to take their message to the public. The Institute's vice president and program director, [[Stephen C. Meyer]], appeared on the [[Fox News]] show ''[[The Big Story (2000 TV series)|The Big Story]]'' with [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]], where he debated [[Eugenie Scott]], executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]]. There Meyer sought to convey the Institute's message that debate over evolution is not a ploy to get religious ideas into public schools, that evolution is a theory in crisis, and that students were currently being taught in error there was no scientific controversy over evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Evolution Vs. God in the Classroom - The Big Story w/ Gibson and Nauert | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=May 6, 2005 | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155943,00.html | accessdate=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed changes were not supported by most of the 26 members of the panel that reviews state science curriculum.

===Decision===
On November 8, 2005, the Board of Education voted to instruct science students along the lines of the Discovery Institute, that evolution could not rule out a supernatural or theistic source, that [[Evolution as theory and fact|evolution itself was not fact but only a theory]] and one in crisis, and that ID must be considered a viable alternative to evolution.

The following is a list of those who testified in the Kansas evolution hearings (in order), most of whom are affiliated with the Discovery Institute and all of whom are [[intelligent design]] advocates or other forms of [[creationism|creationists]], or advocates of some other form of anti-evolution.

==Result==
The Kansas Board of Education voted 6–4 August 9, 2005 to include greater criticism of evolution in its school science standards, but it decided to send the standards to an outside academic for review before taking a final vote. The standards received final approval on November 8, 2005. The new standards were approved by 6 to 4, reflecting the makeup of religious conservatives on the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toppo |first=Greg |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2005-11-08-kansas-science-standards_x.htm |title=Kansas schools can teach 'intelligent design' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=November 8, 2005 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006 the Board of Standards issued a "rationale statement" which claimed that the current science curriculum standards do not include intelligent design.&lt;ref name="kcfs.org"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kcfs.org/kcfsnews/?p=141 |title=KCFS News and Resources |publisher=Kcfs.org |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the scientific community critical of the standards contended that the board's statement was misleading in that they contained a "significant editorializing that supports the Discovery Institute and the Intelligent Design network's campaign position that Intelligent Design is not included in the standards", the standards did "say that students should learn about ID, and that ID content ought to be in the standards", and that the standards presented the controversy over intelligent design as a scientific one, denying the mainstream scientific view.&lt;ref name="kcfs.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/the_kansas_stan.html#more |title=The Panda's Thumb: The Kansas standards DO include ID |publisher=Pandasthumb.org |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=September 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924063758/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/the_kansas_stan.html#more |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kansas joined [[Ohio]] in adopting the Discovery Institute's [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] public school science standards during that period. While other states were backing away from teaching alternatives to evolution, the Oklahoma House passed a bill Thursday, March 2, 2006 that contained Discovery Institute language encouraging schools to expose students to alternative views about the origin of life. Popular reaction included the creation of the intelligent design parody Pastafarianism (the worship of a [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]]). Its founder insisted it should be offered as a "third" theory on origins, suggesting possible legal action if it was not included and intelligent design was.

On August 1, 2006, 4 of the 6 conservative Republicans who approved the [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] classroom standards lost their seats in a primary election. The moderate Republican and liberal Democrats gaining seats, largely supported by Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]], vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14137751/ |title=Evolution's foes lose ground in Kansas - Technology &amp; science - Science - Evolution &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the members who lost her seat, Connie Morris, a conservative from [[St. Francis, Kansas|St. Francis]] in the northwest corner of the state, pointed to the "liberal media" for her loss, noting that "liberal opportunists" do not mind "slandering people and harming their families and their reputation and their business and their communities and their state ... It's a shame, and I feel bad for them when they face God on Judgment Day." Although four members who claimed to be born-again Christians remained on the Board, she believed that the new board would waste no time adopting new science standards, expecting that in the following January, when the new members were sworn in, the Board would rescind existing standards and adopt new ones that "let government schools teach children that we are no more than chaotic, random mutants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Jim |title=Official Cries Foul as Liberals Take Over Kansas Education Board |url=http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/8/112006d.asp |work=Agape Press |publisher=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=August 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006223857/http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/8/112006d.asp |archivedate = October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of science was once again returned to "the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe."&lt;ref name=nyt-2007&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Agency writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 14, 2007 |title=Kansas: Anti-Evolution Guidelines Are Repealed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/us/14brf-evolution.html |deadurl=no |newspaper=N.Y.

'''Media literacy''' encompasses the practices that allow people to access, critically evaluate, and create [[Media (communication)|media]]. Media literacy is not restricted to one medium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=W. James|date=2010-11-30|title=The State of Media Literacy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838151.2011.521462|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|volume=54|issue=4|pages=675–696|doi=10.1080/08838151.2011.521462|issn=0883-8151}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore has had several different attempts to have a specific definition over the years. Media literacy definitions have been defined based on general skills pertinent to all media or definitions relating to specific mean forms of media. The US-based [[National Association for Media Literacy Education]] defines it as a series of communication competencies with the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and communicate in a variety of forms which can be print or non-print messages. They find that media literacy allows people to be critical thinkers and creative in many messages like image, language, and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Leaning|first=Marcus|title=Integrating Media and Information Literacy|date=2017|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-100170-7.00001-9|work=Media and Information Literacy|pages=3–14|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780081001707|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are '''four''' important skills that help the viewer or reader understand the meaning of media literacy: 

* Accessing media
* Analyzing content
* Being able to evaluate messages
* Being able to create media for self-expression and communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Media literacy typically lends itself to a deeper meaning and analysis of the work, not necessarily just a direct understanding of fact represented in the work. Media Literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create media in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medialit.org/media-literacy-definition-and-more|title=https://www.medialit.org/media-literacy-definition-and-more|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy also concerns the ability to identify when there is a problem that impacts [[democracy]], thus allowing the public to generate its own opinion, which can influence society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-white/media-literacy_b_3808886.html|title=Media Literacy: Learning Not to Hate the News|last=White|first=Thomas|date=2013|website=Huff Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy education for children and youth is intended to promote awareness of media influence and create an active stance towards both consuming and creating media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/704121171|title=Digital and media literacy : connecting culture and classroom|last=Renee.|first=Hobbs,|date=2011|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn=9781412981583|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=704121171}}&lt;/ref&gt; By teaching children to have a critical eye toward media, they learn how to interpret information and communicate more efficiently, which may impact their everyday lives. Media literacy education is part of the curriculum in the United States and some European Union countries, and an interdisciplinary global community of media literacy scholars and educators engages in knowledge sharing through scholarly and professional journals and national membership associations. In some countries and locations, however, teachers lack appropriate qualifications and the application of best practices is deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Supsakova|first1=Bozena|title=Media Education of Children a Youth as a Path to Media Literacy|journal=ProQuest|date=April 2016|volume=7|issue=1 |url=https://search-proquest-com.proxyau.wrlc.org/docview/1785832718?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=8285}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=60&amp;v=GIaRw5R6Da4]

==Education==
The terms 'media literacy' and 'media education' are used synonymously in most English-speaking nations. Many scholars and educators consider media literacy to be an expanded conceptualization of literacy. In 1993, a gathering of the media literacy community in the United States developed a definition of media literacy as the ability of a citizen to access, analyze, and produce information for specific outcomes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aufderheide|first=Patricia|date=1993|title=Media Literacy|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED365294|journal=Aspen Inst.|volume=|pages=44|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy has a long history and over the years a number of different terms have been used to capture the skills, competencies, knowledge and habits of mind that are required for full participation in media-saturated societies. In England, the term "media education" is used to define the process of teaching and learning about [[media (communication)|media]].&lt;ref name=Buckingham&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckingham|first=David|title=Media education : literacy, learning and contemporary culture|year=2007|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge [u.a]|isbn=0745628303|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is about developing people's critical and creative abilities when it comes to mass media, popular culture and digital media. Media education is the process and media literacy is the outcome, but neither term should be confused with educational technology or with educational media. When people understand media and technology, they are able to access, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a wide variety of media, genres, and forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romero-Martín|first=Rosario|last2=Castejón-Oliva|first2=Francisco-Javier|last3=López-Pastor|first3=Víctor-Manuel|last4=Fraile-Aranda|first4=Antonio|date=2017|title=Formative assessment, communication skills and ICT in Initial Teacher Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-07|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=73–82|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-07|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education for media literacy often uses an inquiry-based pedagogic model that encourages people to ask questions about what they watch, hear, and read.  Media literacy education provides tools to help people critically analyze messages, offers opportunities for learners to broaden their experience of media, and helps them develop creative skills in making their own media messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromedialiteracy.eu/ The European Charter for Media Literacy]. Euromedialiteracy.eu. Retrieved on 2011-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical analyses can include identifying author, purpose and point of view, examining construction techniques and genres, examining patterns of media representation, and detecting [[propaganda]], [[censorship]], and [[media bias|bias]] in news and public affairs programming (and the reasons for these). Media literacy education may explore how structural features—such as [[media ownership]], or its funding model&lt;ref&gt;See [[Corporate media]] and [[Public service broadcasting]]&lt;/ref&gt;—affect the information presented.

In North America and Europe, media literacy includes both empowerment and protectionist perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobbs|first1=Renee|title=Empowerment and protection: Complementary strategies for digital and media literacy in the United States|journal=Formare|date=2010|pages=1–17|url=http://works.bepress.com/reneehobbs/11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media literate people should be able to skillfully create and produce media messages, both to show understanding of the specific qualities of each medium, as well as to create [[citizen media|independent media]] and participate as active citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Citizen media|date=2018-09-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizen_media&amp;oldid=859043031|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy can be seen as contributing to an expanded conceptualization of literacy, treating mass media, popular culture and digital media as new types of 'texts' that require analysis and evaluation. By transforming the process of [[media consumption]] into an active and critical process, people gain greater awareness of the potential for misrepresentation and manipulation (especially through [[commercials]] and [[public relations]] techniques), and understand the role of mass media and participatory media in constructing views of reality.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Media Literacy Resource Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy education is sometimes conceptualized as a way to address the negative dimensions of [[mass media]], [[Pop culture|popular culture]] and [[digital media]], including [[media violence]], [[Gender stereotypes|gender]] and [[racial stereotypes]], the [[sexualization]] of children, and concerns about [[Identity theft|loss of privacy]], [[cyberbullying]] and [[Internet predator]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By building knowledge and competencies in using media and technology, media literacy education may provide a type of protection to children and young people by helping them make good choices in their media consumption habits, and patterns of usage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Frau-Meigs, D. 2008. Media education: Crossing a mental rubicon." It will also benefit generations to come in order to function in a technological and media filled world. In Empowerment through media education: An intercultural dialogue, ed. Ulla Carlsson, Samy Tayie, Genevieve Jacqui¬not-Delaunay and Jose Manuel Perez Tornero,  (pp. 169 – 180). Goteborg University, Sweden: The International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom in cooperation with UNESCO, Dar Graphit and Mentor Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical concepts for media literacy education===
A variety of scholars have proposed theoretical frameworks for media literacy. Renee Hobbs identifies three frames for introducing media literacy to learners: authors and audiences (AA), messages and meanings (MM), and representation and reality (RR). In synthesizing the literature from media literacy, information literacy, visual literacy and new literacies, she identifies these core ideas that form the theoretical context for media literacy.
&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2006) Multiple visions of multimedia literacy: Emerging areas of synthesis. In Handbook of literacy and technology, Volume II. International Reading Association. Michael McKenna, Linda Labbo, Ron Kieffer and David Reinking, Editors. Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (pp. 15 -28)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Buckingham (academic)|David Buckingham]] has come up with four key concepts that "provide a theoretical framework which can be applied to the whole range of contemporary media and to 'older' media as well: Production, Language, Representation, and Audience."&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt; These concepts are defined as follows:

====Production====

Media texts are consciously made.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt; Some are made by individuals working alone, just for themselves or their family and friends, but most are produced and distributed by groups of people often for commercial profit. Economic interests and the generation of profit are often at stake in media production.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt;

====Representation====

The notion of 'representation' is one of the first established principles of media education. Media offers viewers a facilitated outlook of the world and a re-representation of reality. Media production involves selecting and combining incidents, making events into stories, and creating characters. Media representations allow viewers to see the world in some particular ways and not others. Audiences also compare media with their own experiences and make judgements about how realistic they are. Media representations can be seen as real in some ways but not in others: viewers may understand that what they are seeing is only imaginary and yet they still know it can explain reality.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt;

====Audience====

Studying audiences means looking at how demographic audiences are targeted and measured, and how media are circulated and distributed throughout. It looks at different ways in which individuals use, interpret, and respond to media. The media increasingly have had to compete for people's attention and interest because research has shown that audiences are now much more sophisticated and diverse than has been suggested in the past decades. Debating views about audiences and attempting to understand and reflect on our own and others' use of media is, therefore, a crucial element of media education.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt;

To elaborate on the concepts presented by David Buckingham, Henry Jenkins discusses the emergence of a participatory culture, in which our students are actively engaged.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Henry|title=Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century|date=2009|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of this participatory culture, schools must focus on what Jenkins calls the "new media literacies", that is a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need in the new media landscape.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; In the new media literacies we see a shift in focus from individual expression to community involvement, involving the development of social skills through collaboration and networking.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;

Jeff Share (2002) has categorized the different approaches to media education to fit into 4 different areas. These are the protectionist approach, media arts education, media literacy movement, and critical media literacy (of which he is an advocate). The protectionist approach views audiences of mass media as dupes of the media, vulnerable to cultural, ideological or moral influences, and needing protection by education. The media arts education approach focuses on creative production of different media forms by learners. The media literacy movement is an attempt to bring traditional aspects of literacy from the educational sphere and apply it to media.

===Empowerment and protection approaches===
Empowerment and protection are complementary strategies for media literacy education and are fundamentally linked together.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2010). Empowerment and protection: Complementary strategies for digital and media literacy education in the United States. Formare, 70. 1 – 17. Rome, Italy. http://formare.erickson.it/wordpress/en/2010/empowerment-e-protezione-strategiecomplementari-per-la-digital-e-media-literacy-negli-stati-uniti/&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1930s, media literacy educators recognized the need to increase appreciation for quality media content. Edgar Dale's film appreciation movement embodies the concept of empowerment, helping a generation of students learn how to critically analyze film in the context of English education. By the 1970s, awareness of the impact of media influence on children's behavior increased the focus on building students' awareness of the impact of media violence, including concepts like desensitization, to help students recognize and resist the messages that make violence look heroic, justified and appealing. The Center for Media Literacy's MediaLit Kit (TM) embodies the values of the "empowerment through education" approach to media literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medialit.org/sites/default/files/11_CMLEducPhil.pdf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Center for Media Literacy Empowerment Through Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Common Sense Media's media literacy curriculum, which emphasizes internet safety, information literacy, cyberbullying and digital drama, creative credit and copyright, self-image and identity, privacy and security, digital footprint and reputation balances the empowerment and protection approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/scope-and-sequence Scope &amp; Sequence: Common Sense K-12 Digital Citizenship Curriculum | Common Sense Media&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media arts education===
An arts-based approach to media education falls into related but distinct traditions. A longstanding emphasis is associated with traditions of film education, which typically place a central focus on film as an art-form, on its aesthetic and cultural value, and on the creative processes of young people's film-making. A study commissioned by the [[European Commission]], led by the [[British Film Institute]], shows how these values are generally supported across European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, M, Burn, A, Wall, I (2013) Screening Literacy. London: bfi&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of such support by educators, however, the study shows that most European countries allocate few resources or curriculum emphasis to film education. More generally, a media arts approach has been developed as a cross-curricular model, most conspicuously in a group of UK schools adopting the UK government's 1997 option to specialize in media arts, an approach documented by [[Andrew Burn (professor)|Andrew Burn]] and James Durran.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, A and Durran, J (2007) ''Media Literacy in Schools''. London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; This account exemplifies how creative production work in media art forms such as comicstrip, animation, television, film and videogames promotes the cultural, critical and creative aspects of media literacy. It also models the use of the media arts beyond the literacy curriculum, in subjects such as Geography and Science.  Meanwhile, a third strand of media arts work foregrounds the digital aspect of contemporary media arts, associating creative media production with programming and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;Peppler, K (2010) 'Media Arts: Arts Education for a Digital Age' ''Teachers' College Record'', Volume 112, Number 8, August 2010, pp 2118-2153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the classroom, students are encouraged to understand the value of the arts while using creativity to express themselves through creating their own art. Incorporating the arts into a students public education can lead to students becoming more engaged, hands-on and motivated to express themselves freely. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|last2=Share|first2=Jeff|date=January 2007|title=Critical Media Literacy: Crucial Policy Choices for a Twenty-First-Century Democracy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2304/pfie.2007.5.1.59|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=5|issue=1|pages=59–69|doi=10.2304/pfie.2007.5.1.59|issn=1478-2103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical media literacy===

Critical media literacy is defined originally by [[Douglas Kellner]] and Share in "Critical Media Literacy is Not an Option", as "an educational response that expands the notion of literacy to include different forms of mass communication, popular culture, and new technologies. It deepens the potential of literacy education to critically analyze relationships between media and audiences, information, and power. Along with this mainstream analysis, alternative media production empowers students to create their own messages that can challenge media texts and narratives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellner, Share|first1=Douglas, Jeff|title=Critical media literacy is not an option|date=2007|doi=10.1007/s11519-007-0004-2|url=https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/2007_Kellner-Share_CML-is-not-Option.pdf|volume=1|journal=Learning Inquiry|pages=59–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critical media literacy aims to analyze and understand the power structures that lay within the media and understand the underpinnings of the politics that go into representation of gender, race, class and sexuality in the media. This approach is different than "media literacy" because it critically works to understand that there are dominant power structures that audiences work to make meaning between the dominant, oppositional and negotiated readings of media.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Within society, there are many different ideologies operating in media culture at any given time. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] argues that ideologies exist in every aspect of life and are not separate and isolated. Ideologies are understood by the individual but created collectively. Critical media literacy examines ideologies that govern social institutions, government, and lived lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=The Whites of Their Eyes, Racist Ideologies and the Media|date=1995|pages=2–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The benefit of a critical media literacy approach is that audiences engage with and analyze dominant readings and codes within media and contribute to a better understanding of the world's "social realities".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Instead of taking a mediated image at face value, the reader can understand the history and the characteristics of the image and make meaning in various ways.

People often use the skills of critical media literacy without even noticing while watching television, using social media, reading books, listening to music, etc.. Critical media literacy allows people to interpret the messages conveyed onscreen and apply them to their lives. By using this strategy, critical media literacy contribute to social change and activism. As stated by Douglas Kellner in ''Cultural Studies, Multiculturalism, and Media Culture'', "The gaining of critical media literacy is an important resource for individuals and citizens in learning how to cope with a seductive cultural environment. Learning how to read, criticize, and resist sociocultural manipulation can help one empower oneself in relation to dominant forms of media and culture."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellner|first1=Douglas|title=Cultural Studies, Multiculturalism, and Media Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple different ways that individuals can analyze, interpret, and evaluate media texts, specifically critical visual analysis and audience research. Critical visual analysis is different than visual analysis because of its interdisciplinary way of critical analyzing the frame of reference of a visual artifact and the power structures that are embedded in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schroeder|first1=Jonathan E.|title=Critical visual Analysis|date=2006|pages=303–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a great way to utilize critical media literacy in the classroom.  As for an example of audience research, Kellner says "Fandoms of all sorts, from Star Trek fans ("Trekkies"/"Trekkers") to devotees of various soap operas, reality shows, or current highly popular TV series, also form communities that enable them to relate to others who share their interests and hobbies."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Audience reception is important within critical media literacy because it offers the understanding that the audience will take in various forms of media and make meaning of them. A viewer is different than the audience because a viewer is just an individual who makes meaning, where the audience is a collective whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturken and Cartwright|title=The Practices of Looking|pages=Ch. 2: Viewers Make Meaning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences comes into play when one does research using the skills of critical media literacy. In order to understand a piece of media it is absolutely essential to make meaning of the audience and ask questions of who is this targeted at, focused on, and who is viewing it.

===Media Literacy as an intervention method===

Proponents of media literacy education argue that the inclusion of media literacy into school curriculum promotes civic engagement, increases awareness of the power structures inherent in popular media and aids students in gaining the necessary critical and inquiry skills needed in today's society. Educators have argued for decades that teaching media literacy in the classroom is crucial in shaping critical thinkers, well-informed citizens and conscientious consumers in order to be aware about the risks present in the constant use of media and Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Core principles of media literacy education in the United States|url=https://namle.net/publications/core-principles|website=National Association for Media Literacy Education|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramos-Soler|first=Irene|last2=López-Sánchez|first2=Carmen|last3=Torrecillas-Lacave|first3=Teresa|date=2018-07-01|title=Online risk perception in young people and its effects on digital behaviour|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C56-2018-07|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-07|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing body of research focusing on the impacts of media literacy on students. In an important meta-analysis of more than 50 studies published in the Journal of Communication, media literacy interventions were found to have positive effects on knowledge, criticism, perceived realism, influence, behavioral beliefs, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeong | first1 = S.-H. | last2 = Cho | first2 = H. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = Y. | year = 2012 | title = Media Literacy Interventions: A Meta-Analytic Review | url = http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01643.x | journal = The Journal of Communication | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 454–472 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01643.x| pmc = 3377317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital age has made it easy for anyone to create media. We don't always know who created something, why they made it, and whether it's credible. This makes media literacy tricky to learn and teach. Nonetheless, media literacy is an essential skill in the digital age. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/news-and-media-literacy/what-is-media-literacy-and-why-is-it-important|title=What is media literacy, and why is it important?|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====As student-health interventions====
Critical thinking skills that are the basis of media literacy education are utilized to decrease substance abuse in adolescents. A correlative study evaluated the relationship between skills commonly taught in media literacy programs. This study examined the ability to critically deconstruct media messages and adolescent's intent to use substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scull|first1=T.M.|last2=Kupersmidt|first2=J.B.|last3=Elmore|first3=K.C.|last4=Benson|first4=J.W.|title=Adolescents' media-related cognitions and substance use in the context of parental and peer influences|journal=Adolescents' media-related cognitions and substance use in the context of parental and peer influences|date=2010|volume=39|issue=9|pages=981–98|doi=10.1007/s10964-009-9455-3|pmc=3678372}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students who were better able to critically examine and decode media messages reported that they were less likely to use drugs and alcohol in the future. The findings suggest, based on youth exposure to substances in the media, that media literacy programs may be a valuable tool for preventing harmful adolescent health behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkin|first1=C.|last2=Hocking|first2=J.|last3=Block|first3=M.|title=Teenage Drinking: Does Advertising Make a Difference?|journal=Journal of Communication|date=1984|volume=34|issue=2|pages=157–67|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy education is a tool to combat [[childhood obesity]] and promote healthy consumer habits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liao|first1=L.|last2=Lai|first2=I.|last3=Chang|first3=L.|last4=Lee|first4=C.|title=Effects of a food advertising literacy intervention on Taiwanese children's food purchasing behaviors|journal=Health Education Research|date=2016|volume=31|issue=4|pages=509–520|doi=10.1093/her/cyw025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

140 fifth-grade Taiwanese students participated in a study examining the effects of a food advertising literacy program on food purchasing habits. The media literacy program introduced marketing strategies surrounding food advertisements, teaching students to evaluate the nutritional value of advertised foods and promote healthy food among their peers using learned marketing strategies. The study found that students who had completed the food literacy program showed significantly greater improvements in nutritional food knowledge, food purchasing behavior and food advertising literacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; However, after a 1-month follow up students showed a decrease in the above-mentioned categories.

====As sexual health education====
Media literacy programs can be used as a sexual health promotion. These programs allow people to be actively involved as they use media and technology as a source of information. Digital technology has become a part of millennials everyday lives. With this form of access to the internet, millennials have a larger pool of information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.craftinc.org/literacy-e-books/teaching-and-reaching-the-millennial-generation-through-media-literacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A Journal of Media Literacy Education study found that using MLE, adolescents could gather and learn information regarding sexual health as well as media literacy (e.g., how to make safe-sex decisions and how to improve media skills).&lt;ref&gt;"A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health" (Volume 6: issue 1). 2014: 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy programs apply to HIV prevention. MLE allows people to learn valuable skills to understand and detect the falsity of information found in the media about HIV, decreasing the risks and spread of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4943655/&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a violence-prevention strategy====
Media literacy programs can be a violence-prevention strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of a school-based violence prevention media literacy curriculum: http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/Injury%20Prevention%20Journal%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a major longitudinal study conducted by UCLA with more than 2,000 Southern California middle school students found that introducing a curriculum aimed at deconstructing violence in the media resulted in increased student knowledge acquisition regarding media literacy and effects of violent media on individuals and society, changed attitudes toward media violence, as well as playground behaviors and media usage. The study used a self-report survey to compare participant's knowledge and attitudes surrounding violence pre-intervention and post-intervention. The study not only evaluated the curriculum, Beyond Blame: Challenging Violence in the Media, but also the Center for Media Literacy's frameworks for addressing media-related themes and topics.

====As gender stereotype intervention====
A recent study examines the effects of a media literacy program geared at exploring gender stereotypes expressed in the media on middle school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puchner|first1=L.|last2=Markowitz|first2=L.|last3=Hedley|first3=M.|title=Critical Media Literacy and Gender: Teaching Middle School Children about Gender Stereotypes and Occupations|journal=Critical Media Literacy and Gender: Teaching Middle School Children about Gender Stereotypes and Occupations|date=2015|volume=7|issue=2|pages=23–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research measured the extent to which participants learned to be critical consumers of media, especially in regards to stereotypical portrayals of men and women. Results were gathered through student surveys administered pre-intervention and post-intervention and concluded that participants who received the intervention were more likely to believe that the media influences the way people think about men and women and that the media reinforces gender stereotypes in regards to occupation.

====Promoting positive body image====
Media literacy can be an effective tool for addressing issues surrounding women's body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=K.L.|last2=Alexander|first2=S.M.|title=Media Literacy as an Educational Method for Addressing College Women's Body Image Issues|journal=Education|date=2007|volume=127|issue=4|pages=490–497}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted among female college students, participants were shown a 25-minute video that exposes how the advertising industry influences female body image, particularly the messages that certain media texts are sending to viewers about how an ideal woman should look. The study found that participants who watched the video reported greater satisfaction with their body, meaning the difference between their perceived body type and their ideal body type was much smaller compared to those who did not watch the video.

The above studies used self-report post-treatment surveys in order to gather their data. The limitations of this measure are that data collected about student behavior and experience is self-reported and can easily be distorted. Participants can exaggerate their responses, claiming that the media literacy lessons were more impactful than they actually were.

There is a wealth of research regarding youth exposure to media in all its forms. There are numerous articles seeking to explore the consequences of such exposure on adolescent behavior, but there are surprisingly few studies that explore the efficacy of certain tools that can be used to combat the harmful consequences of media exposure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Media literacy education is purported to lessen the negative impacts of media exposure, but precious few studies have been conducted to prove the statement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=T.|last2=Martin|first2=K.|last3=Afifi|first3=A.A|last4=Kraus|first4=J.|title=Media Literacy as a Violence-Prevention Strategy: A Pilot Evaluation|journal=Health Promotion Practice|date=2010|volume=11|issue=5|page=2|doi=10.1177/1524839908328998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps further evidence demonstrating the benefits of media literacy as an intervention would encourage more educators to embrace the practice and incorporate programs into the classroom.

===UNESCO questionnaire===

In 2001, a media education survey by UNESCO investigated  which countries were incorporating media studies into different schools' curricula, as well as to help develop new initiatives in the field of media education. A questionnaire was sent to a total of 72 experts on media education in 52 different countries around the world. The people who received this questionnaire were people involved in academics (such as teachers), policymakers, and educational advisers. The questionnaire addressed three key areas:

# "Media education in schools: the extent, aims, and conceptual basis of current provision; the nature of assessment; and the role of production by students."&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|last=Domaille, Buckingham|first=Kate, David|title=Where Are We Going and How Can We Get there?|url=http://www.ccsonline.org.uk/mediacentre/Research_Projects/unesco_survey.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030507074850/http://www.ccsonline.org.uk/mediacentre/Research_Projects/unesco_survey.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-05-07|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Partnerships: the involvement of media industries and media regulators in media education; the role of informal youth groups; the provision of teacher education."&lt;ref name=UNESCO2&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Media Literacy|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27056&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150114214920/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27056&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-14|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The development of media education: research and evaluation of media education provision; the main needs of educators; obstacles to future development; and the potential contribution of UNESCO."&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"/&gt;

The results from the answers to the survey were double-sided. It was noted that media education had been making a very uneven progress because while in one country there was an abundant amount of work towards media education, another country may have hardly even heard of the concept. Media education has not taken a full swing in some countries due to the lack of policymakers addressing the issue. In some developing countries, educators say that media education was only just beginning to register as a concern because they were just starting to develop basic print literacy.&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"/&gt;

In the countries where media education existed at all, it would be offered as an elective class or an optional area of the school system rather than being on its own. Many countries argued that media education should not be a separate part of the curriculum but rather should be added to a subject already established. The countries which deemed media education as a part of the curriculum included the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Australia. Many countries lacked even just basic research on media education as a topic, including Russia and Sweden. Some said that popular culture is not worthy enough of study. But all of the correspondents realized the importance of media education as well as the importance of formal recognition from their government and policymakers that media education should be taught in schools.&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"/&gt;

==History==
Media literacy education is actively focused on the instructional methods and pedagogy of media literacy, integrating theoretical and critical frameworks rising from constructivist learning theory, media studies, and cultural studies scholarship. This work has arisen from a legacy of media and technology use in education throughout the 20th century and the emergence of cross-disciplinary work at the intersections of scholarly work in media studies and education. The Voices of Media Literacy was a project through the Center for Media Literacy sponsored by Tessa Jolls. It included first-person interviews with 20 media literacy pioneers active prior to the 1990s in English-speaking countries. The project provided historical context for the rise of media literacy from individuals who helped influenced the field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medialit.org/voices-media-literacy-international-pioneers-speak|title=http://www.medialit.org/voices-media-literacy-international-pioneers-speak|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Media education is developing in [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], with a growing interest in the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[India]], [[Russia]] and among many other nations.

===United Kingdom===
Education, for what is now termed media literacy, has been developing in the UK since at least the 1930s. In the 1960s, there was a [[paradigm shift]] in the field of media literacy to emphasize working within popular culture rather than trying to convince people that popular culture was primarily destructive. This was known as the popular arts paradigm.  In the 1970s, there came a recognition that the ideological power of the media was tied to the naturalization of the image. Forged messages were being passed off as natural ones.  The focus of media literacy also shifted to the consumption of images and representations, also known as the representational paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=4441&amp;4441_0=4987 Buckingham, David] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910000111/http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=4441&amp;4441_0=4987 |date=2005-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development has gathered pace since the 1970s when the first formal courses in [[Film studies|Film Studies]] and, later, [[Media studies|Media Studies]], were established as options for young people in the 14-19 age range: over 100,000 students (about 5% of this age range) now take these courses annually. Scotland has always had a separate education system from the rest of the UK and began to develop policies for media education in the 1980s. In England, the creation of the National Curriculum in 1990 included some limited requirements for teaching about the media as part of English. In Scotland, teachers are represented by the professional association AMES (Association of Media Educators, Scotland); while in England the MEA (Media Education Association) fulfills this purpose.

The UK is widely regarded as a leader in the development of education for media literacy. Key agencies that have been involved in this development include the British Film Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/ Education]. BFI (2010-11-03).

The ‘promotion' of media literacy also became a UK Government policy under New Labour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Richard|last2=Buckingham|first2=David|date=2013-10-01|title=Arming the citizen-consumer: The invention of ‘media literacy’ within UK communications policy|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0267323113483605|journal=European Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=527–540|doi=10.1177/0267323113483605|issn=0267-3231}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and was enshrined in the [[Communications Act 2003]] as a responsibility of the new media regulator, [[Ofcom]].  After an initial burst of activity, however, Ofcom’s work in this regard was progressively reduced in scope, and from the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government]] onwards, the promotion of media literacy was reduced to a matter of market research – what Wallis &amp; Buckingham have described as an ‘undead' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Richard|last2=Buckingham|first2=David|date=2016-09-12|title=Media literacy: the UK’s undead cultural policy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10286632.2016.1229314|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|language=en|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10286632.2016.1229314|issn=1028-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eighteen key media literacy stakeholders were identified in the UK.ten of these stakeholders are categorized as ‘Civil Society’, when four are categorized as ‘Public Authorities’. Two stakeholders are categorized as ‘Academia’, when the sectors of ‘Media Regulatory Authorities’ and ‘Audiovisual Content Providers’ account for one key media literacy stakeholder each. Two main stakeholders in the UK have a duty in relation to media literacy. The development of media literacy is a duty placed on Ofcom by Section 11 of the Communications Act 2003. Also, Under its new Charter, the principal Public Service Broadcaster, the BBC, has a duty to enhance media literacy&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/media-literacy-mapping-report-en-final-pdf/1680783500&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Australia===
In Australia, media education was influenced by developments in Britain related to the inoculation, popular arts, and demystification approaches.  Key theorists who influenced Australian media education were [[Graeme Turner]] and [[John Hartley (academic)|John Hartley]] who helped develop Australian media and cultural studies.  During the 1980s and 1990s, Western Australians [[Robyn Quin]] and [[Barrie MacMahon]] wrote seminal textbooks such as ''Real Images'', translating many complex media theories into classroom appropriate learning frameworks. In most Australian states, media is one of five strands of the Arts Key Learning Area and includes "essential learnings" or "outcomes" listed for various stages of development.  At the senior level (years 11 and 12), several states offer Media Studies as an elective.  For example, many Queensland schools offer Film, Television and New Media, while Victorian schools offer VCE Media. Media education is supported by the teacher professional association [[Australian Teachers of Media]]. With the introduction of a new Australian National Curriculum, schools are beginning to implement media education as part of the arts curriculum, using media literacy as a means to educate students how to deconstruct, construct and identify themes in media.

===Africa===
In [[South Africa]], the increasing demand for Media Education has evolved from the dismantling of apartheid and the 1994 democratic elections. The first national Media Education conference in South Africa was actually held in 1990 and the new national curriculum has been in the writing stages since 1997.  Since this curriculum strives to reflect the values and principles of a democratic society there seems to be an opportunity for critical literacy and Media Education in Languages and Culture courses.

Professor Ralph A. Akinfeleye, Ph.D,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsrc.org/downloads/sim/sexuality_in_the_media.pdf], Sexuality in the Media by Professor Ralph A. Akinfeleye, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt; points out that there have been many strides taken to use media to educate and expose South Africans to sexuality.  This new openness has led to more sex scenes in movies, a boost in sales for the pornography industry, and an increase in sex shops. Although many newspapers are attempting to shed light on important issues related to sexuality, such as women's sexual rights, many people in South Africa are still hesitant to the media openness. One of the main issues that critics point out with the openness to sexuality in the media is the presentation of scholarly articles related to sexuality in print media next to pictures of women dressed scandalously trying to sell something, and how this sends mixed signals about sexuality to viewers. In addition, South Africa is faced with trying to balance its newfound popularity of sex with providing a safe environment that does not spread HIV/AIDS and sexual violence, two issues that South Africa has been plagued with in the past. Although there are issues that South Africa is facing in the adjustment to this new openness of sexuality in the media, the steps being taken to educate the public about issues with sexuality in South Africa is a huge move towards Media Education.

===Europe===
In areas of Europe, media education has seen many different forms. Media education was introduced into the Finnish elementary curriculum in 1970 and into high schools in 1977.  But the media education we know today did not evolve in [[Finland]] until the 1990s. Media education has been compulsory in [[Sweden]] since 1980 and in [[Denmark]] since 1970. In both these countries, media education evolved in the 1980s and 1990s as media education gradually moved away from moralizing attitudes towards an approach that is more searching and pupil-centered. In 1994, the Danish education bill gave recognition to media education but it is still not an integrated part of the school.  The focus in Denmark seems to be on information technology.

[[France]] has taught film from the inception of the medium, but it has only been recently that conferences and media courses for teachers have been organized with the inclusion of media production. [[Germany]] saw theoretical publications on media literacy in the 1970s and 1980s, with a growing interest for media education inside and outside the educational system in the 80s and 90s. In the Netherlands media literacy was placed in the agenda by the Dutch government in 2006 as an important subject for the Dutch society. In April, 2008, an official center has been created (mediawijsheid expertisecentrum = medialiteracy expertisecenter) by the Dutch government. This center is more a network organization existing out of different partners who have their own expertise with the subject of media education. The idea is that media education will become a part of the official curriculum.

The history of [[Media studies|media education]] in [[Russia]] goes back to the 1920s. The first attempts to instruct in media education (on the press and film materials, with the vigorous emphasis on the communist ideology) appeared in the 1920s but were stopped by [[Joseph Stalin]]’s repressions.  The end of the 1950s - the beginning of the 1960s was the time of the revival of media education in secondary schools, universities, after-school children centers ([[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Voronezh]], [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], [[Tver]], [[Rostov on Don]], [[Taganrog]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Ekaterinburg]], etc.), the revival of media education seminars and conferences for the teachers. During the time when the intensive rethinking of media education approaches was on the upgrade in the Western hemisphere, in Russia of the 1970s–1980s media education was still developing within the aesthetic concept. Among the important achievements of 1970s-1990s one can recall the first official programs of film and media education, published by Ministry of Education, increasing interest of Ph.D. to media education,  experimental theoretic and practical work on media education by O.Baranov (Tver), S.Penzin (Voronezh), G.Polichko, U.Rabinovich (Kurgan), Y.Usov (Moscow), [[Alexander Victorovich Fedorov|Alexander Fedorov]] (Taganrog), A.Sharikov (Moscow) and others. The important events in media education development in [[Russia]] are the registration of the new specialization (since 2002) for the pedagogical universities – ‘Media Education’ (№ 03.13.30), and the launch of a new academic journal ‘Media Education’ (since January 2005), partly sponsored by the ICOS [[UNESCO]] ‘Information for All’. Additionally, the Internet sites of Russian Association for Film and Media Education 
(English and Russian versions) were created. Taking into account the fact that UNESCO defines media education as the priority field of the cultural educational development in the 21st century, media literacy has good prospects in Russia.

Montenegro became one of the few countries in the world that have introduced media education into their curriculums, when in 2009 “media literacy” was introduced as an optional subject for 16 and 17 year old students of Gymnasium high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perovic |first1=Jelena |title=Media Literacy in Montenegro |journal=Media and Communication |volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.17645/mac.v3i4.335 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ukraine, media education has been developed according to the Conception of implementing media education Ukraine since its approval in 2010 in the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences. Nowdays its implementaton is on the second stage (2017–2020) of its gradual establishing and standardization in education. There are main centres of media education in Ukraine aimed at its development thanks to relevant scientists such as Ivan Franko University of Lviv (Boris Potyatinnik), Institute of Higher Education of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Hanna Onkovych), Institute of Social and Political Psychology of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Lyubov Naidyonova). Besides, there are other institutions which make a contribution to developing media education including the Academy of Ukrainian Press and some of Ukrainian universities where journalists are mostly trained. As a result of activities of these centres and organizations websites were created including the following ones: 1) http://medialiteracy.org.ua founded in 2013 on the basis of the library of the Academy of Ukrainian Press which is an online interactive platform for communication of media educators; 2)  http://mediaosvita.org.ua/pro-nas founded by the Institute of Social and Political Psychology of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine, and aimed at solving problems of media psychology and media education; 3) http://osvita.mediasapiens.ua founded in 2010 by Detector Media (a non-government organization), and  aimed at educating media consumers; 4) http://mediadriver.online is another project of Detector Media which is a multimedia manual with texts, photos, video, and even cartoons about advantages and disadvantages including non-safety of media and aimed at forming media culture of media consumers. There are also other websites devoted to the development of mass media in Ukraine (Media school of Professor Ganna Onkovych (https://www.facebook.com/groups/ 898909013519964/, http://wiki.iteach.com.ua/Тренінг_"Критичне_оцінювання_ресурсів_інтернету"_ для_вчителів_ і_учнів), but the above-mentioned ones are key websites for media educators. Perspectives for media education development are defined in the Conception of implementing media education Ukraine according to which on the third stage (2021–2025) there should be the introduction of the media educational component in the curriculum of high schools of training of specialists in humanitarian sciences and appropriate information and communication technologies &lt;ref&gt;Karpenko, Olena. (2017). Media education as a component of reforming higher education in Ukraine/ О. О. Karpenko Media4u Magazine: Proceedings of 10th International Research Electronic Conference Media and Education 2017. Special Issue, pp. 59–63. http://www.media4u.cz/mav/9788087570395.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[North America]], the beginnings of a formalized approach to media literacy as a topic of education is often attributed to the 1978 formation of the Ontario-based Association for Media Literacy (AML). Before that time, instruction in media education was usually the purview of individual teachers and practitioners. [[Canada]] was the first country in North America to require media literacy in the school curriculum. Every province has mandated media education in its curriculum. For example, the new curriculum of Quebec mandates media literacy from Grade 1 until final year of secondary school (Secondary V). The launching of media education in Canada came about for two reasons. One reason was the concern about the pervasiveness of American popular culture and the other was the education system-driven necessity of contexts for new educational paradigms. Canadian communication scholar [[Marshall McLuhan]] ignited the North American educational movement for media literacy in the 1950s and 1960s. Two of Canada's leaders in Media Literacy and Media Education are Barry Duncan and John Pungente. Duncan died on June 6, 2012. Even after he retired from classroom teaching, Barry had still been active in media education. Pungente is a Jesuit priest who has promoted media literacy since the early 1960s.

===The United States===
Media literacy education has been an interest in the United States since the early 20th century, when high school English teachers first started using film to develop students' critical thinking and communication skills. However, media literacy education is distinct from simply using media and technology in the classroom, a distinction that is exemplified by the difference between "teaching with media" and "teaching about media."&lt;ref&gt;Culver, S., Hobbs, R. &amp; Jensen, A. (2010). Media Literacy in the United States. [http://www.imlrf.org/united-states International Media Literacy Research Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207011654/http://www.imlrf.org/united-states |date=2010-02-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 60s, the ‘film grammar’ approach to media literacy education developed in the United States. Where educators began to show commercial films to children, having them learn a new terminology consisting of words such as: fade, dissolve, truck, pan, zoom, and cut. Films were connected to literature and history. To understand the constructed nature of film, students explored plot development, character, mood and tone. Then, during the 1970s and 1980s, attitudes about mass media and mass culture began to shift around the English-speaking world. Educators began to realize the need to “guard against our prejudice of thinking of print as the only real medium that the English teacher has a stake in.”&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, P. and M. Hazard. 1961. The public arts: Multi-media literacy. English Journal 50 (2): 132-133, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; A whole generation of educators began to not only acknowledge film and television as new, legitimate forms of expression and communication, but also explored practical ways to promote serious inquiry and analysis—- in higher education, in the family, in schools and in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobbs | first1 = R. | last2 = Jensen | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = The past, present and future of media literacy education | url = | journal = Journal of Media Literacy Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, U.S. media literacy education includes a focus on news, advertising, issues of representation, and media ownership. Media literacy competencies can also be cultivated in the home, through activities including co-viewing and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commonsensemedia.org/ What's Really Best for Learning?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Project Censored began using a service learning model to cultivate media literacy skills among students and faculty in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=Mickey|last2=Roth|first2=Andy Lee|title=Censored 2015: Inspiring We the People|date=October 7, 2014|publisher=Seven Stories Press|location=New York/Oakland|isbn=1609805658|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy education began to appear in state English education curriculum frameworks by the early 1990s, as a result of increased awareness in the central role of visual, electronic and digital media in the context of contemporary culture. Nearly all 50 states have language that supports media literacy in state curriculum frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2005).  Media literacy and the K-12 content areas. In G. Schwarz and P. Brown (Eds.) Media literacy:  Transforming curriculum and teaching.  National Society for the Study of Education, Yearbook 104. Malden, MA: Blackwell (pp. 74 – 99).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Montana developed educational standards around media literacy that students are required to be competent in by grades 4, 8, and 12. Additionally, an increasing number of school districts have begun to develop school-wide programs, elective courses, and other after-school opportunities for media analysis and production.

There is no national data on the reach of media literacy programs in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kahne, J. 2012"&gt;Kahne, J., &amp; Middaugh, E. (2012, November). Digital media shapes youth participation in politics. Phi Delta Kappan.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of information and communication technologies has expanded the subject of media literacy to incorporate information literacy, collaboration and problem-solving skills, and emphasis on the social responsibilities of communication. Various stakeholders struggle over nuances of meaning associated with the conceptualization of the practice on media literacy education. Educational scholars may use the term ''critical media literacy'' to emphasize the exploration of power and ideology in media analysis. Other scholars may use terms like ''new media literacy'' to emphasize the application of media literacy to user-generated content or ''21st century literacy'' to emphasize the use of technology tools.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2006) Multiple visions of multimedia literacy: Emerging areas of synthesis.  In Handbook of literacy and technology, Volume II.  International Reading Association.  Michael McKenna, Linda Labbo, Ron Kieffer and David Reinking, Editors.  Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (pp. 15 -28).&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 2001, the Action Coalition for Media Education (ACME) split from the main media literacy organization as the result of debate about whether or not the media industry should support the growth of media literacy education in the United States. [[Renee Hobbs]] of Temple University in Philadelphia wrote about this general question as one of the "Seven Great Debates" in media literacy education in an influential 1998 Journal of Communication article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobbs | first1 = R | year = 1998 | title = The seven great debates in the media literacy movement | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02734.x | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 9–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media industry has supported media literacy education in the United States. Make Media Matter is one of the many blogs (an “interactive forum”) the Independent Film Channel features as a way for individuals to assess the role media plays in society and the world. The television program, The Media Project, offers a critical look at the state of news media in contemporary society. During the 1990s, the Discovery Channel supported the implementation of Assignment: Media Literacy, a statewide educational initiative for K-12 students developed in collaboration with the Maryland State Board of Education.

Because of the decentralized nature of the education system in a country with 70 million children now in public or private schools, media literacy education develops as the result of groups of advocates in school districts, states or regions who lobby for its inclusion in the curriculum.  There is no central authority making nationwide curriculum recommendations and each of the fifty states has numerous school districts, each of which operates with a great degree of independence from one another. However, most U.S. states include media literacy in health education, with an emphasis on understanding environmental influences on health decision-making. Tobacco and alcohol advertising are frequently targeted as objects for "deconstruction, " which is one of the instructional methods of media literacy education. This resulted from an emphasis on media literacy generated by the Clinton White House. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) held a series of  conferences in 1996 and 1997 which brought greater awareness of media literacy education as a promising practice in health and substance abuse prevention education. The medical and public health community now recognizes the media as a cultural environmental influence on health and sees media literacy education as a strategy to support the development of healthy behavior.

Interdisciplinary scholarship in media literacy education is emerging. In 2009, a scholarly journal was launched, the Journal of Media Literacy Education,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmle.org/ Journal of Media Literacy Education]&lt;/ref&gt; to support the work of scholars and practitioners in the field. Universities such as [[Appalachian State University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Ithaca College]], [[New York University]], [[Brooklyn College of the City,]] [[University of New York Tirana|University of New York]], the [[University of Texas-Austin]], [[The University of Rhode Island]] and the [[University of Maryland]] offer courses and summer institutes in media literacy for pre-service teachers and graduate students. [[Brigham Young University]] offers a graduate program in media education specifically for inservice teachers. The Salzburg Academy for Media and Global Change is another program that educates students and professionals from around the world the importance of being literate about the media.

In 2018 California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed a bill allowing media literacy to be taught in California &lt;ref&gt;schoolshttp://www.ksro.com/2018/09/26/governor-brown-signs-dodd-bill-to-teach-media-literacy-in-california-schools/&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Impacts of media literacy education on civic engagement====
Media literacy education appears to have a positive impact on overall youth civic engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Kahne, J. (2011). Digital Opportunities for Civic Education. In Civics 2.0: Citizenship Education for a New Generation (pp. 1–28). American Enterprise Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Youth who attend schools that offer media literacy programs are more likely to politically engage online and are more likely to report encountering diverse viewpoints online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahne | first1 = J. | last2 = Middaugh | first2 = E. | last3 = Lee | first3 = N.-J. | last4 = Feezell | first4 = J.

====Youth interest====
A nationally representative survey found that 84% of young people think they and their friends would benefit from training on verifying information found online.&lt;ref name="Kahne, J. 2012"/&gt; The Common Sense Institute Research found that around the 50% of young people like to keep themselves informed and 2/3 of them want to be informed about the latest news of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/media-education/but-do-our-kids-keep-themselves-informed-heres-what-the-research-reveals/|title=But do our kids keep themselves informed?

===Asia===
Beginning in the 2017 school year, children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources. Called "media literacy," the course provides training in journalism in the new information society.&lt;ref name=Time-Smith&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4730440/taiwan-fake-news-education/|author=Smith, Nicola|date=April 6, 2017|accessdate=April 17, 2017|publisher=Time|title=Schoolkids in Taiwan Will Now Be Taught How to Identify Fake News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nacel Open Door, Inc.''' is a nonprofit  [[student exchange]] organization dedicated to international understanding and language education. [http://www.nacelopendoor.org/aboutus.htm]

==Purpose==
Nacel Open Door, Inc. (NOD) is dedicated to promoting international understanding and language education. NOD believes it is essential for young people to develop a deeper awareness of their role as citizens of the world through direct experience in other cultures and languages, usually through homestays.

==History==
Nacel Open Door was formed in April 1997 by the merger of Nacel Cultural Exchanges and Open Door Student Exchange. Nacel Cultural Exchanges was founded in France by language teachers in 1957, and homestay exchanges with the U.S. began in 1969. Open Door Student Exchange was founded in 1964 to provide intercultural learning opportunities to high school students and their families.

==Structure==
The Nacel Open Door National Office is located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Roughly 25 Regional Coordinators, assisted by more than 200 Local Representatives, organize the programs on the state and local levels. NOD also employs both full-time and part-time employees to administer programs worldwide.

NOD is a member of Nacel International, a group of partner organizations that promote Nacel programs worldwide.

==Affiliations==

Nacel Open Door is listed by the [[Council on Standards for International Educational Travel]] (CSIET) [http://www.csiet.org/publications-resources/publications/listed-programs.html] and is designated by the [[U.S. Department of State]] (formerly the [[USIA]]) as a [[J-1 visa|J-1]] Exchange Visitor Program Sponsor for the Academic Year Program. [http://eca.state.gov/jexchanges/index.cfm?fuseaction=record.list&amp;userMax=50&amp;mode=&amp;state=&amp;sort=prog_name&amp;cat=11&amp;sc=]

==Programs==

===Academic Year Program (AYP)===
Nacel Open Door offers opportunities for families across the United States to host an international [[exchange student]] from one of the more than 35 countries with which Nacel Open Door works. AYP accepts foreign students ages 15 to 18 to live with a [[host family]] and attend high school in the host family's community for a [[semester]], [[academic year]] or [[calendar year]]. [http://www.nacelopendoor.org/aboutus.htm] English language proficiency is required. Orientation is provided prior to leaving home, as well as after arriving in the U.S.

Students and host families receive support from a trained and experienced Local Representative, who in turn is supported by an Area Coordinator and the [[Twin Cities]]-based National Office.

===Private School Program (PSP)===
The Private School Program (PSP) gives private high schools in the United States the opportunity to welcome qualified  [[international students]] to their campuses. These students, who come on an F-1 visa, stay with host families in the schools' communities and come with the goal of graduating from an [[American high school]]. [http://www.nacelopendoor.org/ipsp] These students typically come to the U.S. for more than one year (though not always to the same host family), and most hope to go on to attend an American college or university.

PSP students and host families are also supported by Local Representatives, who in turn are supported by Regional Program Directors and the National Office.

===Short Term Programs (STP)===
Nacel Open Door offers the opportunity for families in the United States to host a student for 2–8 weeks. These students typically come from [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], and [[Mexico]]. [http://www.nacel.net]

Host families should be aware that students have no activities or planned activities. Instead, students expect host families to provide all entertainment throughout the duration of the program.

===Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX)===
Through joint funding from the [[U.S. Congress]] and the [[German Bundestag]], a total of 25 scholarships are available to graduating high school seniors in the United States to spend one year in [[Germany]]. Students live with a host family, participate in a training or school program, and take part in an [[internship]] with a German company. [http://www.nacelopendoor.org/traveling_scholarships.htm]

To be eligible to apply, students must [http://www.nacelopendoor.org/traveling_scholarships.htm]:
:*be U.S. citizens
:*graduate from high school in January or June of the year in which they plan to participate
:*be between 18-19 years of age
:*have a "B" (3.0) [[G.P.A.]]
:*be highly recommended by their school
:*demonstrate leadership ability and willingness to serve as a young [[ambassador]] of the United States

===St. Paul Preparatory School (SPP)===
St. Paul Preparatory School (SPP) is the original high school within the '''Nacel International School System'''. Established in 2003, SPP is an international high school located in downtown [[St. Paul, Minn.|St. Paul, Minnesota]] Students from more than 25 countries, including the United States, attend SPP. SPP is accredited by the [[North Central Association]] and has a cooperative partnership with the [[University of St. Thomas, St. Paul campus]]. [http://www.stpaulprep.org]

The Nacel International School System also has branch schools in [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Vietnam]], and the [[Philippines]], as well as a partnership with a school in [[Poland]].

==Hosting a student==
Most Nacel Open Door programs are based in homestay experiences, in which international students stay with a host family in the United States.

===How to Host===
The Nacel Open Door host family screening process is based on Department of State regulations, CSIET standards, and Nacel Open Door best practices to ensure student safety. In order to host with NOD, a family must be willing to participate in all screening processes. All host family members ages 18 and older must complete a criminal background check, and a home visit is required to ensure student safety.

====Host families choose a program type and duration====
* Academic Programs: Public and private schools; one-semester or year-long
* Short Term Programs: Summer and winter; 2–8 weeks

====Host families provide====
* Room, board, and a safe environment
* Loving parental guidance

====NOD students come to the U.S. with their own====
* Spending money
* Medical insurance

===Application Process===
# An interested family completes the online Host Family Application.
# A Local Representative contacts the family to complete the screening process, which includes a home visit.
# Once the family is fully vetted, the Local Representative assists the family with selecting the student who best matches the family's interests.
# Nacel Open Door facilitates school acceptance for students on academic programs. Once school acceptance is secured, NOD sends the host family's information to the Foreign Partner in the student's home country. At that time, the family may begin communicating directly with the student.

[[File:NICE Internships.jpg|thumb|NICE Internships in Argentina]]

'''NICE – Network of InterCultural Exchange''' is a German-Argentine cooperation, which applies itself to the educational and cultural exchange between [[Europe]] and [[Argentina]]. Its goal is to support students in organising long term stays (e.g. [[internship]]s) in Argentina, to acquire among work experience [[Soft Skills]] as intercultural flexibility.

== History ==
NICE was founded in 2004 in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], where it is headquartered to this day. The foundation was triggered by the discontentment of the founder members with the improvable offer of the internship intermediation and mentoring in Argentina, which they got to know on site as trainees.
The fascination for the South American continent and the emotional need to introduce the vitality and the cultural heritage of Argentina to interested and open-minded students led quickly to an intercultural network, which is manifested in the multilingualism of the [[NGO]] today.

== Objective ==
NICE is aimed at the promotion of the international cultural and knowledge exchange by honorary general counselling about Argentina, but mainly by individual intermediation of internships and volunteerings, offering of Spanish courses at the integrated language school and the organization of accommodations with locals. In this way the students shall be allowed to get to know the everyday (working) life and the lived reality of Argentina as their own live and consequently strengthen not only their professional but also their intercultural competence.

==Personal life==
Baker was born in 1921 in the little community of Blackford, in [[Webster County, Kentucky]]. His father did shoe repair and his mother was a drugstore clerk. Despite their own lack of education, his parents encouraged him to study from an early age. He attended primary school in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]] and graduated from [[Hopkinsville High School]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="StanfordThesis"/&gt; He served in the Army Air Forces as a [[cryptographer]] during [[World War II]], and began reading about human psychology at that time.&lt;ref name="WashPostObit"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Bernstein  | first = Adam  | title = Obituary: Psychology Expert Robert Baker; Unmasked Ghostly Apparitions  | pages = B05  | publisher = The Washington Post   | date = 12 August 2005  | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/11/AR2005081102036_pf.html  | accessdate = 4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker died of congestive heart failure on the 52nd anniversary of his marriage to Rose Paalz "Dolly" Baker, with whom he fathered six children.&lt;ref name="WashPostObit" /&gt;

==Academic career==
Baker graduated from the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1948 and later returned to receive a master's degree in psychology. He received a doctorate in psychology from [[Stanford University]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="StanfordThesis"&gt;{{Citation

  | title=Abstracts of Dissertations for the Degrees of Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Education
  | oclc=5010152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his PhD, he became a staff scientist at MIT's [[Lincoln Laboratory]], doing military research. In 1953 he joined the Human Resources Research Office at [[Fort Knox]], where he did human factors research relating to the Army.

He served on the faculty of [[Chico State College]] and [[Indiana University Southeast]] and was a staff psychologist for the Kentucky Department of Corrections.&lt;ref name="findagrave"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Dr Robert Allen Baker, Jr. (1921 - 2005)  | publisher = Find A Grave  | date = August 11, 2005  | url = https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11519683  | accessdate = 4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 he joined the faculty of the [[University of Kentucky]] in the psychology department. He was chairman of the psychology department for four years.&lt;ref name="WashPostObit"/&gt; Baker spent the last 20 years of his career here, until his retirement.

He served as president of the Kentucky Psychological Association and was a fellow of the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref name="kases"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Robert Baker 1921 - 2005  | publisher = Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics  | url = http://www.kases.org/baker.htm  | accessdate = 4 December 2008  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512073725/http://www.kases.org/baker.htm  | archivedate = 12 May 2008  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker was a critic of [[pseudoscience]] in the practice of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychotherapy]], and of the coercive nature of psychiatry. He wrote on this topic and allied himself with [[Thomas Szasz]] in his criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Baker | first=Robert A. |

accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 letter to Szasz, Baker metaphorically refereed to psychiatrists as "rapists wearing the mantle of science."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/313787993/Letter-to-Thomas-Szasz-from-psychologist-Robert-A-Baker&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as a skeptic==
His parents instilled skepticism in him from an early age. He was interested in ghosts as a child, but was disappointed to discover upon investigation that the noises emanating from a nearby "haunted cave" were actually natural in origin.&lt;ref name="WashPostObit"/&gt;

As a university psychologist, he sometimes encountered cases with a paranormal element.  He would do his best to find a non-paranormal explanation or resolution for these cases, and eventually gained a reputation as a "ghost buster".&lt;ref name="WashPostObit"/&gt;

When [[Joe Nickell]] was seeking an advanced degree at the University of Kentucky, the two met. They later worked together on several paranormal investigations and co-wrote a book on the topic. Nickell once said, "No one knew more about alien abductions than Robert Baker."&lt;ref name="kases"/&gt;

After retiring from the university in 1989, he devoted much of his time to [[anomalistic psychology]] and [[scientific skepticism]], writing several books on related topics including [[hypnosis]], [[ghost]]s, [[Abduction phenomenon|alien abductions]] and [[false memory syndrome]]. Baker wrote that many paranormal phenomena can be explained via psychological effects such as [[hallucination]]s, [[sleep paralysis]] and hidden memories, a phenomenon in which experiences that originally make little conscious impression are filed away in the brain to be suddenly remembered later in an altered form.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Robert A. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1573920940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an organizer with and served as president of the [[List of skeptics and skeptical organizations|Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics]].&lt;ref name="kases"/&gt;  He wrote numerous articles and book reviews for [[Skeptical Inquirer]] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Baker | first=Robert A. | title=How To Bust a Ghost | newspaper=Skeptical Inquirer | publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | issn=0194-6730 | volume=11 | issue=1 | date=Fall 1986 | pages=84–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Baker | first=Robert A. | title=The Aliens Among Us: [[Hypnotic regression|Hypnotic Regression]] Revisited | newspaper=Skeptical Inquirer | publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | issn=0194-6730 | volume=12 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987–1988 | pages=147–162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Baker |first=Robert A. |title=Can We Tell When Someone Is Staring at Us? |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-03/stare.html |newspaper=Skeptical Inquirer |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |issn=0194-6730 |volume=24 |issue=2 |date=March–April 2000 |pages=? |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119113056/http://csicop.org/si/2000-03/stare.html |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and CSI's Skeptical Briefs newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Baker |first=Robert A. |title=Have You Seen "The Light?" |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/9506/light.html |newspaper=Skeptical Briefs |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |issn=1060-216X |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=June 1995 |pages=? |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125182807/http://www.csicop.org/sb/9506/light.html |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Baker |first=Robert A. |title=A Skeptic's Notebook: Prayer Wars |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/9709/baker.html |newspaper=Skeptical Briefs |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |issn=1060-216X |volume=7 |issue=3 |date=September 1997 |pages=? |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210190407/http://www.csicop.org/sb/9709/baker.html |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Baker |first=Robert A. |title=The Case of the Missing Poltergeist |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/2000-06/poltergeist.html |newspaper=Skeptical Briefs |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |issn=1060-216X |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=June 2000 |pages=? |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007205459/http://www.csicop.org/sb/2000-06/poltergeist.html |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he was acknowledged when a panel of experts chose the outstanding skeptics of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors |title=The Ten Outstanding Skeptics of the 20th Century |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ten_outstanding_skeptics_of_the_twentieth_century |website=csicop.org |publisher=Skeptical Inquirer |accessdate=6 October 2018 |date=January–February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the executive council of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in April 2011, Baker was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics.  The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=31 January 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shootings and bombings ===
In the US, as of January 2018, since 1990, at least 240 [[school shooting]]s have occurred. It's over a 450% increase of the previous 30 years, in which there were only 53 [[List of school shootings in the United States|shootings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duplechain|first=Rosalind|last2=Morris|first2=Robert|date=Winter 2014|title=School Violence: Reported School Shootings and Making Schools Safer|url=|journal=Education|volume= 135|pages=145-150|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; School bombings are less frequent at 22 in 2016, but according to the [[U.S. Bomb Data Center|US Bomb Data Center]], education related buildings are over twice as threatened than any other target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atf.gov/explosives/docs/report/2016-explosives-incident-report/download|title=United States Bomb Data Center Explosive Incident Report|date=2016|work=ATF.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 74% of education related threats were middle schools, junior high, and high schools. Due to safety threats, during the 2013-2014 school year, reports say 93% of public schools lock or monitor doors and gates as a means of controlling access to the school;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=334|title=The NCES Fast Facts Tool provides quick answers to many education questions (National Center for Education Statistics)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is an 18% increase since the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Mike|date=June 2016|title=Stepping Up Security|url=|journal=American School &amp; University|volume= 88|pages=14-18|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal detectors are installed at many entrances of public schools to deter students from bringing weaponry into schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Government Gives Go-Ahead to Metal Detectors in Schools."

=== Vandalism ===
[[Vandalism]] is often a problem for schools as they are an easy target. What constitutes vandalism varies among reports, which makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the extent of vandalism. However, vandalism generally refers to damage to property (graffiti, etc.), and break-ins. The Center for Problem Oriented Policing categorizes break-ins as being of three types: nuisance break-ins, where a break-in is done just for the sake of it; professional break-ins, with an intent of theft; and malicious break-ins, where damage is caused out of spite.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Policing: Partnerships for Problem Solving|last=Miller|first=Linda S.|last2=Hess|first2=Karen M.|last3=Orthmann|first3=Christine M.H.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=1435488687|edition= 6th|location=|pages=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions for preventing vandalism include providing after-school and evening programs to engage youth that are loitering, improving lighting, adding security patrols, and education for students on anti-vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence in America's Schools: Understanding, Prevention, and Responses|last=Thomas|first=Robert Murray|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=0275993299|location=|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Policies on vandalism in New Zealand ====
''see [[Education in New Zealand]]''

The New Zealand government provides funding to public schools to repair vandalism. This funding comes from different sources depending on the type of damage that occurs. Two important guidelines regarding vandalism repair are that it must "be carried out immediately, and comply with Ministry standards."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.govt.nz/school/property/state-schools/funding/vandalism-funding/|title=Vandalism funding to repair school property|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2017|website=Education in New Zealand|language=en-NZ|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the U.S., 20.8% of students ages 12–18 experienced bullying at school in 2014-15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessne|first=Deborah|last2=Yanez|first2=Christina|date=December 2016|title=Student Reports of Bullying|url=|journal=National Center for Education Statistics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention for bullying by parents, teachers, and other adults includes talking to students about bullying, modeling good examples of treating others with kindness, and helping students get involved in something they're passionate about. Helping students understand the importance of reporting bullying and teaching them ways to stop others from bullying can also be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stopbullying.gov/prevention/index.html|title=How to Prevent Bullying|last=|first=|date=September 8, 2017|work=StopBullying.gov|access-date=2018-02-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the ages of 11-15, in most countries around the world, boys are bullied more than girls.  As reported by Young People's Health in Context, in Israel, almost twice as many boys ages 13–15 are bullied than girls; Belgium has a difference nearly as high. On average, bullying tends to peak at age 13. Lithuania experiences the highest level of bullying, with an average of 63.6% for girls between the ages of 11-15, and an average of 65% for boys between the ages of 11-15. Sweden experiences the lowest level of bullying, with an average of 14.7% for girls between 11-15, and an average of 15.3% for boys between 11-15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Wendy M.|last2=Harel|first2=Yossi|date=|title=Bullying, physical fighting and victimization|url=https://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/hbsc/books/2.pdf|journal=Young People's Health in Context|volume=|pages=138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security measures==
The [[National School Boards Association]] states that ensuring safety and security in schools is the primary responsibility of every school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsba.org/services/school-board-leadership-services/school-safety-and-security|title=School Safety, Security, and Emergency Preparedness {{!}} National School Boards Association|website=www.nsba.org|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School Resource Officers===
As we see a rise in gang and drug activity among other safety threats in our schools, there has been an increase in police presence on school campuses. In 2014 the National Center for Education Statistics reported that 43% of schools in the U.S. had [[School resource officer|School Resource Officers]] on their campuses anywhere from once a week to full-time hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2015/2015051.pdf|title=Public School Safety and Discipline 2013-14|last=Gray|first=Lucinda|last2=Lewis|first2=Laurie|date=May 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School Resource Officers, also known as S.R.O.s, are often responsible for teaching a gang-resistance program to students. Commonly referred to as [[Gang Resistance Education and Training|G.R.E.A.T.]], this program has been shown to be 39% effective at deterring at-risk youth from becoming involved in gangs or gang-related activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Brian|date=September 2015|title=Helping At-Risk Youth Say "No" to Gangs|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/248777.pdf|journal=National Institute of Justice|volume=|issue=275|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these S.R.O.s are accompanied by dogs that are fully trained in drug and bomb sniffing. Although this could be potentially helpful, especially in the drug culture among students, it is a highly controversial issue as some believe it may go against Fourth (and possibly Fifth) Amendment Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/Main-Menu/Public-education/The-law-and-its-influence-on-public-school-districts-An-overview/Search-and-seizure-due-process-and-public-schools.html|title=Search and seizure, due process, and public schools|last=Darden|first=Edwin C.|date=April 5, 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance===
Digital [[surveillance]] technology monitoring students, staff and visitors is currently being employed in schools around the world. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, by 2014 an average of 80% of secondary schools in the United States had installed security cameras. This was over 300% increase compared to the 19% of public educational facilities using video surveillance in 2000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Closed-circuit television]] (CCTV), the most common type of video monitoring system, is also reported to be prevalent in the United Kingdom and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Nemorin, Selena (2017) Post-panoptic pedagogies: the changing nature of school surveillance in the digital age. Surveillance and Society, 15 (2). pp. 239-253. ISSN 1477-7487&lt;/ref&gt; A possible 85-90% of secondary schools used CCTV in Britain, according to statistics claimed by [[Big Brother Watch]]. Cameras are also installed on buses to prevent violence, theft, illegal activity by students or drivers and as evidence against motorists who violate traffic laws regarding school buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/68189.htm|title=School Bus Safety is a Shared Responsibility|work=NEA|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new wave of technology, [[Computer security|cyber-security]] has also become a concern as schools try to balance advancement in students' technological skills with the possibilities for misuse of borrowed devices and breeches in school servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/01/18/19hacking.h25.html?qs=cyber+security+concerns+mount|title=Education news|last=Borja|first=Rhea R.|date=18 January 2006|work=Educaion Week|access-date=3 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification cards and badges ===
Student and faculty ID cards and/or badges are a possible way of improving school security. They allow school authorities to know immediately that the people carrying or wearing ID belong there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/11/27/student-technology-tracking/3757459/|title=Cards let schools, parents keep eye on their students|last=Brown|first=Jessica|date=November 27, 2013|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-02-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student ID cards can also help keep track of where students are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=School Board Discusses Student ID Cards|last=Ingram|first=Cinde|date=August 9, 2017|work=High Point Enterprise (NC)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking students through tracking chips has been controversial, however, due to concerns for privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2010/02/03/02id.h03.html|title=Education Week: Student ID Cards Sport New Digital Features|last=Ash|first=Katie|date=January 29, 2010|website=www.edweek.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification badges for visitors to schools can alleviate confusion about who someone unfamiliar is, and school authorities will easily be able to determine where the visitor is authorized to go.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Mike|date=October 2017|title=Enhancing School Security|url=|journal=American School and University|volume= 90| issue = 2|pages= 14–17|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; These visitor badges can also be a way to conduct background checks before the visitor enters a school campus.

====ID Cards in Poland====
{{main|Polish identity card}}

Students in schools abroad (outside of Poland) who are learning Polish language or academic subjects taught in Polish are eligible for Polish student ID cards. These cards provide benefits including transportation, museum, and national park discounts while visiting Poland. Students under age 18 can get one of these IDs, as well as teachers of Polish. They are valid for one school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newyork.mfa.gov.pl/en/news/student_id_cards_?printMode=true|title=Student ID cards|last=|first=|date=May 17, 2017|website=newyork.mfa.gov.pl|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School Security Fencing ===
Within the United Kingdom and around the globe one of the first line of school security measures is the application of a fencing system to control ingress and egress from the school grounds. Recently guidance by NaCTSO is that 'Screen from View' fencing should be adopted on school perimeters to combat the terrorist threat to schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crowded-places-guidance|title=Crowded places guidance|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UK, one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of School Security Fencing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cld-fencing.com/sectors/school-fencing/|title=School Fencing {{!}} Playground Fencing {{!}} CLD Fencing Systems|website=CLD Fencing|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is CLD Fencing Systems. For over 20 years their range of school fencing has provided protection for hundreds of thousands of pupils across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

OFSTED now includes the perimeter school fencing and physical access control as an area of review in the safeguarding of pupils on school grounds.

'''Urban Agricultural Architecture (UAA)''' is the practice of integrating [[Organic farming|organic]], [[hydroponic]], [[aeroponic]] or [[aquaponic]] [[Agricultural science|farming technologies]] into buildings of all types.  An example can be as small as building a lean-to-[[greenhouse]] on a single-family home and using it as a [[kitchen garden]].  Examples of large-scale projects are the hydroponic greenhouses of [[Lufa Farms]], the rooftop farms of [[Brooklyn Grange]] Rooftop Farm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.growingagreenerworld.com/episode322/&lt;/ref&gt; and the vertical farms of Sky Greens.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFQOkzEjxQ&lt;/ref&gt;  Building types that can incorporate food growing technologies include: single-family home, multi-family housing, mixed-use buildings, schools,&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/nyc/photos-fifth-street-farm-unveils-new-rooftop-farm-designed-by-michael-arad-at-the-east-village-earth-school/&lt;/ref&gt; restaurants,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/photo/rosemary-s-rooftop-farm-/218685.html&lt;/ref&gt; institutional buildings,&lt;ref&gt;http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/rooftop_farm.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; vertical farms, hoop houses and greenhouses that are designed to urban conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://popupcity.net/top-5-of-the-greatest-urban-rooftop-farms/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vertical Farm Video".

'''Vanhojentanssit''' or '''wanhojentanssit''' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ([[English language|English]]: "ball of the (new) seniors"), '''de äldstes dag''' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (English: "day of the (new) seniors"), is a formal [[prom]] held in [[Finland|Finnish]] upper secondary schools (''lukio'') during the second year. It is a celebration of when the second-year students (of the three-year lukio) become the seniors of the school. The prom is usually held the day after the third-year students (the seniors) stop attending school and start studying for their [[matriculation]] exams in February. The people attending the dances are called ''vanhat'' ("seniors"). Sometimes the first word is spelled with a ''w'' for a more archaic feel. 

After the ball, the students attend a dinner in the evening, which is sometimes in a very formal restaurant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">'''Žiburėlis''' ([[diminutive]] of ''žiburys'' meaning light, beacon) later '''Lietuvos žiburėlis''' was a charitable society providing financial aid to gifted [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] students. The society grew out of the [[Lithuanian National Revival]], hopes of creating Lithuanian [[intelligentsia]], and frustration over financial hardships faced by many young students.&lt;ref name=kati/&gt;&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; It was established in 1893 by [[Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė]] and Jadvyga Juškytė, and led by [[Felicija Bortkevičienė]] from 1903 until its dissolution in 1940.

==History==
It was established in 1893&lt;ref name=kati/&gt; by [[Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė]] and Jadvyga Juškytė with help from [[Vincas Kudirka]] and [[Jonas Jablonskis]].&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; The meeting took place in Jablonskis' home in Mitau ([[Jelgava]]); at the time he worked as a teacher at [[Jelgava Gymnasium]]. At the time it was an illegal organization as all Lithuanian organizations were banned after the [[Uprising of 1863]]. Petkevičaitė-Bitė was the driving force of the society; she was helped by many other wealthier women but their involvement was usually short.&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; The funds were raised by various means, including donations from the public and [[Lithuanian Americans]], card games among intellectuals, various events.&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; For example, the first public Lithuanian theater performance ''[[Amerika pirtyje]]'' in 1899 donated some of the proceeds to Žiburėlis.&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; In 1904, [[Povilas Višinskis]] suggested to publish and sell postcards.&lt;ref name=striog/&gt; Up to 1900, the society distributed 3,258 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (1,629 U.S. dollars).&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; By 1906, the amount grew to almost 8,000 rubles.&lt;ref name=kati/&gt;

In 1903, [[Felicija Bortkevičienė]] took over the society and headed it until its dissolution in 1940.&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; The death of Višinskis from [[tuberculosis]] that he had contracted as a student at the [[Saint Petersburg University]] became an impulse to legalize and expand the society.&lt;ref name=striog/&gt; The society legalized its activities and became an officially registered organization on 14 January 1907.&lt;ref name=kati/&gt; After Lithuania became independent, Žiburėlis grew and strengthened. It collected funds from membership fees, donations, proceeds from various events, including lotteries and concerts.&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; After graduation, former aid recipients repaid their support.&lt;ref name=kati/&gt; In 1921, it established a 30-room dormitory in [[Kaunas]].&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; The society had sections in other cities, including [[Šiauliai]], [[Ukmergė]], [[Panevėžys]]. The society ceased to exist when [[Occupation of Lithuania by Soviet Union 1940|Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt;

==Supported students==
During its existence the society supported some 300 gifted students&lt;ref name=kati/&gt; many of whom who later became prominent figures in Lithuania, including forester Povilas Matulionis, writer [[Jonas Biliūnas]], painter and composer [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis]], jurist [[Rapolas Skipitis]], diplomat [[Jurgis Šaulys]], doctor [[Petras Avižonis]], linguist [[Kazimieras Būga]], operatic tenor [[Kipras Petrauskas]], painter [[Adomas Varnas]], sculptor [[Petras Rimša]], sculptor [[Juozas Zikaras]], priest Antanas Viskantas,&lt;ref name=lapi/&gt; Prime Minister [[Ernestas Galvanauskas]], Soviet revolutionary [[Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas]], writers [[Julius Janonis]]&lt;ref name=kati/&gt; and [[Jonas Biliūnas]].&lt;ref name=striog/&gt;
