      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1363">The '''Aargletschers''', literally "Aare-Glaciers", are a system of [[glacier]]s located at the sources of the [[Aare]] river in the [[Bernese Alps]], [[Switzerland]]. The original name has no plural-"s", as in German the plural of "gletscher" is only marked by changes of the [[article (grammar)|article]]. The Aargletschers are constituted by two distinct partial glacier systems:
*[[Unteraargletscher]]: composed by the converging ''Lauteraargletscher'' and ''Finsteraargletscher'', between the [[Lauteraarhorn]], [[Finsteraarhorn]] &lt;small&gt;({{coord|46|32|14.9|N|08|07|33.7|E}})&lt;/small&gt; and [[Grimselsee]] &lt;small&gt;({{coord|46|34|11|N|08|19|39|E}})&lt;/small&gt;.
*[[Oberaargletscher]]: between [[Oberaarhorn]] &lt;small&gt;({{coord|46|31|53|N|08|10|28|E}})&lt;/small&gt; and [[Oberaarsee]] &lt;small&gt;({{coord|46|33|N|08|16|E}})&lt;/small&gt;.
Grimselsee and Oberaarsee are recent reserve lakes. The "...-Aar-Horns" are summits of more than 3600 metres above sea level, two of them even above 4000 metres.

Most [[organic compounds]] have [[plane (geometry)|planar]] structures and higher [[photoemission]] efficiencies in [[solution (chemistry)|solution]] than in the [[solid (state of matter)|solid]] state. However, some organic luminophores have freely-rotating groups that consume [[energy]] and promote radiation-less decay after they are excited in solution. When these luminophores aggregate or [[crystallization|crystallize]] and the free rotation of those groups is restricted in the solid-state, the photoluminescence efficiency (i.e. quantum yield) becomes higher than in the solution phase.

==Aggregation-induced emission enhancement==
The phenomenon in which organic luminophores show higher photoluminescence efficiency in the aggregated state than in solution is called aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE). Some luminophores, e.g., [[Diketopyrrolopyrrole dye|diketopyrrolopyrrole]]-based and [[sulfonamide]]-based luminophores, only display enhanced emission upon entering the crystalline state. That is, these luminophores are said to exhibit crystallization-induced emission enhancement (CIEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Yi|last2=Xu|first2=Yanbin|last3=Liu|first3=Yinling|last4=Wang|first4=Lingyun|last5=Jiang|first5=Huanfeng|last6=Xianjie|first6=Li|last7=Cao|first7=Derong|title=Synthesis of novel diketopyrrolopyrrole-based luminophores showing crystallization-induced emission enhancement properties|journal=Dyes and Pigments|date=2011|volume=90|pages=311–318|doi=10.1016/j.dyepig.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Virk|first1=Tarunpreet Singh|last2=Ilawe|first2=Niranjan V.|last3=Zhang|first3=Guoxian|last4=Yu|first4=Craig P.|last5=Wong|first5=Bryan M.|last6=Chan|first6=Julian M.

'''Agrology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀγρός|ἀγρός]]}}, ''agros'', "field, tilled land"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the branch of [[soil science]] dealing with the production of crops.  The use of the term is most active in [[Canada]].  Use of the term outside Canada is sporadic but significant. The term appears especially well established in [[Russia]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]], with agrologists on university faculty lists and agrology curricula.

Agrology is synonymous with [[agricultural science]] when used in [[Canada]], is nearly synonymous with the U.S. term ''[[agronomy]]'', and has a meaning related to [[agricultural soil science]] when used outside Canada.

==Canada==

The term '''agrologist''' was coined by Dr. J. B. Harrington and adopted in 1946 to fill the need in Canada to have a term to denote "provincial agriculturalist". The title of [[Professional Agrologist]] is conferred on persons with at least a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in [[Agriculture]] and who can demonstrate the qualities needed to responsibly teach, practise, or conduct [[experiment]]s and [[research]] in the agricultural sciences.  According to the [[Agricultural Institute of Canada]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070712121831/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/dictionaries/difficultwords/data/d0000482.html website], an agrologist can also hold a degree in a field related to agriculture, or in some provinces pass rigorous prescribed examinations to attain a professional designation. There are about 5000 agrologists in Canada {{As of|2004|lc=on}}.

Agrology designations are managed by separate governing bodies in each province, with each operating under its own legislation.  For example, within [[British Columbia]] the term "agrology" is defined by an Act of the Legislature passed in 2003 and adopted in 2004 entitled the Agrologists Act. This Act authorizes the self-governing body, the British Columbia Institute of Agrologists and those practising agrology within British Columbia do so under the following definition.

"Agrology" means using agricultural and natural sciences and agricultural and resource economics, including collecting or analyzing data or carrying out research or assessments, to design, evaluate, advise on, direct or otherwise provide professional support to

(a) the cultivation, production, improvement, processing or marketing of aquatic or terrestrial plants or animals, or

(b) the classification, management, use, conservation, protection, restoration, reclamation or enhancement of aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems that are affected by, sustain, or have the potential to sustain the cultivation or production of aquatic or terrestrial plants or animals;

BCIA, the governing body for Agrologists in British Columbia, has over 1000 registered members.

The Registrars of Professional Agrologists across Canada adopted the following definition of Agrology in May 2007.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Agrology is the practice of bioresource sciences to provide knowledge and advice to support the development of the agriculture sector and the health of the society, environment, and economy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Outside Canada==

Outside of Canada, the term agrology is synonymous with [[soil science]] and is not in common usage in English-speaking countries.

===Agrology in soil science society glossaries===

Two national member societies (Canadian, American) of the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] (IUSS) maintain and publish glossaries of scientific terms.  Other soil science societies defer to the American glossary. The term agrology is not in use. [[Edaphology]] or crop edaphology in combination with [[soil management]] would be the preferred approach used by soil scientists to concisely describe soil science as it applies to crop production.

===Agrology dictionary definitions===
{{As of|2004}}, no [[dictionary]] definition of agrology is yet consistent with the Canadian use of the term and dictionary definitions fall into one of four categories.
# agrology is defined as synonymous with soil science.  The root agr- is represented as meaning soil.
# agrology is defined as synonymous with soil science, but the context implies that soil science is a subdiscipline of [[agricultural science]].
# agrology is defined as the subdiscipline of soil science as it applies to crop production.  This would make agrology synonymous with the term crop edaphology.
# agrology is defined as the subdiscipline of agronomy that considers the influence of soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1685">'''Belgian marble''' is the name given to [[limestone]] extracted in [[Wallonia]], southern [[Belgium]]. 

It is quarried around the cities of Namur, Dinant, Tournai, Basecles, Theux, and Mazy/Golzinne. &lt;ref name=noirbelge&gt;[http://www.noirbelge.com/themarble01.html Noirbelge.com: Belgian Marble −  history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rock is actually not a true [[marble]] (a [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] rock), but a type of [[limestone]] (a calcareous [[sedimentary rock]]).

Belgian marbles are available in solid dark greys or blacks; and in polychroms of red, grey, and/or pink. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graniteland.com/stone/country/belgium  Graniteland.com: Types of stone from Belgium]&lt;/ref&gt; After polishing slabs with several colors exhibit natural decorative patterns. 

===Named selections===
Named Belgian marbles include:
*[[Rouge Belge]]: including [[Rouge de Rance]], Rouge Royal.
*[[Noir Belge]]: including [[Noir de Golzinne]], [[Noir de Mazy]].

==History==
Belgian marble has been quarried, cut, and finished as a [[Dimension stone|building stone]], [[stone cladding]], and [[stone veneer]] since the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman era]], in [[Roman Gaul]] and Rome, such as in the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]].&lt;ref name=noirbelge/&gt;  It has been used in important European religious and secular buildings since the [[Renaissance]], including the [[Palazzo Pitti]] and [[Palace of Versailles]]. &lt;ref name=noirbelge/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2319">In [[astrophysics]], the '''Biermann battery''' is a process by which a weak seed [[magnetic field]] can be generated from zero initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2008ApJ...688L..57X|title=The Biermann Battery in Cosmological MHD Simulations of Population III Star Formation|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=688|issue=2|pages=L57|author1=Xu|first1=Hao|last2=O'Shea|first2=Brian W.|last3=Collins|first3=David C.|last4=Norman|first4=Michael L.|last5=Li|first5=Hui|last6=Li|first6=Shengtai|year=2008|doi=10.1086/595617|arxiv = 0807.2647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative motion between [[electron]]s and [[ion]]s is driven by rotation. The process was discovered by [[Ludwig Biermann]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Uber den Ursprung der Magnetfelder auf Sternen und im interstellaren Raum (mit einem Anhang von A. Schluter)|journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung|volume=5|pages=65|author1=Biermann|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1998MNRAS.295L...6K|title=Generation of magnetic fields by a gravitomagnetic plasma battery|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=295|pages=L6|author1=Khanna|first1=Ramon|year=1998|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.29511447.x|arxiv = astro-ph/9803240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple derivation of the effect starts with the momentum equation for the free electron fluid, keeping only the [[electric field]] and pressure force:

&lt;math&gt;m_e{d\vec v_e \over dt}=-e\vec E-{\nabla p_e \over n_e}&lt;/math&gt;.

For phenomena on sufficiently slow time scales, the left-hand side of the above equation can be neglected. That leads to the [[Ohm's law]] for the electric field:

&lt;math&gt;\vec E=-{\nabla p_e \over en_e}&lt;/math&gt;.

The other terms in the general Ohm's law are neglected here since they typically vanish for zero magnetic field and do not spontaneously generate field. Inserting the above electric field into [[Faraday's law of induction]] gives an equation for the magnetic field:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \vec B \over \partial t}={1\over en_e}\nabla T_e \times\nabla n_e&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that magnetic fields develop "spontaneously", that is, from initially being zero, when there are non-parallel gradients in electron temperature and density.

'''Charles Jules Edmée Brongniart''' (11 February 1859, in Paris – 18 April 1899, in Paris) was a French [[entomologist]] and [[paleontologist]].

A pioneer in the field of [[paleoentomology]], he made important contributions towards the understanding of [[insect evolution]]. He is remembered for his studies of [[Late Carboniferous]] fauna found at [[Commentry]], France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odQmAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT346 Google Books] Evolution of the Insects by David Grimaldi&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43619">Diagnoses of [[autism]] have become more frequent since the 1980s, which has led to various controversies about both the cause of autism and the nature of the diagnoses themselves. Whether autism has mainly a [[heritability of autism|genetic or developmental cause]], and the degree of coincidence between autism and [[intellectual disability]], are all matters of current [[scientific controversy]] as well as inquiry.

[[Scientific consensus]] holds that [[vaccines]] do not cause autism, but popular rumors and an article in a respected scientific journal, ''[[The Lancet]]'', provoked concern among parents. The ''Lancet'' article was retracted for making false claims and because its author was found to be on the payroll of litigants against vaccine manufacturers.&lt;ref name=retraction/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
{{Main|Epidemiology of autism}}

Most recent reviews of [[epidemiology]] estimate a [[prevalence]] of one to two cases per 1,000 people for [[autism]], and about six per 1,000 for ASD;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newschaffer CJ, Croen LA, Daniels J, Giarelli E, Grether JK, Levy SE, Mandell DS, Miller LA, Pinto-Martin J, Reaven J, Reynolds AM, Rice CE, Schendel D, Windham GC | title = The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Annual Review of Public Health | volume = 28 | pages = 235–58 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17367287 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144007 | url = http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf | author. =  | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130903024137/http://idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2632/1/2006175339.pdf | df =  | archive-date = 2013-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate the true prevalence of [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD).&lt;ref name=Caronna&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caronna EB, Milunsky JM, Tager-Flusberg H | title = Autism spectrum disorders: clinical and research frontiers | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 518–23 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18305076 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2006.115337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASD averages a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio. The number of children on the autism spectrum has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; it is unclear whether prevalence has actually increased;&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt; and as-yet-unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref name=Rutter&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutter M | title = Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning | journal = Acta Paediatrica | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–15 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15858952 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x | authorlink = Professor Sir Michael Rutter }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of autism is associated with several prenatal factors, including advanced parental age and diabetes in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Gardener&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL | title = Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–14 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19567888 | pmc = 3712619 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ASD is associated with several [[genetic disorder]]s&lt;ref name=Zafeiriou&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E | title = Childhood autism and associated comorbidities | journal = Brain &amp; Development | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–72 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17084999 | doi = 10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and epilepsy.&lt;ref name=Levisohn&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levisohn PM | title = The autism-epilepsy connection | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 48 Suppl 9 | issue = Suppl 9 | pages = 33–5 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18047599 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01399.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism is also associated with [[intellectual disability]].&lt;ref name=Chakrabarti&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E | title = Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children | journal = Jama | volume = 285 | issue = 24 | pages = 3093–9 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11427137 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
{{details|Heritability of autism}}
The role of genetic influence on ASD has been heavily researched over the past few years. ASD is considered to have polygenic traits since there is not a single risk factor, but multiple ones.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson EB, Neale BM, Hyman SE | title = Genetic research in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Current Opinion in Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 685–91 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26371945 | pmc = 4650984 | doi = 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple twin and family studies have been conducted in order to observe any genetic influence in diagnosing ASD. The chance of both twins having ASD was significantly higher in identical twins than fraternal twins, concluding that ASD is heritable.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bourgeron T | title = Current knowledge on the genetics of autism and propositions for future research | journal = Comptes Rendus Biologies | volume = 339 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 300–7 | date = 2016-07-01 | pmid = 27289453 | doi = 10.1016/j.crvi.2016.05.004 | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069116300415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A reoccurring finding is that ''de novo'' (new mutation) [[Copy-number variation|copy number variants]] are a primary cause of ASD - they alter synaptic functions; [[Germline mutation|germ line mutations]] can produce ''de novo'' CNVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ronemus M, Iossifov I, Levy D, Wigler M | title = The role of de novo mutations in the genetics of autism spectrum disorders | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–41 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24430941 | doi = 10.1038/nrg3585 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3585 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mutations can only be passed on to offspring; this explains the phenomenon that occurs when the child has symptoms of ASD, but the parents have no symptoms or history of ASD. ''De novo'' variants differ from person to person i.e one variant can cause ASD in one person, whereas another person would need multiple variants to cause the same disorder.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Loss of function variants occur in 16-18% of ASD diagnoses, which is nearly double the normal population.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These loss of function variants reduce function in the protein [[neurexin]], which connects neurons at the synapse and is important for neurological development; [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion mutations]] of neurexin are also very common in people with autism, as well as other neurological disorders like [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen J, Yu S, Fu Y, Li X | title = Synaptic proteins and receptors defects in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 8 | pages = 276 | date = 2014-09-11 | pmid = 25309321 | pmc = 4161164 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gut [[Microbiota|microbiome]] has a relation to ASD. Excessive ''Clostridia'' spp. was found in children with ASD and gastrointestinal difficulties; ''Clostridia'' spp produces propionic acid which is impaired or in excess in people with ASD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frye RE, Rose S, Slattery J, MacFabe DF | title = Gastrointestinal dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder: the role of the mitochondria and the enteric microbiome | journal = Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease | volume = 26 | issue = 0 | pages = 27458 | date = 2015-05-07 | pmid = 25956238 | pmc = 4425813 | doi = 10.3402/mehd.v26.27458 | url = https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Ftoc%2Fzmeh20%2Fcurrent }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, ''C. tetani'' and ''C. histolyticum'' are two species of this bacteria that affect people with ASD. ''C. tetani'' produces tetanus neurotoxin in the intestinal tract; ''C. histolyticum'' is a toxin producer that is abundant in people diagnosed with ASD.&lt;ref name="pmid28503135"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Q, Han Y, Dy AB, Hagerman RJ | title = The Gut Microbiota and Autism Spectrum Disorders | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue =  | pages = 120 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28503135 | pmc = 5408485 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2017.00120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these could contribute to neurological symptoms.

There is also controversy over the [[Nature versus nurture|Nature vs. Nurture]] debate. According to family studies, genetic and environmental factors have an equal influence on risk of ASD.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Vaccines==
Several false claims have been made with regard to [[autism]] and [[vaccinations]], leading notably to the [[MMR vaccine controversy]], the [[thiomersal controversy]], and the theory of [[vaccine overload]]. A 2011 journal article described the MMR-autism connection as "the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years".&lt;ref name=Klaherty&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flaherty DK | title = The vaccine-autism connection: a public health crisis caused by unethical medical practices and fraudulent science | journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 45 | issue = 10 | pages = 1302–4 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21917556 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1Q318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thimerosal===
{{Main|Thiomersal controversy}}

In 1999, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove the [[organomercury]] compound [[thiomersal]] (spelled "thimerosal" in the U.S.) from vaccines as quickly as possible, and thiomersal has been phased out of U.S. and European vaccines, except for some preparations of [[influenza vaccine]], [[meningococcal vaccine]], and trace amounts in the [[tetanus vaccine|tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://vaccinesafety.edu/thi-table.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Offit"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Offit PA | title = Thimerosal and vaccines--a cautionary tale | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 13 | pages = 1278–9 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17898096 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp078187 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1278 | authorlink = Paul Offit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997, the FDA conducted a comprehensive review of the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines.

=== Vaccine overload ===

{{details|Vaccine controversy#Vaccine overload}}

Following the belief that individual vaccines caused autism was the idea of vaccine overload, which claims that too many vaccines at once may overwhelm or weaken a child's immune system and lead to adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Hilton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K | title = 'Combined vaccines are like a sudden onslaught to the body's immune system': parental concerns about vaccine 'overload' and 'immune-vulnerability' | journal = Vaccine | volume = 24 | issue = 20 | pages = 4321–7 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16581162 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaccine overload became popular after the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program accepted the case of nine year old [[Jon Poling|Hannah Poling]]. Hannah had encephalopathy putting her on the autism spectrum disorder, which was believed to have worsened after getting multiple vaccines at nineteen months old.&lt;ref name="Gerber" /&gt; There have been multiple cases reported similar to this one, which led to the belief that vaccine overload caused autism. However, scientific studies show that vaccines do not overwhelm the immune system.&lt;ref name="Gerber" /&gt; In fact, conservative estimates predict that the immune system can respond to thousands of viruses simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Gerber" /&gt; It is known that vaccines constitute only a tiny fraction of the pathogens already naturally encountered by a child in a typical year.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Common fevers and middle ear infections pose a much greater challenge to the immune system than vaccines do.&lt;ref&gt;Immune challenges:

==Intelligence==

The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Learning in autism |vauthors=Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title= Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor= Byrne JH (-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol.) |publisher= Academic Press |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=0-12-370504-5 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |access-date=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[PDD-NOS]] the association with intellectual disability is much weaker.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti"/&gt; The diagnosis of Asperger's excludes clinically significant delays in mental or cognitive skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study suggested that [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] (RPM), a test of abstract reasoning, may be a better indicator of intelligence for autistic children than the more commonly used [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC). Researchers suspected that the WISC relied too heavily on language to be an accurate measure of intelligence for autistic individuals. Their study revealed that the neurotypical children scored similarly on both tests, but the autistic children fared far better on the RPM than on the WISC. The RPM measures abstract, general and fluid reasoning, an ability autistic individuals have been presumed to lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawson M, Soulières I, Gernsbacher MA, Mottron L | title = The level and nature of autistic intelligence | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 657–62 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17680932 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01954.x | laysummary = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070803151245.htm | laydate = 2007-08-05 | laysource = ScienceDaily }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found a similar effect, but to a much lesser degree and only for individuals with IQs less than 85 on the Wechsler scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bölte S, Dziobek I, Poustka F | title = Brief report: The level and nature of autistic intelligence revisited | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 678–82 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19052857 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0667-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilitated Communication ==
{{Further|Facilitated communication}}
Facilitated communication gained immediate attention and was used by many hopeful parents of individuals with autism when it was first introduced during the early 1990s by [[Douglas Biklen]], a professor at Syracuse University.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soe.syr.edu/centers_institutes/institute_communication_inclusion/default.aspx|title=Institute on Communication and Inclusion |date=|website=Syracuse University School of Education|access-date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, controversies shortly arose after several reports of sexual abuse were made by individuals using the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stock|first=Barbara | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011-10-25|title=Mixed Messages: Validity and Ethics of Facilitated Communication|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/1725|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|issn=2159-8371}}&lt;/ref&gt; There became a heightened concern regarding who was actually typing the messages – the individual with autism or the facilitator?

Similar studies were conducted starting in 1993 that argued facilitated communication was an ineffective technique. One reason was that autistic individuals were not able to communicate any better than they would have independently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bebko JM, Perry A, Bryson S | title = Multiple method validation study of facilitated communication: II. Individual differences and subgroup results | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–42 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8819769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was because facilitators’ seemed to have an influence on the messages being typed by individuals with autism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1994, the American Psychological Association officially announced that there was “no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx|title=Facilitated Communication: Sifting the Psychological Wheat from the Chaff |date=November 20, 2003|website=American Psychological Association|language=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120060710/http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study done in 2014 examined the role of facilitators in eleven cases where children have been using facilitated communication for more than one year. They agreed that facilitated communication was not valid because the children with autism performed better on test questions only when the facilitator was also aware of the questions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saloviita T, Leppänen M, Ojalammi U | title = Authorship in facilitated communication: an analysis of 11 cases | journal = Augmentative and Alternative Communication | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 213–25 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24946681 | doi = 10.3109/07434618.2014.927529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the facilitator did not know the test questions or the keyboard was out of sight, those with autism were not able to answer the questions either, suggesting that facilitators unconsciously play a role in the messages being typed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Much of the empirical research done during the early 1990s up to now argue that facilitated communication is an invalid alternative treatment to autism.

Despite what the scientific community claims, there are still many people using facilitated communication. In fact, Syracuse University still offers a program called Institute on Communication and Inclusion that trains facilitators to use this technique, what they now call supported typing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They claim that new methods such as video-eye tracking, linguistics analysis, evidence of speech before and during typing, and message passing have demonstrated that it is the individual with autism doing the typing, not the facilitator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A study done in 2014 stated that the changes made to facilitated communication since its introduction, such as the use of multiple facilitators for one individual, has made this technique more valid such that some individuals with autism have been able to type with zero support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Donald N. | last1 = Cardinal | first2 = Mary A. | last2 = Falvey |  name-list-format = vanc |date=2014|title=The Maturing of Facilitated Communication: A Means Toward Independent Communication|url=|journal=Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities Journal|volume=39|pages=189–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Autism National Committee announced a position statement that approves the use of facilitated communication as it “has already proven to be profoundly beneficial in the lives of many people by opening the doors to reliable, trusted, and respected symbolic communication for the first time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autcom.org/|title=The Autism National Committee |website=www.autcom.org|access-date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: (1) the mainstream perspective that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s) and (2) the perspective that autism is caused by environmental factors like vaccines and pollution and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

===Anti-cure perspective===
"Curing" or "treating" autism is a [[Ethical challenges to autism treatment|controversial]] and politicized issue. Doctors and scientists are not sure of the [[causes of autism|cause(s) of autism]] yet many organizations like [[Autism Research Institute]] and [[Autism Speaks]] advocate researching a cure. Members of the various autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.&lt;ref name=Harmon&gt;Harmon, Amy. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', May 9, 2004.

The ''"anti-cure perspective"'' endorsed by the movement is a view that [[autism spectrum|autism]] is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt; Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Gal L |title=Who says autism's a disease? |work=Haaretz |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html |access-date=2007-07-16| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701201936/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html| archive-date= 1 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html |title=In Support of Michelle Dawson and Her Work |publisher=Autistics.org |access-date=2012-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215181832/http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html |archive-date=2012-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARM is a part of the larger disability rights movement, and as such acknowledges the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Waltz M |title=Autism: A Social and Medical History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=0-230-52750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the model, struggles faced by autistic people are viewed as discrimination rather than deficiencies.

[[John Elder Robison]] was a discussant for the Autism Social, Legal, and Ethical Research Special Interest Group at the 2014 International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR). He ended up taking the group to task, stating that the autism science community is headed for disaster if it does not change course on several factors – and noting for context the larger size of the US autistic community in proportion to other minority groups such as Jewish or Native American communities.

Robison asserted that autistic people need to be the ones providing oversight and governance for autism research. He condemned the use of words like "cure". He pointed out that researchers' explicit or implicit efforts to eradicate autistic people are a formula for disaster and need to stop. He also affirmed that memoirs and narratives written by autistic people are more trustworthy than writing about autism by nonautistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2014/05/john-robison-at-imfar-on-autism-rights.html John Robison at IMFAR: On Autism Rights, Ethics, &amp; Priorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 2013 fifth revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) has more specificity, it also has reports of more limited sensitivity. Due to the changes to the DSM and the lessening of sensitivity, there is the possibility that individuals who were diagnosed with [[autistic spectrum]] disorders (ASD) using the fourth revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) will not receive the same diagnosis with the DSM-5.

From the 933 individuals that were evaluated, 39 percent of the samples that were diagnosed with an ASD using the DSM-IV-TR criteria did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for that disorder.{{MEDRS|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barton ML, Robins DL, Jashar D, Brennan L, Fein D | title = Sensitivity and specificity of proposed DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder in toddlers | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 1184–95 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23543293 | pmc = 3684196 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-013-1817-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the DSM-5 criteria no longer classified them with having ASD, deeming them without a diagnosis. It was likely that individuals that exhibited higher cognitive functioning and had other disorders, such as Asperger's or [[pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS), were completely excluded from the criteria. Also, it is more probable that younger children who do not exhibit the entirety of the symptoms and characteristics of ASD are more at risk of being excluded by the new criteria since they could have Asperger's as Asperger's disorder does not usually show symptoms until later in childhood. Because the onset age is different in Asperger's from autism, grouping together the disorders does not typically allow or distinguish the differentiating ages of onset, which is problematic in diagnosing. It is evident, through the various studies, that the amount of people being diagnosed will be significantly diminished as well, which is prominently due to the DSM-5's new criteria.&lt;ref name=Barton/&gt;

'''Damer''' is a [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] at latitude 36.36 N, longitude 115.81 W and is inside the [[Shakespeare quadrangle]]. It is 60&amp;nbsp;km wide and was named after the English sculptor [[Anne Seymour Damer]], and the name was approved on June 18, 2013 by the IAU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature (USGS)|title=Damer|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15139|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damer is located east of the ray crater [[Degas (crater)|Degas]] and west of [[Gibran (crater)|Gibran]], NNE is the [[Whitman (crater)|crater Whitman]]. Rays from the [[Degas (crater)|Degas]] protrude into the northernmost rim and north of the crater. The crater features a circular central peak with a hollow in the middle.

'''Dapeng dialect''' ({{zh|t=大鵬話|s=大鹏话}}) is a Chinese dialect, a variant of [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] with a strong [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] influence that was originally only spoken on the [[Dapeng Peninsula]] of [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]], [[China]]. The [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]] has spread the dialect to places with large populations whose ancestral roots are originally from Dapeng, Shenzhen, Guangdong. Today, their descendants living in [[Hong Kong]], as well among [[overseas Chinese]] living in the [[Randstad]] region of [[The Netherlands]], [[Portsmouth]], [[UK]] and [[New York City]], [[United States]] have a lot of Dapeng dialect speakers.

The dialect is a form of junhua, created as a [[lingua franca]] by soldiers at the [[Dapeng Fortress]], who spoke various forms of [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]].&lt;ref name="chen"/&gt; Despite strong influence from Hakka, some, including Lau Chun-Fat, have classified it as a Guan–Bao dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Chun-Fat|last2=Zhou|first2=Jiafan|date=February 2017|title=Looking at the Effects of Language Contact With Hakka as Reflected by the Characteristics of the Pingshan Zhanmi Dialect in Shenzhen|journal=Journal of Literature and Art Studies|volume=7|issue=2|pages=186–194|url=https://www.davidpublisher.com/Public/uploads/Contribute/586c50b0c9e78.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries''''' is a 2007 [[popular science]] book written by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]]. It is an [[anthology]] of several of Tyson's most popular articles, and was featured in an episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Daily Show with Jon Stewart {{!}} Neil deGrasse Tyson|url = http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2007/01/30/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart|website = www.haydenplanetarium.org|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Death by Black Hole {{!}} Big Think|url = http://bigthink.com/big-think-tv/death-by-black-hole|website = Big Think|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''Death by Black Hole'' is divided into seven sections: The Nature of Knowledge, The Knowledge of Nature, Ways and Means of Nature, The Meaning of Life, When the Universe Turns Bad, Science and Culture, and Science and God.

Section 1 comprises five chapters:
* Chapter 1, "Coming to Our Senses", discusses how important the augmentation of our five basic senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch) is for expanding scientific knowledge.  Tools that convert (seemingly) latent aspects of our environment into quantities we can sense greatly ease scientific discovery.  For example, [[night vision]] goggles convert the near-infrared spectrum into the [[visible spectrum]], making it easier for biologists to observe nocturnal animal behavior.
* Chapter 2, "On Earth as in the Heavens", addresses the history of physics and how it came to be known that physical laws observed on Earth are also observed on the sun and the other planets.  In short, how physics became a study of the universal rather than just the terrestrial.
* Chapter 3, "Seeing Isn't Believing", hints at the pitfalls of generalizing from too little evidence.  It begins by making the point that although we know the Earth is round, it appears flat when one observes only a small, local portion of it.
* Chapter 4, "The Information Trap", observes that we can view our surroundings at many different scales, and may find different phenomena at different scales.  For instance, on a [[macroscopic scale]] classical mechanics describes the physical behaviors we observe, while on a smaller scale, [[quantum mechanics]] comes into play.
*Chapter 5, "Stick-in-the-Mud Science", guides the reader through a series of experiments based primarily on watching how the shadow of a stick, stuck upright in the earth, changes as time passes.  For example, one can observe that, in the northern hemisphere, over the course of a day, the shadow of the stick will trace out a semi-circle as it moves clockwise.

[[Image:Dichroicclose.jpg|thumb|right|[[lampworking|Lampworked]] [[dichroic glass]] bead]]
In [[optics]], a '''dichroic''' material is either one which causes [[visible light]] to be split up into distinct beams of different [[wavelength]]s ([[colour]]s) (not to be confused with [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]), ''or'' one in which light rays having different [[Polarization (waves)|polarizations]] are absorbed by different amounts.&lt;ref&gt;''University Physics'' 6th ed. F.W. Sears, M.W. Zemansky, H.D. Young, {{ISBN|0-201-07199-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In beam splitters==
{{Main|Beam splitter}}
The original meaning of ''dichroic'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''dikhroos'', two-coloured, refers to any optical device which can split a beam of light into two beams with differing wavelengths. Such devices include [[mirror]]s and [[dichroic filter|filter]]s, usually treated with [[optical coating]]s, which are designed to reflect light over a certain range of wavelengths, and transmit light which is outside that range. An example is the [[dichroic prism]], used in some [[camcorder]]s, which uses several coatings to split light into red, green and blue components for recording on separate [[charge-coupled device|CCD arrays]], however it is now more common to have a [[Bayer filter]] to filter individual pixels on a single [[charge-coupled device|CCD array]]. This kind of dichroic device does not usually depend on the polarization of the light. The term ''dichromatic'' is also used in this sense.

==With polarized light==
{{Main|Linear dichroism|Circular dichroism}}
The second meaning of ''dichroic'' refers to the property of a material in which light in different polarization states traveling through it experiences a different [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] coefficient; this is also known as '''diattenuation.''' When the polarization states in question are right and left-handed [[circular polarization]], it is then known as [[circular dichroism]]. Since the left- and right-handed circular polarizations represent two [[spin angular momentum of light|spin angular momentum]] (SAM) states, in this case for a photon, this dichroism can also be thought of as Spin Angular Momentum Dichroism.

In some [[crystal]]s,{{which|date=August 2016}} the strength of the dichroic effect varies strongly with the wavelength of the light, making them appear to have different colours when viewed with light having differing polarizations.{{dubious|date=July 2014}} This is more generally referred to as [[pleochroism]],&lt;ref name="Schumann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Schumann|title=Gemstones of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9PqVxpxeiEC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=[[Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.]]|isbn=978-1-4027-6829-3|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the technique can be used in [[mineralogy]] to identify [[mineral]]s. In some materials, such as [[herapathite]] (iodoquinine sulfate) or [[Polaroid (polarizer)|Polaroid]] sheets, the effect is not strongly dependent on wavelength.

===In liquid crystals===
Dichroism, in the second meaning above, occurs in [[liquid crystals]] due to either the [[optical anisotropy]] of the molecular structure or the presence of impurities or the presence of '''dichroic dyes'''.  The latter is also called a ''[[guest–host effect]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Flat Panel Displays: Advanced Organic Materials | author = Stephen M.

The '''E-belt asteroids''' were the population of a hypothetical extension of the primordial [[asteroid belt]] proposed as the source of most of the basin-forming [[Moon|lunar]] [[impact event|impacts]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]].&lt;ref name=Bottke2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bottke|first=William F.|author2=Vokrouhlický, David |author3=Minton, David |author4=Nesvorný, David |author5=Morbidelli, Alessandro |author6=Brasser, Ramon |author7=Simonson, Bruce |author8= Levison, Harold F. |title=An Archaean heavy bombardment from a destabilized extension of the asteroid belt|journal=Nature|year=2012|volume=485|issue=7396|pages=78–81|doi=10.1038/nature10967|url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_et_al_2012_Nature_Archean_Bombardment.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.485...78B |pmid=22535245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== E-belt model ==

The E-belt model was developed by [[William F. Bottke]], David Vokrouhlicky, David Minton, David Nesvorný, [[Alessandro Morbidelli (astronomer)|Alessandro Morbidelli]], Ramon Brasser, [[Bruce Simonson]] and [[Harold F. Levison|Harold Levison]].&lt;ref name=Bottke2012 /&gt;  It describes the dynamics of an inner band of the early asteroid belt within the framework of the [[Nice model]].

=== Location and stability ===

The extended-belt [[asteroids]] were located between the current inner boundary of the asteroid belt and the [[orbit]] of [[Mars]] with [[semi-major axis]] ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 [[astronomical units]] (AU). In the current [[Solar System]] most orbits in this region are unstable due to the presence of the ν&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; [[secular resonance]].&lt;ref name=Bottke2012 /&gt; However, prior to the [[giant planet]] [[Planetary migration|migration]] described in the [[Nice model]] the [[outer planets]] would have been in a more compact configuration with nearly circular orbits.&lt;ref name="Gomes 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gomes|first=R.|author2=Levison, H. F. |author3=Tsiganis, K. |author4= Morbidelli, A. |title=Origin of the cataclysmic Late Heavy Bombardment period of the terrestrial planets|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=435|issue=7041|pages=466–469|doi=10.1038/nature03676|url=http://staff.on.br/rodneyg/curso2010/aula7/LHB_NM.pdf|pmid=15917802|bibcode = 2005Natur.435..466G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the planets in this configuration the ν&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; secular resonance would be located outside the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name="Morbidellli 2010" /&gt;   Stable orbits would have existed inside 2.1 AU and the inner edge of the primordial asteroid belt would have been defined by Mars-crossing orbits.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|author2=Marchi, S. |author3=Bottke, W. F. |author4= Kring, D. A. |title=A sawtooth-like timeline for the first billion years of lunar bombardment|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|year=2012|volume=355|pages=144–151|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.07.037|bibcode=2012E&amp;PSL.355..144M|arxiv = 1208.4624 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late Heavy Bombardment ===

During the migration of the giant planets the ν&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; secular resonance would have moved inward as [[Saturn]] moved outward.&lt;ref name="Minton Malhorta 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minton|first=David A.|author2=Malhotra, Renu|title=Secular Resonance Sweeping of the Main Asteroid Belt During Planet Migration|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|year=2011|volume=732|issue=1|page=53|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/732/1/53|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/732/1/53/pdf/0004-637X_732_1_53.pdf|bibcode=2011ApJ...732...53M|arxiv = 1102.3131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon reaching its current location near 2.1 AU the ν&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; secular resonance and other related resonances would destabilize the orbits of the E-belt asteroids. Most would be driven onto planet-crossing orbits as their [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] and [[orbital inclination|inclinations]] increased. Over a period of 400 million years impacts of the E-belt asteroids yield an estimated 9-10 of the 12 basin-forming lunar impacts attributed to the Late Heavy Bombardment.&lt;ref name=Bottke2012 /&gt;

=== Hungaria asteroids ===

As their orbits evolved many of the E-belt asteroids would have acquired orbits similar to those of the [[Hungaria group|Hungaria asteroids]] with high inclinations and semimajor axis between 1.8 and 2.0 AU.&lt;ref name="Bottke LPSC" /&gt;  Because orbits in this region are dynamically sticky these objects would form a quasi-stable reservoir.&lt;ref name=Bottke2012 /&gt;  As this population of the E-belt asteroids leaked from this reservoir they would produce a long-lived tail of impacts after the traditional end of the late heavy bombardment at 3.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Helen|title=Ancient asteroids kept on coming|url=http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-asteroids-kept-on-coming-1.10504|publisher=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A remnant representing roughly 0.1–0.4% of the original E-belt asteroids would remain as the current Hungaria asteroids.&lt;ref name=Bottke2012 /&gt;

== Evidence of extended belt ==

=== Problems with alternative sources of LHB ===

Evidence for the [[Moon]] does not support [[comet]]s from the outer [[planetesimal]] belt as the source of the basin-forming lunar impacts. The size frequency distribution (SFD) of ancient lunar craters is a similar to the SFD of main belt asteroids instead of that of comets.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli 2012" /&gt; Samples recovered from the Moon containing impact melts have a range of ages rather than the sharp spike expected if comets produced the LHB.&lt;ref name="Bottke 2012 Supplement" /&gt; Analysis of highly [[Siderophile element#Siderophile elements|siderophile elements]] in these samples shows a better match for impactors from the inner Solar System than for comets.&lt;ref name="Bottke 2012 Supplement"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bottke|first=William F.|author2=Vokrouhlický, David |author3=Minton, David |author4=Nesvorný, David |author5=Morbidelli, Alessandro |author6=Brasser, Ramon |author7=Simonson, Bruce |author8= Levison, Harold F. |title=An Archaean heavy bombardment from a destabilized extension of the asteroid belt: Supplementary Information|journal=Nature|year=2012|volume=485|issue=7396|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7396/extref/nature10967-s1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies of the dynamics of the main asteroid belt during giant planet migration have significantly limited the number of impactors originating from this region. A rapid alteration of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits is necessary to reproduce the current orbital distribution.&lt;ref name="Morbidellli 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=Alessandro|author2=Brasser, Ramon |author3=Gomes, Rodney |author4=Levison, Harold F. |author5= Tsiganis, Kleomenis |title=Evidence from the Asteroid Belt for a Violent Past Evolution of Jupiter's Orbit|journal=The Astronomical Journal|year=2010|volume=140|issue=5|pages=1391–1401|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/140/5/1391|bibcode=2010AJ....140.1391M|arxiv = 1009.1521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This scenario removes only 50% of the asteroids from the main belt producing 2–3 basins on the Moon.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli 2012" /&gt;

=== Support for E-belt as source of LHB ===

Examination of samples recovered from the Moon indicates that the impactors were thermally evolved objects.&lt;ref name="Bottke LPSC"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bottke|first=W. F.|author2=Vokrouhlicky, D. |author3=Nesvorný, D. |author4=Minton, D. |author5=Morbidelli, A. |author6= Brasser, R. |title=The E-Belt: A Possible Missing Link in the Late Heavy Bombardment|journal=41st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|date=March 2010|page=1269|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2010/pdf/1269.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[E-type asteroid]]s, an example of this type, are uncommon in the main belt&lt;ref name="Lang 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang|first=Kenneth|title=Asteroid distribution of spectral type with distance|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/view_picture.asp?id=1242|publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but become more common toward the inner belt and would be expected to be most common in the E-belt.&lt;ref name="Bottke LPSC" /&gt;  The Hungaria asteroids, which are a remnant of the E-belt in this model, contain a sizable fraction of E-type asteroids.&lt;ref name="Warner 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warner|first=Brian D.|author2=Harris, Alan W. |author3=Vokrouhlický, David |author4=Nesvorný, David |author5= Bottke, William F. |title=Analysis of the Hungaria asteroid population|journal=Icarus|year=2009|volume=204|issue=1|pages=172–182|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2009.06.004|url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Warner_2009_Icarus_204_172_Hungaria_Asteroids.pdf|bibcode=2009Icar..204..172W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decay of the population of E-belt asteroids captured onto Hungaria like orbits produces a long-lived tail of impacts which continues past the LHB. The continuation of the bombardment is predicted to generate basin-forming impacts on the Earth and [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]]-sized craters on the Earth and Moon.&lt;ref name=Bottke2012 /&gt;  [[Impact crater]]s on the Moon and impact spherule beds found on the Earth dated to this period are consistent with these predictions.&lt;ref name=Bottke2012 /&gt;

The E-belt model predicts a remnant population will remain on Hungaria-like orbits. The initial population of E-belt asteroids was calculated based on the population of potential basin-forming impactors remaining among the Hungaria asteroids.&lt;ref name="Bottke 2012 Supplement" /&gt;  The result was consistent with calculations based on the recent estimates of the orbital density of the main asteroid belt before the planetary migration.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli 2012" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7958">'''Ecological indicators''' are used to communicate information about [[ecosystem]]s and the impact human activity has on ecosystems to groups such as the public or [[government]] [[policy]] makers. Ecosystems are complex and ecological indicators can help describe them in simpler terms that can be understood and used by non-scientists to make management decisions. For example, the number of different [[beetle]] [[taxon|taxa]] found in a field can be used as an [[Diversity index|indicator]] of [[biodiversity]].{{ref|Gird}}{{ref|Niem}}{{ref|Osi}}

Many different types of indicators have been developed.  They can be used to reflect a variety of aspects of ecosystems, including biological, chemical and physical.  Due to this variety, the development and selection of ecological indicators is a complex process.{{ref|Kurt}}

Using ecological indicators is a pragmatic approach since direct documentation of changes in ecosystems as related to management measures, is cost and time intensive.{{ref|Bert}}{{ref|Osi}} For example, it would be expensive and time-consuming to count every [[bird]], [[plant]] and [[animal]] in a newly [[Restoration ecology|restored]] [[wetland]] to see if the restoration was a success. Instead, a few [[indicator species]] can be monitored to determine the success of the restoration.

:''"It is difficult and often even impossible to characterize the functioning of a complex system, such as an eco-agrosystem, by means of direct measurements.  The size of the system, the complexity of the interactions involved, or the difficulty and cost of the measurements needed are often crippling"''{{ref|Gird}}

The terms ecological indicator and [[environmental indicator]] are often used interchangeably. However, ecological indicators are actually a sub-set of environmental indicators.  Generally, environmental indicators provide information on pressures on the [[Ecosystem|environment]], environmental conditions and societal responses.  Ecological indicators refer only to [[ecology|ecological]] processes; however, sustainability indicators are seen as increasingly important for managing humanity's coupled human-environmental systems&lt;ref&gt;Shaker, R. R. (2018). A mega-index for the Americas and its underlying sustainable development correlations. Ecological Indicators, 89, 466-479. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.050&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Policy evaluation==

Ecological indicators play an important role in evaluating policy regarding the environment.

===Contributions===

Indicators contribute to evaluation of policy development by:{{ref|Pior}}
*Providing decision-makers and the general public with relevant information on the current state and trends in the environment.
*Helping decision-makers better understand cause and effect relationships between the choices and practices of businesses and policy-makers versus the environment.
*Assisting to monitor and assess the effectiveness of measures taken to increase and enhance [[ecological goods and services]].

Based on the [[United Nations]] [[convention to combat desertification]] and [[convention for biodiversity]], indicators are planned to be built in order to evaluate the evolution of the factors.  For instance, for the CCD, the [[Unesco]]-funded [[Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel]] (OSS) has created the Réseau d'Observatoires du Sahara et du Sahel ([[ROSELT]]) (website [http://www.roselt-oss.teledection.fr]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) as a network of cross-Saharan observatories to establish ecological indicators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Limitations===

There are limitations and challenges to using indicators for evaluating policy programs.

For indicators to be useful for policy analysis, it is necessary to be able to use and compare indicator results on different scales (local, regional, national and international).  Currently, indicators face the following spatial limitations and challenges:

# Variable availability of data and information on local, regional and national scales.
# Lack of methodological standards on an international scale.
# Different ranking of indicators on an international scale which can result in different legal treatment.
# Averaged values across a national level may hide regional and local trends.
# When compiled, local indicators may be too diverse to provide a national result.{{ref|Pior}}

Indicators also face other limitations and challenges, such as:

# Lack of reference levels, therefore it is unknown if trends in environmental change are strong or weak.
# Indicator measures can overlap, causing over estimation of single parameters.
# Long-term monitoring is necessary to identify long-term environmental changes.
# Attention to more easily handled measurable indicators distracts from indicators less quantifiable such as aesthetics, ethics or cultural values. {{ref|Pior}}

{{Sociology}}

'''Enculturation''' is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding [[culture]] and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; p&amp;nbsp;547.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this process, the influences that limit, direct, or shape the individual (whether deliberately or not) include parents, other adults, and peers. If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values, and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

Enculturation is related to [[socialization]]. In some academic fields, socialization refers to the deliberate shaping of the individual. In others, the word may cover both deliberate and informal enculturation.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

[[Conrad Phillip Kottak]] (in ''Window on Humanity'') writes:

{{quote|Enculturation is the process where the culture that is currently established teaches an individual the accepted norms and values of the culture or society where the individual lives. The individual can become an accepted member and fulfill the needed functions and roles of the group. Most importantly the individual knows and establishes a context of boundaries and accepted behavior that dictates what is acceptable and not acceptable within the framework of that society. It teaches the individual their role within society as well as what is accepted behavior within that society and lifestyle.}}

''Enculturation'' is sometimes referred to as ''[[acculturation]]'', a word recently used to more distinctively refer only to exchanges of cultural features with foreign cultures. Note that this is a recent development, as ''acculturation'' in some literatures has the same meaning as ''enculturation''.

[[Image:Order of the Engineer ring.jpg|thumbnail|The ring is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand.]]

The '''Engineer's Ring''' is a ring worn by members of the United States [[Order of the Engineer]], a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies|fellowship]] of [[engineer]]s who must be a certified Professional Engineer or graduated from an accredited engineering program (or be within one academic year of graduation to participate).&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/?page_id=17 Order of the Engineer FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The ring is usually a [[stainless steel]] band worn on the [[pinky ring|little finger]] of the dominant hand.&lt;ref name="order pdf"&gt;[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ceremony.pdf Manual for Conducting Order of the EngineerInduction Ceremonies]&lt;/ref&gt; This is so that it makes contact with all work done by the engineer. Rings used to be cast in iron in the most unattractive and simple form to show the nature of work. The ring is symbolic of the oath taken by the wearer, and symbolizes the unity of the profession in its goal of benefitting mankind. The stainless steel from which the ring is made depicts the strength of the profession.&lt;ref name="order pdf"/&gt;

Starting in 1970,&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; it is inspired by the original Canadian [[Iron Ring]] ceremony that started in 1922. Engineers receive the ring after taking an oath known as [[#The Obligation of The Engineer|The Obligation of The Engineer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/?page_id=251|title=Ceremony Manual|last=|first=|date=2011-11-01|website=Order Of The Engineer|page=iv|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a ring ceremony. Only those who have met the standards of [[professional engineering]] training or experience are able to accept the Obligation, which is voluntarily received for life.

==The Obligation of The Engineer==
The required oath, taken immediately before accepting the Engineer's Ring, is known as "The Obligation of the Engineer" and is as follows:

{{Quote|text=
''I am an Engineer.''
''In my profession I take deep pride.''
''To it I owe solemn obligations.''

''As an engineer, I, (full name), pledge to practice Integrity and Fair Dealing, Tolerance, and Respect,'' 
''and to uphold devotion to the standards and dignity of my profession,''
''conscious always that my skill carries with it the obligation to serve humanity''
''by making best use of the Earth's precious wealth.''

''As an engineer, I shall participate in none but honest enterprises.''
''When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reservation for the public good.''
''In the performance of duty, and in fidelity to my profession, I shall give the utmost.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7678">A '''flavorist''', also known as '''flavor chemist''', is someone who uses [[chemistry]] to engineer artificial and natural [[flavor]]s. The tools and materials used by flavorists are almost the same as that used by [[perfumer]]s with the exception that flavorists seek to mimic or modify both the [[olfactory]] and [[gustatory]] properties of various food products rather than creating just abstract smells. As well, the materials and chemicals that a flavorist utilizes for flavor creation must be safe for human consumption.

The profession of flavorists came about when affordable [[refrigeration]] for the home spurred of food processing technology, which could affect the quality of the flavor of the food. In some cases these technologies can remove naturally occurring flavors. To remedy the flavor loss, the food processing industry created the flavor industry. The [[chemist]]s that resolved the demand of the food processing industry became known as ''flavorists''. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Education==
Educational requirements for the profession known as flavorist are varied.  Flavorists are often graduated either in Chemistry, Biology or Food Science up to PhDs obtained in subjects such as Biochemistry and Chemistry.  Because, however, the training of a flavorist is mostly done on-the-job and specifically at a [[:Category:Flavor companies|flavor company]] known as a flavor house, this training is similar to the [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] system.

Located in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] ([[France]]), [[ISIPCA]] French School offers two years of high-standard education in food flavoring including 12 months traineeship in a [[:Category:Flavor companies|flavor company]]. This education program provides students with solid background in [[flavor]] formulation, flavor application, and flavor chemistry (analysis and sensory).

The [http://www.bsf.org.uk British Society of Flavourists] together with [[Reading University]] provide, every year, a three-week flavorist training course for flavorists from all around the world.

==Flavorist societies==
In the [[United States]], a flavorist can join the [http://www.flavorchemist.org/ Society of Flavor Chemists], which meets in [[New Jersey]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Chicago]], and the West Coast 6 to 8 times a year.  To be an apprentice flavorist in the society, one must pass an apprenticeship within a flavor house for five years.  To be a certified member with voting rights, one must pass a seven-year program.  Each level is verified by a written and oral test of the Membership Committee.  As an alternative to training under a flavorist, rather than the above-mentioned cases, a 10-year independent option is available.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a flavorist can join [http://www.bsf.org.uk/ The British Society of Flavourists], which meets near the [[London]] area. To acquire membership, applicants must be sponsored by at least two voting members, shall not be under thirty years of age, and shall have been engaged as a creative flavorist for a period of at least ten years. To be an associate member, applicants must be either a full-time creative flavorist with at least four years' experience, a flavor application chemist, or a food technologist responsible for flavor blending, assessment, and evaluation for a period of at least five years, or a person of such standing in the flavor-producing or using industries as satisfies the Membership Committee that he/she is eligible for membership. An Associate Member must be proposed by two voting members. To be a student member, the applicant must be a new entrant to the flavor industry, not yet able to qualify as an Associate, and proposed by one voting member. To be an affiliate member, applicants must be Technical and Marketing Consultants, Commercial and Technical Managers having a direct relationship to the flavoring industry, and sponsored by three voting members.

'''Flux balance analysis''' ('''FBA''') is a mathematical method for simulating metabolism in genome-scale reconstructions of [[metabolic network]]s. In comparison to traditional methods of modeling, FBA is less intensive in terms of the input data required for constructing the model. Simulations performed using FBA are computationally inexpensive and can calculate steady-state metabolic fluxes for large models (over 2000 reactions) in a few seconds on modern personal computers.

The predicted flux through each reaction is proportional to the width of the line.

FBA finds applications in [[bioprocess engineering]] to systematically identify modifications to the metabolic networks of microbes used in fermentation processes that improve product yields of industrially important chemicals such as ethanol and succinic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ranganathan | first1 = Sridhar | last2 = Suthers | first2 = Patrick F. | last3 = Maranas | first3 = Costas D. | year = 2010 | title = OptForce: An Optimization Procedure for Identifying All Genetic Manipulations Leading to Targeted Overproductions | url = | journal = PLoS Comput Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 4| page = e1000744 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000744 | pmid = 20419153 | pmc = 2855329 | bibcode = 2010PLSCB...6E0744R }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used for the identification of putative drug targets in cancer &lt;ref name="genome_scale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis, NE|author2=Abdel-Haleem, AM|title=The evolution of genome-scale models of cancer metabolism|journal=Front.

The thickness of the arrows is proportional to the flux through the reaction.

FBA formalizes the system of equations describing the concentration changes in a metabolic network as the dot product of a matrix of the stoichiometric coefficients (the stoichiometric matrix '''S''') and the vector '''v''' of the unsolved fluxes. The right-hand side of the dot product is a vector of zeros representing the system at [[steady state]]. [[Linear programming]] is then used to calculate a solution of fluxes corresponding to the steady state.

==History==

Some of the earliest work in FBA dates back to the early 1980s. Papoutsakis&lt;ref name="Papoutsakis, ET. 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papoutsakis | first1 = ET | year = 1984 | title = Equations and calculations for fermentations of butyric acid bacteria | url = | journal = Biotech Bioeng | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 174–187 | doi=10.1002/bit.260260210| pmid = 18551704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that it was possible to construct flux balance equations using a metabolic map. It was Watson,&lt;ref name="Watson, MR. 1984"&gt;Watson MR (1984) Metabolic maps for the Apple II. 12, 1093-1094&lt;/ref&gt; however, who first introduced the idea of using linear programming and an objective function to solve for the fluxes in a pathway. The first significant study was subsequently published by Fell and Small,&lt;ref name="Fell DA and Small JR. 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fell | first1 = DA | last2 = Small | first2 = JR | year = 1986 | title = Fat synthesis in adipose tissue.

FBA is not computationally intensive, taking on the order of seconds to calculate optimal fluxes for biomass production for a typical network (around 2000 reactions). This means that the effect of deleting reactions from the network and/or changing flux constraints can be sensibly modelled on a single computer.

===Gene/reaction deletion and perturbation studies===

====Single reaction deletion====
A frequently used technique to search a metabolic network for reactions that are particularly critical to the production of biomass. By removing each reaction in a network in turn and measuring the predicted flux through the biomass function, each reaction can be classified as either essential (if the flux through the biomass function is substantially reduced) or non-essential (if the flux through the biomass function is unchanged or only slightly reduced).

====Pairwise reaction deletion====
Pairwise reaction deletion of all possible pairs of reactions is useful when looking for drug targets, as it allows the simulation of multi-target treatments, either by a single drug with multiple targets or by drug combinations. Double deletion studies can also quantify the synthetic lethal interactions between different pathways providing a measure of the contribution of the pathway to overall network robustness.

==== Single and multiple gene deletions====
Genes are connected to enzyme-catalyzed reactions by [[Boolean expression]]s known as Gene-Protein-Reaction expressions (GPR). Typically a GPR takes the form (Gene A AND Gene B) to indicate that the products of genes A and B are protein sub-units that assemble to form the complete protein and therefore the absence of either would result in deletion of the reaction. On the other hand, if the GPR is (Gene A OR Gene B) it implies that the products of genes A and B are [[isozymes]].

Therefore, it is possible to evaluate the effect of single or multiple gene deletions by evaluation of the GPR as a Boolean expression. If the GPR evaluates to '''false''', the reaction is constrained to zero in the model prior to performing FBA. Thus gene knockouts can be simulated using FBA.

====Interpretation of gene and reaction deletion results====
The utility of reaction inhibition and deletion analyses becomes most apparent if a gene-protein-reaction matrix has been assembled for the network being studied with FBA. The gene-protein-reaction matrix is a binary matrix connecting genes with the proteins made from them. Using this matrix, reaction essentiality can be converted into gene essentiality indicating the gene defects which may cause a certain disease phenotype or the proteins/enzymes which are essential (and thus what enzymes are the most promising drug targets in pathogens). However, the gene-protein-reaction matrix does not specify the Boolean relationship between genes with respect to the enzyme, instead it merely indicates an association between them. Therefore, it should be used only if the Boolean GPR expression is unavailable.

====Reaction inhibition====
The effect of inhibiting a reaction, rather than removing it entirely, can be simulated in FBA by restricting the allowed flux through it. The effect of an inhibition can be classified as lethal or non-lethal by applying the same criteria as in the case of a deletion where a suitable threshold is used to distinguish “substantially reduced” from “slightly reduced”. Generally the choice of threshold is arbitrary but a reasonable estimate can be obtained from growth experiments where the simulated inhibitions/deletions are actually performed and growth rate is measured.

====Growth media optimization====
To design optimal growth media with respect to enhanced growth rates or useful by-product secretion, it is possible to use a method known as Phenotypic Phase Plane analysis. PhPP involves applying FBA repeatedly on the model while co-varying the nutrient uptake constraints and observing the value of the objective function (or by-product fluxes). PhPP makes it possible to find the optimal combination of nutrients that favor a particular phenotype or a mode of metabolism resulting in higher growth rates or secretion of industrially useful by-products. The predicted growth rates of bacteria in varying media have been shown to correlate well with experimental results.&lt;ref name="Edwards, J. 2001" /&gt; as well as to define precise minimal media for the culture of ''Salmonella typhimurium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raghunathan | first1 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Constraint-based analysis of metabolic capacity of ''Salmonella typhimurium'' during host-pathogen interaction | url = | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 38 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-3-38 | pmid=19356237 | pmc=2678070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical description==

In contrast to the traditionally followed approach of metabolic modeling using coupled [[ordinary differential equations]], flux balance analysis requires very little information in terms of the enzyme kinetic parameters and concentration of metabolites in the system. It achieves this by making two assumptions, [[steady state]] and optimality. The first assumption is that the modeled system has entered a steady state, where the metabolite concentrations no longer change, i.e. in each metabolite node the producing and consuming fluxes cancel each other out. The second assumption is that the organism has been optimized through evolution for some biological goal, such as optimal growth or conservation of resources. The steady-state assumption reduces the system to a set of linear equations, which is then solved to find a flux distribution that satisfies the steady-state condition subject to the stoichiometry constraints while maximizing the value of a pseudo-reaction (the objective function) representing the conversion of biomass precursors into biomass.

The steady-state assumption dates to the ideas of [[material balance]] developed to model the growth of microbial cells in fermenters in bioprocess engineering. During microbial growth, a substrate consisting of a complex mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen sources along with trace elements are consumed to generate biomass.
The material balance model for this process becomes:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} = \mathrm{Output} + \mathrm{Accumulation} &lt;/math&gt;

If we consider the system of microbial cells to be at steady state then we may set the accumulation term to zero and reduce the material balance equations to simple algebraic equations. In such a system, substrate becomes the input to the system which is consumed and biomass is produced becoming the output from the system. The material balance may then be represented as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} = \mathrm{Output} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} - \mathrm{Output} = \mathrm{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, the algebraic equations can be represented as a dot product of a matrix of coefficients and a vector of the unknowns. Since the steady-state assumption puts the accumulation term to zero. The system can be written as:
: &lt;math&gt; \qquad A \cdot\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Extending this idea to metabolic networks, it is possible to represent a metabolic network as a stoichiometry balanced set of equations. Moving to the matrix formalism, we can represent the equations as the dot product of a matrix of stoichiometry coefficients (stoichiometric matrix &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) and the vector of fluxes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; as the unknowns and set the right hand side to 0 implying the steady state.

: &lt;math&gt; \qquad S \cdot\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Metabolic networks typically have more reactions than metabolites and this gives an under-determined system of linear equations containing more variables than equations. The standard approach to solve such under-determined systems is to apply [[linear programming]].

Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in [[canonical form]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{maximize} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{x}\\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; A \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b} \\
&amp; \text{and} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{x} \ge \mathbf{0}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''x''' represents the vector of variables (to be determined), '''c''' and '''b''' are [[vector space|vectors]] of (known) coefficients, ''A'' is a (known) [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients, and &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[matrix transpose]]. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the ''objective function'' ('''c'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''x''' in this case). The inequalities ''A'''''x'''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;'''b''' are the constraints which specify a [[convex polytope]] over which the objective function is to be optimized.

Linear Programming requires the definition of an objective function. The optimal solution to the LP problem is considered to be the solution which maximizes or minimizes the value of the objective function depending on the case in point. In the case of flux balance analysis, the objective function '''Z''' for the LP is often defined as biomass production. Biomass production is simulated by an equation representing a lumped reaction that converts various biomass precursors into one unit of biomass.

Therefore, the canonical form of a Flux Balance Analysis problem would be:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{maximize} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{v}\\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; S \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \\
&amp; \text{and} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{lower bound} \le \mathbf{v} \le \mathbf{upper bound}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; represents the vector of fluxes (to be determined), &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a (known) [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the ''objective function'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in this case). The inequalities &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{lower bound} \le \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \le \mathbf{upper bound}&lt;/math&gt; define, respectively, the minimal and the maximal rates of flux for every reaction corresponding to the columns of the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; matrix. These rates can be experimentally determined to constrain and improve the predictive accuracy of the model even further or they can be specified to an arbitrarily high value indicating no constraint on the flux through the reaction.

The main advantage of the flux balance approach is that it does not require any knowledge of the metabolite concentrations, or more importantly, the [[enzyme kinetics]] of the system; the homeostasis assumption precludes the need for knowledge of metabolite concentrations at any time as long as that quantity remains constant, and additionally it removes the need for specific [[Rate equation|rate laws]] since it assumes that at steady state, there is no change in the size of the metabolite pool in the system. The stoichiometric coefficients alone are sufficient for the mathematical maximization of a specific [[objective function]].

The objective function is essentially a measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product. The product itself depends on the purpose of the model, but one of the most common examples is the study of total biomass. A notable example of the success of FBA is the ability to accurately predict the growth rate of the [[prokaryote]] ''[[E. coli]]'' when cultured in different conditions.&lt;ref name="Edwards, J. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = J. | last2 = Ibarra | first2 = R. | last3 = Palsson | first3 = B. | year = 2001 | title = ''In silico'' predictions of Escherichia coli metabolic capabilities are consistent with experimental data | doi = 10.1038/84379| journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 125–130 | pmid=11175725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass objective function. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some [[Biotechnology|biotechnologically]] relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a [[chemostat]] or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.

==Model preparation and refinement==
The key parts of model preparation are: creating a metabolic network without gaps, adding constraints to the model, and finally adding an objective function (often called the Biomass function), usually to simulate the growth of the organism being modelled.

===Metabolic network and software tools===
[[File:Prepare for FBA.png|right|thumb|The first six reactions in Glycolysis prepared for FBA through the addition of an objective function (red) and the import and export of nutrients (ATP, ADP, BDG, ADG) across the system boundary (dashed green line).{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

Metabolic networks can vary in scope from those describing a single [[Metabolic pathway|pathway]], up to the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] or [[organism]]. The main requirement of a metabolic network that forms the basis of an FBA-ready network is that it contains no gaps. This typically means that extensive manual curation is required, making the preparation of a metabolic network for flux-balance analysis a process that can take months or years.  However, recent advances such as so-called gap-filling methods can
reduce the required time to weeks or months.

Software packages for creation of FBA models include [http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/ Pathway Tools/MetaFlux],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karp | first1 = P.D. | last2 = Paley | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Krummenacker | first3 = M. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title = Pathway Tools version 13.0: Integrated Software for Pathway/Genome Informatics and Systems Biology | url = | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 40–79 | doi=10.1093/bib/bbp043 | pmid=19955237 | pmc=2810111| arxiv = 1510.03964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latendresse | first1 = M. | last2 = Krummenacker | first2 = M. | last3 = Trupp | first3 = M. | last4 = Karp | first4 = P.D. | year = 2012| title = Construction and completion of flux balance models from pathway databases | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 28 | issue = 388–96| pages = 388–96 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr681 | pmid=22262672 | pmc=3268246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpheny,&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, C.H. et al.

Generally models are created in [[BioPAX]] or [[SBML]] format so that further analysis or visualization can take place in other software although this is not a requirement.

===Constraints===
A key part of FBA is the ability to add constraints to the flux rates of reactions within networks, forcing them to stay within a range of selected values. This lets the model more accurately simulate real metabolism. The constraints belong to two subsets from a biological perspective; boundary constraints that limit nutrient uptake/excretion and internal constraints that limit the flux through reactions within the organism.  In mathematical terms, the application of constraints can be considered to reduce the solution space of the FBA model. In addition to constraints applied at the edges of a metabolic network, constraints can be applied to reactions deep within the network. These constraints are usually simple; they may constrain the direction of a reaction due to energy considerations or constrain the maximum speed of a reaction due to the finite speed of all reactions in nature.

====Growth media constraints====
Organisms, and all other metabolic systems, require some input of nutrients. Typically the rate of uptake of nutrients is dictated by their availability (a nutrient that is not present cannot be absorbed), their concentration and diffusion constants (higher concentrations of quickly-diffusing metabolites are absorbed more quickly) and the method of absorption (such as [[active transport]] or [[facilitated diffusion]] versus simple diffusion).

If the rate of absorption (and/or excretion) of certain nutrients can be experimentally measured then this information can be added as a constraint on the flux rate at the edges of a metabolic model. This ensures that nutrients that are not present or not absorbed by the organism do not enter its metabolism (the flux rate is constrained to zero) and also means that known nutrient uptake rates are adhered to by the simulation. This provides a secondary method of making sure that the simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.

====Thermodynamical reaction constraints====
In principle, all reactions are reversible however in practice reactions often effectively occur in only one direction. This may be due to significantly higher concentration of reactants compared to the concentration of the products of the reaction. But more often it happens because the products of a reaction have a much lower free energy than the reactants and therefore the forward direction of a reaction is favored more.

For ideal reactions,

: &lt;math&gt; - \infty &lt;  v_i &lt; \infty \, &lt;/math&gt;

For certain reactions a thermodynamic constraint can be applied implying direction (in this case forward)

: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;  v_i &lt; \infty \, &lt;/math&gt;

Realistically the flux through a reaction cannot be infinite (given that enzymes in the real system are finite) which implies that,

: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; v_i &lt; v_\max \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Experimentally measured flux Constraints====

Certain flux rates can be measured experimentally (&lt;math&gt;v_{i,m}\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the fluxes within a metabolic model can be constrained, within some error (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt;), to ensure these known flux rates are accurately reproduced in the simulation.

: &lt;math&gt;v_{i,m} - \varepsilon &lt; v_i &lt;v_{i,m}+ \varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt;

Flux rates are most easily measured for nutrient uptake at the edge of the network. Measurements of internal fluxes is possible using radioactively labelled or NMR visible metabolites.

Constrained FBA-ready metabolic models can be analyzed using software such as the COBRA toolbox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = S.A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2007 | title = Quantitative prediction of cellular metabolism with constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 727–38 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.99| pmid = 17406635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(available implementations in [[MATLAB]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), SurreyFBA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gevorgyan | first1 = A | last2 = Bushell | first2 = ME | last3 = Avignone-Rossa | first3 = C | last4 = Kierzek | first4 = AM | year = 2011 | title = SurreyFBA: a command line tool and graphics user interface for constraint-based modeling of genome-scale metabolic reaction networks | url = | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 433–4 | pmid = 21148545 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq679}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the web-based FAME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boele | first1 = J | last2 = Olivier | first2 = BG | last3 = Teusink | first3 = B | year = 2012| title = FAME: the Flux Analysis and Modeling Environment | url = | journal = BMC Syst Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = 8 | pmid = 22289213 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-8 | pmc=3317868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional software packages have been listed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/ | title=CoBRA Methods - Constraint-based analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review of all such software and their functionalities has been recently reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakshmanan|first=M|author2=Koh, G |author3=Chung, BK |author4= Lee, DY |title=Software applications for flux balance analysis.|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=Jan 2014|volume=15|issue=1|pages=108–22|pmid=23131418 |doi=10.1093/bib/bbs069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abcdeFBA/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective function===
FBA can give a large number of mathematically acceptable solutions to the steady-state problem &lt;math&gt;(S\vec v=0)&lt;/math&gt;. However  solutions of biological interest are the ones which produce the desired metabolites in the correct proportion. The objective function defines the proportion of these metabolites. For instance when modelling the growth of an organism the objective function is generally defined as biomass. Mathematically, it is a column in the stoichiometry matrix the entries of which place a "demand" or act as a "sink" for biosynthetic precursors such as fatty acids, amino acids and cell wall components which are present on the corresponding rows of the '''S''' matrix. These entries represent experimentally measured, dry weight proportions of cellular components. Therefore, this column becomes a lumped reaction that simulates growth and reproduction. Therefore, the accuracy of experimental measurements plays an essential role in the correct definition of the biomass function and makes the results of FBA biologically applicable by ensuring that the correct proportion of metabolites are produced by metabolism.

When modeling smaller networks the objective function can be changed accordingly. An example of this would be in the study of the [[Glycolysis|carbohydrate metabolism]] pathways where the objective function would probably be defined as a certain proportion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADH]] and thus simulate the production of high energy metabolites by this pathway.

====Optimization of the objective/biomass function====
Linear programming can be used to find a single optimal solution. The most common biological optimization goal for a whole-organism metabolic network would be to choose the flux vector &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; that maximises the flux through a biomass function composed of the constituent metabolites of the organism placed into the stoichiometric matrix and denoted &lt;math&gt;v_\textrm{biomass}&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;v_b&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
\max_{ \vec v}\ v_b  \qquad \textrm{s. t.} \qquad \mathbf{S} \, \vec v=0
&lt;/math&gt;

In the more general case any reaction can be defined and added to the biomass function with either the condition that it be maximised or minimised if a single “optimal” solution is desired. Alternatively, and in the most general case, a vector &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; can be introduced, which defines the weighted set of reactions that the linear programming model should aim to maximise or minimise,

: &lt;math&gt; 
\max_{ \vec v}\ \vec v \cdot \vec c \qquad \textrm{s. t.} \qquad \mathbf{S}\,\vec{v}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of there being only a single separate biomass function/reaction within the stoichiometric matrix &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; would simplify to all zeroes with a value of 1 (or any non-zero value) in the position corresponding to that biomass function. Where there were multiple separate objective functions &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; would simplify to all zeroes with weighted values in the positions corresponding to all objective functions.

=== Reducing the solution space – biological considerations for the system ===
The analysis of the null space of matrices is implemented in software packages specialized for matrix operations such as Matlab and Octave. Determination of the null space of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; tells us all the possible collections of flux vectors (or linear combinations thereof) that balance fluxes within the biological network.  The advantage of this approach becomes evident in biological systems which are described by differential equation systems with many unknowns. The velocities in the differential equations above - &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; - are dependent on the reaction rates of the underlying equations. The velocities are generally taken from the [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten kinetic theory]], which involves the kinetic parameters of the enzymes catalyzing the reactions and the concentration of the metabolites themselves. Isolating enzymes from living organisms and measuring their kinetic parameters is a difficult task, as is measuring the internal concentrations and diffusion constants of metabolites within an organism. Therefore, the differential equation approach to metabolic modeling is beyond the current scope of science for all but the most studied organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kotte | first1 = O. | last2 = Zaugg | first2 = J. B. | last3 = [[Matthias Heinemann|Heinemann]] | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Bacterial adaptation through distributed sensing of metabolic fluxes | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 355| page = 355 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2010.10 | pmid=20212527 | pmc=2858440}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBA avoids this impediment by applying the homeostatic assumption, which is a reasonably approximate description of biological systems.

Although FBA avoids that biological obstacle, the mathematical issue of a large solution space remains. FBA has a two-fold purpose. Accurately representing the biological limits of the system and returning the flux distribution closest to the natural fluxes within the target system/organism. Certain biological principles can help overcome the mathematical difficulties. While the stoichiometric matrix is almost always under-determined initially (meaning that the solution space to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S} \, \vec v = 0&lt;/math&gt; is very large), the size of the solution space can be reduced and be made more reflective of the biology of the problem through the application of certain constraints on the solutions.

==Extensions==

The success of FBA and the realization of its limitations has led to extensions that attempt to mediate the limitations of the technique.

===Flux variability analysis===
[[Image:FVA1TomForth.png|right|thumb|Visual and numerical representation of FVA on a complete network.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

The optimal solution to the flux-balance problem is rarely unique with many possible, and equally optimal, solutions existing. Flux variability analysis (FVA), built into some analysis software, returns the boundaries for the fluxes through each reaction that can, paired with the right combination of other fluxes, estimate the optimal solution.

[[Image:FVA2TomForth.png|right|thumb|Visual and numerical representation of FVA on a network with non-lethal deletion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

Reactions which can support a low variability of fluxes through them are likely to be of a higher importance to an organism and FVA is a promising technique for the identification of reactions that are important.

===Minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA)===

When simulating knockouts or growth on media, FBA gives the final steady-state flux distribution. This final steady state is reached in varying time-scales. For example, the predicted growth rate of ''E. coli'' on glycerol as the primary carbon source did not match the FBA predictions; however, on sub-culturing for 40 days or 700 generations, the growth rate adaptively evolved to match the FBA prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ibarra | first1 = Rafael U. | last2 = Edwards | first2 = Jeremy S. | last3 = Palsson | first3 = Bernhard O. | year = 2002 | title = Escherichia Coli K-12 Undergoes Adaptive Evolution to Achieve in Silico Predicted Optimal Growth | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6912| pages = 186–189 | doi = 10.1038/nature01149 | pmid=12432395| bibcode = 2002Natur.420..186I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is of interest to find out what is the immediate effect of a perturbation or knockout, since it takes time for regulatory changes to occur and for the organism to re-organize fluxes to optimally utilize a different carbon source or circumvent the effect of the knockout. MOMA predicts the immediate sub-optimal flux distribution following the perturbation by minimizing the distance (Euclidean) between the wild-type FBA flux distribution and the mutant flux distribution using quadratic programming. This yields an optimization problem of the form.

&lt;math&gt;
\min\ ||\mathbf{v_w} - \mathbf{v_d}||^2 \qquad s. t.\quad \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{v_d}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_w}&lt;/math&gt; represents the wild-type (or unperturbed state) flux distribution and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_d}&lt;/math&gt; represents the flux distribution on gene deletion that is to be solved for. This simplifies to:

&lt;math&gt;
\min\ \frac{1}{2}\,{\mathbf{v_d}}^T\,\mathbf{I}\,\mathbf{v_d} + (\mathbf{-v_w})\cdot\mathbf{v_d} \qquad s. t.\quad \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{v_d}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the MOMA solution which represents the flux distribution immediately post-perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segrè | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Vitkup | first2 = Dennis | last3 = Church | first3 = George M. | year = 2002 | title = Analysis of Optimality in Natural and Perturbed Metabolic Networks | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 23| pages = 15112–15117 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.232349399 | pmid = 12415116 | pmc=137552| bibcode = 2002PNAS...9915112S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory on-off minimization (ROOM)===
ROOM attempts to improve the prediction of the metabolic state of an organism after a gene knockout. It follows the same premise as MOMA that an organism would try to restore a flux distribution as close as possible to the wild-type after a knockout. However it further hypothesizes that this steady state would be reached through a series of transient metabolic changes by the regulatory network and that the organism would try to minimize the number of regulatory changes required to reach the wild-type state. Instead of using a distance metric minimization however it uses a mixed integer linear programming method.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomi, Tomer, Omer Berkman, and Eytan Ruppin. "Regulatory On/off Minimization of Metabolic Flux Changes After Genetic Perturbations." ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' 102, no. 21 (May 24, 2005): 7695–7700. doi:10.1073/pnas.0406346102.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic FBA===
Dynamic FBA attempts to add the ability for models to change over time, thus in some ways avoiding the strict steady state condition of pure FBA. Typically the technique involves running an FBA simulation, changing the model based on the outputs of that simulation, and rerunning the simulation. By repeating this process an element of feedback is achieved over time.

==Comparison with other techniques==

FBA provides a less simplistic analysis than Choke Point Analysis while requiring far less information on reaction rates and a much less complete network reconstruction than a full dynamic simulation would require. In filling this niche, FBA has been shown to be a very useful technique for analysis of the metabolic capabilities of cellular systems.

===Choke point analysis===

Unlike [[choke point analysis]] which only considers points in the network where metabolites are produced but not consumed or vice versa, FBA is a true form of [[metabolic network modelling]] because it considers the metabolic network as a single complete entity ([[Stoichiometry#Stoichiometry matrix|the stoichiometric matrix]]) at all stages of analysis. This means that network effects, such as chemical reactions in distant pathways affecting each other, can be reproduced in the model. The upside to the inability of choke point analysis to simulate  network effects is that it considers each reaction within a network in isolation and thus can suggest important reactions in a network even if a network is highly fragmented and contains many gaps.

===Dynamic metabolic simulation===

Unlike [[dynamic metabolic simulation]], FBA assumes that the internal concentration of metabolites within a system stays constant over time and thus is unable to provide anything other than steady-state solutions. It is unlikely that FBA could, for example, simulate the functioning of a nerve cell. Since the internal concentration of metabolites is not considered within a model, it is possible that an FBA solution could contain metabolites at a concentration too high to be biologically acceptable. This is a problem that dynamic metabolic simulations would probably avoid. One advantage of the simplicity of FBA over dynamic simulations is that they are far less computationally expensive, allowing the simulation of large numbers of perturbations to the network. A second advantage is that the reconstructed model can be substantially simpler by avoiding the need to consider enzyme rates and the effect of complex interactions on enzyme kinetics.

'''Frederic Rousseau''' is a [[Flemish]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.kpn.nl/~martine_segers/biotechnologie/eiwitvouwing.html Artikel uit C2W life sciences, maart 2011] "... van eiwitten is de prijs die we betalen om de 3D-structuur van een scala aan eiwitten mogelijk te maken”, vertelt de Vlaamse onderzoeker Frederic Rousseau."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium|Belgian]] molecular biologist and researcher at the [[KU Leuven]] ([[Leuven]], [[Belgium]]). Together with [[Joost Schymkowitz]] he is group leader at the [[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie|VIB]] [[Switch Laboratory]], [[KU Leuven]]. His research interest is on essential cellular processes where functional regulation is governed by [[protein]] conformational switches that have to be actively controlled to ensure cell viability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fernandez-Escamilla |first=Ana-Maria |author2=Rousseau, Frederic |author3=Schymkowitz, Joost |author4=Serrano, Luis |title=Prediction of sequence-dependent and mutational effects on the aggregation of peptides and proteins |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=22 |pages=1302–1306 |year=2004 |doi=10.1038/nbt1012 |pmid=15361882 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained a PhD at the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom]]) in 2001. He did a post-doctorate work at the [[EMBL]] in [[Heidelberg]] [[Germany]] from 2001 until 2003. Rousseau is a VIB Group leader since 2003.

In geology, '''frostwork''' is a type of [[speleothem]] (cave formation) with acicular ("needle-like") growths almost always composed of [[aragonite]] (a [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]] of calcite) or [[calcite]] replaced aragonite.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, C. and Forti, P. (1997), ''Cave Minerals of the World'', [[National Speleological Society]], 2nd Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a variety of [[anthodite]]. In some caves frostwork may grow on top of [[cave popcorn]] or [[boxwork]].

In architecture frost-work or frostwork refers to a style of [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] carved with a vertically-oriented pattern evoking hanging pond-weed or algae, or icicles. It is mainly found in garden architecture, where water is to flow over or near the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/styles/classical/features/rustication.html Looking at buildings], "Rustication"&lt;/ref&gt;  Other decorative arts may use the term for other decorative patterns imitating frost or ice.
  
==Formation==
The origin of frostwork is somewhat controversial. Formation of cave frostwork has been attributed to moist, circulating air which, containing dissolved [[calcium carbonate]], drifted against rock surfaces and coated them with the delicate crystals.  Frostwork has also been attributed to water seepage from cave passageways in which there are relatively high [[evaporation]] rates.

==Occurrence==
Notable frostwork deposits are found in a number of [[cave]]s in the [[Black Hills]] region of [[South Dakota]], USA, most notable in [[Wind Cave National Park]] and [[Jewel Cave National Monument]] and [[Timpanogos Cave]] in [[Utah]]. Perhaps the most extensive displays known are found in [[Lechuguilla Cave]], [[New Mexico]], USA.

'''Georg Wilhelm Steller''' (10 March 1709 – 14 November 1746) was a German [[botanist]], [[zoologist]], [[physician]] and [[List of explorers|explorer]], who worked in Russia and is considered a pioneer of Alaskan natural history.&lt;ref name="Evans169"&gt;Evans, Howard Ensign. Edward Osborne Wilson (col.) ''The Man who Loved Wasps: A [[Howard Ensign Evans]] Reader''. in: Evans, Mary Alice. Big Earth Publishing, 2005. pp. 169. {{ISBN|1555663508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuttall"&gt;Nuttall, Mark. ''Encyclopedia of the Arctic''. Routledge, 2012. pp. 1953. {{ISBN|1579584365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Steller was born in [[Windsheim]], near [[Nuremberg]] in Germany, son to a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] named Johann Jakob Stöhler (after 1715, Stöller), and studied at the [[University of Wittenberg]]. He then traveled to Russia as a physician on a troop ship returning home with the wounded. He arrived in Russia in November 1734. He met the [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt]] (1685–1735) at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]]. Two years after Messerschmidt's death, Steller married his widow and acquired notes from his travels in [[Siberia]] not handed over to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy]].&lt;ref name="Egerton (2008)"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Egerton | first = Frank N. | title = A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 27: Naturalists Explore Russia and the North Pacific During the 1700s | journal = Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–60 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9623(2008)89[39:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steller knew about [[Vitus Bering]]’s [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]], which had left [[Saint Petersburg]] in February 1733. He volunteered to join it and was accepted. He then left St Petersburg in January 1738 with his wife, who decided to stay in Moscow and go no farther. Steller met [[Johann Georg Gmelin]] in [[Yeniseisk]] in January 1739. Gmelin recommended that Steller take his place in the planned exploration of Kamchatka. Steller embraced that role and finally reached [[Okhotsk]] and the main expedition in March 1740 as Bering's ships, the ''St. Peter'' and ''St. Paul'', were nearing completion.

[[File:Арка Стеллера.JPG|thumb|left|Steller's Arch on Bering Island]]
In September 1740, the expedition sailed to the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] with Bering and his two expeditionary vessels sailing around the peninsula's south tip and up to Avacha Bay on the Pacific coast. Steller went ashore on the east coast of Kamchatka to spend the winter in [[Bolsherechye]], where he helped to organize a local school and began exploring Kamchatka. When Bering summoned him to join the voyage in search of America and the strait between the two continents, serving in the role of scientist and physician, Steller crossed the peninsula by [[dog sled]].  After Bering's ''St. Peter'' was separated from its sister ship the ''St. Paul'' in a storm, Bering continued to sail east, expecting to find land soon. Steller, reading sea currents and [[flotsam]] and wildlife, insisted they should sail northeast. After considerable time lost, they turned northeast and made landfall in [[Alaska]] at [[Kayak Island]] on Monday 20&amp;nbsp;July 1741. Bering wanted to stay only long enough to take on fresh water. Steller argued Captain Bering into giving him more time for land exploration and was granted 10&amp;nbsp;hours. During this time, as the first non-native to have set foot upon Alaskan soil, Steller became the first European naturalist to describe a number of North American plants and animals, including a jay later named [[Steller's jay]].

Of the six species of birds and mammals that Steller discovered during the voyage, two are extinct ([[Steller's sea cow]] and the [[spectacled cormorant]]) and three are endangered or in severe decline ([[Steller's sea lion]], [[Steller's eider]] and [[Steller's sea eagle]]). The sea cow, in particular, a massive northern relative of the [[dugong]], lasted only 27 years after Steller discovered and named it, a limited population that quickly became victim of overhunting by the Russian crews that followed in Bering's wake.

[[Steller's jay]] is one of the few species named after Steller that is not currently endangered. In his brief encounter with the bird, Steller was able to deduce that the jay was kin to the American [[blue jay]], a fact which seemed proof that Alaska was indeed part of North America.

[[File:Могила Стеллера 01.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A 2009 memorial to Steller in a riverside park in [[Tyumen]], Siberia, where he had died of fever at age 37.]]

Although Steller tried to treat the crew's growing scurvy epidemic with leaves and berries he had gathered, officers scorned his proposal. Steller and his assistant were some of the very few who did not suffer from the ailment. On the return journey, with only 12&amp;nbsp;members of the crew able to move and the rigging rapidly failing, the expedition was shipwrecked on what later became known as [[Bering Island]]. Almost half of the crew had perished from [[scurvy]] during the voyage. Steller nursed the survivors, including Bering, but the aging captain could not be saved and died. The remaining men made camp with little food or water, a situation made only worse by frequent raids by [[Arctic fox]]es. Despite the hardships the crew endured, Steller studied the flora, fauna, and topography of the island in great detail. Of particular note were the only detailed behavioral and anatomical observations of [[Steller's sea cow]], a large [[sirenian]] mammal that once ranged across the Northern Pacific during the Ice Ages, but whose surviving relict population was confined to the shallow kelp beds around the [[Commander Islands]], and which was driven to extinction within 30&amp;nbsp;years of discovery by Europeans.

Based on these and other observations, Steller later wrote ''De Bestiis Marinis'' (‘On the Beasts of the Sea’), describing the fauna of the island, including the [[northern fur seal]], the [[sea otter]], [[Steller's sea lion]], Steller's sea cow, [[Steller's eider]] and the [[spectacled cormorant]]. Steller claimed the only recorded sighting of the marine [[cryptid]] [[Steller's sea ape]].

In early 1742 the crew used salvaged material from the St. Peter to construct a new vessel to return to [[Avacha Bay]] and nicknamed it ''The Bering''. Steller spent the next two years exploring the Kamchatka peninsula. Because of his sympathies for the native Kamchatkans, he was accused of fomenting rebellion and was recalled to Saint Petersburg. At one point he was put under arrest and made to return to Irkutsk for a hearing. He was freed and again turned west toward St. Petersburg, but along the way he came down with a fever and died at [[Tyumen]].

His journals, which reached the Academy and were later published by [[Peter Simon Pallas]], were used by other explorers of the North Pacific, including [[Captain Cook]].

'''Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK)''' is a [[surrogate model]]ing technique used in engineering. A surrogate model (alternatively known as a [[metamodeling|metamodel]], [[response surface methodology|response surface]] or emulator) is a prediction of the output of an expensive computer code.
&lt;ref name = mitchell1992&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = M. | last2 = Morris | first2 = M. | title = Bayesian design and analysis of computer experiments: two examples | url = http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A2n23.pdf | journal = Statistica Sinica | year = 1992 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This prediction is based on a small number of evaluations of the expensive computer code.

== Introduction ==

The black line indicates the test-function, while the gray circles indicate 'observations', 'samples' or 'evaluations' of the test-function. The blue line is the Kriging mean, the shaded blue area illustrates the Kriging standard deviation. With GEK we can add the gradient information, illustrated in red, which increases the accuracy of the prediction.]]

Adjoint solvers are now becoming available in a range of [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) solvers, such as [[Ansys|Fluent]], [[OpenFOAM]], [[SU2 code|SU2]] and US3D. Originally developed for [[optimization]], adjoint solvers are now finding more and more use in [[uncertainty quantification]].

=== Linear speedup ===
An adjoint solver allows one to compute the [[gradient]] of the quantity of interest with respect to all design parameters at the cost of one additional solve. This, potentially, leads to a [[linear]] speedup: the computational cost of constructing an accurate surrogate decrease, and the resulting computational speedup &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; scales linearly with the number &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of design parameters.

The reasoning behind this linear speedup is straightforward. Assume we run &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; primal solves and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; adjoint solves, at a total cost of &lt;math&gt;2N&lt;/math&gt;. This results in &lt;math&gt;N+dN&lt;/math&gt; data; &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; values for the quantity of interest and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; partial derivatives in each of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; gradients. Now assume that each partial derivative provides as much information for our surrogate as a single primal solve. Then, the total cost of getting the same amount of information from primal solves only is &lt;math&gt;N+dN&lt;/math&gt;. The speedup is the ratio of these costs:

:&lt;math&gt;s = \frac{N+dN}{2N} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}d&lt;/math&gt;.

A linear speedup has been demonstrated for a [[fluid-structure interaction]] problem &lt;ref name = debaar2012/&gt; and for a [[transonic]] [[airfoil]].&lt;ref name = debaar2015/&gt;

=== Noise ===
One issue with adjoint-based gradients in CFD is that they can be particularly [[Noise (signal processing)|noisy]].

When derived in a [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] framework, GEK allows one to incorporate not only the gradient information, but also the [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainty]] in that gradient information.&lt;ref name = debaar2014a&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Baar | first1 = J.H.S. | last2 = Dwight | first2 = R.P. | last3 = Bijl | first3 = H. | year = 2014 | title = Improvements to gradient-enhanced Kriging using a Bayesian interpretation | url = http://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/52034eb04b657aea,348c4184660ca52f,5e1970130bd779d8.html | journal = International Journal for Uncertainty Quantification | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–223 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
When using GEK one takes the following steps:

# '''Create a Design of Experiment (DoE):''' The DoE or 'sampling plan' is a list of different locations in the design space. The DoE indicates which combinations of parameters one will use to sample the computer simulation. With Kriging and GEK, a common choice is to use a Latin Hypercube Design (LHS) design with a 'maximin' criterion. The LHS-design is available in scripting codes like [[MATLAB]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]].
# '''Make observations:''' For each sample in our DoE one runs the computer simulation to obtain the Quantity of Interest (QoI).
# '''Construct the surrogate:''' One uses the GEK predictor equations to construct the surrogate conditional on the obtained observations.

Once the surrogate has been constructed it can be used in different ways, for example for surrogate-based [[Uncertainty Quantification]] (UQ) or [[optimization]].

== Predictor equations ==
In a [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] framework, we use [[Bayes' Theorem]] to predict the [[Kriging]] mean and covariance conditional on the observations. When using GEK, the observations are usually the results of a number of computer simulations. GEK can be interpreted as a form of [[Gaussian process]] regression.

=== Kriging ===
Along the lines of, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wikle | first1 = C.K. | last2 = Berliner | first2 = L.M. | year = 2007 | title = A Bayesian tutorial for data assimilation | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016727890600354X | journal = Physica D | volume = 230 | issue = 1–2| pages = 1–16 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt; we are interested in the output &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of our computer simulation, for which we assume the [[normal distribution|normal]] [[prior probability|prior probability distribution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;X\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,P)&lt;/math&gt;,

with prior mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and prior [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. The observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have the normal [[likelihood]]:

:&lt;math&gt;Y|x\sim\mathcal{N}(Hx,R)&lt;/math&gt;,

with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; the observation matrix and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; the observation error covariance matrix, which contains the [[measurement uncertainty|observation uncertainties]]. After applying [[Bayes' Theorem]] we obtain a normally distributed [[posterior probability|posterior probability distribution]], with Kriging mean:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(X|y) = \mu + K(y-H\mu)&lt;/math&gt;,

and Kriging covariance:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cov}(X|y) = (I-KH)P&lt;/math&gt;,

where we have the gain matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;K = PH^T(R+HPH^T)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

In Kriging, the prior covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is generated from a covariance function. One example of a covariance function is the Gaussian covariance:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = \sigma^2 \mathrm{exp}\left(-\sum_k\frac{|\xi_{jk}-\xi_{ik}|^2}{2 \theta_k^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where we sum over the dimensions &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; are the input parameters. The [[hyperparameter]]s &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated from a [[maximum likelihood estimation|Maximum Likelihood Estimate]] (MLE).&lt;ref name = debaar2014a /&gt;
&lt;ref name = dwight2009&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dwight | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Han | first2 = Z.-H. | year = 2009 | title = Efficient uncertainty quantification using gradient-enhanced Kriging | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2009-2276 | journal = 11th AIAA Non-Deterministic Approaches Conference, Palm Springs, California, 4–7 May | volume = | issue = | pages = | doi =10.2514/6.2009-2276| isbn = 978-1-60086-975-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect GEK ===
There are several ways of implementing GEK. The first method, indirect GEK, defines a small but finite stepsize &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and uses the gradient information to append synthetic data to the observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, see for example.&lt;ref name = dwight2009 /&gt; Indirect Kriging is sensitive to the choice of the step-size &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and cannot include [[measurement uncertainty|observation uncertainties]].

=== Direct GEK (through prior covariance matrix) ===
Direct GEK is a form of co-Kriging, where we add the gradient information as co-variables. This can be done by modifying the prior covariance &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or by modifying the observation matrix &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;; both approaches lead to the same GEK predictor. When we construct direct GEK through the prior covariance matrix, we append the partial derivatives to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and modify the prior covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; such that it also contains the derivatives (and second derivatives) of the covariance function, see for example 
&lt;ref name = laurenceau2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurenceau | first1 = J. | last2 = Sagaut | first2 = P. | year = 2008 | title = Building efficient response surfaces of aerodynamic functions with Kriging and coKriging | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.32308 | journal = AIAA Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 498–507 | doi =10.2514/1.32308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref name = debaar2014a /&gt;
The main advantages of direct GEK over indirect GEK are: 1) we do not have to choose a step-size, 2) we can include [[measurement uncertainty|observation uncertainties]] for the gradients in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and 3) it is less susceptible to poor [[condition number|conditioning]] of the gain matrix &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref name = debaar2014a /&gt;
&lt;ref name = dwight2009 /&gt;

=== Direct GEK (through observation matrix) ===
Another way of arriving at the same direct GEK predictor is to append the partial derivatives to the observations &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and include partial derivative operators in the observation matrix &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, see for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = de Baar | first1 = J.H.S. | year = 2014 | title = Stochastic Surrogates for Measurements and Computer Models of Fluids | url = http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A79d2dc5a-9a7c-4179-a417-a50cbba2bc5f?collection=research | journal = PhD thesis, Delft University of Technology | volume = | issue = | pages = 99–101 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gradient-enhanced kriging for high-dimensional problems (Indirect method) ===

Current gradient-enhanced kriging methods do not scale well with the number of sampling points due to the rapid growth in the size of the correlation matrix, where new information is added for each sampling point in each direction of the design space. Furthermore, they do not scale well with the number of independent variables due to the increase in the number of hyperparameters that needs to be estimated.
To address this issue, a new gradient-enhanced surrogate model approach that drastically reduced the number of hyperparameters through the use of the [[Partial least squares regression|partial-least squares]] method that maintains accuracy is developed. In addition, this method is able to control the size of the correlation matrix by adding only relevant points defined through the information provided by the partial-least squares method. For more details, see &lt;ref name = bouhlel2018&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bouhlel | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Martins | first2 = J.R.R.A. | year = 2018 | title = Gradient-enhanced kriging for high-dimensional problems | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-018-0590-x | journal = Engineering with Computers | doi =10.1007/s00366-018-0590-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
This approach is implemented into the Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) in Python (https://github.com/SMTorg/SMT), and it runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. SMT is distributed under the New BSD license.

== Example: Drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil ==
[[File:Transonic airfoil.png|thumb|400px|Transonic airfoil.]]

[[File:GEK airfoil reference.png|thumb|400px|Reference results for the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil, based on a large number of CFD simulations. The horizontal and vertical axis show the deformation of the shape of the airfoil.]]

[[File:GEK airfoil Kriging.png|thumb|400px|Kriging surrogate model of the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil. The gray dots indicate the configurations for which the CFD solver was run.]]

[[File:GEK airfoil GEK.png|thumb|400px|GEK surrogate model of the drag coefficient of a transonic airfoil. The gray dots indicate the configurations for which the CFD solver was run, the arrows indicate the gradients.]]

As an example, let us consider the flow over a [[transonic]] [[airfoil]].&lt;ref name = debaar2015/&gt; The airfoil is operating at a [[Mach number]] of 0.8 and an [[angle of attack]] of 1.25 degrees. We assume that the shape of the airfoil is uncertain; the top and the bottom of the airfoil might have shifted up or down due to manufacturing tolerances. In other words, the shape of the airfoil that we are using might be slightly different from the airfoil that we designed.

On the right we see the reference results for the [[drag coefficient]] of the airfoil, based on a large number of CFD simulations. Note that the lowest drag, which corresponds to 'optimal' performance, is close to the undeformed 'baseline' design of the airfoil at (0,0).

After designing a sampling plan (indicated by the gray dots) and running the CFD solver at those sample locations, we obtain the Kriging surrogate model. The Kriging surrogate is close to the reference, but perhaps not as close as we would desire.

In the last figure, we have improved the accuracy of this surrogate model by including the adjoint-based gradient information, indicated by the arrows, and applying GEK.

}}'''ICBA''' (International Center for Biosaline Agriculture) is an international, non-profit agricultural research and development center which focuses on the closely linked issues of water, environment, income, and [[food security]]. ICBA conducts research and development programs that aim to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in marginal environments.

Its headquarters are in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and it is a founding member of the [[Association of International Research and Development Centers for Agriculture]] (AIRCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airca.org/index.php/airca-members|title=AIRCA Members|website=www.airca.org|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://menanwc.org/about-network/current-members/international-center-biosaline-agriculture-icba|title=International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA)|website=Middle East and North Africa Network of Water Centers of Excellence|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apaari.org/about/members/|title=Members : APAARI|website=Asia Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1992, the [[Islamic Development Bank]] (IDB) initiated a series of expert consultations which outlined the objectives and activities of the new institute. In November 1992, the IDB Board of Executive Directors approved financing for start-up operations. Subsequent consultations between the Bank and the General Secretariat of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] led to the selection of the United Arab Emirates as a host country for the new center.

In 1996, the IDB and the Government of the UAE signed an agreement to establish ICBA as a formal entity. In 1997, the Municipality of Dubai donated 100 hectares of land at Al Ruwayyah, where ICBA's head office is now based. The center became operational in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319057675|title=Environmental Cost and Face of Agriculture in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Ahmed|first2=Mushtaque|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-3-319-05768-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBA’s founding donors were the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]] (OFID), the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]] (AFESD), and the [[Politics of the United Arab Emirates|Government of the United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).

Currently the Center is funded by the three core donors: the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment of the UAE (formerly the Ministry of Environment and Water); the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi; and the Islamic Development Bank. The Center has additional support from several development agencies and international donors such as&amp;nbsp;the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), the UAE Government, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Municipalities, and the private sector in Oman and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470290187.ch16/summary|title=The Role of Biosaline Agriculture in Managing Freshwater Shortages and Improving Water Security|last=Al-Attar|first=Mohammad|date=2003|publisher=Iowa State Press|isbn=9780470290187|editor-last=Scanes|editor-first=Colin G.|pages=271–280|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470290187.ch16|editor-last2=Miranowski|editor-first2=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|last2=Elouafi|first2=Ismahane A.|date=2014|title=The alternative futures of the International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture: from salinity research to greening the desert|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|journal=Foresight|volume=16|issue=5|pages=389–409|doi=10.1108/FS-08-2013-0030|issn=1463-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and development focus ==
[[file:Ismahane Elouafi (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dr Ismahane Elouafiis the center's director (2015)]]
Initially ICBA focused solely on biosaline environments but its applied research for development now aims to address agricultural challenges in all marginal environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Its tasks include assessment of natural resources, [[Adaptation to global warming|climate change adaptation]], [[Agricultural productivity|crop productivity]] and diversification, [[aquaculture]], [[bioenergy]] and policy analysis.

ICBA works on a number of technological developments, including the use of conventional and non-conventional water (such as saline, [[Wastewater|treated wastewater]], [[Industrial water treatment|industrial water]], [[agricultural drainage]], and seawater);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/Scientists_finding_ways_to_help_farmers_maximise_ground_water-GN_29032015_300309/|title=Scientists finding ways to help farmers maximise ground water|last=Ponce de Leon|first=Janice|date=29 March 2015|website=Thomson Reuters ZAWYA|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muslim-science.com/icba-oasis-desert/|title=ICBA – An Oasis in the Desert|date=2 August 2014|website=Muslim Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; water and land management technologies; and [[remote sensing]] and modeling for climate change adaptation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Center conducts research on a variety of food crops which hold promise of being resilient, salt tolerant and water efficient. For example, ICBA has been conducting widespread research on [[quinoa]], a multi-purpose, high-protein grain crop which is drought and salt tolerant. ICBA initiated research on a number of quinoa germplasm accessions since 2006–07. The selections from these trials are being introduced to farmers in several countries, e.g. in the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://raconteur.net/sustainability/more-meat-eaters-means-uk-farmers-can-cash-in|title=UK farming addresses global meat demand|last=Wale|first=Michael|date=29 July 2015|website=Raconteur|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icbawebsiteyn6lbe9b4h.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/GulfTimes_quinoa_19072015.pdf|title=Proper value chain needed for Quinoa|last=Banerjee|first=Thirtho|date=19 July 2015|work=The Gulf Time|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBA scientists are also working to increase the salinity tolerance of hardier traditional crops such as [[date palm]]s, [[sorghum]] and [[millet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/saltwater-saviors/30923|title=Saltwater Saviours|last=Cadei|first=Emily|date=15 April 2014|website=OZY|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field of research lies with ''[[Salicornia]]'' and other [[halophyte]]s (salt-loving plants) that remove salts from saline soils and water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Salicornia’s'' oil-bearing seeds produce biofuel, cosmetic oil and edible vegetable oil.

== Reach ==
The geographic scope of ICBA has grown since its inception. It now focusses its work on water-scarce countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) including Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), Central Asia and the Caucasus (CAC) and South and Southwest Asia. It is currently expanding to include countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|title=Turning Adversity into an Advantage for Food Security Through Improving Soil Quality and Providing Production Systems for Marginal Saline Lands: ICBA Perspectives and Approach|last=Shahid|first=Shabbir A.|last2=Taha|first2=Faisal K.|last3=Ismail|first3=Shoaib|last4=Dakheel|first4=Abdullah|last5=Abdelfattah|first5=Mahmoud|date=2011|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400705180|editor-last=Behnassi|editor-first=Mohamed|pages=43–67|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-0519-7_3|editor-last2=Shahid|editor-first2=Shabbir A.|editor-last3=D'Silva|editor-first3=Joyce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11698">The '''International Commission on Mathematical Instruction''' ('''ICMI''')  is a commission of the [[International Mathematical Union]] and is an internationally acting organization focussing on [[mathematics education]]. ICMI was founded in 1908 at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in Rome and aims to improve teaching standards around the world, through programs, workshops and initiatives and publications. It aims to work a great deal with developing countries, to increase teaching standards and education which can improve life quality and aid the country.

==History==

[http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/ ICMI] was founded at the ICM, and mathematician [[Felix Klein]] was elected first president of the organisation. [[Henri Fehr]] and [[Charles Laisant]] created the international research journal ''[[L'Enseignement Mathématique]]'' in 1899, and from early on this journal became the official organ of ICMI. A bulletin is published twice a year by ICMI, and from December 1995 this bulletin has been available at the organisation's official website, in their 'digital library'.

In the years between World War I and World War II there was little activity in the organization, but in 1952 ICMI was reconstituted. At this time the organization was reorganized, and it became an official commission of the [[International Mathematical Union]] (IMU). As a scientific organization, IMU is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). Although ICMI follows the general principles of IMU and ICSU, the organization has a large degree of autonomy.

==Structure==

All countries that are members of IMU are automatically members of ICMI; membership is also possible for non-IMU members. Currently, there are 90 member states of ICMI. Each member state has the right to appoint a national representative.

As a commission, ICMI has two main bodies:
* [http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/about-icmi/executive-committee/current-executive-committee/ the Executive Committee (EC)], and
* the national representatives from the member countries.

Together, these two constitute the General Assembly (GA) of ICMI. The GA is summoned every four years in connection with the [[International Congress on Mathematical Education|International Congress on Mathematical Education, ICME]]. The executive committee is appointed by the general assembly of IMU for four-year terms.

==Affiliate Organisations==

These include multi-national organisations, which are independent from ICMI and have interests in the field of mathematics.

There are currently four multinational Mathematical Education Societies:

* CIAEM: Inter-American Committee on Mathematics Education (2009)
* CIEAEM: International Commission for the Study and Improvement of Mathematics Teaching (2010)
* ERME: European Society for Research in Mathematics Education (2010)
* MERGA: Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia (2011)

And six international Study Groups which have obtained affiliation with ICMI:
* HPM: The International Study Group on the Relations between the History and Pedagogy of Mathematics (1976)
* ICTMA: The International Study Group for Mathematical Modelling and Applications (2003)
* IOWME: The International Organization of Women and Mathematics Education (1987)
* IGMCG: The International Group for Mathematical Creativity and Giftedness (2011)
* PME: The International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education (1976)
* WFNMC: The World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions (1994)

==Conferences==

'''International Congress on Mathematical Education'''

The [[International Congress on Mathematical Education]] (ICME) is an international event which is held every four years under the auspices of ICMI. The congress looks at the development of mathematical education across the world.

The last ICME was held in Hamburg in 2016 (link to website:http://icme13.org/). The next 2020 ICME will be held in Shanghai, China

'''ICMI Regional Conferences'''

ICMI sometimes offers financial as well as moral support to facilitate the organisation of regional meetings these have to be related to mathematical education. Precedence goes to less affluent countries. 
AFRICME: The Africa Regional Congress of ICMI on Mathematical Education was launched in 2005 and aims at offering a forum for mathematics educators throughout Africa.

[http://www.cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ocs/index.php/xiii_ciaem/xiii_ciaem CIAEM:] The Conferencia interamericana de educación matemática — Inter-American Conference on Mathematical Education organised by the Comité Interamericano de Educación Matemática - Inter-American Committee on Mathematical Education to promote discussion amongst Latin-American countries.

[http://www.sme.or.jp/earcome/ EARCOME:] is the name given to the ICMI-East Asia Regional Conferences in Mathematics Education. The South East Asia Conferences on Mathematics Education (SEACME) series began in 1978 in Manila. In addition there have been two ICMI-China Regional Conferences on Mathematics Education, in Beijing (1991) and Shanghai (1994). The EARCOME series has replaced the SEACME series.

[http://www.emf2012.unige.ch/ EMF] Launched by the French Sub-Commission of ICMI on the occasion of the World Mathematical Year 2000, the series of Espace Mathématique Francophone conferences is built on a notion of "region" defined in linguistic rather than geographical terms, French being a common language among participants.
Other ICMI Regional Conferences occur on a more ad hoc basis. 
Approval of a Conference as an ICMI Regional Conference
Two main aspects are that:

•	The conference should be genuinely international, and not just a national activity;

•	The conference should aim for high standards of scientific quality, with a planning and organizing structure that assures this.

==ICMI Publications and Research==

There are a variety of various publications made by or under the auspices of ICMI, some resulting directly from activities organised by the Commission, examples include: 
•	[http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/publications/icmi-bulletin/ The ICMI Bulletin]
•	[http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/publications/icmi-news/ ICMI News – The ICMI electronic newsletter] 
•	[http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/publications/icme-proceedings/ ICME Proceedings]
•	[http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/publications/icme-proceedings/ ICMI Studies Publications]
•	[http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/conferences/other-icmi-conferences/ Proceedings from other ICMI Conferences]
•	[http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/publications/lenseignement-mathematique/ L’Enseignement Mathématique]

==ICMI Studies==
Each ICMI Study addresses an issue or topic of particular significance in contemporary mathematics education, and is conducted by an international team of leading scholars and practitioners in that domain. The best contributing professionals from around the world are then invited to a carefully planned and structured international conference/workshop. Beyond the productive interaction and collaborations occasioned by this event, the main product is a Study volume, which are published in the New ICMI Study Series (NISS) by [[Springer Science+Business Media]].

==Awards==

From 2000 onwards ICMI has been presenting the [[Felix Klein]] Award and the [[Hans Freudenthal]] Award. These prizes recognise outstanding achievement in mathematics education research. In 2013 the ICMI [[Emma Castelnuovo]] Award for Excellence in the Practice of Mathematics Education was created.

*	The Felix Klein Award, named after the first president of the ICMI (1908-1920), honours a lifetime achievement: Guy Brousseau (2003),  Ubiratan D’Ambrosio (2005), Jeremy Kilpatrick (2007), Gilah Leder (2009), Michèle Artigue (2013).
*	The Hans Freudenthal Award, named after the eighth president of ICMI (1967-1970), recognises a major cumulative programme of research: Celia Hoyles (2003), Paul Cobb (2005), Anna Sfard (2007), Yves Chevallard (2009), Luis Radford (2011), Frederick Leung (2013).
*       The ICMI Emma Castelnuovo Award The award recognizes outstanding achievements in the practice of mathematics education. The award is named after Emma Castelnuovo, an Italian mathematics educator born in 1913 to celebrate her 100th birthday and honour her pioneering work. Awardees: Hugh Burkhardt and Malcolm Swan (2016).

'''ICMI [[Emma Castelnuovo/Award]]'''

In 2013 the ICMI Emma Castelnuovo Award for Excellence in the Practice of Mathematics Education was created. The award recognizes outstanding achievements in the practice of mathematics education. The award is named after Emma Castelnuovo, an Italian mathematics educator born in 1913 to celebrate her 100th birthday and honour her pioneering work.

The award honours persons, groups, projects, institutions or organizations engaged in the development and implementation of exceptional and influential work in the practice of mathematics education, including: classroom teaching, curriculum development, instructional design (of materials or pedagogical models), teacher preparation programs and/or field projects with a shown influence on schools, districts, regions or countries.

The award consists of a medal and a certificate accompanied by a citation and will be awarded only once every four years, delivered at the International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME).

At each ICME, the medals and certificates of the awards are presented at the Opening Ceremony.  Furthermore, the awardees are invited to present special lectures at the Congress.

==CANP==

The Capacity &amp; Networking Project is an international initiative to support mathematics education in the developing world and is a joint initiative of the international bodies of mathematicians (IMU) and mathematics educators (ICMI) in conjunction with [[UNESCO]] and International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, ICIAM. The project is a response to the report: Current Challenges in Basic Mathematics Education (UNESCO, 2011). CANP aims to enhance mathematics education at all levels in developing countries so that their people are capable of meeting the challenges these countries face. The first program was held in Bamako in Mali in September, 2011. The follow up meeting took place in Senegal in 2012. The second program was held in [http://www.mathunion.org/icmi/other-activities/outreach-to-developing-countries/canp-project-2012-central-america-and-the-caribbean/ Costa Rica] in 2012 and created a successful regional network.

== Klein Project ==
The Klein Project was launched in 2008 and aims to support mathematics teachers to connect the mathematics they teach, to the field of mathematics, while taking into account the evolution of this field over the last century. The Klein Project is inspired by [[Felix Klein]]’s famous book, Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced
Standpoint, published in 1908 and 1909. The project will have two main outputs: a book published in several languages and a [http://blog.kleinproject.org/ blog] which includes many materials for mathematics teachers to be used in the class room.

The '''International Near-Earth Asteroid Survey''' ('''INAS''') was an [[astronomical survey]], organized and co-ordinated by prolific American astronomer [[Eleanor Helin]] during the 1980s. It is considered to be the international extension of the [[Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey]] (PCAS). While PCAS operated exclusively from the U.S. [[Palomar Observatory]] in California, INAS attempted to encourage and stimulate worldwide interest in [[asteroid]]s, and to expand the sky coverage and the discovery and recovery of [[near-Earth objects]] around the world.&lt;ref name="WITI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Helin-2000" /&gt;

The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] credits INAS with the discovery of 8 minor planets in 1986 (compared to 20 discoveries made by PCAS during 1993–1994).&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt; One of the discoveries was the 7-kilometer sized main-belt asteroid [[4121 Carlin]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Carlin" /&gt;

{{Infobox Observatory}}
The '''Jodrell Bank Observatory''' (originally the '''Jodrell Bank Experimental Station''' and from 1966 to 1999, the '''Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories'''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɒ|d|r|əl}}) hosts a number of [[radio telescope]]s, and is part of the [[Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. The [[observatory]] was established in 1945 by [[Bernard Lovell]], a radio astronomer at the University of Manchester to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s after his work on [[radar]] during the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of [[meteor]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[astrophysical maser|masers]] and [[gravitational lens]]es, and was heavily involved with the tracking of [[space probe]]s at the start of the [[Space Age]]. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington.

The main telescope at the observatory is the [[Lovell Telescope]], which is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II]], and {{convert|42|ft|m|abbr=on}} and 7&amp;nbsp;m diameter radio telescopes. Jodrell Bank Observatory is the base of the [[MERLIN|Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network]] (MERLIN), a National Facility run by the [[University of Manchester]] on behalf of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

The observatory, the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre and an arboretum, are in the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Lower Withington]] and the rest of the site is in Goostrey civil parish, near [[Goostrey]] and [[Holmes Chapel]], [[Cheshire East|Cheshire]], [[North West England]]. The observatory is reached from the [[A535 road|A535]]. The [[Crewe to Manchester Line]] passes right by the site, and [[Goostrey railway station|Goostrey station]] is a short distance away. In 2018, the observatory became a candidate for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] status.

== Early years ==
[[Image:Jodrell bank Hut 1945.jpg|thumb|Observations at Jodrell Bank in 1945]]
{{see also|Timeline of Jodrell Bank Observatory}}
Jodrell Bank was first used for academic purposes in 1939 when the University of Manchester's [[Faculty of Life Sciences (University of Manchester)#Department of Botany|Department of Botany]] purchased three fields from the Leighs. It is named from a nearby rise in the ground, Jodrell Bank, which was named after [[William Jauderell]] whose descendants lived at the [[mansion]] that is now Terra Nova School. The site was extended in 1952 by the purchase of a farm from George Massey on which the [[Lovell Telescope]] was built.&lt;ref name="story_jb"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank''&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first used for [[astrophysics]] in 1945, when Bernard Lovell used some equipment left over from [[World War II]], including a [[gun laying]] [[radar]], to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name="story_2"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment was a GL II radar system working at a wavelength of 4.2&amp;nbsp;m, provided by [[J. S. Hey]].&lt;ref name="astronomer_110"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2005Gunn"&gt;Gunn, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to use the equipment in [[Manchester]] but [[Electromagnetic interference|electrical interference]] from the trams on [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] prevented him from doing so. He moved the equipment to Jodrell Bank, {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of the city, on 10 December 1945.&lt;ref name="2005Gunn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="story_3"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Lovell's main research was transient radio echoes, which he confirmed were from [[ionisation|ionized]] meteor trails by October 1946.&lt;ref name="story_9"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The first staff were Alf Dean and Frank Foden who observed meteors observed with the naked eye while Lovell observed the electromagnetic signal using equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bernard Lovell |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21560524 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=18 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Lovell turned the radar on  – 14 December 1945 – the [[Geminids]] [[meteor shower]] was at a maximum.&lt;ref name="story_3"/&gt;

Over the next few years, Lovell accumulated more ex-military radio hardware, including a portable cabin, known as a "Park Royal" in the military (see [[Park Royal Vehicles]]). The first permanent building was near to the cabin and was named after it.&lt;ref name="story_9"/&gt;

Jodrell Bank is primarily used for investigating radio waves from the planets and stars.

== Searchlight telescope ==
A [[searchlight]] was loaned to Jodrell Bank in 1946 by the army;&lt;ref name="story_10"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; a broadside array was constructed on its mount by [[J. Clegg]].&lt;ref name="story_10"/&gt; It consisted of a number of [[Yagi antenna]]s.&lt;ref name="astronomer_129"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for astronomical observations in October 1946.&lt;ref name="astronomer_128"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 and 10 October 1946, the telescope observed [[ionisation]] in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the [[Giacobinids]] meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were from meteors.&lt;ref name="astronomer_129"/&gt; The telescope was then used to determine the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it.&lt;ref name="story_10"/&gt; The telescope and other receivers on the site, studied [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral streamer]]s that were visible in early August 1947.&lt;ref name="story_15"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astronomer_186"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transit Telescope ==
&lt;!-- [[:fr:Télescope Transit]] --&gt;
The Transit Telescope was a {{convert|218|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[parabolic reflector]] [[zenith telescope]] built in 1947. At the time, it was the world's largest [[radio telescope]]. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[scaffolding|scaffold poles]], which focussed radio signals on a [[focus (optics)|focal point]] {{convert|126|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ground. The telescope mainly looked directly upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point.

In the following years, the telescope tracked various space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the United States' [[NASA]]-launched [[Pioneer 5]] probe. The telescope sent commands to the probe, including those to separate it from its carrier rocket and turn on its more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It received data from the probe, the only telescope in the world capable of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. xii, pp. 239–244&lt;br /&gt;Lovell, ''Astronomer by Chance'', p. 272&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894817,00.html | title=Voice in Space | publisher=Time Magazine | date=21 March 1960 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827621,00.html | title=Big Voice from Space | publisher=[[Time Magazine]] | date=23 May 1960 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track its unmanned moon lander [[Luna 9]] and recorded on its [[Fax|facsimile]] transmission of photographs from the moon's surface.

== Mark II and III telescopes ==
{{main|Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark III (radio telescope)}}
[[Image:Jodrell Bank Mark II.jpg|thumb|The [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II]] radio telescope]]
The Mark II is an elliptical radio telescope, with a major axis {{convert|38.1|m|ft}} and a minor axis of {{convert|25.4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="jbo_mk2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/mk2.html | title=The MKII Radio Telescope | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-06-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221041/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/mk2.html | archivedate=27 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed in 1964. As well as operating as a standalone telescope, it has been used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope, and is now primarily used as part of the [[MERLIN]] project.&lt;ref name="interferometer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/about/layman/quest.html | title=The quest for the resolving power | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Mark III (radio telescope)|Mark III telescope]], the same size as the Mark II, was constructed to be transportable&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;Palmer and Rowson (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was never moved from [[Wardle, Cheshire|Wardle]], near [[Nantwich]], where it was used as part of [[MERLIN]].

== Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals ==
[[Image:Mark V radio telescope model.jpg|thumb|upright|A model of the proposed Mark V radio telescope]]
The Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals were put forward in the 1960s through to the 1980s to build even larger radio telescopes.

The Mark IV proposal was for a {{convert|1000|ft|m}} diameter standalone telescope, built as a national project.

The Mark V  proposal was for a {{convert|400|ft|m}} moveable telescope. The concept of this proposal was for a telescope on a 3/4-mile long railway line adjoining Jodrell Bank but concerns about future levels of interference meant that a site in Wales would have been preferable.  Design proposals by Husband and Co and Freeman Fox, who had designed the [[Parkes Observatory]] telescope were put forward.

The Mark VA was similar to the Mark V but with a smaller dish of {{convert|375|ft|m}} and a design using [[prestressed concrete]], similar to the Mark II (the previous two designs more closely resembled the Lovell telescope).&lt;ref name="jb_telescopes"&gt;Lovell, ''Jodrell Bank Telescopes''&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the proposed telescopes was constructed, although design studies were carried out and scale models were made, partly because of the changing political climate, partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK and it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which overran in terms of cost.&lt;ref name="jb_telescopes"/&gt;

The 42&amp;nbsp;ft (12.8&amp;nbsp;m) dish is mainly used to observe pulsars, and continually monitors the [[Crab Pulsar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/Pulsars.html | title=Jodrell Bank—Pulsars | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory|accessdate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 42&amp;nbsp;ft was installed, a smaller dish, the "7&amp;nbsp;m" (actually 6.4 m, or 21&amp;nbsp;ft, in diameter) was installed and is used for undergraduate teaching. The 42&amp;nbsp;ft and 7&amp;nbsp;m telescopes were originally used at the [[Woomera Rocket Testing Range]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/tour/lobs.html | title=JBO—Lovell Observing Room | accessdate=2007-06-10 | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720151959/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/tour/lobs.html | archivedate=20 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7&amp;nbsp;m was originally constructed in 1970 by [[Marconi Company]].&lt;ref name="7m"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/7m/7m_telescope.html | title=NRAL—7&amp;nbsp;m Telescope | accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Polar Axis telescope was built in 1962. It had a circular 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15.2&amp;nbsp;m) dish on a [[polar mount]],&lt;ref name="jbtelescopes_232"&gt;Lovell, ''Jodrell Bank Telescopes'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and was mostly used for moon radar experiments. It has been decommissioned.

== MERLIN ==
{{main|MERLIN}}
The Multi-Element Radio Linked [[Interferometer]] Network (MERLIN) is an array of [[radio telescope]]s spread across England and the Welsh borders. The array is run from Jodrell Bank on behalf of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] as a National Facility.&lt;ref name="merlin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/ | title=MERLIN/VLBI National Facility | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The array consists of up to seven [[radio telescope]]s and includes the Lovell Telescope, the Mark II, [[Cambridge]], [[Defford]], [[Knockin]], [[Darnhall]], and [[Pickmere]] (previously known as [[Tabley Superior|Tabley]]). The longest baseline is {{convert|217|km|mi}} and MERLIN can operate at [[Frequency|frequencies]] between 151 [[Megahertz|MHz]] and 24 [[Hertz|GHz]].&lt;ref name="merlin_locations"/&gt; At a [[wavelength]] of 6&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency), MERLIN has a resolution of 50&amp;nbsp;milli[[arcsecond]]s which is comparable to that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] at optical wavelengths.&lt;ref name="merlin"/&gt;

== Very Long Baseline Interferometry ==
{{main|European VLBI Network|Very Long Baseline Interferometry}}
Jodrell Bank has been involved with [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes at [[Algonquin Radio Observatory|Algonquin]] and [[Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory|Penticton]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="zenith_67"&gt;Lovell, ''Out of the Zenith'', pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the [[European VLBI Network]]), giving a resolution of around 0.001 [[arcseconds]].&lt;ref name="interferometer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/booklet/Merlin.html|title=The Merlin and VLBI National Facility|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory|accessdate=2009-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501163251/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/booklet/Merlin.html|archivedate=1 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof Ralph Spencer was Acting Director during 2009 and 2010. In October 2010, Prof. Albert Zijlstra became Director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. Professor Lucio Piccirillo was the Director of the Observatory from Oct 2010 to Oct 2011 when Prof Simon Garrington became its managing director.

In May 2017 Jodrell Bank entered into a partnership with the [[Breakthrough Listen]] initiative and will share information with Jodrell Bank’s team, who wish to conduct an independent SETI search via its 76-m radio telescope and e-MERLIN array.

There is an active development programme researching and constructing telescope receivers and instrumentation. The observatory has been involved in the construction of several [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] experiments, including the [[Tenerife Experiment]], which ran from the 1980s to 2000, and the amplifiers and cryostats for the [[Very Small Array]].&lt;ref name="vsa_cryostats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/technology/vsa.html | title=JBO—VSA Receivers | accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also constructed the front-end modules of the 30 and 44&amp;nbsp;GHz receivers for the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="jb_bigbang"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/BigBang.html | title=Jodrell Bank—Observing the Big Bang | accessdate=2007-06-10|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receivers were also designed at Jodrell Bank for the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes Telescope]] in Australia.&lt;ref name="jodrellbank_anatomy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/anatomy.html | title=Jodrell Bank—Anatomy of a Radio Telescope | accessdate=2007-06-10 | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016100922/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/anatomy.html | archivedate=16 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, work on a new visitor centre started and the Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre opened on 11 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-12998614 | title=Jodrell Bank unveils £3m discovery centre | accessdate=2012-05-25 | work=BBC News | date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes an entrance building, the Planet Pavilion, a Space Pavilion for exhibitions and events, a glass-walled cafe with a view of the Lovell Telescope and an outdoor dining area, an education space, and landscaped gardens including the Galaxy Maze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/visitorcentre/ | title=Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre is being redeveloped | accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[orrery]] was installed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-21936801 | title=Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre unveils 'world's biggest' orrery | accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visitor centre is open to daily and organises public outreach events, including public lectures, star parties, and "ask an astronomer" sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.net/events/ | title=Jodrell Bank Observatory Visitors Centre—Events | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2012-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516183514/http://www.jodrellbank.net/events/ | archivedate=16 May 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A path around the Lovell telescope is approximately 20&amp;nbsp;m from the telescope's outer railway, information boards explain how the telescope works and the research that is done with it.

The {{convert|35|acre|m2}} [[arboretum]], created in 1972, houses the UK's national collections of [[crab apple]] ''Malus'' and [[Sorbus|mountain ash]] ''Sorbus'' species, and the Heather Society's ''[[Calluna]]'' collection. The arboretum also has a small [[scale model]] of the [[solar system]], the scale is approximately 1:5,000,000,000. At Jodrell Bank, as part of the ''SpacedOut'' project, is the Sun in a 1:15,000,000 scale model of the solar system covering Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spacedout-uk.com/solar_system/solar_info.asp?site_id=2 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051213212326/http://www.spacedout-uk.com/solar_system/solar_info.asp?site_id=2 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2005-12-13 | title=SpacedOut Location: The Sun at Jodrell Bank | accessdate=2007-06-08 | publisher=SpacedOut }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2010, it was announced that the observatory was being considered for the 2011 United Kingdom Tentative List for [[World Heritage Site]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7221.aspx | title = Applicants for UK Tentative World Heritage Status | accessdate = 2010-09-04 | publisher = Department for Culture Media and Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 22 March 2011 that it was on the UK government's shortlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/22/uk-nominations-world-heritage-status | title=UK nominates 11 sites for Unesco world heritage status | publisher=Guardian | date=22 March 2011 | accessdate=2011-03-22 | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, it became the UK's candidate for World Heritage status.&lt;ref name=Unesco_2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unesco.org.uk/news/jodrell-bank-selected-as-next-uk-nomination-for-world-heritage-site-status/ |title=Jodrell Bank selected as next UK nomination for UNESCO World Heritage Site status |publisher=The United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO |date=2018 |accessdate=22 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 the visitor centre and observatory hosted "Jodrell Bank Live" – a rock concert with bands including [[The Flaming Lips]], [[British Sea Power]], [[Wave Machines]], [[OK GO]] and [[Alice Gold]].&lt;ref name="jblive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbanklive.co.uk/shows | title=Shows: Live from Jodrell Bank | accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2012 Elbow performed live at the observatory and filmed a documentary of the event and the facility which was released as a live CD/DVD of the concert.

On 31 August 2013 Jodrell Bank hosted a concert performed by the [[Halle Orchestra]] to commemorate what would have been Lovell's 100th birthday. As well as a number of operatic performances during the day, the evening Halle performance saw numbers such as themes from [[Star Trek]], [[Star Wars]] and [[Doctor Who]] among others. The main Lovell telescope was rotated to face the onlooking crowd and used as a huge projection screen showing various animated planetary effects. During the interval the 'screen' was used to show a history of Lovell's work and Jodrell Bank.

There is an astronomy [[podcast]] from the observatory, named ''The [[Jodcast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodcast.net | title=The Jodcast | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory| accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Stargazing Live]]'' is hosted in the control room of the observatory. The programme has had four series, in January 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20958297 |publisher=BBC News |title=Stargazing Live: Behind the scenes at Jodrell Bank |accessdate= 14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, the observatory will hold [[Bluedot Festival|Bluedot]], a music and science festival, featuring [[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Jim Al-Khalili]] and [[Richard Dawkins]].

==Planetarium==
Jodrell Bank's visitor centre had a [[planetarium]] until 2003, when it and much else was demolished because of risk of [[asbestos]]. The planetarium projector was one-ended, with one star ball, and it could not show stars near the south pole.

Currently (as at 2018) they only have a small inflatable planetarium dome.

A new planetarium with a computer-generated display will be built in the arboretum, starting in February or March 2019.

== Threat of closure ==
On 3 March 2008, it was reported that Britain's [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC), faced with an £80 million shortfall in its budget, was considering withdrawing its planned £2.7 million annual funding of Jodrell Bank's [[MERLIN#e-MERLIN|e-MERLIN]] project. The project, which aims to replace the [[microwave]] links between Jodrell Bank and a number of other radio telescopes with high-bandwidth [[Optical fiber|fibre-optic]] cables, greatly increasing the sensitivity of observations, is seen as critical to the survival of the establishment in its present form. Sir [[Bernard Lovell]] was quoted as saying "It will be a disaster … The fate of the Jodrell Bank telescope is bound up with the fate of e-MERLIN. I don't think the establishment can survive if the e-MERLIN funding is cut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7281176.stm | title=Jodrell Bank fears funding loss | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date= 6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3500905.ece | title=Professor Sir Bernard Lovell condemns 'disastrous' plan to close Jodrell Bank | publisher=[[The Times]] | date=7 March 2008 | location=London | first1=Lewis | last1=Smith | first2=Sam | last2=Coates | accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 14 April 2008, Cheshire's [[106.9 Silk FM]] unveiled to its listeners their own campaign song to save Jodrell Bank, entitled "The Jodrell Bank Song" and sung by a group dubbed "The Astronomers". Along with the song, the Silk FM team also produced a music video filmed in front of the iconic Lovell telescope. Silk FM released the song for download from Monday 21 April 2008. All proceeds went towards saving Jodrell Bank.

On 9 July 2008, it was reported that, following an independent review, the STFC had reversed its initial position and would after all guarantee funding of £2.5 million annually for three years.&lt;ref name="timesrescuedeal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal to rescue Jodrell Bank helps Britain see its future in the stars |publisher=The Times |date=9 July 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article4297239.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional references ==
Jodrell Bank has been mentioned {{clarify|date=June 2015}} in several popular works of fiction, including [[Doctor Who]] (''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'', ''[[The Poison Sky]]'', ''[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]''). It was intended to be a filming location for ''[[Logopolis]]'' ([[Tom Baker]]'s final ''Doctor Who'' serial) but budget restrictions prevented this and another location with a superimposed model of a radio telescope was used instead. It was also mentioned in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''&lt;ref name="hitchhiker"&gt;Adams, ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', p. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; (as well as [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' film]]), ''[[The Creeping Terror]]'' and ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]''. Jodrell Bank also featured heavily in the music video to ''[[Electric Light Orchestra]]'''s 1983 single ''[[Secret Messages]]''. The [[Prefab Sprout]] song Technique (from debut album Swoon) opens with the line "Her husband works at Jodrell Bank/He's home late in the morning".

The Observatory is the site of several episodes in the novel ''[[Boneland]]'', by [[Alan Garner]] (2012), and the central character, Colin Whisterfield, is an astrophysicist on its staff.

==Appraisal==
Since 13 July 1988 the Lovell Telescope has been designated as a Grade I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1221685|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Lovell Telescope|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 July 2017 the [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II Telescope]] was also designated at the same grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443087|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Mark II Telescope|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the same date five other buildings on the site were designated at Grade II; namely the Searchlight Telescope,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443133|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: 71MHz Searchlight Aerial|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Control Building,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443868|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Control Building|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Park Royal Building,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443093|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Park Royal Building|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Electrical Workshop,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1444238|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Electrical Workshop (Former Main Office)|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Link Hut.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443486|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Link Hut (Cosmic Noise Hut)|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grade I is the highest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to buildings that are of "exceptional interest", and Grade&amp;nbsp;II, the lowest grade, is applied to buildings "of special interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/| title = What is Listing? | accessdate = 16 July 2017| publisher = Historic England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Altman''' (1925 – 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bayer|first1=Shirley A.|title=Joseph Altman (1925-2016): A life in neurodevelopment|pmid=27294721|website=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|pages=2933–2943|doi=10.1002/cne.24058|date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Americans|American]] biologist who worked in the field of [[neurobiology]].

== From an emigree librarian to a scientist ==
Born in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] to a Jewish family, he survived the [[Holocaust]] and migrated with his family via Germany and Australia to the United States. In these places, he sought employment as a librarian and used the opportunity to inform himself reading books about psychology, human behavior, psychoanalysis, and human brain structure. In New York, where he married his first wife Elizabeth Altman, he became a graduate student in psychology in the laboratory of Hans-Lukas Teuber, earning a PhD.,in 1959 from New York University. That degree launched his scientific career, first as a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University, next at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and finally at Purdue University. During his career, he collaborated closely with his second wife,  Shirley A. Bayer.  From the early 1960s to 2016, he published many articles in peer-reviewed journals, books, monographs, and online free books that emphasized developmental processes in brain anatomy and function.

==Discovery of adult neurogenesis==
Joseph Altman discovered [[adult neurogenesis]], the creation of new [[neuron]]s in the adult brain, in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Altman &amp; G. Das, "Postnatal Neurogenesis in the Guinea-pig", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 214, 1098–1101 (10 June 1967). {{doi|10.1038/2141098a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an independent investigator at [[MIT]], his results were largely ignored in favor of [[Pasko Rakic]]'s findings that neurogenesis is limited to pre-natal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rakic|first=Pasko|title=Neurons in rhesus monkey visual cortex: systematic relation between time of origin and eventual disposition.|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=1 February 1974|volume=183|issue=4123|pages=425–7|pmid=4203022|doi=10.1126/science.183.4123.425}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=January 2012}} By the late 1990s, a [[paradigm shift]] had occurred. The fact that the [[brain]] can create new neurons even into adulthood was rediscovered by [[Elizabeth Gould (psychologist)|Elizabeth Gould]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=E|author2=Reeves, AJ |author3=Graziano, MS |author4= Gross, CG |title=Neurogenesis in the neocortex of adult primates.|journal=Science|date=15 October 1999|volume=286|issue=5439|pages=548–52|pmid=10521353|doi=10.1126/science.286.5439.548}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading it to be one of the hottest fields in [[neuroscience]]. Adult neurogenesis has recently been proven to occur in the dentate gyrus, olfactory bulb and striatum through the measurement of Carbon-14—the levels of which changed during nuclear bomb testing throughout the 20th century—in postmortem human brains.&lt;ref&gt;Leonie Welberg, "A striatal supply of new neurons", ''[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]]'', 15, 203 (05 March 2014). {{doi|10.1038/nrn3714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Ciconiiformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is incomprehensive, as not all Ciconiiformes have had their numbers quantified. The classification of this order of birds is [[Ciconiiformes#Taxonomic issues with Ciconiiformes|currently in flux]]; the classification for this list is aligned with the [[IUCN]]'s current position, but may change in the future.
{{-}}

Furthermore, some species currently listed below are no longer considered Ciconiformes; they have been reclassified under [[Pelecaniformes]] (e.g. the Black-crowned night heron, listed below). Click the species page for a more definitive classification.

On the [[Eiffel Tower]], seventy-two names of [[France|French]] scientists, engineers, and mathematicians are engraved in recognition of their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 72 Scientists|url=http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/teiffel/uk/documentation/dossiers/page/savants.html|publisher=La Tour Eiffel|accessdate=31 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215224304/http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/teiffel/uk/documentation/dossiers/page/savants.html|archivedate=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave Eiffel]] chose this "invocation of science" because of his concern over the [[Eiffel_Tower#Artists'_protest|protests]] against the tower.&lt;ref name="Harriss1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harriss |first=Joseph |title=The Tallest Tower: Eiffel And The Belle Epoque |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vv3dT-kyuu8C&amp;pg=PA80 |year=1975 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0395204402 |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engravings are found on the sides of the tower under the first balcony, in letters about 60&amp;nbsp;cm high, and originally painted in gold.
The engraving was painted over at the beginning of the twentieth century and restored in 1986–1987 by Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, the company contracted by the city of [[Paris]] to operate the Tower. The repainting of 2010–2011 restored the letters to their original gold colour.

There are also names of the engineers who helped build the tower and design its architecture on the top of the tower on a plaque, where a laboratory was built as well.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== List ==

=== Location ===
The list is split in four parts (for each side of the tower). The sides have been named after the parts of Paris that each side faces:
* The North-East side (also known as La Bourdonnais side)

== Criticism ==

=== Women ===
The list contains no women. The list has been criticized for excluding the name of [[Sophie Germain]], a noted French mathematician whose work on the theory of elasticity was used in the construction of the tower itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gray |first=Mary |title=Sophie Germain (1776–1831) |encyclopedia=Women of Mathematics: A Bibliographic Sourcebook |editors=Louise S. Grinstein and Paul Campbell |publisher=Greenwood |date=1978 |isbn=978-0-313-24849-8 |pages=47–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, [[John Augustine Zahm]] suggested that Germain was excluded because she was a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mozen |first=H.

=== Hydraulic engineers and scholars ===
14 hydraulic engineers and scholars are listed on the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel acknowledged most of the leading scientists in the field. [[Henry Darcy|Henri Philibert Gaspard Darcy]] is missing; some of his work did not come into wide use until the 20th century. Also missing are [[Antoine Chézy]], who was less famous; [[Joseph Valentin Boussinesq]], who was  early in his career at the time;&lt;ref name="Chanson2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chanson |first=Hubert |editor=Jerry R.

==Attaining maximum density==
Almost all known substances undergo [[thermal expansion]] in response to heating, meaning that a given mass of substance contracts to a low volume at low [[temperature]]s, when little [[thermal energy]] is present.  Substances, especially [[fluid]]s in which [[intermolecular force]]s are weak, also undergo [[compression (physical)|compression]] upon the application of [[pressure]].  Nearly all substances therefore reach a density maximum at very low temperatures and very high pressures, characteristic properties of the [[solid]] [[State of matter|state]] of [[matter]].

==Water==

An especially notable irregular maximum density is that of [[water]], which reaches a density peak at {{convert|3.98|°C|°F}}.

In biology, '''mineralization''' refers to a process where an inorganic substance precipitates in an organic matrix.  This may be due to normal biological processes that take place during the life of an organism such as the formation of bones, egg shells, teeth, coral, and other exoskeletons. This term may also refer to abnormal processes that result in kidney and gall stones.

== Types of Mineralization ==
'''Mineralization''' can be subdivided into different categories depending on the following: the organisms or processes that create chemical conditions necessary for mineral formation, the origin of the substrate at the site of mineral precipitation, and the degree of control that the substrate has on crystal morphology, composition, and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Processes of carbonate precipitation in modern microbial mats|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825208001190|journal = Earth-Science Reviews|date = 2009-10-01|pages = 141–162|volume = 96|series = Microbial Mats in Earth's Fossil Record of Life: Geobiology|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2008.10.005|first = Christophe|last = Dupraz|first2 = R. Pamela|last2 = Reid|first3 = Olivier|last3 = Braissant|first4 = Alan W.|last4 = Decho|first5 = R. Sean|last5 = Norman|first6 = Pieter T.|last6 = Visscher}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subcategories include: biomineralization, organomineralization, and inorganic mineralization, which can be subdivided further. However, usage of these terms vary widely in scientific literature because there are no standardized definitions.The following definitions are based largely on a paper written by Dupraz et al. (2009), which provided a framework for differentiating these terms.

=== Biomineralization ===
[[Biomineralization]], '''biologically-controlled''' '''mineralization,''' occurs when crystal morphology, growth, composition, and location is completely controlled by the cellular processes of a specific organism. Examples include the shells of invertebrates, such as [[Mollusca|molluscs]] and [[brachiopod]]s. Additionally, mineralization of collagen provides the crucial compressive strength for the bones, cartilage, and teeth of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sherman |first=Vincent R. |title=The materials science of collagen |journal=Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials |volume=52 |pages=22–50 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.05.023 |pmid=26144973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organomineralization ===
This type of mineralization includes both '''biologically-induced mineralization''' and '''biologically-influenced''' mineralization.
* '''Biologically-induced mineralization''' occurs when the metabolic activity of microbes (e.g. [[bacteria]]) produces chemical conditions favorable for mineral formation. The substrate for mineral growth is the organic matrix, secreted by the microbial community, and affects crystal morphology and composition. Examples of this type of mineralization include [[calcareous]] or siliceous [[stromatolite]]s and other [[microbial mat]]s. A more specific type of biologically-induced mineralization, '''remote calcification''' or '''remote mineralization''', takes place when calcifying microbes occupy a shell secreting organism and alter the chemical environment surrounding the area of shell formation. The result is mineral formation not strongly controlled by the cellular processes of the metazoan host (i.e. remote mineralization), and may lead to unique or unusual crystal morphologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The oyster enigma variations: a hypothesis of microbial calcification|url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1666/13002|journal = Paleobiology|date = 2013-09-27|issn = 0094-8373|pages = 1–13|volume = 40|issue = 1|doi = 10.1666/13002|first = Geerat J.|last = Vermeij}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Biologically-influenced mineralization''' takes place when chemical conditions surrounding the site of mineral formation are influenced by abiotic processes (e.g. evaporation or degassing). However, the organic matrix (secreted by microorganisms) is responsible for crystal morphology and composition. Examples include micro- to nano-meter scale crystals of various morphologies.

=== Inorganic mineralization ===
Inorganic mineralization is a completely abiotic process. Chemical conditions necessary for mineral formation develop via environmental processes, such as evaporation or degassing. Furthermore, the substrate for mineral deposition is abiotic (i.e. contains no organic compounds) and there is no control on crystal morphology or composition. Examples of this type of mineralization include cave formations, such as [[stalagmite]]s and [[stalactite]]s.

Biological mineralization can also take place as a result of [[fossilization]]. 
See also [[calcification]].

Bone mineralization occurs in human body by cells called [[osteoblasts]].{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Simple Periodic Table Chart-en.svg|thumb|upright=2]]

The '''periodic table''', or '''periodic table of elements''', is a tabular arrangement of the [[chemical element]]s, ordered by their [[atomic number]], [[electron configuration]], and recurring [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], whose structure shows ''[[periodic trends]]''. Generally, within one row (period) the elements are [[metal]]s to the left, and [[non-metals]] to the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours placed in the same column. Table rows are commonly called [[Periodic table period|periods]] and columns are called [[Group (periodic table)|groups]]. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the [[halogen]]s; and group 18 are the [[noble gas]]es. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or [[block (periodic table)|blocks]] associated with the filling of different [[atomic orbital]]s.

The organization of the periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the various element properties, but also the predicted chemical properties and behaviours of undiscovered or newly synthesized elements. Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] was the first to publish a recognizable periodic table in 1869, developed mainly to illustrate periodic trends of the then-known elements. He also predicted some properties of [[Dmitri Mendeleev's predicted elements|unidentified elements]] that were expected to fill gaps within the table. Most of his forecasts proved to be correct. Mendeleev's idea has been slowly expanded and refined with [[element discovery|the discovery or synthesis of further new elements]] and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour. The modern periodic table now provides a useful framework for analyzing [[chemical reactions]], and continues to be widely used in [[chemistry]], [[nuclear physics]] and other sciences.

All the elements from atomic numbers 1 ([[hydrogen]]) through 118 ([[oganesson]]) have been either discovered or synthesized, completing the first seven rows of the periodic table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35220823|title=Chemistry: Four elements added to periodic table|newspaper=BBC News|date=January 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104125144/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35220823|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nicholas|last=St. Fleur|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/science/periodic-table-new-elements.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront|title=Four New Names Officially Added to the Periodic Table of Elements|work=New York Times|date=December 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814221055/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/science/periodic-table-new-elements.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 98 elements exist in nature, although some are found only in trace amounts and others were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature.{{#tag:ref|The elements discovered initially by synthesis and later in nature are technetium (Z=43), promethium (61), astatine (85), neptunium (93), plutonium (94), americium (95), curium (96), berkelium (97) and californium (98).|group=n}} Elements 99 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name="emsley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=J.|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is currently being pursued: these elements would begin an [[extended periodic table|eighth row]], and theoretical work has been done to suggest possible candidates for this extension.

==Overview==
{{for|a more detailed periodic table|Periodic table (detailed cells)}}
{{Periodic table}}

Each chemical element has a unique atomic number (''Z'') representing the number of protons in its nucleus.{{#tag:ref|An [[neutronium|element zero]] (i.e. a substance composed purely of neutrons), is included in a few alternate presentations, for example, in the [[Chemical Galaxy]].|group=n}} Most elements have differing numbers of [[neutron]]s among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as [[isotope]]s. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the standard periodic table, the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number ''Z'' (the number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom). A new row ([[Period (periodic table)|''period'']]) is started when a new [[electron shell]] has its first electron. Columns ([[Group (periodic table)|''groups'']]) are determined by the [[electron configuration]] of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. [[oxygen]] and [[selenium]] are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2016}}, the periodic table has 118 confirmed elements, from element 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson). Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) in December 2015. Their proposed names, nihonium (Nh), moscovium (Mc), tennessine (Ts) and oganesson (Og) respectively, were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 and made official in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/08/health/periodic-table-new-elements-names/index.html|title=New elements on the periodic table are named|last=CNN|first=Ashley Strickland|website=CNN|access-date=2016-06-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610215843/http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/08/health/periodic-table-new-elements-names/index.html|archivedate=10 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iupac.org/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118/|title=Discovery and assignment of elements with atomic numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118|publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|date=2015-12-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613223413/http://iupac.org/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118/|archivedate=13 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/09/481410462/hello-nihonium-scientists-name-4-new-elements-on-the-periodic-table|title=Hello, Nihonium.

The first 94 elements occur naturally; the remaining 24, americium to oganesson (95–118), occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are [[primordial element|primordial]] and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements.&lt;ref name="emsley"/&gt; No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) has ever been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed in the form of light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss| editor1-first=L.

==Grouping methods==

===Groups===
{{Main|Group (periodic table)}}
A ''group'' or ''family'' is a vertical column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their [[valence shell]].&lt;ref&gt;Scerri 2007, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, elements in the same group tend to have a shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Messler|first=R. W.|title=The essence of materials for engineers|year=2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=978-0-7637-7833-0|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bagnall|first=K. W.|year=1967|contribution=Recent advances in actinide and lanthanide chemistry|title=Advances in chemistry, Lanthanide/Actinide chemistry|volume=71|pages=1–12|publisher=American Chemical Society|doi=10.1021/ba-1967-0071|editor1-first=P. R.|editor1-last=Fields|editor2-first=T.|editor2-last=Moeller |series=Advances in Chemistry |isbn=978-0-8412-0072-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Day|first1=M. C., Jr.|last2=Selbin|first2=J.|title=Theoretical inorganic chemistry|year=1969|publisher=Nostrand-Rienhold Book Corporation|edition=2nd|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7637-7833-0|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holman|first1=J.|last2=Hill|first2=G.

Under an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases).&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: IUPAC Recommendations 2005|last1=Connelly |first1=N.

In America, the roman numerals were followed by either an "A" if the group was in the [[s-block|s-]] or [[p-block]], or a "B" if the group was in the [[d-block]]. The roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g. the [[group 4 element]]s were group IVB, and the [[group 14 element]]s were group IVA). In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that "A" was used if the group was before [[group 10 elements|group 10]], and "B" was used for groups including and after group 10. In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII. In 1988, the new IUPAC naming system was put into use, and the old group names were deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fluck |first1=E. |year=1988 |title=New Notations in the Periodic Table |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] |volume=60 |pages=431–436 |doi=10.1351/pac198860030431 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf |accessdate=24 March 2012 |issue=3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325152951/http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these groups have been given [[Collective names of groups of like elements|trivial (unsystematic) names]], as seen in the table below, although some are rarely used. Groups 3–10 have no trivial names and are referred to simply by their group numbers or by the name of the first member of their group (such as "the scandium group" for [[Group 3 element|group 3]]),&lt;ref name="IUPAC" /&gt; since they display fewer similarities and/or vertical trends.

Elements in the same group tend to show patterns in [[atomic radius]], [[ionization energy]], and [[electronegativity]]. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it is easier to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus.&lt;ref name="For Dummies"&gt;Moore, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; There are exceptions to these trends: for example, in [[group 11 element|group 11]], electronegativity increases farther down the group.&lt;ref name="Greenwood30"/&gt;

{{Periodic table (group names)}}

===Periods===
{{Main|Period (periodic table)}}
A ''period'' is a horizontal row in the periodic table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s form two substantial horizontal series of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stoker|first=S. H.|title=General, organic, and biological chemistry|year=2007|page=68|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-618-73063-6|oclc=52445586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements in the same period show trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, [[electron affinity]], and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mascetta |first=J. |title=Chemistry The Easy Way |year=2003|publisher=Hauppauge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7641-1978-1 |oclc=52047235|edition=4th |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases in the same manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus.&lt;ref name="For Dummies"/&gt; Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kotz |first1=J. |last2=Treichel |first2=P.|last3=Townsend |first3=John |title=Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity, Volume 2|edition=7th |year=2009|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont |isbn=978-0-495-38712-1 |oclc=220756597 |page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blocks===
{{Main|Block (periodic table)}}
[[File:Periodic table blocks spdf (32 column).svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Left to right: s-, f-, d-, p-block in the periodic table]]
Specific regions of the periodic table can be referred to as ''blocks'' in recognition of the sequence in which the electron shells of the elements are filled. Each block is named according to the subshell in which the "last" electron notionally resides.&lt;ref name="Gray12"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|There is an inconsistency and some irregularities in this convention. Thus, helium is shown in the p-block but is actually an s-block element, and (for example) the d-subshell in the d-block is actually filled by the time group 11 is reached, rather than group 12.|group=n}} The [[s-block]] comprises the first two groups (alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) as well as hydrogen and helium. The [[p-block]] comprises the last six groups, which are groups 13 to 18 in IUPAC group numbering (3A&amp;nbsp;to 8A in American group numbering) and contains, among other elements, all of the [[metalloid]]s. The [[d-block]] comprises groups 3 to 12 (or&amp;nbsp;3B to 2B in American group numbering) and contains all of the [[transition metals]]. The [[f-block]], often offset below the rest of the periodic table, has no group numbers and comprises lanthanides and actinides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=C. |title=d- and f-block chemistry |year=2002 |publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-22476-1|oclc=300468713 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metals, metalloids and nonmetals===
[[File:Periodic table (metals–metalloids–nonmetals, 32 columns).png|upright=1.36|right|thumb
|{{legend inline|1={{element color|metals}}|2=Metals|border=none}}, {{legend inline|1={{element color|metalloids}}|2=metalloids|border=none}}, {{legend inline|1={{element color|nonmetals}}|2=nonmetals|border=none}}, and {{nowrap|{{legend inline|1={{element color|unknown chemical properties}}|2=elements with unknown chemical properties|border=none}}}} in the periodic table. Sources disagree on the classification of some of these elements.]]
According to their shared physical and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of [[metal]]s, [[metalloid]]s and [[nonmetal]]s. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys with one another and salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than [[noble gas]]es). A majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature [[covalent bond]]ing. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Silberberg|first=M. S.|title=Chemistry: The molecular nature of matter and change|year=2006|page=536|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-07-111658-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal and nonmetals can be further classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals may be subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. Nonmetals may be simply subdivided into the [[Nonmetal#Polyatomic nonmetals|polyatomic nonmetals]], being nearer to the metalloids and show some incipient metallic character; the essentially nonmetallic [[Nonmetal#Diatomic nonmetals|diatomic nonmetals]], nonmetallic and the almost completely inert, monatomic noble gases. Specialized groupings such as [[refractory metals]] and [[noble metals]], are examples of subsets of transition metals, also known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manson|first1=S. S.|last2=Halford|first2=G. R.|title=Fatigue and durability of structural materials|year=2006|page=376|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|isbn=978-0-87170-825-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally denoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bullinger|first=H-J.|title=Technology guide: Principles, applications, trends|year=2009|page=8|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-88545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placing elements into categories and subcategories based just on shared properties is imperfect. There is a large disparity of properties within each category with notable overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones|first=B. W.|title=Pluto: Sentinel of the outer solar system|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-19436-5|pages=169–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. [[Radon]] is classified as a nonmetallic noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is characteristic of metals. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into [[Goldschmidt classification|mineralogical occurrence categories]], or [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|crystalline structures]]. Categorizing the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when [[Gustavus Detlef Hinrichs|Hinrichs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinrichs|first=G. D.|title=On the classification and the atomic weights of the so-called chemical elements, with particular reference to Stas's determinations|journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=1869|volume=18|issue=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vj1SAAAAcAAJ|pages=112–124|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802141046/https://books.google.com/books?id=vj1SAAAAcAAJ|archivedate=2 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that simple boundary lines could be placed on the periodic table to show elements having shared properties, such as metals, nonmetals, or gaseous elements.

The electrons occupy a series of [[electron shell]]s (numbered 1, 2, and so on). Each shell consists of one or more [[Electron shell#Subshells|subshells]] (named s, p, d, f and g). As [[atomic number]] increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the [[Madelung rule]] or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The electron configuration for [[neon]], for example, is 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell; there are two electrons in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by [[hydrogen]] and the [[alkali metals]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |last=Myers|first=R.|title=The basics of chemistry|year=2003|pages=61–67|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-31664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chang2&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang|first=R.|title=Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=7|isbn=978-0-07-112072-2|pages=289–310, 340–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Periodic trends.png|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Periodic table trends (arrows show an increase)]]

Since the properties of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, the properties of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner|were noticed well before]] the [[Niels Bohr|underlying theory was developed]], that led to the establishment of the periodic law (the properties of the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;ref name=chang2/&gt;

===Atomic radii===
{{main|Atomic radius}}
[[File:Empirical atomic radius trends.png|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Atomic number plotted against atomic radius{{#tag:ref|The noble gases, astatine, francium, and all elements heavier than [[americium]] were left out as there is no data for them.|group=n}}]]
Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood27"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrons in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled across the [[lanthanide]] series, are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them.&lt;ref name="Jolly_contract"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence [[hafnium]] has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as [[zirconium]], and [[tantalum]] has an atomic radius similar to [[niobium]], and so forth. This is known as the [[lanthanide contraction]]. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to [[platinum]] (element 78), after which it is masked by a [[relativistic effect]] known as the [[inert pair effect]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood28"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The [[d-block contraction]], which is a similar effect between the [[d-block]] and [[p-block]], is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.&lt;ref name="Jolly_contract"/&gt;

===Ionization energy===
[[File:First Ionization Energy.svg|thumb|upright=2.27|right|Ionization energy: each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the noble gases]]

{{main|Ionization energy}}

The first ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove one electron from an atom, the second ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol and the second is 1450&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and to the right of the periodic table.&lt;ref name="Greenwood28"/&gt;

Large jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For magnesium again, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, for the removal of a 2p electron from the very stable [[neon]]-like configuration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.&lt;ref name="Greenwood28"/&gt;

===Electronegativity===
{{main|Electronegativity}}

[[Image:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Graph showing increasing electronegativity with growing number of selected groups]]

Electronegativity is the tendency of an [[atom]] to attract a shared pair of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its [[atomic number]] and the distance between the [[valence electrons]] and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by [[Linus Pauling]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="paulingJACS"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pauling, L. |authorlink=Linus Pauling |year= 1932 |journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] |volume= 54 |issue= 9 |pages= 3570–3582 |title= The Nature of the Chemical Bond. IV. The Energy of Single Bonds and the Relative Electronegativity of Atoms |doi= 10.1021/ja01348a011|bibcode=1932JAChS..54.2610C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, [[fluorine]] is the most electronegative of the elements,{{#tag:ref|While fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements under the [[Pauling scale]], [[neon]] is the most electronegative element under other scales, such as the [[Allen scale]].|group=n}} while [[caesium]]&lt;!-- not francium; please don't change unless you supply a citation for published experimental results --&gt; is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.&lt;ref name="Greenwood30"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some exceptions to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than [[aluminium]] and [[silicon]] respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity.&lt;ref name="Greenwood30"/&gt; The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to [[thallium]] and [[bismuth]], appears to be an artifact of data selection and data availability.  Methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allred |first=A. L. |year=1960 |title=Electronegativity values from thermochemical data |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022190261801425|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry |volume=17 |issue=3–4 |pages=215–221 |doi=10.1016/0022-1902(61)80142-5 |accessdate=11 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electron affinity===
{{main|Electron affinity}}
[[File:Electron affinity of the elements.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Dependence of electron affinity on atomic number.&lt;ref&gt;Huheey, Keiter &amp; Keiter, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Values generally increase across each period, culminating with the halogens before decreasing precipitously with the noble gases. Examples of localized peaks seen in hydrogen, the alkali metals and the [[group 11 elements]] are caused by a tendency to complete the s-shell (with the 6s shell of gold being further stabilized by relativistic effects and the presence of a filled 4f sub shell). Examples of localized troughs seen in the alkaline earth metals, and nitrogen, phosphorus, manganese and rhenium are caused by filled s-shells, or half-filled p- or d-shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Siekierski|first1=S.|last2=Burgess|first2=J.|title=Concise chemistry of the elements|publisher=Horwood Publishing|location=Chichester|year=2002|isbn=978-1-898563-71-6|pages=35‒36}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The electron affinity of an atom is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although electron affinity varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, [[nonmetals]] have more positive electron affinity values than [[metal]]s. [[Chlorine]] most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.&lt;ref name=chang&gt;Chang, pp. 307–309&lt;/ref&gt;

Electron affinity generally increases across a period. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;

A trend of decreasing electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital farther away from the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. In going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, this is due to the poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Huheey, Keiter &amp; Keiter, pp. 42, 880–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metallic character===
The lower the values of ionization energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more [[metal]]lic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yoder |first1=C. H.|last2=Suydam|first2= F. H.|last3=Snavely|first3=F. A. |year=1975 |title=Chemistry |page=58 |edition=2nd |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |isbn=978-0-15-506465-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]],&lt;ref&gt;Huheey, Keiter &amp; Keiter, pp. 880–85&lt;/ref&gt; tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as [[caesium]] and [[francium]]) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements ([[oxygen]], [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]]) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped [[dividing line between metals and nonmetals]] found on some periodic tables, and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as [[metalloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks|first=O.|title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a chemical boyhood|year=2009|publisher=Alfred A.

{{Main|History of the periodic table}}

===First systemization attempts===
[[File:Discovery of chemical elements.svg|upright=2.27|thumb|The [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the elements]] mapped to significant periodic table development dates (pre-, per- and post-)]]
In 1789, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] published a list of 33 [[chemical element]]s, grouping them into [[gas]]es, [[metal]]s, [[nonmetal]]s, and [[Earth (chemistry)|earths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From elements to atoms a history of chemical composition |last=Siegfried |first=R. |year=2002 |page=92 |publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data |isbn=978-0-87169-924-4 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]] observed that many of the elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. [[Lithium]], [[sodium]], and [[potassium]], for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals. Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third;&lt;ref name="Ball100"&gt;Ball, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; this became known as the [[Döbereiner's triads|Law of Triads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horvitz |first=L.|title=Eureka!: Scientific Breakthroughs That Changed The World |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-23341-1 |oclc=50766822 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; German chemist [[Leopold Gmelin]] worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.&lt;ref name="Ball100"/&gt;

In 1857, German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|August Kekulé]] observed that [[carbon]] often has four other atoms bonded to it. [[Methane]], for example, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Über die s. g. gepaarten Verbindungen und die Theorie der mehratomigen Radicale|author=Aug. Kekulé|journal=[[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]|year=1857|volume=104|issue=2|pages=129–150|doi= 10.1002/jlac.18571040202}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept eventually became known as [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]]; different elements bond with different numbers of atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Spronsen|first=J.

In 1862, [[Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois]], a French geologist, published an early form of periodic table, which he called the telluric helix or screw. He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of [[Dmitri Mendeleev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annales.org/archives/x/chancourtois.html|publisher=Annales des Mines history page|title=Alexandre-Emile Bélguier de Chancourtois (1820–1886)|accessdate=18 September 2014|language=French|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127153250/http://www.annales.org/archives/x/chancourtois.html|archivedate=27 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, [[Julius Lothar Meyer]], a German chemist, published a table with 44 elements arranged by valency. The table showed that elements with similar properties often shared the same valency.&lt;ref&gt;Venable, pp. 85–86, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, English chemist [[William Odling]] published an arrangement of 57 elements, ordered on the basis of their atomic weights. With some irregularities and gaps, he noticed what appeared to be a periodicity of atomic weights among the elements and that this accorded with "their usually received groupings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Odling |first=W.|title=On the proportional numbers of the elements|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science|year=2002 |volume=1|pages=642–648 (643)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odling alluded to the idea of a periodic law but did not pursue it.&lt;ref name="Scerri 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scerri|first=E.|title=The periodic table: A very short introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently proposed (in 1870) a valence-based classification of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaji |first=M. |editor1-first=D.

In 1867, [[Gustavus Detlef Hinrichs|Gustavus Hinrichs]], a Danish born academic chemist based in America, published a spiral periodic system based on atomic spectra and weights, and chemical similarities. His work was regarded as idiosyncratic, ostentatious and labyrinthine and this may have militated against its recognition and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Scerri 2007, pp. 87, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =American forerunners of the periodic law | last =Kauffman | first = G.

This early arrangement presents the periods vertically, and the groups horizontally.]]

Russian chemistry professor [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and German chemist [[Julius Lothar Meyer]] independently published their periodic tables in 1869 and 1870, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendelejew |first=D.|year=1869 |title=Über die Beziehungen der Eigenschaften zu den Atomgewichten der Elemente |journal=Zeitschrift für Chemie |pages=405–406 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Venable, pp. 96–97; 100–102&lt;/ref&gt; They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made. The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pullman |first=B. |title=The Atom in the History of Human Thought |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page=227 |isbn=978-0-19-515040-7|others=Translated by Axel Reisinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|missing elements]], such as [[gallium]] and [[germanium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the [[atomic weights]] and switch adjacent elements, such as [[tellurium]] and [[iodine]], to better classify them into [[Group (periodic table)|chemical families]].

Mendeleev published in 1869, using atomic weight to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough to allow Mendeleev to accurately predict the properties of missing elements.

Following the discovery, in 1911, by [[Ernest Rutherford]] of the atomic nucleus, it was proposed that the integer count of the nuclear charge is identical to the sequential place of each element in the periodic table. In 1913, [[Henry Moseley]] using [[X-ray spectroscopy]] confirmed this proposal experimentally. Moseley determined the value of the nuclear charge of each element, and showed that Mendeleev's ordering actually places the elements in sequential order by nuclear charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Periodic Kingdom |author=Atkins, P. W.|authorlink=P. W. Atkins |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc. |year=1995 |page=87|isbn=978-0-465-07265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear charge is identical to [[proton]] count, and determines the value of the [[atomic number]] (Z) of each element. Using atomic number gives a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements. Moseley predicted, in 1913, that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72, and 75, all of which were later discovered. The atomic number is the absolute definition of an [[Chemical element|element]], and gives a factual basis for the ordering of the periodic table. The periodic table is used to predict the properties of new synthetic elements before they are produced and studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nucl. Phys.

In 1871, Mendeleev published his periodic table in a new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist.&lt;ref&gt;Scerri 2007, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaji |first=M. |year=2002 |title=D.

The popular&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p.&amp;nbsp; 12&lt;/ref&gt; periodic table layout, also known as the common or standard form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short ([http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=456 Mendeleev style]) and medium ([http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=360 18-column]) form periodic tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deming|first=H.

With the development of modern [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] theories of [[electron]] configurations within atoms, it became apparent that each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a [[electron shell|quantum shell]] of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glenn Seaborg - 1964.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Glenn T. Seaborg]], in 1945, suggested a new periodic table showing the actinides as belonging to a second f-block series.]]

In 1945, [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Glenn Seaborg]], an American scientist, made the suggestion that the [[actinides|actinide elements]], like the [[lanthanides]], were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career.

==Different periodic tables==

===The long- or 32-column table===
[[File:32-column periodic table-a.png|upright=2.95|thumb|The periodic table in 32-column format]]
The modern periodic table is sometimes expanded into its long or 32-column form by reinstating the footnoted f-block elements into their natural position between the s- and d-blocks. Unlike the 18-column form this arrangement results in "no interruptions in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=spjcrJ0UjbsC&amp;pg=PA190 | last = Scerri | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Scerri | title = A Tale of 7 Elements | chapter = Element 61—Promethium | place = New York | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] (USA) | isbn = 978-0-19-539131-2 | pages = 175–194 (190) | year = 2013 | quote = ...&amp;nbsp;no interruptions in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers&amp;nbsp;... | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910135005/https://books.google.com/books?id=spjcrJ0UjbsC&amp;pg=PA190 | archivedate = 10 September 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the periodic table also becomes easier to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rysqAAAACAAJ |last = Newell |first = S.

Near the physics end of the continuum is [[Charles Janet|Janet]]'s Left-Step Periodic Table (1928).

==Open questions and controversies==

===Placement of hydrogen and helium===
Simply following electron configurations, hydrogen (electronic configuration 1s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and helium (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) should be placed in groups 1 and 2, above lithium (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and beryllium (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Gray12"&gt;Gray, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; While such a placement is common for hydrogen, it is rarely used for helium outside of the context of electron configurations: When the [[noble gases]] (then called "inert gases") were first discovered around 1900, they were known as "group 0", reflecting no chemical reactivity of these elements known at that point, and helium was placed on the top of that group, as it did share the extreme chemical inertness seen throughout the group. As the group changed its formal number, many authors continued to assign helium directly above neon, in group 18; one of the examples of such placing is the current [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iupac.org/fileadmin/user_upload/news/IUPAC_Periodic_Table-1May13.pdf|title = IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements|date = 2013-05-01|accessdate = 2015-09-20|website = iupac.org|publisher = IUPAC|author = IUPAC|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150822234830/http://www.iupac.org/fileadmin/user_upload/news/IUPAC_Periodic_Table-1May13.pdf|archivedate = 22 August 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen's chemical properties are not very close to those of the alkali metals, which occupy group 1. On this basis it is sometimes placed elsewhere. A common alternative is at the top of group 17&lt;ref name="ScerriJBPC"/&gt; given hydrogen's strictly univalent and largely non-metallic chemistry, and the strictly univalent and non-metallic chemistry of fluorine (the element otherwise at the top of group 17). Sometimes, to show hydrogen has properties corresponding to both those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it is shown at the top of the two columns simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seaborg |first= G.|title=The chemical and radioactive properties of the heavy elements |journal= Chemical English Newspaper |year=1945 |volume=23 |issue=23 |pages=2190–2193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the [[tetravalence]] characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements.&lt;ref name="hydrogen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronyn |first=M.

The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, throughout the book&lt;/ref&gt; The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modeling Marvels: Computational Anticipation of Novel Molecules|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IoFzgBSSCwEC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2008-12-05|isbn = 978-1-4020-6973-4|first = Errol G.|last = Lewars|pages = 69–71|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160519021952/https://books.google.com/books?id=IoFzgBSSCwEC|archivedate = 19 May 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.&lt;!-- (Neon's electron configuration is [He]2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, argon's is [Ne]3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and so on.)--&gt;

Although scandium and yttrium are always the first two elements in group 3, the identity of the next two elements is not completely settled. They are commonly [[lanthanum]] and [[actinium]], and less often [[lutetium]] and [[lawrencium]].

This arrangement was referred to as the "asteroid hypothesis", in analogy to asteroids occupying a single orbit in the solar system. Before this time the lanthanides were generally (and unsuccessfully) placed throughout groups I to VIII of the older 8-column form of periodic table. Although predecessors of Brauner's 1902 arrangement are recorded from as early as 1895, he is known to have referred to the "chemistry of asteroids" in an 1881 letter to Mendeleev. Other authors assigned all of the lanthanides to either group 3, groups 3 and 4, or groups 2, 3 and 4. In 1922 [[Niels Bohr]] continued the detachment process by locating the lanthanides between the s- and d-blocks. In 1949 [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] (re)introduced the form of periodic table that is popular today, in which the lanthanides and actinides appear as footnotes. Seaborg first published his table in a classified report dated 1944. It was published again by him in 1945 in ''[[Chemical and Engineering News]],'' and in the years up to 1949 several authors commented on, and generally agreed with, Seaborg's proposal. In that year he noted that the best method for presenting the actinides seemed to be by positioning them below, and as analogues of, the lanthanides. See: Thyssen P. and Binnemans K. (2011).

===Groups included in the transition metals===
The definition of a [[transition metal]], as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=T06456|title=transition element}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition all of the elements in groups 3–11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.

Some chemists treat the categories "[[d-block]] elements" and "transition metals" interchangeably, thereby including groups 3–12 among the transition metals. In this instance the group 12 elements are treated as a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding. The 2007 report of [[mercury(IV) fluoride]] (HgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), a compound in which mercury would use its d electrons for bonding, has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury can be regarded as a transition metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xuefang|first1= W. |last2=Andrews|first2=L.|last3=Riedel|first3=S.|last4= Kaupp|first4=M. |title=Mercury Is a Transition Metal: The First Experimental Evidence for HgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |year=2007 |volume=46 |issue=44 |pages=8371–8375 |doi=10.1002/anie.200703710 |pmid=17899620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators, such as Jensen,&lt;ref name=Jensen2008&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Mercury Now a Transition Element? |last = Jensen |first= W. B.|journal=J. Chem. Educ. |year=2008 |volume=85 |pages=1182–1183 |doi=10.1021/ed085p1182|bibcode = 2008JChEd..85.1182J |issue=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can occur only under highly abnormal conditions; indeed, its existence is currently disputed. As such, mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term.&lt;ref name=Jensen2008/&gt;

Still other chemists further exclude the [[group 3 element]]s from the definition of a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=G.|last2=Overton|first2=T.|title=Descriptive inorganic chemistry|publisher=W H Freeman|pages=484–485|location=New York|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-7167-8963-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. Though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, they do show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).&lt;ref name=Greenwood947&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 947&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements with unknown chemical properties===
Although all elements up to oganesson have been discovered, of the elements above [[hassium]] (element 108), only [[copernicium]] (element 112), [[nihonium]] (element 113), and [[flerovium]] (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, even though it is currently placed in the [[carbon group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements|last=Schändel|first=M.|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-1250-1|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current experimental evidence still leaves open the question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2016/26/epjconf-NS160-07003.pdf |title=Gas-phase chemistry of element 114, flerovium |last1=Yakushev |first1=Alexander |last2=Eichler |first2=Robert |date=2016 |conference=Nobel Symposium NS160 – Chemistry and Physics of Heavy and Superheavy Elements |doi=10.1051/epjconf/201613107003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further periodic table extensions===
{{main|Extended periodic table}}
&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; font-size:85%;"&gt;
{{Periodic table (micro)|number=120|caption=Periodic table with eight rows, extended to element 172&lt;ref name="Fricke"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=B. |last2=Greiner |first2=W. |last3=Waber |first3=J.

&lt;/div&gt;
It is unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern of the current periodic table as [[Period 8 element|period 8]], or require further adaptations or adjustments. [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Seaborg]] expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements [[ununennium|119]] and [[unbinilium|120]], a new [[g-block]] for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3963006|last=Frazier|first=K.|title=Superheavy Elements|journal=Science News|volume=113|issue=15|pages=236–238|year=1978|jstor=3963006}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, physicists such as [[Pekka Pyykkö]] have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the [[Madelung rule]], which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical models for the placement of the elements of atomic number less than or equal to 172. In all of these it is element 172, rather than element 168, that emerges as the next noble gas after oganesson, although these must be regarded as speculative as no complete calculations have been done beyond element 122.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykkö|first1=P.|authorlink=Pekka Pyykkö|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z ≤ 172, based on Dirac–Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161–168|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Element with the highest possible atomic number===
The number of possible elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, and based on the arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than circa 256 (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elliot|first=Q.

;Bohr model
The [[Bohr model]] exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be travelling faster than ''c'', the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |isbn=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.

;Relativistic Dirac equation
The [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] Dirac equation has problems for elements with more than 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the [[Klein paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the [[Positron emission|spontaneous emission of a positron]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Optimal form===
The many different forms of periodic table have prompted the question of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table.&lt;ref name=optimal/&gt; The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the many different forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.{{#tag:ref|[[Eric Scerri|Scerri]], one of the foremost authorities on the history of the periodic table,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Sella|first = Andrea|authorlink = Andrea Sella|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929291-200-an-elementary-history-lesson/|title = An elementary history lesson|journal = [[New Scientist]]|date = 7 August 2013|issue = 2929|accessdate = 13 June 2017|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160703041107/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929291-200-an-elementary-history-lesson|archivedate = 3 July 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; favoured the concept of an optimal form of periodic table but has recently changed his mind and now supports the value of a plurality of periodic tables.&lt;ref name=optimal&gt;{{cite web|first = Eric|last = Scerri|authorlink = Eric Scerri|date = 9 August 2013|url = http://ericscerri23.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/0-0-1-16-77-ucla-2-1-92-14.html|title = Is there an optimal periodic table and other bigger questions in the philosophy of science|accessdate = 4 September 2013|publisher = [[Eric Scerri]]|website = ericscerri23.blogspot.com.au|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170613022703/http://ericscerri23.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/0-0-1-16-77-ucla-2-1-92-14.html|archivedate = 13 June 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

[[File:Apollo15DunaTisza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Photograph from [[Apollo 15]] orbital unit of the [[rille]]s in the vicinity of the crater [[Aristarchus (crater)|Aristarchus]] on the [[Moon]].]]
'''Planetary science''' or, more rarely, '''planetology''', is the scientific study of [[planet]]s (including [[Earth]]), [[Natural satellite|moons]], and [[planetary system]]s (in particular those of the [[Solar System]]) and the processes that form them. It studies objects ranging in size from [[micrometeoroid]]s to [[gas giant]]s, aiming to determine their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history. It is a strongly [[interdisciplinary]] field, originally growing from [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]],&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"/&gt; but which now incorporates many disciplines, including [[planetary geology]] (together with [[geochemistry]] and [[geophysics]]), [[cosmochemistry]], [[atmospheric science]], [[oceanography]], [[hydrology]], [[theoretical planetary science]], [[glaciology]], and [[exoplanetology]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1994"&gt;{{cite journal

There are interrelated observational and theoretical branches of planetary science. Observational research can involve a combination of [[space exploration]], predominantly with [[robotic spacecraft]] missions using [[remote sensing]], and comparative, experimental work in Earth-based laboratories. The theoretical component involves considerable [[computer simulation]] and mathematical modelling.

Planetary scientists are generally located in the astronomy and physics or Earth sciences departments of universities or research centres, though there are several purely planetary science institutes worldwide. There are several major conferences each year, and a wide range of [[academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]]. In the case of some exclusive planetary scientists, many of whom are in relation to the study of dark matter, they will seek a private research centre and often initiate partnership research tasks.

==History==
The history of planetary science may be said to have begun with the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], who is reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] as saying &lt;blockquote&gt;The ordered worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others, both are greater than with us, and yet with others more in number. And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase, others flourish and others decay, and here they come into being and there they are eclipsed. But that they are destroyed by colliding with one another. And that some ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and all water.&lt;ref name="Philosophumena"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippolytus (Antipope) |author2=Origen |others=Translation by Francis Legge, F.S.A.|title=Philosophumena|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|location=Original from Harvard University.|date=1921|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lrDy9nn1doC&amp;printsec=titlepage|accessdate=22 May 2009|type=Digitized 9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In more modern times, planetary science began in astronomy, from studies of the unresolved planets. In this sense, the original planetary astronomer would be [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who discovered the four largest moons of [[Jupiter]], the mountains on the [[Moon]], and first observed the [[rings of Saturn]], all objects of intense later study. Galileo's study of the lunar mountains in 1609 also began the study of extraterrestrial landscapes: his observation "that the Moon certainly does not possess a smooth and polished surface" suggested that it and other worlds might appear "just like the face of the Earth itself".&lt;ref name="Taylor1994b"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in telescope construction and instrumental resolution gradually allowed increased identification of the atmospheric and surface details of the planets. The Moon was initially the most heavily studied, as it always exhibited details on its surface, due to its proximity to the Earth, and the technological improvements gradually produced more detailed lunar geological knowledge. In this scientific process, the main instruments were astronomical [[optical telescope]]s (and later [[radio telescopes]]) and finally robotic exploratory [[space probe|spacecraft]].

The Solar System has now been relatively well-studied, and a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system exists. However, there are large numbers of unsolved questions,&lt;ref name="SternPlanetarySoc09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001956/|title=Ten Things I Wish We Really Knew In Planetary Science|last=Stern|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rate of new discoveries is very high, partly due to the large number of interplanetary spacecraft currently exploring the Solar System.

==Disciplines==

===Planetary astronomy===
This is both an observational and a theoretical science. Observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the Solar System: those that are observed by telescopes, both optical and radio, so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape, spin, surface materials and weathering are determined, and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood.

Theoretical planetary astronomy is concerned with [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: the application of the principles of [[celestial mechanics]] to the Solar System and [[extrasolar planet]]ary systems.

=== Planetary geology ===
{{main|Planetary geology}}
{{see also|Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Icy moon}}

The best known research topics of planetary geology deal with the planetary bodies in the near vicinity of the Earth: the [[Moon]], and the two neighbouring planets: [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Of these, the Moon was studied first, using methods developed earlier on the Earth.

==== Geomorphology ====
{{main|Geomorphology}}

Geomorphology studies the features on planetary surfaces and reconstructs the history of their formation, inferring the physical processes that acted on the surface. Planetary geomorphology includes the study of several classes of surface features:
* Impact features (multi-ringed basins, craters)
* Volcanic and tectonic features (lava flows, fissures, [[rille]]s)
* [[Space weathering]] - erosional effects generated by the harsh environment of space (continuous micro meteorite bombardment, high-energy particle rain, [[impact gardening]]). For example, the thin dust cover on the surface of the [[moon|lunar]] [[regolith]] is a result of micro meteorite bombardment.
* Hydrological features: the liquid involved can range from water to [[hydrocarbon]] and [[ammonia]], depending on the location within the Solar System.

The history of a planetary surface can be deciphered by mapping features from top to bottom according to their [[Law of superposition|deposition sequence]], as first determined on terrestrial [[stratum|strata]] by [[Nicolas Steno]]. For example, [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic mapping]] prepared the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts for the field geology they would encounter on their lunar missions. Overlapping sequences were identified on images taken by the [[Lunar Orbiter program]], and these were used to prepare a lunar [[stratigraphic column]] and [[geologic map|geological map]] of the Moon.
{{further|Geology of the Moon}}

====Cosmochemistry, geochemistry and petrology====
{{main|Cosmochemistry|Geochemistry|Petrology}}

One of the main problems when generating hypotheses on the formation and evolution of objects in the Solar System is the lack of samples that can be analysed in the laboratory, where a large suite of tools are available and the full body of knowledge derived from terrestrial geology can be brought to bear. Direct samples from the Moon, [[asteroid]]s and [[Mars]] are present on Earth, removed from their parent bodies and delivered as [[meteorite]]s. Some of these have suffered contamination from the [[oxidise|oxidising]] effect of Earth's atmosphere and the infiltration of the [[biosphere]], but those meteorites collected in the last few decades from [[Antarctica]] are almost entirely pristine.

The different types of meteorites that originate from the [[asteroid belt]] cover almost all parts of the structure of [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] bodies: meteorites even exist that come from the core-mantle boundary ([[pallasite]]s). The combination of geochemistry and observational astronomy has also made it possible to trace the [[HED meteorite]]s back to a specific asteroid in the main belt, [[4 Vesta]].

The comparatively few known [[Martian meteorites]] have provided insight into the geochemical composition of the Martian crust, although the unavoidable lack of information about their points of origin on the diverse Martian surface has meant that they do not provide more detailed constraints on theories of the evolution of the Martian [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwyo.edu&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 24, 2013 65 samples of Martian meteorites have been discovered on Earth. Many were found in either Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.

During the Apollo era, in the [[Apollo program]], 384 kilograms of [[lunar sample]]s were collected and transported to the Earth, and 3 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna]] robots also delivered [[regolith]] samples from the Moon. These samples provide the most comprehensive record of the composition of any Solar System body beside the Earth. The numbers of lunar meteorites are growing quickly in the last few years –&lt;ref&gt;{curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/lmc/lmcintro.pdf}&lt;/ref&gt; as of
April 2008 there are 54 meteorites that have been officially classified as lunar.
Eleven of these are from the US Antarctic meteorite collection, 6 are from the Japanese
Antarctic meteorite collection, and the other 37 are from hot desert localities in Africa,
Australia, and the Middle East. The total mass of recognized lunar meteorites is close to
50&amp;nbsp;kg.

====Geophysics====
{{main|Geophysics|Space physics}}
Space probes made it possible to collect data in not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|right|thumb|The [[solar wind]] is deflected by the magnetosphere (not to scale)]]
If a planet's [[magnetic field]] is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a [[magnetosphere]] around a planet. Early space probes discovered the gross dimensions of the terrestrial magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The [[solar wind]], a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.

Geophysics includes [[seismology]] and [[tectonophysics]], [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], [[mineral physics]], [[geodynamics]], [[mathematical geophysics]], and [[geophysical surveying]].

{{anchor|planetary geodesy}}&lt;!-- used by incoming redirect --&gt;
Planetary [[geodesy]], (also known as planetary geodetics) deals with the measurement and representation of the planets of the Solar System, their [[gravitation]]al fields and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]] in three-dimensional, time-varying space. The science of geodesy has elements of both astrophysics and planetary sciences. The shape of the Earth is to a large extent the result of its rotation, which causes its equatorial bulge, and the competition of geologic processes such as the collision of plates and of [[Volcano|vulcanism]], resisted by the Earth's [[gravity]] field. These principles can be applied to the solid surface of Earth ([[orogeny]]; Few mountains are higher than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, few deep sea trenches deeper than that because quite simply, a mountain as tall as, for example, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}, would develop so much [[pressure]] at its base, due to gravity, that the rock there would become [[plastic]], and the mountain would slump back to a height of roughly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in a geologically insignificant time. Some or all of these geologic principles can be applied to other planets besides Earth. For instance on Mars, whose surface gravity is much less, the largest volcano, [[Olympus Mons]], is {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} high at its peak, a height that could not be maintained on Earth. The Earth [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. Therefore, the Mars geoid is essentially the figure of Mars abstracted from its topographic features. [[Surveying]] and [[map]]ping are two important fields of application of geodesy.

===Atmospheric science===
{{main|Atmospheric science|Global climate model}}
[[File:Jupiter.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud bands clearly visible on [[Jupiter]]. ]]
The [[atmosphere]] is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied [[Ionisation|ionizing]] and radiation belts. Not all planets have atmospheres: their existence depends on the mass of the planet, and the planet's distance from the Sun&amp;nbsp;— too distant and frozen atmospheres occur. Besides the four [[gas giant]] planets, almost all of the [[terrestrial planets]] ([[Earth's atmosphere|Earth]], [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus]], and [[Atmosphere of Mars|Mars]]) have significant atmospheres. Two moons have significant atmospheres: [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]]. A tenuous atmosphere exists around [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

The effects of the [[Planet#Rotation|rotation rate]] of a planet about its axis can be seen in atmospheric streams and currents. Seen from space, these features show as bands and eddies in the cloud system, and are particularly visible on Jupiter and Saturn.

==Comparative planetary science==

{{main|Comparative planetary science}}

Planetary science frequently makes use of the method of comparison to give a greater understanding of the object of study. This can involve comparing the dense atmospheres of Earth and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the evolution of outer Solar System objects at different distances from the Sun, or the geomorphology of the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, to give only a few examples.

The main comparison that can be made is to features on the Earth, as it is much more accessible and allows a much greater range of measurements to be made. Earth analogue studies are particularly common in planetary geology, geomorphology, and also in atmospheric science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2433">'''Porosimetry''' is an [[Measurement|analytical technique]] used to determine various quantifiable aspects of a material's [[Porosity|porous]] nature, such as '''pore diameter''', total '''pore volume''', [[surface area]], and [[Bulk density|bulk]] and absolute [[density|densities]].

The technique involves the intrusion of a [[wetting|non-wetting]] liquid (often [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]) at high [[pressure]] into a material through the use of a '''porosimeter'''.  The pore size can be determined based on the external pressure needed to force the liquid into a pore against the opposing force of the liquid's [[surface tension]].

A force balance equation known as [[Washburn's equation]] for the above material having [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] pores is given as:&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Abell, K.L. Willis and D.A. Lange, "Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry and Image Analysis of Cement-Based Materials", Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 211, pp. 39-44 (1999). {{cite web |url=http://faculty.arch.tamu.edu/anichols/index_files/pubs_data/tri-prin97/tri-prin97.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214230450/http://faculty.arch.tamu.edu/anichols/index_files/pubs_data/tri-prin97/tri-prin97.htm |archivedate=2012-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_L - P_G = -\frac{4 \sigma \cos \theta}{D_P}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{L}&lt;/math&gt; = pressure of liquid
:&lt;math&gt;P_{G}&lt;/math&gt; = pressure of gas
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = surface tension of liquid
:&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; = [[contact angle]] of intrusion liquid
:&lt;math&gt;D_{P}&lt;/math&gt; = pore diameter

Since the technique is usually performed within a [[vacuum]], the initial gas pressure is zero.  The [[contact angle]] of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] with most solids is between 135° and 142°, so an average of 140° can be taken without much error.  The [[surface tension]] of mercury at 20 °C under vacuum is 480 [[millinewton|mN]]/[[Metre|m]].  With the various substitutions, the equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;D_P = \frac{1470 \ \text{kPa} \cdot \mu \text{m}}{P_L} &lt;/math&gt; 

As pressure increases, so does the cumulative pore volume.  From the cumulative pore volume, one can find the pressure and pore diameter where 50% of the total volume has been added to give the median pore diameter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1965">'''Quantum [[dimer model]]s''' were introduced to model the physics of [[resonating valence bond]] (RVB) states in [[lattice spin systems]].  The only degrees of freedom retained from the motivating spin systems are  the valence bonds, represented as dimers which live on the lattice bonds.  In typical dimer models, the dimers do not overlap ("hardcore constraint").

Typical phases of quantum dimer models tend to be [[valence bond crystal]]s.  However, on non-bipartite lattices,  RVB liquid phases possessing [[topological order]] and [[Fractionalization|fractionalized]] [[spinon]]s also appear.  The discovery of topological order in quantum dimer models (more than a decade after the models were introduced) has led to new interest in these models.

Classical dimer models have been studied previously in [[statistical physics]], in particular by P. W. Kasteleyn (1961) and
M. E. Fisher (1961).

The '''Saturn V Instrument Unit''' is a ring-shaped structure fitted to the top of the [[Saturn V]] rocket's third stage ([[S-IVB]]) and the [[Saturn IB]]'s second stage (also an S-IVB). It was immediately below the SLA ''(Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter)'' panels that contained the [[Lunar Module]]. The Instrument Unit contains the guidance system for the Saturn V rocket. Some of the electronics contained within the Instrument Unit are a [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer|digital computer]], analog flight control computer, emergency detection system, inertial guidance platform, control accelerometers and control rate gyros. The instrument unit (IU) for Saturn V was designed by NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and was developed from the Saturn I IU.&lt;ref&gt;"Instrument Unit Fact Sheet, Saturn V News Reference." Changed December 1968. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's contractor to manufacture the Saturn V Instrument Unit was International Business Machines ([[IBM]]).&lt;ref&gt;Roger E. Bilstein.

The Saturn V rocket, which sent astronauts to the Moon, used inertial guidance, a self-contained system that guided the rocket's trajectory.  The rocket booster had a guidance system separate from those on the command and lunar modules.  It was contained in an instrument unit like this one, a ring located between the rocket's third stage and the command and lunar modules.  The ring contained the basic guidance system components—a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics—as well as radar, telemetry, and other units.

The instrument unit's stable platform was based on an experimental unit for the German V-2 rocket of World War II. The Bendix Corporation produced the platform, while IBM designed and built the unit's digital computer.

==Instrument Unit specifications==
*Diameter: 260&amp;nbsp;inches (6.6 m)
*Height: 36&amp;nbsp;inches (914&amp;nbsp;mm)
*Weight at launch: ~4,400&amp;nbsp;lb (1996&amp;nbsp;kg)

==Mission history==
There was no Instrument Unit for Saturn I Block I boosters (SA-1 to SA-4). Guidance and control equipment was carried in canisters on top of the S-I first stage, and included the ST-90 stabilized platform, made by Ford Instrument Company and used in the [[Jupiter missile]].&lt;ref&gt;‘’Stages To Saturn’’ Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IU made its debut with SA-5, the first Saturn I Block II launch. The first version of the IU was {{convert|154|in|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|58|in|mm}} high, and was both designed and built by MSFC. Guidance, telemetry, tracking and power components were contained in four pressurized, cylindrical containers attached like spokes to a central hub.&lt;ref&gt;''The Apollo "A"/Saturn C-1 Launch Vehicle System''&lt;/ref&gt;

MSFC flew version 2 of the IU on SA-8, 9 and 10. Version 2 was the same diameter as version 1, but only {{convert|34|in|mm}} high. Instead of pressurized containers, the components were hung on the inside of the cylindrical wall, achieving a reduction in weight.&lt;ref&gt;''Saturn I Summary'' PDF p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The last version, number 3, was {{convert|260|in|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|36|in|mm}} tall. It was designed by MSFC but manufactured by IBM in their factory at Huntsville, and flew on all Saturn IB and Saturn V launches. This is the version that is on display in Washington, Huntsville, Houston, and the [[Apollo/Saturn V Center]].

== Mission profile ==
Saturn Apollo flight profiles varied considerably by mission.&lt;ref&gt;"Astrionics System Handbook", 1 November 1968, MSFC No. IV-4-401-1. IBM No. 68-966-0002. Section 1.3. Saturn V Mission Profile.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;" Instrument Unit Fact Sheet. Saturn V News Reference." Changed December 1968. Pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Saturn V Flight Manual SA-507." MSFC-MAN-507. Changed 5 October 1969. P. 2-1 (PDF page 15). Section II. Performance. Flight Sequence.&lt;/ref&gt; All missions began, however, with liftoff under power of the first stage. To more smoothly control engine ignition, thrust buildup and liftoff of the vehicle, restraining arms provided support and hold down at four points around the base of the S-IC stage. A gradual controlled release was accomplished during the first six inches of vertical motion.

After clearing the launch tower, a flight program stored in the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer|launch vehicle digital computer]] (LVDC) commanded a roll of the vehicle to orient it so that the subsequent pitch maneuver pointed the vehicle in the desired azimuth. The roll and pitch commands were controlled by the stored program, and were not affected by navigation measurements. Until the end of the S-IC burn, guidance commands were functions only of time.

First stage cutoff and stage separation were commanded when the IU received a signal that the tank's fuel level had reached a predetermined point. Guidance during the second and third stage burns depended both on time and navigation measurements, in order to achieve the target orbit using the minimum fuel.

Second stage engine cutoff was commanded by the IU at a pre-determined fuel level, and the stage was separated. By this time, the vehicle had reached its approximate orbital altitude, and the third stage burn was just long enough to reach a circular [[parking orbit]].

During manned Apollo missions, the vehicle coasted in Earth orbit for 2-4 passes as the crew performed checks of systems status and other tasks, and as ground stations tracked the vehicle. During the hour and a half after launch, tracking stations around the world had refined estimates of the vehicle's position and velocity, collectively known as its state vector. The latest estimates were relayed to the guidance systems in the IU, and to the Command Module Computer in the spacecraft. When the Moon, Earth, and vehicle were in the optimum geometrical configuration, the third stage was reignited to put the vehicle into a translunar orbit. For Apollo 15, for example, this burn lasted 5 minutes 55 seconds.

After translunar injection came the maneuver called transposition, docking, and extraction. This was under crew control, but the IU held the S-IVB/IU vehicle steady while the Command/Service Module (CSM) first separated from the vehicle, rotated 180 degrees, and returned to dock with the Lunar Module (LM). When the CSM and LM had "hard docked" (connected by a dozen latches), the rearranged spacecraft separated from the S-IVB/IU.

The last function of the IU was to command the very small maneuver necessary to keep the S-IVB/IU out of the way of the spacecraft. On some missions the S-IVB/IU went into high Earth or Solar orbit, while on others it was crashed into the Moon; seismometers were left on the Moon during Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16, and the S-IVB/IUs of Apollo 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were directed to crash. These impacts provided impulses that were recorded by the seismometer network to yield information about the geological structure of the Moon.

== Subsystems ==
[[Image:Saturn IU Mk12cyl3mod2Crop25pct.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of IU-514, with components labeled]]
[[Image:IUExteriorMk2.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of exterior of IU-514]]
The IU consists of six subsystems: structure, guidance and control, environmental control, emergency detection, radio communications (for telemetry, tracking, and command), and power.

=== Structure ===
The basic IU structure is a short cylinder, 36&amp;nbsp;inches high and {{convert|260|in|mm}} in diameter, fabricated of an aluminum alloy honeycomb sandwich material {{convert|0.95|in|mm}} thick. The cylinder is manufactured in three 120-degree segments, which are joined by splice plates into an integral structure. The top and bottom edges are made from extruded aluminum channels bonded to the honeycomb sandwich. This type of construction was selected for its high strength to weight ratio, acoustical insulation, and thermal conductivity properties. The IU supported the components mounted on its inner wall and the weight of the Apollo spacecraft above (the Lunar Module, the Command Module, the Service Module, and the Launch Escape Tower). To facilitate handling the IU before it was assembled into the Saturn, the fore and aft protective rings, 6&amp;nbsp;inches tall and painted blue, were bolted to the top and bottom channels. These were removed in the course of stacking the IU into the Saturn vehicle. The structure was manufactured by North American Rockwell in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Edward A. Beasley was the I.U. Program Manager.

The IU is divided into 24 locations, which are marked on the interior by numbers 1-24 on the aluminum surface just above the blue flange.

=== Guidance and control ===
[[Image:ST-124gimbals.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Drawing on the [[ST-124-M3 inertial platform]]]]
The Saturn V launch vehicle was guided by navigation, guidance, and control equipment located in the IU. A space stabilized platform (the [[ST-124-M3 inertial platform]] at location 21) measured acceleration and attitude. A [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer|launch vehicle digital computer]] (LVDC at location 19) solved guidance equations, and an analog flight control computer (location 16) issued commands to steer the vehicle.

The attitude of the vehicle was defined in terms of three axes:

*The roll axis (X) runs from tail to nose and was vertical at time of launch.
*The pitch axis (Y) is at right angles to the roll axis, and is marked on the exterior of the IU by +Y above the viewport, outside location 21.
*The yaw axis (Z) is at right angles to both the pitch and roll axis, and is marked by +Z outside location 3.&lt;ref&gt;"Astrionics System Handbook", 1 November 1968, MSFC No. IV-4-401-1. IBM No. 68-966-0002. P. 1.2-1 (PDF p. 15): The old and new coordinate systems are described. The new standard became effective for vehicles 204 and 502 (and subsequent).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ST-124-M3 inertial platform]] contains three [[gimbal]]s: the outer gimbal (which can rotate 360° about the roll or X axis of the vehicle), the middle gimbal (which can rotate ±45° about the yaw or Z axis of the vehicle), and the inner or inertial gimbal (which can rotate 360° about the pitch or Y axis of the vehicle). The inner gimbal is a platform to which are fixed several components:

*Two vertical alignment pendulums sent signals before launch to ground support equipment, which generated signals to the platform gyro torque generators to level the inner gimbal. The vertical alignment system levelled the platform to an accuracy of ±2.5 [[arc second]]s.
*Two [[prism (optics)|prism]]s, one fixed and one [[servomechanism|servo]]-driven, were used with an external [[theodolite]] which sighted through the viewport outside location 21 to set the [[azimuth]] of the inner gimbal before launch. The azimuth could be set to an accuracy of ±5 arc seconds.
*Three single-degree-of-freedom [[gyroscope]]s have their input axes aligned along an [[orthogonal]] [[inertial coordinate system]]. Three signal generators, fixed to the output axis of each gyro, generated electrical signals proportional to the [[torque]] disturbances. The signals were transmitted through the servo electronics which terminated in the gimbal pivot servotorque motors. The servoloops maintained the inner gimbal rotationally fixed in inertial space. That is, while the vehicle rolled, pitched, and yawed, the inner gimbal remained in the same attitude to which it was set just before launch. Though it was being translated during the launch and orbit process, it was rotationally fixed.
*Three integrating [[accelerometer]]s measured the three components of velocity resulting from vehicle propulsion. The accelerometer measurements were sent through the launch vehicle data adapter (LDVA at location 19) to the LVDC. In the LVDC the accelerometer measurements were combined with the computed gravitational acceleration to obtain velocity and position of the vehicle.

The angular positions of gimbals on their axes were measured by resolvers, which sent their signals to the LVDA. The LVDA was the input/output device for the LVDC. It performed the necessary processing of signals to make these signals acceptable to the LVDC.

The instantaneous attitude of the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through [[hydraulic]] [[actuator]]s. In the first and second stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IVB/IU stage.

=== Environmental control ===
The environmental control system (ECS) maintains an acceptable operating environment for the IU equipment during preflight and flight operations. The ECS is composed of the following:

*The thermal conditioning system (TCS), which maintains a circulating coolant temperature to the electronic equipment of 59° ± 1&amp;nbsp;°F (15 ± 5/9&amp;nbsp;°C).
*Preflight purging system, which maintains a supply of temperature- and pressure-regulated mixture of air and gaseous nitrogen (air/GN2) in the IU/S-IVB equipment area.
*Gas bearing supply system, which furnishes GN2 to the ST-124-M3 inertial platform gas bearings.
*Hazardous gas detection sampling equipment which monitors the IU/S-IVB forward interstage area for the presence of hazardous vapors

==== Thermal conditioning ====
Thermal conditioning panels, also called cold plates, were located in both the IU and S-IVB stage (up to sixteen in each stage). Each cold plate contains tapped bolt holes in a grid pattern which provides flexibility of component mounting.

The cooling fluid circulated through the TCS was a mixture of 60 percent [[methanol]] and 40 percent demineralized [[water]] by weight. Each cold plate was capable of dissipating at least 420 watts.

During flight, heat generated by equipment mounted on the cold plates was dissipated to space by a [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] [[heat exchanger]]. Water from a reservoir (water accumulator) was exposed to the low temperature and pressure environment of space, where it first freezes and then sublimates, taking heat from the heat exchanger and transferring it to the water molecules which escape to space in gaseous state. Water/methanol was cooled by circulation through the heat exchanger.

==== Preflight air/GN2 purge system ====
Before flight, ground support equipment (GSE) supplies cooled, filtered ventilating air to the IU, entering via the large duct in the middle of the umbilical panel (location 7), and branching into two ducts at the top that are carried around the IU in the cable rack. Downward pointing vents from these ducts release ventilating air to the interior of the IU. During fueling, gaseous nitrogen was supplied instead of air, to purge any propellant gases that might otherwise accumulate in the IU.

==== Gas bearing supply ====
To reduce errors in sensing attitude and velocity, designers cut friction to a minimum in the platform gyros and accelerometers by floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen. The nitrogen was supplied from a sphere holding 2 cu ft (56.6 l) of gas at 3,000 [[psig]] (pounds per square inch gauge, i.e. psi above one atmosphere) (20,7 [[MPa]]). This sphere is 21&amp;nbsp;inches (0,53 m) in diameter and is mounted at location 22, to the left of the ST-124-M3. Gas from the supply sphere passes through a filter, a pressure regulator, and a heat exchanger before flowing through the bearings in the stable platform.

==== Hazardous gas detection ====
The hazardous gas detection system monitors the presence of hazardous gases in the IU and S-IVB stage forward compartments during vehicle fueling. Gas was [[sampling (statistics)|sampled]] at four locations: between panels 1 and 2, 7 and 8, 13 and 14, and 19 and 20. Tubes lead from these locations to location 7, where they were connected to ground support equipment (external to the IU) which can detect hazardous gases.

=== Emergency detection ===
&lt;!-- [[Emergency Detection System]] redirects here --&gt;
The emergency detection system (EDS) sensed initial development of conditions in the flight vehicle during the boost phases of flight which could cause vehicle failure. The EDS reacted to these emergency situations in one of two ways. If breakup of the vehicle were imminent, an automatic abort sequence would be initiated. If, however, the emergency condition were developing slowly enough or were of such a nature that the flight crew can evaluate it and take action, only visual indications were provided to the flight crew. Once an abort sequence had been initiated, either automatically or manually, it was irrevocable and ran to completion.

The EDS was distributed throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored each of the three axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.

=== Radio communications ===
The IU communicated by radio continually to ground for several purposes. The measurement and telemetry system communicated data about internal processes and conditions on the Saturn V. The tracking system communicated data used by the Mission Ground Station (MGS) to determine vehicle location. The radio command system allowed the MGS to send commands up to the IU.

==== Measuring and telemetry ====
Approximately 200 parameters were measured on the IU and transmitted to the ground, in order to

*Assist in the checkout of the launch vehicle prior to launch,
*Determine vehicle condition and to verify received commands during flight, and
*Facilitate postflight analysis of the mission.

Parameters measured include [[acceleration]], [[angular velocity]], [[Mass flow rate|flow rate]]{{which|date=August 2017}}, [[position (vector)|position]], [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], [[frequency]], and others. [[Sensor]] signals were conditioned by [[amplifier]]s or [[Electric power conversion|converters]] located in measuring racks. There are four measuring racks in the IU at locations 1, 9, and 15 and twenty signal conditioning modules in each.{{clarify|"1, 9, and 15 and twenty signal conditioning modules in each" Does "twenty" refer to location in IU or number of condition modules|date=April 2014}} Conditioned signals were routed to their assigned telemetry channel by the measuring distributor at location 10. There were two telemetry links. In order for the two IU telemetry links to handle approximately 200 separate measurements, these links must be shared. Both frequency sharing and time sharing [[multiplexing]] techniques were used to accomplish this. The two [[modulation]] techniques used were pulse code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and frequency modulation/frequency modulation (FM/FM).

Two Model 270 time sharing [[multiplexer]]s (MUX-270) were used in the IU telemetry system, mounted at locations 9 and 10. Each one operates as a 30×120 multiplexer (30 primary channels, each sampled 120 times per second) with provisions for submultiplexing individual primary channels to form 10 subchannels each sampled at 12 times per second. Outputs from the MUX-270 go to the PCM/DDAS assembly model 301 at location 12, which in turn drives the 245.3&amp;nbsp;MHz PCM VHF transmitter.

The FM/FM signals were carried in 28 subcarrier channels and transmitted by a 250.7&amp;nbsp;MHz FM transmitter.

Both the FM/FM and the PCM/FM channels were coupled to the two telemetry antennas on opposite sides of the IU outside locations 10 and 22.

==== Tracking ====
[[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[radar]] [[transponder]]s carried by the IU provided tracking data to the ground which were used to determine the vehicle's [[trajectory]]. The transponder received coded or single pulse interrogation from ground stations and transmitted a single-pulse reply in the same frequency band (5.4 to 5.9 [[GHz]]). A common [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] was used for receiving and transmitting. The C-band transponder antennas are outside locations 11 and 23, immediately below CCS PCM omni receive antennas.

==== Radio command ====
The command communications system (CCS) provided for digital data transmission from ground stations to the LVDC. This communications link was used to update guidance information or command certain other functions through the LVDC. Command data originated in the [[Mission Control Center]], [[Houston]], and was sent to remote stations for transmission to the launch vehicle.  Command messages were transmitted from the ground at 2101.8&amp;nbsp;MHz. The received message was passed to the command decoder (location 18), where it was checked for authenticity before being passed to the LVDC. Verification of message receipt was accomplished through the IU PCM telemetry system. The CCS system used five antennas:

*A single directional antenna outside location 3-4,
*Two omni transmit antennas outside locations 11 and 23, and
*Two omni receive antennas outside locations 12 and 24.

=== Power ===
Power during flight originated with four silver-zinc batteries with a nominal voltage of 28±2 vdc. Battery D10 sat on a shelf at location 5, batteries D30 and D40 were on shelves in location 4, and battery D20 was at location 24. Two power supplies converted the unregulated battery power to regulated 56 vdc and 5 vdc. The 56 vdc power supply was at location 1 and provided power to the ST-124-M3 platform electronic assembly and the accelerometer signal conditioner. The 5 vdc power supply at location 12 provided 5 ±.005 vdc to the IU measuring system.

These images show the development of the IU. The first four Saturn launches did not have an IU, but used guidance, telemetry and other equipment installed on top of the first stage.

The first IU flew on the fifth Saturn launch, SA-5, and was {{convert|12|ft|10|in|m}} in diameter and {{convert|4|ft|10|in|m}} high. The components it carried were in pressurized containers. This version flew on SA-5, SA-6 and SA-7. The IU carried by missions SA-8, -9, and -10 was only {{convert|2|ft|10|in|m}} high, and was not pressurized.&lt;ref&gt;"Saturn I Summary." 15 February 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Saturn IB and Saturn V launches, a third version was used, {{convert|21.6|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|3|ft|m}} high. Comparison of these photographs  of the Instrument Unit shows that the configuration of components carried by this version changed, depending on the mission. Some equipment was deleted (e.g. the Azusa tracking system was deleted from later IUs), some equipment  was added (e.g. a fourth battery for longer missions), and other components were moved around.

These images also show that some components (e.g. batteries, the ST-124 inertial platform) were installed  in the IU after it had been stacked in the VAB on top of the S-IVB third stage.

'''''Science in History''''' is a four-volume book by scientist and historian [[John Desmond Bernal]], published in 1954. It was the first comprehensive attempt to analyse the reciprocal relations of science and society throughout history. It was originally published in London by Watts. There were three editions up to 1969 an. It was republished by [[MIT Press]] in 1971 and is still in print.

It is one of the sources for the idea - considered erroneous by modern historians - that [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Medieval Christianity]] had returned to the pre-scientific notion of a [[Flat Earth]]:
:"In medieval times there was a return to the concept of a flat Earth and a dogmatism about the crystalline celestial spheres, here epitomized in a woodcut showing the machinery responsible for their motion discovered by an inquirer who has broken through the outer sphere of fixed stars. Sixteenth century." - ''Science in History'', vol. 1, The Emergence of Science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20815">'''Technological innovations''' have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age. New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. '''Technological transitions''' (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as “user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture”.&lt;ref name="Geels"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study.

A technological system includes technical and non-technical aspects, and it a major shift in the socio-technical configurations (involving at least one new technology) is when a technological transition occurs.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, J., 1993. ‘Configurations: Crystallizing Contingency’, The International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 3, pp. 15-36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including [[history of science]], technology studies, and [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this [[technological change]] has been considered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Geels_a"&gt;Geels, F.W., 2005. Technological transitions and system innovations. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph [[Schumpeter]], in his classic ''Theory of Economic Development''&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, T., 1934. The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process.  [[Schumpeter]] proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.

===Long wave theory===
The Russian economist Kondratiev&lt;ref&gt;Kondratiev, N., 1925. Major Economic Cycles. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [[Kondratiev]] had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined five cycles in the modern age:

* [[The Industrial Revolution]] (1770–1830)
* Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880)
* The Age of Steel (1880–1930)
* Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980)
* The Information Age (1980-?)

Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed ‘techno-economic paradigms’, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. 

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recent economic crisis]], authors such as Moody and Nogrady&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.

===Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes===
[[Thomas Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease.  Building on this work, [[Giovanni Dosi]]&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.

==Multi-level perspective on technological transitions==
In analysing (historic) cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi-level perspective (MLP) as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio-technical systems. (&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone
(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J. and Hoogma, R., 1998. Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: The approach of strategic niche management. Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management. 10 (2), pp. 175-198&lt;/ref&gt;)  [[Innovation system]] approaches traditionally focus on the production side. A socio-technical approach combines the science and technology in devising a production, with the application of the technology in fulfilling a societal function.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W., 2004. From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. Insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory. Research Policy 33 (6-7) pp. 897–920&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the two domains are the distribution, infrastructure and markets of the product. This approach considers a transition to be multi-dimensional as technology is only one aspect. 

The MLP proposes three analytical levels: the niche, regime and landscape. 

'''Niche''' (Micro-level)
Radical innovations occur at the niche level. These act as ‘safe havens’ for fledgling technologies to develop, largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp" /&gt; The US Military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft, radio and the internet. More recently, California’s Silicon Valley has provided an arena for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] focused technologies to emerge. Some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail. 

'''Regime''' (Meso-level)
The socio-technical regime, as defined by Geels,&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; includes a web of inter-linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules.  In effect, the established practices of a given system. Seven dimensions have been identified in the socio-technical regime: technology, user practices and application, the symbolic meaning of technology, infrastructure, policy and techno-scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level. The actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new. This is known as ‘lock-in’.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

'''Landscape''' (Macro-level)
Exogenous to the previous levels is the socio-technical landscape.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; A broad range of factors are contained here, such as economic pressures, cultural values, social trends, wars and environmental issues. Change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level. 

A transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred. This is the result of the interplay between the three levels.  Regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt; As such, transitions are difficult to achieve. The current regime is typically suffering internal issues. Pressure from the landscape level may cause ‘cracks’ or ‘windows of opportunity’ through which innovations at the niche level may initially co-exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency. Once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed.&lt;ref name="Genus"&gt;Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case study===
The MLP has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio-technical regimes for mobility, sanitation, food, lighting and so on.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; While early research focused on historical transitions, a second strand of research was more focused on transitions to sustainable technologies in key sectors such as transport, energy and housing.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Geels &lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation. The technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the UK will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation. 

Great Britain was the world’s leading naval power in the nineteenth century, and led the way in the transition from sail to steam.  At first, the introduction of steam technology co-existed with the current regime. Steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam / sail ships appeared. Landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology. A demand for trans-Atlantic emigration was prompted by the Irish potato famine, European political instability and the lure of gold in California. The requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship-development. From the late 1880s, as steamship technology improved and costs dropped, the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established. The changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices, new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities.

==Transition paths==
The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot &lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt; defined five transition paths:

* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.
* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.
* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. 
* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).
* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.

==Characteristics of technological transitions==
Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''
Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;
 
''Multi-actors are involved''
Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.

''Transitions occur at multiple levels''
As shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. 

''Transitions are a long-term process''
Complete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt;

''Transitions are radical''
For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  

''Change is Non-linear''
The rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.

==Diffusion: transition phases==
Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why. Everett (1962).The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.&lt;ref name="Rotmans"&gt;Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.&lt;ref name="Rotmans" /&gt; This process can be speeded-up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. 

Geels&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phases one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – ‘windows of opportunity’ are required.

==Windows of opportunity==
A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: 

* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.
* Problems external to the system. Such ‘problems’ are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.
* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.
* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation
* Complimentary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough

Alongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.&lt;ref name="Rip" /&gt; Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.

==Societal relevance==
The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. 

Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.

==Criticisms==
Genus and Coles&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt; outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.&lt;ref&gt;Shove E, Walker G, 2007, "CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770&lt;/ref&gt;
