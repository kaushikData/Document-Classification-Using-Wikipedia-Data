''500 Years Later'' has received praise as well as controversy, both for the genre of the film (creative documentary), and its social-political impact with relation to race study. The film opened on February 28, 2005, at the Pan-African Awards (PAFF) and won Best Documentary at its premiere. It made its American television premiere on August 23, 2008, on [[TV One (Radio One)]], and [[Ethiopian Television]] premiere on October 27, 2007. It was shown nationally in South Africa on December 14, 2014, on [[SABC 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabc.co.za/Integration/Services/EPG/TVSchedule/SABC2/PressTool/1.0/2014-12-14.html TV Schedule for SABC2], 2014-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabc.co.za/Integration/Services/EPG/TVSchedule/SABC2/PressTool/1.0/2014-12-21.html TV Schedule for SABC2], 2014-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the sequel, ''[[Motherland (2010 film)|Motherland]]'', was released.

==Plot==
''500 Years Later'' studies the [[African diaspora]] and the impact of slavery throughout history, identifying key issues facing the world's black communities, including poor education, poverty, crime, and the way that such issues dehumanize and degrade black peoples. The film also gives insight into the struggles faced by continental Africans today, for instance in terms of poverty, disease, and corrupt governments. While the continuing negative impact, influence and effects of the trans-Atlantic slave trade are highlighted, scholars interviewed for the film express hope that "old scars can be healed" and Africans as a race will advance through education about their history.&lt;ref name="500 Years Later — MK Asante"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later — MK Asante|url = http://mkasante.com/films/500-years-later/|website = mkasante.com|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===
The film states that the lasting effects of slavery are still felt 500 years later, hence the title. This is justified and explained through a series of scholarly interviews throughout the film. The film begins with an adage that illustrates its historical theme: "Until lions tell their story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter."

The promotional page for the producer of the film describes it thusly: "''500 Years Later'' is a compelling journey, infused with the spirit and music of liberation, that chronicles the struggle of a people from enslavement who continue to fight for the most essential human right - freedom."&lt;ref name="500 Years Later — MK Asante"/&gt; The film presents the richness of African cultures and traditions and how they have evolved since slavery was abolished, emphasizing that prior to the beginning of the Atlantic Slave Trade Africans were free. &lt;!--The images provided in the documentary concerning the slave trade are eye-opening for the audience. --&gt;The film includes testimonies, voices, and opinions gathered around five continents. Many of the people who voice their opinion are scholars or experts on the African diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aalbc.com/authors/molefi_kete_asante.htm | title=Molefi Kete Asante, Author, Scholar,  and Historian | accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those interviewed in the film criticize contemporary rap music as being particularly negative for Africans and their descendants, as they believe it reinforced racist stereotypes that were established in part because of the slave trade.

A lasting example of the stereotypes referenced in the film is a study performed by [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] in which black children were given a variety of dolls, including black and white ones, and were told to pick the "smarter" or "better" one. A majority of the black children chose the white dolls. Many of those interviewed believe that a distinct change to the educational system is necessary to change the mindset of people of African descent. The film affirms that "the kind of education that we have is to still enslave our minds, to make us believe we are inferior."&lt;ref name=NeoCopernicanReview /&gt; Education should be the main weapon for the new generations of Africans and African descendants, to remind the world of the richness and struggle of African history.

At the end of the film, Africans are encouraged to remember their past, in order to move forward. The film promotes the idea that making it through enslavement should be a strength, not a weakness or something to be ashamed about; that the people who enslaved the Africans should be the ones that are ashamed. Essentially, the goal proposed is to teach African children a more Afrocentric history, instead of a Eurocentric one. It further argues that teaching African-descent people about a history that is not their own will not help because they cannot relate to it. It also indicates that society must establish and promote African ideas and history in order to preserve what they want for future generations. The film calls for the ideas promoted within it to become mainstream so that there can be a better Africa and a better history associated with the continent.&lt;ref&gt;''500 Years Later''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO award ==
{{Slavery}}
''500 Years Later'' was the first film to win a UNESCO award for documenting slavery. And was part of UNESCO slave route project started in 1994: "The prize awarded $10,000 to a film that breaks the silence and speaks to the social, historical, economic and psychological impact of the slave trade; a film that raises public awareness of slavery’s historical and contemporary manifestations; a film that gives voice to the dispossessed, reflects their perspectives and articulates their
resistance to this dehumanization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swahiliweb.net/ziff_journal_4_files/ziff2007-14.pdf Swahiliweb.net]&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO launched the Slave Route Project in 1994. This project wants to increase knowledge and understanding in terms of slavery and historical events related to it. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Critical reception==
Kingsley Sheteh, from A Neo-Copernican Review, asserts that the film ''500 Years Later'' is a step in the right direction in depicting the relationship between the Western world and Africa, showcasing the historically dependent and underdeveloped status of African countries. Shetah also pointed out that, although the movie did a great job in touching on sensitive issue that are causes for Africa's problems, it is worth mentioning it failed to treat the issue of conflict. Shetah cites reasons that independent African state governments are heavily corrupted due to problems that can't be simply be tied down to ideology, slavery, and colonialism.&lt;ref name=NeoCopernicanReview&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later - Time For Africa to Forget... A Review!!!|url = https://newuh.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/500-years-later-time-to-forget-a-review/|website = A NEO-COPERNICAN REVIEW|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=December 2015}} While not exactly presenting overly new information, the documentary's delivery of the material and evidence is refreshing, meant to promote discussion among groups of people.&lt;ref name=NeoCopernicanReview /&gt;

''500 Years Later'' holds a 6.8/10 rating on IMDb.com from over 150 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444593/|title = 500 Years Later (2005) |accessdate = December 3, 2015|website = IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds an audience approval rating of 88% on rotten tomatoes from over 340 voters, and has an average rating of 4.2 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/500_years_later/|website = www.rottentomatoes.com|date = 2005-02-24|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many critics received the film as a way to explore African history like never before. The film is a compilation of interviews that offer history from the perspective of people whose knowledge has been suppressed for years. "500 Years Later" is applauded for its vast focus on African history, both the good and the bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheteh|first1=Kingsley|title=500 Years Later-Time for Africa to Forget...A Review|url=https://newuh.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/500-years-later-time-to-forget-a-review/|website=www.newuh.wordpress.com|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite much success, ''500 Years Later'' received mixed reviews from critics regarding content and presentation. Dan Schindel, a documentary reviewer, calls the film "The Malcolm X to the MLK of the average doc that covers African-related material"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Doc of the Day: 500 Years Later Review - Dan Schindel|url = http://danschindel.com/doc-of-the-day-500-years-later/|website = Dan Schindel|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers many examples of the extremity of the film. An article entitled "Destroying the Horrors of 500 Years" on the African Holocaust website, written by Attahiru Kawu-Bala in 2006, praised the film as an "articulate multi-dimensional African world perspective" with regard to the effects of African Diaspora. Kawu-Bala argued that the techniques used in the documentary did not rely on emotion and instead used facts and truth to build a case from an African standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AFRICAN HOLOCAUST {{!}} Destroying the Horrors of 500 Years|url = http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/horror500yearslater.html|website = www.africanholocaust.net|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Curt Holman recognized the film's righteousness, but believed "a more informative film would have been more effective." He found the video to be emotionally charged and, at times, overly obvious. According to Holman, the emotional biases sometimes overshadowed the factual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tales from the diaspora|url = http://clatl.com/atlanta/tales-from-the-diaspora/Content?oid=1255107|website = Creative Loafing Atlanta|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wanuri Kahiu]], a Kenyan film director, states that the film is a discussion between the "greatest and most articulate thinkers of the African global nation." In his review of ''500 Years Later'', Kahiu wrote that the documentary should not be referred to as a film but rather an "audiovisual reference book" because of how informative the documentary is. According to Kahiu, ''500 Years Later'' is a good resource to show the challenges people of African descent faced during the Diaspora and slavery and the challenges they still face today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 500 Years Later...More than a Film|url = http://www.africanholocaust.net/500/review.pdf|website = African Holocaust|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that the film is a great representation of the strength of African-American culture and citizenry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.africanholocaust.net/500/review.pdf|title = 500 Years Later...More Than A Movie|date = December 8, 2015|accessdate = |website = African Holocaust|publisher = |last = Kahui|first = Wanuri}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that the movie is a call for African people to patiently work to rid the African world of the "defeatist nature" still subconsciously ingrained in them today.

'''''A Palace Concert''''' ({{zh|宮樂圖}}) is a Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] [[silk painting]] showing ten [[Court lady|court ladies]] and two standing servant maidens around a large rectangular table. Some court ladies are depicted drinking tea, while others drink wine. The four women at the far end are presumably responsible for playing music and livening up the mood. The musical instruments depicted, from left to right, are bamboo pipes, [[guqin]], [[pipa]] and [[flute]]. One of the servant maidens plays a [[Clapper (musical instrument)|clapper]] to maintain beat. A small dog is depicted under the table. The artist and the precise year of the painting are unknown. The painting is housed in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan.

==Dating==
The hairstyles are combed in one direction on top, while others are combed in two directions and tied into knots around the ears. In addition to a floral headdress, these all indicate some of the popular Tang dynasty fashions.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-anonymous-a-palace-concert.php|title=A Palace Concert|publisher=China Online Museum|accessdate =30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woven bamboo table, cusped crescent stools, winged wine cups and the style of the lute playing with a large pick showcase late Tang dynasty customs.&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;

'''''Ascent of the Blessed''''' is a [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painting made between 1505 and 1515. It is in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], in [[Venice]], Italy.

This painting is part of a [[polyptych]] of four panels entitled ''Visions of the Hereafter''. The others are ''[[Terrestrial Paradise (Bosch)|Terrestrial Paradise]]'', ''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'' and ''[[Hell (Bosch)|Hell]]''.

==Formal Analysis==

The most intriguing element of this painting is the large tunnel at the top of the panel. It appears from the perspective of looking through a straw and into the heavenly beyond. As Stephen Hitchens writes, it could also be described as a “funnel of goodness and light [as] a source of variety and surprise capturing the visionary and ecstatic union with God.”&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''109.&lt;/ref&gt; The three dimensional tunnel gives the viewer a peek of the “white light” from Heaven with three figures waiting at the end for the blessed. The near side of the tunnel has one angel carrying a human soul towards the pearly gates. The viewer can differentiate the two figures because one has a white robe with wings and the other is naked, thus a soul and an angel. Both have their hands in prayer formation.

Right beneath the tunnel, there is an array of angels helping blessed human souls towards salvation. In the lower parts of the panel there are two angels per one soul, suggesting that some humans need more help than others. As it gets closer to the top of the panel, there is a one to one ratio of angel and soul. This might symbolize that the human souls that are pulled from Earth’s gravity and towards the tunnel become lighter in weight. The angels have their hands either on the human body carrying it upwards or near the body simply guiding it where to go. All the figures in the painting are looking upwards towards the tunnel.

All the characters have similar facial features because the physical aspect of the humans and angels are more idealized and not individualized. The figures are not meant to look like specific individual people. The style of the hair is also quite idealized; the angels have long wavy hair and the souls have short hair. None of the human souls have organs to help differentiate whether they are male or female. This could be a form of symbolism which shows that there are no genders in Heaven. This could be implying that all human souls are no longer differentiated by sexual organs and everyone is the same. The angels have a multitude of different colored robes and wings, such as subtle reds, blues, and greens.

The painting as a whole is very dimly lit which contrasts with the white brightness at the end of the tunnel. The light at the end of the tunnel is not the light that lights up the bottom of the painting, which is most likely the earthly realm. The extreme darkness directly around the tunnel indicates that the heavenly light has nothing to do with the light coming from below. The areas outside the tunnel are dark and gray. The light actually becomes darker as it moves upwards then when it reaches the tunnel there is a sudden eruption of light. Coincidentally, this painting of the funnel has been known to look very similar to people who have had near-death experiences. During the fifteenth-century, the entrance to paradise was depicted as a funnel which appeared in many miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Baldass,''Hieronymus Bosch,''224.&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the radiant funnel actually has some resemblance to contemporary zodiac diagrams but Bosch transforms it into a shining corridor through which the blessed approach God.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson,''Hieronymus Bosch,''64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Context==

Bosch’s paintings reflect the religious themes that dominated art and society in the [[Netherlands]] during the sixteenth century, especially the [[Catholic]] religion. Almost everyone’s duty was to behave and act like a good Catholic so that they could ascend into heaven. The consequences of sin were made so awful to frighten the faithful obedience into people with the ultimate punishments of weakening in purgatory and being sent to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.,73.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Reuterswärd, the limited number of people being admitted into Heaven “illustrates the remarkable specification contained in a treatise entitled ''Van der Vorsieningkeit Godes'', which circulated in the Netherlands in Bosch’s time, that out of 30,000 souls only two were likely to reach Heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Reuterswärd,"Hieronymus Bosch's Four "Afterlife" Panels in Venice,"34.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Bosch read this [[treatise]] will never be known for sure, however it is known that there was a high number of [[monks]] and nuns that lived in his home city. It was even called “a pious city” because of its high quantity of [[confraternities]] and religious houses.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrangement of polyptych==
Bosch scholars have other interpretations about the meaning behind these paintings, especially Ascent of the Blessed. The panels may come off straight forward and simple but there is a lot of dispute about the order of the panels and how they should be positioned in a museum. When hung in Venice in 2011, the order of the panels was ''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'', ''[[Hell]]'', space, ''[[Terrestrial Paradise (Bosch)|Terrestrial Paradise]]'', and ''Ascent of the Blessed''. The ''Terrestrial Paradise'' was placed on the left because it resembles other Eden panels by Bosch, especially with its landscape, fountain, and following biblical convention.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''109.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also confusion on whether the ''Terrestrial Paradise''  is even “paradise” because it might also be Purgatory. Another possible arrangement is ''Ascent'', ''Paradise'', ''Hell'' and the ''Fall'' which takes inspiration from Matthew 25: 32-3 in the Bible. The idea is that traditionally; God directs the damned to Hell on his left side.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bosch scholar, [[Ludwig von Baldass]], does not mention any other possible arrangements and feels that “the wings are divided into two portions, one above the other, representing on the left the figures of the saved being escorted by angels into Paradise and on the right the fall of the damned into Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Baldass,''Hieronymus Bosch,''27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars believe that Visions of the Hereafter are the wings to a missing middle panel which would presumably be the Last Judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics are not unanimous in attributing these panels to Bosch, however it would be difficult to ascribe their compositions to anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson,''Hieronymus Bosch,''62.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also speculation about how these designs came to surface through Bosch, whether they are simply just from his mind or dreams. During the sixteenth-century many people would attempt to stimulate themselves into spiritual awakening to get as close to God as possible. Thus, these might have been some of the visions people saw when attempting to jump into the unconscious depth and mystery of the spiritual visions.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''111.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''asymmetric cut''' is a [[haircut]] in which the hair is cut in such a way that the hair does not have left-right [[symmetry]] and one side is cut or appears to be longer than the other.{{r|Stacy-nd}} It is a versatile hairstyle with many subvariations.{{r|Stacy-nd}}{{r|Shellie-nd}} Usually it is a combination of two separate styles, one for each side.{{r|Stacy-nd}} An extreme variation is the "side shave", in which one side of the head is totally or partially shaved close.{{r|Cauterucci-2015-09-24}}

== Examples ==

Celebrities who have sported asymmetric hairstyles include [[Justin Bieber]],{{r|Page-Six-2015-08-31}}{{r|Romeyn-2015-08-30}} [[January Jones]],{{r|Gardner-2013-03-07}} [[Milla Jovovich]],{{r|Hairstyles-Weekly-nd}}  [[Kim Kardashian]],{{r|Panych-2016-08-02}} [[Cyndi Lauper]],{{r|Stacy-nd}} [[Rihanna]],{{r|Cauterucci-2015-09-24}} [[Roland Orzabal]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/10/how-we-made-mad-world-tears-fears&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Oakey|Phil Oakey]],{{r|Lester-2001-07-12}} and [[Davey Havok]]{{r|Raymer-2006-07-06}} of [[AFI (band)|AFI]]. Reality television star [[Kate Gosselin]] became well known for her asymmetrical cut,{{r|Romeyn-2015-08-30}}{{r|Talarico-2014-10-28}} which she has since changed.{{r|Talarico-2014-10-28}}

== Aesthetics ==

Asymmetric cuts can confer an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] property known to professional [[Hairdresser|hairdressers]] and [[Cosmetology|cosmetologists]] as "asymmetrical balance" when they balance asymmetrical facial features.{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=237–238,251}}{{r|Bendell-and-Tehan-2009|p=158,160}} Hairdressers advise the use of an asymmetric cut for clients with asymmetrical features, such as a crooked nose, because symmetrical hairstyles draw attention to the facial asymmetries.{{r|Stacy-nd}}{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=245}} Experts on personal appearance management in business offer the same advice.{{r|Vega-2010|p=99}} The asymmetry of the hairstyle should be opposite to that of the facial feature.{{r|Roche-and-Roche-2017}} Asymmetrical styles that show the ears can make the face look slimmer, and hence are advised for clients with round faces or wide-set eyes.{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=427}}{{r|Bendell-and-Tehan-2009|p=156}} If the client wears eyeglasses, an asymmetric cut can distract attention from them.{{r|Bendell-and-Tehan-2009|p=156}} Asymmetric cuts are often more "trendy" than symmetrical hairstyles.{{r|Alpert-Altenburg-Bailey-et-al-2004|p=237}}

== Psychology ==

Psychological experiments have shown that hairstyle asymmetries are helpful, although not necessary, in determining whether or not an image of a familiar face has been mirror-reversed.{{r|Bredart-2003}}

'''''Bhowani Junction''''' is a 1956 [[film adaptation]] of the 1954 novel ''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' by [[John Masters]] made by [[MGM]]. The film was directed by [[George Cukor]] and produced by [[Pandro S. Berman]] from a screenplay by [[Sonya Levien]] and [[Ivan Moffat]].

The film starred [[Ava Gardner]] as Victoria Jones, an [[Anglo-Indian]] who has been serving in the [[Indian Army]], and [[Stewart Granger]] as Colonel Rodney Savage, a (British) Indian Army officer.  It also featured [[Bill Travers]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]], [[Lionel Jeffries]] and (uncredited)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0049007|title=Bhowani Junction}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neelo]] (who went on to become one of the leading ladies of the Pakistan film industry).

The film was shot in England at [[MGM-British Studios]], [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], on the [[Longmoor Military Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald, D. W.|author2=Carter, R. J.|title=The Longmoor Military Railway|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot|year=1974|isbn=0-7153-6357-3|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on location in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].

==Plot==
India, 1947: In the final days of British rule, Victoria Jones, the daughter of an Indian mother and an English [[railroad engineer|train engineer]], is serving in the British Army. She returns on leave after four years to her home in Bhowani, where supporters of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] are non-violently protesting against British rule and communists, led by a revolutionary known as Davay, foment riot and sabotage.

She becomes reacquainted with a childhood sweetheart also of [[Anglo-Indian]] heritage, rail traffic superintendent Patrick Taylor, and with Colonel Rodney Savage, whose Indian battalion has been sent to Bhowani to maintain law and order as British rule ends. The protesters disrupt rail service and Savage places Victoria on duty during the crisis. He disperses the protesters but Victoria does not approve of his methods. She begins seriously contemplating her identity and speculates that she might marry a man from India, although clearly Taylor is still in love with her and Savage infatuated.

Walking home alone one night, Victoria is attacked and nearly raped by Captain McDaniel, one of Savage's officers, killing him with a steel bar. Finding her, a [[Sikh]] co-worker of Taylor's, Ranjit Kasel, takes her to his home and offers her sanctuary, introducing her to his mother, the Sardarni, and to a guest in their home, Ghan Shyam, who offers to hide McDaniel's body after the Sardarni worries that her son Ranjit will be accused of murdering the officer.

Davay's raids continue. He blows up a train, causing numerous deaths and injuries. Victoria, influenced by her love for India, decides to marry Ranjit, but during the ceremony fearing the complete loss of her identity, suddenly flees. When an army sentry is found murdered because he saw McDaniel and Victoria together just before she killed the officer, Victoria realizes that the man in Ranjit's home, Ghan Shyam, is actually Davay and that the Sardarni, once a notorious Indian resistance leader, has been harboring him.

Davay kidnaps Victoria, using her to escape the city aboard her father's train. Savage and Taylor intercept the train before it reaches a tunnel, rescuing Victoria but finding Davay has gone into the tunnel with dynamite. Taylor recklessly advances to defuse the dynamite but is shot by Davay, who is immediately killed by Savage. Savage, cradling Taylor as he dies, watches the passage of the train. On board is Gandhi, whom Davay meant to assassinate, thereby inciting further hostilities and riots.

Savage's duty in India ends and he is summoned back to England, but his love for Victoria has become overwhelming. When she refuses to marry him and live in England, he proposes to marry but remain in India, and she accepts. Savage's superior offers to expedite his early release from military service as reward for his accomplishments.

==Differences from novel==
The film, like the original novel, portrays the Anglo-Indian protagonist, Victoria Jones, as tugged in different directions by three suitors, Col. Rodney Savage, Ranjit Kasel and Patrick Taylor, each representing a different ethnic community: British, Indian (Sikh) and Anglo-Indian, respectively.  The film-makers, however, changed the novel's ending and Victoria's fate.  Whereas in the novel Victoria finally seeks her future with her fellow Anglo-Indian Patrick, a railway worker, the film-makers instead matched her at the end with the more obviously dashing British officer Rodney Savage, while consigning Patrick to a heroic death.&lt;ref name=Jacobson&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Andrew|title=Bhowani Junction –a brief but memorable encounter with Hollywood|url=http://area148.com/cms/bhowani-junction-a-brief-but-memorable-encounter-with-hollywood/|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006151540/http://area148.com/cms/bhowani-junction-a-brief-but-memorable-encounter-with-hollywood/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(In the writer's own depiction, in the (unfilmed) sequel "[[To the Coral Strand]]", Rodney Savage does stay on in India after the end of British rule - but he does not marry Victoria, but rather goes through many upheavals and finally finds love with an Indian woman.)

==Production==
The novel was the fourth by John Masters about India.&lt;ref&gt;By, L. N. (1954, Mar 28). Talk with john masters. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113010573&lt;/ref&gt; MGM outbid two other studios to buy the film rights, paying more than $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;By THOMAS M PRYOR Special to The New York Times. (1954, Apr 12). METRO BIDS HIGH FOR INDIA NOVEL. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113115288&lt;/ref&gt; Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger were announced as leads almost immediately; Gardner had been on suspension at the studio for refusing to appear in ''[[Love Me or Leave Me (film)|Love Me or Leave Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Special to The New York Times. (1954, Aug 14). AVA GARDNER SET FOR FILM ON INDIA. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/112983416&lt;/ref&gt;

George Cukor was assigned to direct. He travelled to India in October 1954 to research the movie. "I feel that for the first time India has been presented in this book as it really is, instead of the usual hokey-pokey atmosphere in which it is painted by most authors who write about it," he said.&lt;ref&gt;GeorgeCukor HereToGet the feel of india. (1954, Oct 03). The Times of India (1861-Current) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/608296868&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government refused to cooperate with the production of the film.&lt;ref&gt;By A.H. WEILER. (1954, Oct 24). BY WAY OF REPORT. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113049044&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional  location Bhowani [[Junction (rail)|Junction]] was in [[India]], most probably [[Jhansi]].  MGM had wanted to shoot the film in location in India; but, as the government of India insisted on script approval and imposed high taxes,  MGM  decided to film in [[Pakistan]] where the government was more welcoming.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By, J. P. (1955, May 15). First 'invasion' of pakistan by film troupe met with welcome reception. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113436640&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the change in location to Pakistan, the script was altered to show Rodney Savage in command of the 1/13 Frontier Force Battalion ([[55th Coke's Rifles (Frontier Force)|Coke's Rifles]]), which at that time of filming was part of the 7th (Golden Arrow) Division of the [[Pakistan Army]], rather than in command of a [[Gurkha]] Battalion, the  1/13 Gorkha Rifles, as in the book.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt; Pakistan army and police enthusiastically assisted in making of the film.  Several Pakistan army units of the 7 Golden Arrow Division including the 5th Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 10 Frontier Force Regiment), 5th Probyn’s Horse, 1st Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 7 Frontier Force Regiment), participated in the making of the film. Colonel Savage in the film is shown wearing the Golden Arrow formation sign of the Pakistan 7 Division.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt;

Also in the movie is the 4th Battalion (Wilde's) 13th Frontier Force Rifles, the band at the Lahore Railway Station with a deer as its mascot, while the troops taking part in the train accident were from the 4/13th. The battalion has a copy of the book and autographed photographs from both Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger.

The future Pakistani film star [[Neelo]] appeared in a small role as a reporter in a crowd scene. Neelo was introduced to Cukor by A. H. Rana, the film's production manager and casting assistant in Pakistan, who worked with the film's casting director, Harvey Woods. This was her first role in a movie.

==Reception==
The film earned $2,075,000 in North America and $2.8 million elsewhere, making a profit of $1,238,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

It recorded admissions of 1,554,970 in France.&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-ava-gardner-c24969968|title=Ava Gardner Box Office|last=Soyer|first=Renaud|first2=Didier|last2=Noisy|date=28 March 2014|work=Box Office Story|language=French|accessdate=7 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919020036/http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-ava-gardner-c24969968|archivedate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2030">[[File:Oxford University Coat Of Arms.svg|thumb|The [[coat of arms]] of the [[University of Oxford]].]]

The '''coat of arms of the University of Oxford''' depicts an open book with the inscription ''[[Dominus Illuminatio Mea|Dominus illuminatio mea]]'' ('The Lord is my light'), surrounded by three golden crowns.

A blazon of this would be:
{{cquote|''Azure, upon a book open proper, leathered Gules, garnished Or, having on the dexter side seven seals of the last, the words DOMINVS ILLVMINATIO MEA; all between three open crowns, two and one, Or.''&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford. (2005.) ''Oxford University Calendar 2005–2006'', [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-928370-2}}. p. 1 features a blazon of the coat of the arms of the university.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The arms have been in existence since around 1400, varying in appearance over the centuries. The number of seals and the text, for example, have both varied. The modern version of the arms in which they are not borne on a shield, but rather surrounded by a garter bearing the text ''UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD'', was designed in 1993 and is a registered trademark.

'''Ernest Jacques Thiel''' (Norrköping 18 August 1859 – Stockholm 6 January 1947) was a Swedish financier and art collector whose former villa in the Stockholm park area [[Djurgården]] today houses the ''[[Thielska galleriet]]'' (the Thiel Gallery). Thiel also translated works by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] into Swedish.

Ernest Thiel's parents were the Belgian Catholic engineer Jacques Thiel and Fanny Stiebel, of German-Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; After school in Stockholm, Thiel was sent to Germany to learn trade in a Hamburg merchant house, and later worked in a bank there. He returned to Stockholm in 1877 and found work in [[Stockholms Enskilda Bank]], the bank of the [[Wallenberg family]].&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 he became the manager of the Stockholm office of Hernösands enskilda bank and in 1891 he had accumulated enough capital to start his own bank, Stockholms Kredit- och Diskontoförening, later known as Aktiebolaget Stockholms diskontobank, which he headed until 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Hofberg et al. 1906; Linde, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 he had married Anna Josephson, member of a well-known Jewish family and sister-in-law of the publisher [[Bonnier family|Karl Otto Bonnier]].&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 7 f&lt;/ref&gt; He caused a scandal when he divorced her (1896–97) to marry Signe Hansen, a young and beautiful widow with literary and artistic interests who had been his wife's companion.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiel's art collecting began in earnest in 1901, when he bought art for the then considerable sum of 19,000 [[Swedish krona|crowns]] at the exhibition of the Konstnärsförbundet artist group. The following year he bought 19 paintings by [[Bruno Liljefors]].&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The flat at [[Strandvägen]] into which he had moved with second wife in 1897 started to be cramped, and in 1904, Thiel commissioned the architect [[Ferdinand Boberg]] to build him a large villa at Blockhusudden in the [[Djurgården]] park area of Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 10 f&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon discovered that the art collection had outgrown the building and Boberg had to add another large room in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke|Prince Eugen]], the painter and collector, had recently had Boberg design a combined residence and art gallery at [[Waldemarsudde]] in another part of Djurgården, which may have influenced Thiel.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince originally counteracted Thiel's plans and forced him to move his new house to a spot farther away from Waldemarsudde than he had first wanted,&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 10, 47&lt;/ref&gt; but when, in 1906, Eugen gave Thiel a painting of his, ''Nattmolnet'' (The Night Cloud) it was a sign that he had accepted his position in the art life of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Her poles include two poles raised at the [[Tsimshian]] community of [[Kitsumkalum]] near [[Terrace, British Columbia|Terrace, B.C.]], with the assistance of a Tsimshian team, a 1987 pole for the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] station in Terrace, and poles in Prince Rupert.

==Legacy and awards==
Diesing was a master carver, painter, educator and champion of First Nations art and culture.  Her students include acclaimed artists [[Dempsey Bob]], [[Norman Tait]], her nephew [[Don Yeomans]], and many others.  She lived in Terrace in her later years, and can be credited with instructing numerous students throughout the Pacific Northwest.

Diesing has received many honors and awards. She was recognized by the [[Indspire|National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]], now Indspire, who awarded her the [[Indspire Awards|National Aboriginal Achievement Award]] in [[Winnipeg]] in March 2002. She received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Northern British Columbia]] in May 2002.&lt;ref name=ncc/&gt; In 2006, [[Coast Mountain College]] created the [[Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art]], located in Terrace, British Columbia and named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fredadiesing.nwcc.bc.ca/ "Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art."] ''Northwest Community College.'' 2009. Retrieved 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has served as artist-in-residence in the Dominican Republic and participated in sculpture symposia in Finland.

'''Future Systems''' was a London-based [[architecture|architectural]] and design practice, formerly headed by Directors [[Jan Kaplický]] and [[Amanda Levete]].

Future Systems was founded by Kaplický and David Nixon after working with [[Denys Lasdun]], [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Renzo Piano]], and [[Richard Rogers]] in 1979.  The work of Future Systems can be classified within the British high-tech architects as either [[bionic architecture]] or amorphous, organic shapes sometimes referred to as "[[blobitecture]]". "Compared to his peers, Kaplicky was the avant-garde incarnate, relentlessly pursuing the new new thing, refusing to settle into some predictable, and comfortable, architectural niche."&lt;ref&gt;"Jan Kaplicky, a visionary, dies" Architectural Record, March 2009, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Future Systems proposals adapted construction methods from other professions, including (most commonly) the curved [[monocoque]] shell structures found in [[aircraft design process|aircraft design]], [[car design]] and [[boat building]].

In the 1990s the company moved from theoretical projects to fee-paying work with projects such as the "spacecraft-like"&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Booth |title=Radical architect Jan Kaplický dies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jan/15/architect-jan-kaplicky-dies |work=The Guardian |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord's Media Centre|Media Centre]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in London (completed 1999), and the Selfridges Building (completed 2003). For Lord's, Kaplicky received the [[Stirling Prize]]. The [[Selfridges Building, Birmingham|Selfridges]] department store is a prime example of the early 21st century movement referred to as "[[blobitecture]]", and has been compared to [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]]'s [[Kunsthaus Graz|Kunsthaus]] in [[Graz]], Austria.

After Future Systems won the Stirling Prize, the firm received larger commissions including the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena, Italy (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Staff Writer |title=Designed for the fast lane |url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=818 |publisher=World Architecture News |date= 15 January 2007|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the unbuilt new [[Czech National Library]]. In 2008 Kaplický and Levete split the firm. Kaplický took the firm name and some staff to the Czech republic, and Levete would take a proposed new headquarters for News Corporation in east London and a commission for a hotel and retail complex in Bangkok, Thailand, along with most of the staff – between 35 and 45 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Booth |title=From a shining future to a bitter end as 'blob' architecture pioneers part company |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/17/architecture |work=The Guardian |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Umbria, jacopo da varazze, leggenda aurea, 1290 ca. 01.jpg|thumb|300px|''Legenda Aurea'', 1290 circa, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], Florence]]

[[Image:Stgeorge-dragon.jpg|thumb|The story of [[Saint George and the dragon]] is one of many stories of the [[saint]]s preserved in the ''Golden Legend''.]]

The '''''Golden Legend''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Legenda aurea'' or ''Legenda sanctorum'') is a collection of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] by Blessed [[Jacobus de Varagine]] that was widely read in late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe. More than a thousand manuscripts of the text have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Maddocks, "Pictures for aristocrats: the manuscripts of the ''Légende dorée''", in Margaret M. Manion, Bernard James Muir, eds. ''Medieval texts and images: studies of manuscripts from the Middle Ages'' 1991:2; a study of the systemization of the Latin manuscripts of the ''Legenda aurea'' is B. Fleith, "Le classement des quelque 1000 manuscrits de la Legenda aurea latine  en vue de l'éstablissement d'une histoire de la tradition" in Brenda Dunn-Lardeau, ed. ''Legenda Aurea: sept siècles de diffusion", 1986:19-24&lt;/ref&gt; It was likely compiled around the year 1260, although the text was added to over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to the ''Legenda'', its great popular late medieval success and the collapse of its reputation in the 16th century, is Sherry L. Reames, ''The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history'', University of Wisconsin, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houghton WKR 1.3.4 - Saints in glory.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration for ''Golden Legend'', 1493]]
[[Image:Sainte Marguerite et Olibrius.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]] attracts the attention of the Roman prefect, by [[Jean Fouquet]] from an [[illuminated manuscript]]]]
Initially entitled ''Legenda sanctorum'' (''Readings of the Saints''), it gained its popularity under the title by which it is best known. It overtook and eclipsed earlier compilations of abridged legendaria, the ''Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum'' attributed to the Dominican chronicler [[Jean de Mailly]] and the ''Epilogus in gestis sanctorum'' of the Dominican preacher [[Bartholomew of Trent]]. Over eight hundred&lt;ref&gt;Number supplied by Reames 1985:4.&lt;/ref&gt; manuscript copies of the work survive, and when printing was invented in the 1450s, editions appeared quickly, not only in Latin, but also in every major European language. Among ''[[incunabula]]'', printed before 1501, ''Legenda aurea'' was printed in more editions than the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Reames 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first books [[William Caxton]] printed in the [[English language]]; Caxton's version appeared in 1483 and his translation was reprinted, reaching a ninth edition in 1527.&lt;ref name="Vorágine)1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacobus (de Vorágine)|title=The Golden Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99I3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=16 November 2012|year=1973|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=8–|id=GGKEY:DE1HSY5K6AF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Written in simple, readable Latin, the book was read in its day for its stories. The book is considered the closest to an encyclopaedia of medieval saint lore that survives today; as such it is invaluable to [[art history|art historians]] and medievalists who seek to identify saints depicted in art by their deeds and attributes. Its repetitious nature is explained if Jacobus da Varagine meant to write a compendium of saintly lore for [[sermon]]s and [[preaching]], not a work of popular entertainment.

==Lives of the saints==
The book sought to compile traditional lore about all of the saints [[veneration|venerated]] at the time of its compilation. Jacobus da Varagine typically begins with an (often fanciful) [[etymology]] for the saint's name. An example (in Caxton's translation) shows his method:

{{quote|[[Pope Silvester I|Silvester]] is said of ''sile'' or ''sol'' which is light, and of ''terra'' the earth, as who saith the light of the earth, that is of the church. Or Silvester is said of ''silvas'' and of ''trahens'', that is to say he was drawing wild men and hard unto the faith. Or as it is said ''in glossario'', Silvester is to say green, that is to wit, green in contemplation of heavenly things, and a toiler in labouring himself; he was umbrous or shadowous. That is to say he was cold and refrigate from all concupiscence of the flesh, full of boughs among the trees of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester "The Life of St. Sylvester."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925020341/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester |date=2012-09-25 }} ''The Golden Legend'' or ''Lives of the Saints.'' Compiled by Jacobus de Varagine. Trans. William Caxton. Ed. [[F. S. Ellis]]. Reproduced at ''www.Aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend'', Augusta State University.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a Latin author, Jacobus da Varagine must have known that ''Silvester'', a relatively common Latin name, simply meant "from the forest". The correct derivation is alluded to in the text, but set out in parallel to fanciful ones that [[lexicography|lexicographers]] would consider quite wide of the mark. Even the "correct" explanations (''silvas'', "forest", and the mention of green boughs) are used as the basis for an [[allegory|allegorical]] interpretation. Jacobus da Varagine's etymologies had different goals from modern etymologies, and cannot be judged by the same standards. Jacobus' etymologies have parallels in [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'', in which linguistically accurate derivations are set out beside allegorical and figurative explanations.

Jacobus da Varagine then moves on to the saint's life, compiled with reference to the readings from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s [[liturgy]] commemorating that saint; then embellishes the biography with [[supernatural]] tales of incidents involving the saint's life.

===Medieval view of Muhammad===
The chapter "St Pelagius, Pope and the History of the Lombards" begins with the story of St Pelagius, then proceeds to touch upon events surrounding the origin and history of the [[Lombards]] in Europe leading up to the 7th century when the story of [[Muhammad]] begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNWZgIL5ZCoC&amp;pg=PA753#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Golden Legend: Readings on the Saints|first=Jacobus De|last=Varagine|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story then goes on to describe "Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)" as "a false prophet and sorcerer", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his "visions" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade [[Nestorianism | Nestorian]] monk named [[Bahira|Sergius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNWZgIL5ZCoC&amp;pg=PA754&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Golden Legend: Readings on the Saints|first=Jacobus De|last=Varagine|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=11 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter conveys the medieval Christian understanding of the beliefs of [[Saracens]] and other [[Muslims]].

===Miracle tales of relics===
Many of the stories also conclude with [[miracle]] tales and similar wonderlore from accounts of those who called upon that saint for aid or used the saint's [[relic]]s. Such a tale is told of Saint [[Agatha of Sicily|Agatha]]; Jacobus da Varagine has [[paganism|pagans]] in [[Catania]] repairing to the relics of St. Agatha to [[magic (paranormal)|supernaturally]] repel an [[volcano|eruption]] of [[Mount Etna]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And for to prove that she had prayed for the salvation of the country, at the beginning of February, the year after her martyrdom, there arose a great fire, and came from the mountain toward the city of Catania and burnt the earth and stones, it was so fervent. Then ran the paynims to the sepulchre of S. Agatha and took the cloth that lay upon her tomb, and held it abroad against the fire, and anon on the ninth day after, which was the day of her feast, ceased the fire as soon as it came to the cloth that they brought from her tomb, showing that our Lord kept the city from the said fire by the merits of S. Agatha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/agatha "The Life of St. Agatha."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120801050601/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/agatha |date=2012-08-01 }} ''The Golden Legend'' or ''Lives of the Saints.''

A substantial portion of Jacobus' text was drawn from two [[epitome]]s of collected lives of the saints, both also arranged in the order of the liturgical year, written by members of his [[Dominican order]]: one is [[Jean de Mailly]]'s lengthy ''Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum'' (''Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints'') and the other is [[Bartholomew of Trent]]'s ''Epilogum in gesta sanctorum'' (''Afterword on the Deeds of the Saints'').&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Maddocks, "Pictures for aristocrats: the manuscripts of the Légende dorée", in Margaret M. Manion and Bernard James Muir, eds.,''Medieval Texts and Images: studies of manuscripts from the Middle Ages'' 1991:2 note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The many extended parallels to text found in [[Vincent de Beauvais]]' ''[[Speculum historiale]]'', the main encyclopedia that was used in the Middle Ages, are attributed by modern scholars to the two authors' common compilation of identical sources, rather than to Jacobus' reading Vincent's encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stace, tr., ''The Golden Legend: selections'' (Penguin), "Introduction" pp. xii–xvi, reporting conclusions of K. Ernest Geith, (Geith, "Jacques de Varagine, auteur indépendant ou compilateur?" in Brenda Dunn-Lardeau, ed. ''Legenda aurea – 'La Légende dorée'' 1993:17–32) who printed the comparable texts side by side.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 more distant sources have been identified for the tales related of the saints in the ''Golden Legend'', few of which have a nucleus in the [[New Testament]] itself; these [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] sources include [[apocrypha]]l texts such as the ''[[Gospel of Nicodemus]]'', and the histories of [[Gregory of Tours]] and [[John Cassian]]. Many of his stories have no other known source. A typical example of the sort of story related, also involving St. Silvester, shows the saint receiving miraculous instruction from [[Saint Peter]] in a [[vision (religion)|vision]] that enables him to [[exorcism|exorcise]] a [[dragon]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this time it happed that there was at Rome a dragon in a pit, which every day slew with his breath more than three hundred men. Then came the bishops of the idols unto the emperor and said unto him: O thou most holy emperor, sith the time that thou hast received Christian faith the dragon which is in yonder fosse or pit slayeth every day with his breath more than three hundred men. Then sent the emperor for S. Silvester and asked counsel of him of this matter. S. Silvester answered that by the might of God he promised to make him cease of his hurt and blessure of this people. Then S. Silvester put himself to prayer, and S. Peter appeared to him and said: "Go surely to the dragon and the two priests that be with thee take in thy company, and when thou shalt come to him thou shalt say to him in this manner: Our Lord Jesus Christ which was born of the Virgin Mary, crucified, buried and arose, and now sitteth on the right side of the Father, this is he that shall come to deem and judge the living and the dead, I commend thee Sathanas that thou abide him in this place till he come. Then thou shalt bind his mouth with a thread, and seal it with thy seal, wherein is the imprint of the cross. Then thou and the two priests shall come to me whole and safe, and such bread as I shall make ready for you ye shall eat.&lt;p&gt;Thus as S. Peter had said, S. Silvester did. And when he came to the pit, he descended down one hundred and fifty steps, bearing with him two lanterns, and found the dragon, and said the words that S. Peter had said to him, and bound his mouth with the thread, and sealed it, and after returned, and as he came upward again he met with two enchanters which followed him for to see if he descended, which were almost dead of the stench of the dragon, whom he brought with him whole and sound, which anon were baptized, with a great multitude of people with them. Thus was the city of Rome delivered from double death, that was from the culture and worshiping of false idols, and from the venom of the dragon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester "The Life of St. Sylvester."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925020341/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend/silvester |date=2012-09-25 }} ''The Golden Legend'' or ''Lives of the Saints''.

Jacobus had his limits; he describes the story of [[Saint Margaret of Antioch]] surviving being swallowed by a dragon as "apocryphal and not to be taken seriously" (trans. Ryan, 1.369).

==Perception and legacy==
[[File:Iacopo - Legenda aurea, nel MCCCCLXXXXIX adi V di decembre - 911150 2r.jpg|thumb|upright|''Legenda Aurea'', 1499.]]

===16th-century rejection and 20th-century revival===
The adverse reaction to ''Legenda aurea'' under critical scrutiny in the 16th century was led by scholars who reexamined the criteria for judging hagiographic sources and found ''Legenda aurea'' wanting; prominent among the [[humanism|humanist]]s were two disciples of [[Erasmus]], [[Georg Witzel]], in the preface to his ''Hagiologium'', and [[Juan Luis Vives]] in ''De disciplinis''. Criticism among members of Jacobus' Dominican order were muted by the increased reverence towards the archbishop, which culminated in his beatification in 1815. The rehabilitation of ''Legenda aurea'' in the 20th century, now interpreted as a mirror of the heartfelt pieties of the 13th century, is attributed&lt;ref&gt;Reames 1985:18ff.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Téodor de Wyzewa]], whose retranslation into French, and its preface, have been often reprinted.

===Editions and translations ===
[[Image:Felicianusandprimus.jpg|thumb|right|Saints [[Primus and Felician]], from a 14th-century manuscript of the ''Golden Legend'']]
The critical edition of the Latin text has been edited by Giovanni Paolo Maggioni (Florence: SISMEL 1998). In 1900, the Caxton version was updated into more modern English by [[Frederick Startridge Ellis]], and published in seven volumes. Jacobus da Varagine's original was translated into French around the same time by [[Téodor de Wyzewa]]. A modern English translation of the ''Golden Legend'' has been published by William Granger Ryan, {{ISBN|0-691-00153-7}} and {{ISBN|0-691-00154-5}} (2 volumes).

A modern translation of the ''Golden Legend'' is available from [[Fordham University]]'s Medieval Sourcebook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend''The Golden Legend''].

'''Heraldic visitations''' were tours of inspection undertaken by [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]] (and more often by junior [[Officer of arms|officers of arms (or Heralds)]] as deputies) throughout [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]]. Their purpose was to regulate and register the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] and [[borough]]s, and to record [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s. They took place from 1530 to 1688, and their records (akin to an [[upper class]] [[census]]) provide important source material for [[historian]]s and [[genealogy|genealogists]].

==Visitations in England==

===Process of visitations===
[[Image:English heraldic visitations map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Map showing the number of visitations by the [[King of Arms]] to [[England]]'s counties, taken from ''Burke's Landed Gentry'', 1937 edition]]
By the fifteenth century, the use and abuse of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] was becoming widespread in [[England]]. One of the duties conferred on [[William Bruges]] (or [[Brydges]]), the first [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] was to survey and record the [[Coat of arms|armorial bearings]] and [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]]s of those using coats of arms and correct irregularities. [[officer of arms|Officers of arms]] had made occasional tours of various parts of the kingdom to enquire about armorial matters during the fifteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Friar, Ed. ''A Dictionary of Heraldry''. (Harmony Books, New York: 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the sixteenth century that the process began in earnest.

The first provincial visitations were carried out under [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] granted by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to [[Thomas Benolt]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/2/101002134/ www.oxforddnb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; dated 6 April 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn. ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry''. (MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London: 1960), 386.&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned to travel throughout his province (i.e. south of the [[River Trent|Trent]]) with authority to enter all homes and churches. Upon entering these premises, he was authorized to "put down or otherwise deface at his discretion... those [[coat of arms|arms]] unlawfully used".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Vivian, Ed. ''The Visitations of Cornwall, Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1530, 1573, &amp;1620''. (William Pollard and Co., Exeter: 1887), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also required to enquire into all those using the titles of [[knight]], [[esquire]], or [[gentleman]] and decided if they were being lawfully used.

By this [[writ]], Henry VIII also compelled the [[sheriff]]s and [[mayor]]s of each [[county]] or [[city]] visited by the [[officer of arms|officers of arms]] to give aid and assistance in gathering the needed information. When a [[King of Arms]], or Herald, visited a county, his presence was proclaimed by presenting the King's royal commission to the local gentry and nobility, which required them to provide evidence of their right to use a [[coat of arms]]. The [[High Sheriff|Sheriff]] would collect from the [[bailiff]] of each [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] within his county a list of all people using [[title]]s or arms. 

In the early days, the visiting herald would tour the homes of the gentry and nobility, but from the late 1560s these persons were summoned to attend a central "place of sitting" – usually an inn – at a particular time.&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; They were to bring their arms, and proof of their right to use them, most often by way of detailing their ancestral right to them, which would also be recorded. Where an official [[grant of arms]] had been made, this was also recorded. Other ancient arms, many of which predated the establishment of the [[College of Arms]], were confirmed. The [[officer of arms|officer]] would record the information clearly and make detailed notes that could be entered into the records of the College of Arms when the party returned to [[London]]. 

These volumes now make up the collection of Visitation Books at the College, which contain a wealth of information about all armigerous people from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; If the officers of arms were not presented with sufficient proof of the right to use a coat of arms, they were also empowered to deface monuments which bore these arms and to force persons bearing such arms to sign a disclaimer that they would cease using them. The visitations were not always popular with members of the landed gentry, who were required to present proof of their gentility.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Following the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689, no further commissions to carry out visitations were commanded. The reasons behind this cessation of the programme have been a matter of debate among historians. Philip Styles, for example, related it to a declining willingness of members of the gentry to attend visitations, which he traced to a growing proportion of "[[parvenu|newly risen]]" families, who lacked long pedigrees and were therefore apathetic about registering them.&lt;ref&gt;Styles 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janet Verasano has challenged this interpretation, finding that (in Staffordshire, at least) gentry enthusiasm for coats of arms as an enhancement to social standing persisted to the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Verasano 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the visitations did not have much effect on those counties far removed from London, some of which had only been rarely visited over the entire period of the visitations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

There was never a systematic visitation of Wales. There were four visitations in the principality, and on 9 June 1551, Fulk ap Hywel, [[Lancaster Herald|Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary]] was given a commission to visit all of Wales. This was not carried out, however, as he was degraded and executed for counterfeiting the seal of [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]. This is regrettable, since no visitation of all Wales was ever made by the officers of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Siddons|Michael Powell Siddons]]. ''Visitations by the Heralds in Wales''. (The Harleian Society, London: 1996), v.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===
[[Image:Thomas Hawley Clarenceux King of Arms.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Hawley]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms]], wearing a [[tabard]] displaying the [[Royal arms of England]]; the manuscripts from his first tour of London are the earliest existing records of an English visitation.]]
The principal records to emerge from the visitations were pedigrees, initially recorded on loose sheets of paper, and afterwards bound together as notebooks. In some cases, the sheets would include blank shields which had been drawn in advance (or at a later date printed), to simplify the process of recording coats of arms.&lt;ref name="Wag p167"&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The persons whose pedigrees were recorded were required (from about 1570 onwards) to certify them by signature, and where these original draft pedigrees have survived they are known as "originals with signatures".&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 58–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The signed copies were taken back to the College of Arms, where fair copies were made to a higher standard and preserved as the "office copies".&lt;ref name="Wag p167"/&gt; Sometimes the signed copies were also retained at the College, but in other cases, no longer considered of official interest, they might pass into private hands: once in general circulation, further copies were often made, which might in turn be revised or augmented. As a result, a number of variant manuscript copies of any one visitation record may now survive, possessing varying degrees of accuracy and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 24–5, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harleian Collection]] of the [[British Library]] is particularly rich in such records. Many visitation records have been published over the years, by the [[Harleian Society]], by county [[Text publication society|record societies]], and a few privately (see [[Heraldic visitation#Published editions|listing below]]). However, because until relatively recently the College of Arms restricted access to its records, many of the older published editions were necessarily based on the unofficial second- or third-generation copies in other collections, and may therefore not always be reliable.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 18, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

From as early as the 1530s, officers of arms on visitation frequently also compiled what were known as "church notes". These were [[fieldnotes]] (usually in the form of sketches) of coats of arms observed on [[English church monuments|church monuments]], in [[stained glass]] windows, or on display in private houses.&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1967, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, drawings were also made of non-heraldic antiquities, such as medieval architectural features, views of towns, Roman inscriptions and even [[Stonehenge]].&lt;ref name="Wag52 pp61-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.D. |last=Kendrick |authorlink=T. D. Kendrick |title=British Antiquity |year=1950 |location=London |publisher=Methuen |pages=156–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lankester |first=Philip J. |year=1993 |title=Two lost effigial monuments in Yorkshire and the evidence of church notes |journal=Church Monuments |volume=8 |pages=25–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ailes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th-century visitations generated a growing number of supplementary papers, including warrants, lists of persons who disclaimed any pretence to arms, lists of persons summoned to appear before the heralds (including those who had not appeared), records of fees paid, and miscellaneous correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see {{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Ireland |editor2-last=Squibb |editor2-first=G.D. |editor2-link=George Drewry Squibb |title=Dugdale's Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Visitation Papers |place=London |series=Harleian Society, new ser. |volume=6 |year=1987 |ISBN=0-9500207-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lists of visitations===
Visitations were conducted by or in the name of the two provincial [[King of Arms|Kings of Arms]], [[Clarenceux King of Arms|Clarenceux]] and [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms|Norroy]], within their respective provinces. In the following lists, the Deputies are the officers of arms who actually carried out the visitations. Where no Deputy is named, the visitation can be assumed to have been conducted by the King of Arms in person.

====Southern Province====
The Southern Province, the jurisdiction of Clarenceux King of Arms, comprised that part of [[England]] south of the [[River Trent]], i.e. the counties of [[Bedfordshire|Bedford]], [[Berkshire|Berks]], [[Buckinghamshire|Buckingham]], [[Cambridgeshire|Cambridge]], [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[Essex]], [[Gloucestershire|Gloucester]], [[Herefordshire|Hereford]], [[Hertfordshire|Hertford]], [[Huntingdonshire|Huntingdon]], [[Kent]], [[Leicestershire|Leicester]], [[Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Middlesex]], [[Monmouthshire|Monmouth]], [[Norfolk]], [[Northamptonshire|Northampton]], [[Oxfordshire|Oxford]], [[Rutland]], [[Shropshire|Salop]], [[Somerset]], [[Hampshire|Southampton]], [[Suffolk]], [[Surrey]], [[Sussex]], [[Warwickshire|Warwick]], [[Wiltshire|Wilton]], [[Worcestershire|Worcester]], and the [[City of London]]; and [[South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 66–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Province====
The Northern Province, the jurisdiction of Norroy King of Arms, comprised that part of England north of the River Trent, i.e. the counties of [[Cheshire|Chester]], [[Cumberland]], [[Derbyshire|Derby]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Northumberland]], [[Nottinghamshire|Nottingham]], [[Staffordshire|Stafford]], [[Westmorland]] and [[Yorkshire|York]]; and [[North Wales]]. The Trent ran through Staffordshire, and the county was therefore technically divided between the two provinces; but for the purposes of visitation it was generally treated (sometimes through a process of deputation) as falling under the jurisdiction of Norroy.&lt;ref&gt;Listings are based on Wagner 1952, pp. 77–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitations in Ireland==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2016}}
Since the practices of [[Ulster King of Arms]] so closely followed those of the English College of Arms, it is hardly surprising that the Irish officers of arms undertook heraldic visitations in their province. The purpose behind these visitations was twofold: to prevent the assumption of arms by unqualified people, and to record the arms of the gentry that were unknown to Ulster office. The first visitation was held by [[Nicholas Narbon]], the second [[Ulster King of Arms]], in 1569. He was authorized to reform practices which were contrary to good armorial practice. He conducted six visitations ([[Dublin]] in 1568&amp;ndash;1573, [[Drogheda]] and [[Ardee]] in 1570, Dublin in 1572, [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] in 1572, [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1574, and [[Limerick]] in 1574). One of his successors, [[Daniel Molyneux]] had the commission renewed, and mounted several visitations. Although Molyneux's last visitation – of [[Wexford]] – was the last proper visitation, two other expeditions occurred after 1618 by subsequent Ulster Kings of Arms. The visitations were not very extensive. The officers would not often be found in the disturbed countryside. Thus the visitations are confined to areas under firm control of the [[Dublin]] administration.

Today, the original visitation and related manuscripts are in the custody of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Copies are also deposited at the College of Arms in London.

The [[Film score|film's score]] and [[soundtrack]] are [[musical composition|composed]] by [[A. R. Rahman]]. The film met with critical acclaim upon release and received accolades.

==Plot==
Mokkatha (Vani), a wife of Mokkaiyan ([[Periyar Dasan]]), a farmer in Pottalpetti village, is in labour. They already have two daughters and are keen to have a son; two daughters born earlier were killed soon after birth by feeding them with poisonous cactus extract. Unable to pay hefty dowries for their daughters marriage, the villagers consider female infanticide to be acceptable. A new school teacher ([[R. Sundarrajan (director)|R. Sundarrajan]]) feels sad on learning about this heinous practice. When Mokkatha delivers a girl again, Mokkaiyan orders the village midwife ([[S. N. Lakshmi]]) to kill the baby. The midwife sadly tries to feed the cactus extract to the baby at a secluded place. The school teacher notices, meets her and requests to handover the infant so that he can bring up her. She hands over and he moves away from the village with the child.

As years roll by, Stephen ([[Raja (Tamil actor)|Raja]]), a veterinary doctor, comes to the village. Mokkaiyan's first daughter Ponnatha ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]) is married to Thavasi ([[Ponvannan]]), the son of Mokkaiya's nefarious sister. The second daughter Karuthamma ([[Rajashree (actress)|Rajashree]]) takes care of the family. After getting into some tiff with Stephen, Karuthamma falls in love with him.

Ponnatha has two daughters, and is pregnant for the third time. Unfortunately, when a girl is born again, Kaliamma ([[Vadivukkarasi]]), her mother-in-law and Mokkaiyan's sister, orders to kill it. To save her child, Ponnatha escapes with her baby and is chased by Thavasi, who beats her to death; the child also dies. He and Kaliamma enact a drama that Ponnatha committed suicide as her third child also a girl.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=336}}

Karuthamma, devastated with the death of her sister, does not believe this story. Ponnatha had earlier expressed her fear to her that if she delivered a girl again, Kaliamma would kill her. When Karuthamma is giving a ceremonial bath to Ponnatha's baby, she notices bloodstains on her abdomen.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=337}} Concluding that she was murdered, Karuthamma stops the funeral and rushes to complain to the police. The village chairman Chellamuthu (Kamalasekhar), who is close to Thavasi, asks the police not to intervene, hence the police do not. Karuthamma refuses to leave the station. Stephen, who is passing by, threatens action against the police if they do not act on her complaint, as he is also a government employee. Left with no option, the police take Ponnatha's body away and arrest Thavasi and Kaliamma.

Dr. Rosy ([[Maheswari]]), a teacher's daughter, comes to meet her close relative Stephen. Her presence and closeness with Stephen is misunderstood by Karuthamma. Rosy loves Stephen, but he only likes her. Kaliamma's husband ([[Janagaraj]]) celebrates her arrest by drinking with Mokkaiyan, who is not used to liquor. Mokkaiyan suffers a paralytic attack and loses control of his limbs. Rosy attends to him and in the process gets attached to Mokkaiyan and Karuthamma.

A few weeks later, when Thavasi and Kaliamma get bail, they come to attack Karuthamma, but Stephen saves her. Chellamuthu manipulates the villagers to accept Thavasi's proposal that Karuthamma must marry Thavasi to take care of Ponnatha's two young daughters (by which the police case will also be closed). Chellamuthu, who has lent money to Mokkaiyan, threatens and seeks immediate repayment if he does not accept this proposal.

Thavasi's father realises that his son is using the young children as bait and takes away the children with him one night. However, he is caught by Thavasi, who, motivated by Chellamuthu, burns his father to death. Thavasi takes the children away and forces Karuthamma to come with him to their village to marry him. Shocked with all this, Mokkaiyan consumes poison and is on his deathbed.

When Rosy expresses her love to Stephen, he gets surprised and states that he loves Karuthamma. Rosy is shocked as she was keen to marry him and decides to move away from the village. When the villagers asks her to treat Mokkaiyan who is fighting for his life, she does not as she is keen to leave. When her father, the teacher arrives, the village midwife realises that he is the same person who took Mokkiayan's third daughter. The midwife reveals to Rosy that Mokkaiyan is her real father; the school teacher also confirms it. Rosy treats Mokkaiyan, who now realises his mistake of killing female infants without realizing their worth.

Karuthamma, on the eve of her wedding, demands to see the children take away earlier by Thavasi's father. However, Thavasi is unable to show his children (as they were taken by Chellamuthu to use them as bait to force himself on Karuthamma). That night Chellamuthu makes Thavasi drunk and asks him to spare Karuthamma for that night. Thavasi agrees in a drunken state, which is overheard by Karuthamma, who also comes to know that Thavasi had killed his own father. When Chellamuthu goes to meet Karuthamma, she is well prepared to meet him. She murders Chellamuthu and then Thavasi. After saving Ponnatha's children, who were locked inside a box, she returns to her village. Realising that Rosy is her own sister, Karuthamma asks her to look after the children and their father and leaves with the police. Stephen is sad but decides to wait for her.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=338}}

==Themes and influences==
The film was a milestone in the annals of [[Tamil cinema]], addressed the heinous act of female foeticide prevalent in [[Tamil Nadu]] during that time. This hard hitting film highlights this crime and created huge awareness among the people and officials, which led to the banning of the practice of prenatal sex identification across country. It was received with critical acclaim and received many accolades. The film looks at female infanticide and the hatred that surrounds the birth of a female child. A father blames his miseries on the birth of his daughters. Set in a rural village. ''Karuthamma'' was released to critical acclaim.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=336}}

[[Bharathiraja]] once mentioned that ''Karuththamma'' is the finest film in his career. Such was his attachment to the theme of this film. The practice of gender identification of the foetus and terminating pregnancy for female foetuses was becoming a rampant practice in [[India]]. This film highlighted the next level of crime&amp;nbsp;— killing female infants&amp;nbsp;— which created mass awareness on the practice. The Government of Tamil Nadu initiated several new policies to prevent and control this practice in the last 15 Years. A new law across the country banning gender identification of foetus also saved millions of girls lives and maintenance of a healthy sex ratio.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=337}}

''Behindwoods.com'' wrote:"Taking in his hands the issue of female infanticide, Bharathiraja presented the poignant tale of a female child who was to be slain as soon as she was born. Besides, he did not fail to pose a question in the end of the movie, serving his part in making the viewer socially conscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-slide-shows/movie-1/social/tamil-cinema-social-karuthamma.html|title=Karuthamma|website=Behindwoods.com|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karuththamma'' touched upon the emotionally sensitive subject of killing female infants and hence was widely appreciated. The intense story, super hit and youthful music from [[A. R. Rahman]] and fine direction by Bharathiraja added sheen to the film. It remains a milestone in [[Tamil Cinema]] for bringing to light the menaces in the society and putting an end to them through law.''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'' in its review(04-12-1994) mentioned that "Though the subject taken up was delicate, instead of making a documentary, the director has narrated the film, through visuals, which should be appreciated. [[Bharathiraja]] must be congratulated for making a heart&amp;nbsp;— wrenching film on a delicate subject without lecturing us on the theme". The film was given 45 Marks.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=338}}

===Box Office===
The film ran for over 100 days. The first film to bring to light the menace of [[Female infanticide]] on screen, ''Karuththamma'' forced the Government at National and State level to act against this practice and bring in suitable laws to curb it. It became a catalyst for this change in the society and was recognised with both National and State Awards.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=338}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1052">The '''Leonardo da Vinci Award''' was established in 1975 by the [[Rotary Club]] of [[Florence]] as an annual international prize named after [[Leonardo da Vinci]], to be presented to young people involved in the study of the sciences, technology, literature and the arts. Among the disciplines recognised and rewarded so far have been [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[geology]], [[architecture]], [[medicine]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The 21st Leonardo da Vinci Prize was recently presented to the brilliant young pianist Johan Schmidt. The prize giving event has been hosted by other European Rotary Clubs in cities such as [[Tours]], [[Vienna]], [[Athens]], [[Madrid]], [[Würzburg]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]].  This event was last held in [[London]] in 1987, when the prize was awarded to the internationally recognised percussionist [[Evelyn Glennie]]. In 1996 1/2 the Rotary Club of London will again be responsible for hosting the prize-giving ceremony.

'''Assassinations''' have formed a major plot element in various works of fiction. This article provides a list of fictional stories in which assassination features as an important plot element.  Passing mentions are omitted.
 
Assassination can be regarded as the murder of a ''prominent'' person for a motive which is broadly public and political rather than merely personal or financial.&lt;ref&gt;
Murders within families are often termed assassinations if the family members are very prominent. This would be true of Roman Empire poisonings, or the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre|slaughter of the royal family in Nepal]]. The murder of the well-known actor [[Phil Hartman]] by his wife in 1998 does not qualify.
&lt;br /&gt;
Is the 1978 murder of actor [[Bob Crane]] assassination? No. Is the 1987 murder of singer [[Peter Tosh]] by robbers assassination? If the motive is extortion, no. If an author writes a novel proposing a broad conspiracy, then yes. Is the 1948 death of actor [[Solomon Mikhoels]] assassination? Yes. It was orchestrated by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].
&lt;br /&gt;
King [[Alex I of England|Charles I]]? No. Executed publicly, after a trial. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]? Yes. Executed secretly, with his children, without a trial.
&lt;br /&gt;
There will always be a problem with a precise definition and applying that definition to specific cases.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Assassinations in fiction have attracted scholarly attention.  In ''Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy: Transformations in Society and Culture'', as well as analyzing Italian assassinations in their historical and cultural contexts, Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi explore the films, plays, other works of fiction, and art that the act of assassination has inspired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palgrave-usa.com/catalog/product.aspx?isbn=1403983917 ''Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy'']: ''Transformations in Society and Culture'', edited by Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Cullather]] has discussed "The Movie Version" of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cullather, "History, Conspiracy, and the Kennedy Assassination", ''Retrieving the American Past'', ed. Marc Horger (New York: Pearson Custom Publishing, 2005), pp. 301–30&lt;/ref&gt;

This list prefers to highlight less familiar cultural artifacts, while trying not to itemize every [[Ian Fleming]] or [[Agatha Christie]] title, or every [[Mafia]] film. The historical–historically based or historically inspired–takes precedence over the purely fictional and sensational.

Introductory notes:

This section does not indicate the country of origin for a film which is in English. (Far too many countries produce films in English, either by themselves, or in complex co-production arrangements which are '''irrelevant''' to the subject matter of this article.)

When the nationality of a film is indicated, that is primarily about the '''language''' of the film. In cases where a country has multiple official languages, or languages in common use, then the film's language is noted in parentheses. French Canadian films represent an exception (since the editor of this section is a Canadian). (Presumably, at some point, there could be British (Welsh) or South African (Afrikaans) films listed here, but in both of these cases, the nationality is not indicated now.)

The other reason to note a film's nationality is to provide a context for the film's description. So a "President" in a Polish film description implies a Polish President. In the general English-speaking context, a "President" is assumed to be American, rather than Irish or South African and so forth, but that is usually clarified here by using "US President" explicitly.

This section assumes an intelligent readership that does not require links to define major world cities (no Moscow or New Delhi, much less [[Paris, France]]), or the states and provinces of the USA, Canada, and Australia. Indian states, alas, are not so familiar to anglophones outside the subcontinent, so this section will use [[Himachal Pradesh]]. British and Irish counties, in spite of their antiquity in many cases, are also not immediately familiar to many, so this section will use [[Co. Durham]] and [[Co. Donegal]] when needed.

If there is a link to a "novel", then it is to an actual novel, and not merely the definition of the word "novel". Links in this section should always be consequential.
--&gt;
The list is organized chronologically by year of release, rather than year of production.&lt;br /&gt;
Within each year, films based on genuine historical events are listed first, followed by any purely fictional entries.
&lt;!--
  -- Previously, this list distinguished real from imaginary by having links to the years
  -- of the actual historical events.
  -- Links to years have now generally been suppressed in English Wikipedia.

In 1955 the [[Bollywood]] group Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Samyabrata Ray Goswami |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1141111/jsp/frontpage/story_19024241.jsp#.VTaWKul0wdk |title=Women get makeup justice |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014 the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry out any profession) and Article 21 (right to liberty).&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no "rationale nexus" to the cause sought to be achieved and was "unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist, female or male, to work in the industry, they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amit Anand Choudhary|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bollywood/Bollywood-make-up-artists-group-inducts-first-woman-after-SC-rap/articleshow/46995208.cms |title=Bollywood make-up artists’ group inducts first woman after SC rap |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) authorised an official protest on the movie set of [[Bang Bang!]] in protest of a foreign makeup artist, Daniel Bauer working on the movie for its lead actress, [[Katrina Kaif]]. The CCMAA and 15 of its members protested on the movie set as Daniel Bauer was not registered with the Union, despite the Union banning foreign artists working in Bollywood. The issue was resolved with the CCMAA granting Daniel Bauer full membership &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/salman-khan-comes-to-katrina-kaif-s-rescue/story-GMCYL9HKR55xcJU3pXZB7O.html|title=Salman Khan comes to Katrina Kaif's rescue|author=|date=28 June 2014|website=hindustantimes.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Man Ray''' (born '''Emmanuel Radnitzky'''; August 27, 1890&amp;nbsp;– November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in [[Paris]]. He was a significant contributor to the [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of [[List of artistic media|media]] but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his photography, and he was a renowned [[fashion photography|fashion]] and portrait photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with [[photogram]]s, which he called "rayographs" in reference to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743589,00.html |title=Rayograms by Man Ray |work=Time |date=April 18, 1932 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Background and early life===
[[File:WLA amart 1913 watercolor Landscape.jpg|thumb|upright|Man Ray, 1913, ''Landscape'' (''Paysage Fauve''),  watercolor on paper, 35.2 x 24.6 cm, [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]]]
During his career as an artist, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he ever had a name other than Man Ray.&lt;ref name= BaldwinBio&gt;[[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Baldwin, Neil]]. &lt;cite&gt;Man Ray: American Artist&lt;/cite&gt;; Da Capo Press; {{ISBN|0-306-81014-X}} (1988, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray's birth name was Emmanuel Radnitzky in [[South Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], US, in 1890.&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; He was the eldest child of [[History of the Jews in Russia#United States|Russian Jewish immigrants]]&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; Max, a tailor, and Minnie Radnitzky.&lt;ref name="Federal Census"&gt;1900 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dora and Essie,&lt;ref name="Federal Census" /&gt; the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]]&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray. Man Ray's brother chose the surname in reaction to the [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] discrimination and [[antisemitism]] prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was called "Manny" as a nickname, changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod&gt;[[Francis Naumann]]; &lt;cite&gt;Conversion to Modernism: The Early Work of Man Ray&lt;/cite&gt;; Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|0-8135-3148-9}} (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Man Ray, Rencontre dans la porte tournante.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Man Ray, c. 1921–1922, ''Rencontre dans la porte tournante'', published on the cover (and page 39) of ''[[Der Sturm]]'', Volume 13, Number 3, March 5, 1922]]
Man Ray's father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray's mother enjoyed designing the family's clothes and inventing [[patchwork]] items from scraps of fabric.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt; Man Ray wished to disassociate himself from his family background, but their tailoring left an enduring mark on his art. [[Mannequin]]s, [[Clothes iron|flat irons]], sewing machines, needles, pins, threads, [[Textile|swatches of fabric]], and other items related to tailoring appear in almost every [[List of artistic media|medium]] of his work.&lt;ref name=HeydJewishID&gt;Milly Heyd; "Man Ray/Emmanuel Rudnitsky: Who is Behind the Enigma of Isidore Ducasse?"; in &lt;cite&gt;Complex Identities: Jewish Consciousness and Modern Art&lt;/cite&gt;; ed. Matthew Baigell and Milly Heyd; Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|0-8135-2869-0}} (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians have noted similarities between Ray's collage and painting techniques and styles used for tailoring.&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod/&gt;

Mason Klein, curator of a Man Ray exhibition at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in New York, ''Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention'', suggests that the artist may have been "the first Jewish avant-garde artist."&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity"&gt;{{ citation | url= http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c347_a17217/The_Arts/Museums.html | date= November 10, 2009 | title= Man Ray's Jewish Identity: 'Concealing And Revealing' | first= Eric | last= Herschthal | work = [[The Jewish Week]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100127075614/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c347_a17217/The_Arts/Museums.html | archivedate = January 27, 2010 | deadurl=yes | quote=Klein suggests that Ray may have even been the first Jewish avant-garde artist, though it is a tenuous claim given both the movement and Man Ray's disavowal of ethnic identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray was the uncle of the photographer [[Naomi Savage]], who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G. Heller|title=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|date=December 19, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-63882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First artistic endeavors===
[[File:Man Ray, 1919, Seguidilla, airbrushed gouache, pen &amp; ink, pencil, and colored pencil on paperboard, 55.8 x 70.6 cm, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.jpg|thumb|230px|Man Ray, 1919, ''Seguidilla'', airbrushed gouache, pen &amp; ink, pencil, and colored pencil on paperboard, 55.8 × 70.6&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], Washington, D.C.]]
Man Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's [[Boys and Girls High School|Boys' High School]] from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in [[technical drawing|drafting]] and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to the local art museums, where he studied the works of the [[Old Master]]s. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his [[studio]].&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt; The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a [[commercial art]]ist and was a [[Technical illustration|technical illustrator]] at several [[Manhattan]] companies.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod/&gt;

The surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s "[[291 (art gallery)|291]]" gallery and works by the [[Ashcan School]]. However, with a few exceptions, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled in the [[Modern School (United States)|Ferrer School]] in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development.&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod/&gt;

While living in New York City, Man Ray was visually influenced by the 1913 [[Armory Show]] and galleries of European contemporary works. His early paintings display facets of [[cubism]]. After befriending [[Marcel Duchamp]], who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in ''The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3716&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=The Collection &amp;#124; Man Ray. The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows. 1916 |publisher=MoMA |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after he had taken up residence at an art colony in [[Grantwood, New Jersey]], across the [[Hudson River]] from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D14FF345C137B93CBA8178AD95F428785F9 "Man Ray Is Dead in Paris at 86; Dadaist Painter and Photographer"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 19, 1976. Retrieved December 15, 2013. "His style changed in 1915 to 'reducing human figures to flat-patterned disarticulated forms.' He was living at the time in Ridgefield, N.&amp;nbsp;J."&lt;/ref&gt; His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled ''Self-Portrait'', was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918.

Man Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with [[Dada]], a radical anti-art movement. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of ''Rope Dancer'', he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he did ''[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]''—ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His ''[[The Gift (sculpture)|Gift]]'' readymade (1921) is a [[Clothes iron|flatiron]] with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and ''Enigma of Isidore Ducasse''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/collections/item.asp?table=comb&amp;itemNum=194410 |title=IMAGINE – The Israel Museum's searchable collections database |publisher=Imj.org.il |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. ''Aerograph'' (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/artwork/27789-aerograph |title=Man Ray, ''Aerograph'', 1919, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam |access-date=June 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235648/http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/artwork/27789-aerograph |archive-date=June 18, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make the ''[[Marcel Duchamp#Kinetic art|Rotary Glass Plates]]'', one of the earliest examples of [[kinetic art]]. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, [[Katherine Dreier]], and Duchamp founded the [[Société Anonyme (art)|Société Anonyme]], an itinerant collection that was the first museum of [[modern art]] in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Cabanne, P"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=4SNKDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=cabanne,+Marcel+Duchamp+military+service&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6oi3mMDXAhXHWxQKHTsbBb8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cabanne%2C%20Marcel%20Duchamp%20military%20service&amp;f=false Cabanne, P., &amp; Duchamp, M.

Man Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of ''[[New York Dada]]'' in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada's experimentation was no match for the wild and chaotic streets of New York.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/man-ray/prophet-of-the-avant-garde/510/ |title=Man Ray – Prophet of the Avant-Garde &amp;#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=September 17, 2005 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

In 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887–1975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Lacroix's first marriage had been to Adolf Wolff, an immigrant anarchist sculptor and poet, born in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris===

In July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, France. He soon settled in the [[Montparnasse]] quarter favored by many artists. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Kiki de Montparnasse ([[Alice Prin]]), an artists' model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Kiki was Man Ray's companion for most of the 1920s. She became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images and starred in his experimental films, ''[[Le Retour à la Raison]]'' and ''[[L'Étoile de mer]]''. In 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer [[Lee Miller]]. Miller left him in 1932.

For the next 20 years in Montparnasse, Man Ray was a distinguished photographer. Significant members of the art world, such as [[James Joyce]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]],&lt;ref name="Man Ray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1015080 |title=Christie's Photography Auction, London, May 1, 1996, Lot 213/Sale 558 ''Man Ray – Bridget Bate, 1941'' |publisher=Christies.com |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antonin Artaud]], posed for his camera.

Man Ray was represented in the first [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] exhibition with [[Jean Arp]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]], [[Joan Miró]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled ''[[Object to Be Destroyed]]'', and the ''Violon d'Ingres,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=61240 Getty collection].

''Violon d'Ingres'' is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Roland. Man Ray. 1. Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1975. Pg 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, surrealist artist [[Méret Oppenheim]], known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a [[printing press]].

With [[Lee Miller]], his [[photographic assistant]] and lover, Man Ray reinvented the photographic technique of [[solarisation|solarization]]. He also created a type of [[photogram]] he called "rayographs", which he described as "pure dadaism".

Man Ray was in a relationship with the model Adrienne Fidelin during some time between 1936 and 1940, the two parting ways after Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, while Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/style/tmagazine/25tmodel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray directed a number of influential [[avant-garde]] short films, known as ''[[Cinéma Pur]]''. He directed ''[[Le Retour à la Raison]]'' (2 mins, 1923); ''[[Emak-Bakia]]'' (16 mins, 1926); ''[[L'Étoile de Mer]]'' (15 mins, 1928); and ''[[Les Mystères du Château de Dé]]'' (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on [[Fernand Léger]]'s ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]'' (1924). In [[René Clair]]'s film ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing [[chess]] with Duchamp.

Duchamp, Man Ray, and [[Francis Picabia]] were friends and collaborators. The three were connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Winter Museum Preview: Top 5 London | first= Chris | last= Bors | work=Art+Auction  | date= January 9, 2008 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26385/winter-museum-preview-top-5-london/ | accessdate=April 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k5qvm7pOI8AC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=man%20ray%20american%20artist&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Neil Baldwin, ''Man Ray American Artist''].

Man Ray was forced to return from Paris to the United States due to the [[Second World War]]. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951 where he focused his creative energy on painting.

The two married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends [[Max Ernst]] and [[Dorothea Tanning]]. In 1948 Man Ray had a solo exhibition at the [[William Copley (artist)|Copley Galleries]] in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the ''Shakespearean Equations'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Strauss, "To Be Continued Unnoticed: Mathematics and Shakespeare in Hollywood," in Wendy A.

===Later life===
[[File:Man Ray by Wolleh.jpg|thumb|Man Ray portrayed by [[Lothar Wolleh]], Paris, 1975]]

Man Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue Ferou near the Luxembourg Gardens in St. Germain des Pres, where he continued his creative practice across mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Baldwin, Man Ray: American Artist, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later [[Arturo Schwarz]].

In 1963, he published his autobiography, ''Self-Portrait'', which was republished in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ray|first1=Man|year=1999|title=Self Portrait: Man Ray|edition=First paperback|publisher=Bulfinch|isbn=0-8212-2474-3|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Paris on November 18, 1976, from a lung infection. He was interred in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 38837-38838). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ray's [[epitaph]] reads "unconcerned, but not indifferent". When Juliet Browner died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads "together again". Juliet organized a trust for his work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure's disrepair. Most of the contents were stored at the [[Pompidou Center]].&lt;ref name="Juliet's obituary"/&gt;

==Accolades==
In 1974, Man Ray received the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship "in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rps.org/about/awards/history-and-recipients/progress-medal|title=Progress Medal|date=1974|website=Royal Photographic Society|access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''[[ARTnews]]'' magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, "his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, [[collage]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] and prototypes of what would eventually be called [[performance art]] and [[conceptual art]]." ''ARTnews'' further stated that "Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a [[Transcendental Meditation#Science of Creative Intelligence|creative intelligence]] that, in its 'pursuit of pleasure and liberty', unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would." Seeking pleasure and liberty was one of Ray's guiding principles, along with others such as doing things that are socially prohibited.&lt;ref name=artnews&gt;Coleman, A. D. "Willful Provocateur"; ''ARTnews'', May 1999.

* "Man Ray is a youthful alchemist forever in quest of the painter's [[philosopher's stone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1697">'''Manoil Manufacturing Company''' was an American metal and plastic toy company that began production in 1935 or 1936, and left the business in 1959. From June 1940 they were located on Providence Street, in [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly, NY]] (Tioga County). Its prominence was from 1937-1941 when it produced [[hollowcast]] [[toy soldiers]] (sometimes called [[dimestore soldiers]]) along with toy airplanes and cars.

Maurice Manoil (4 December 1896-15 September 1974) and his brother Jack (29 January 1902-1 September 1955) produced a variety of items from 1927 until they began making toys in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;p.122 O'Brien, Richard ''Collecting American Made Toy Soldiers Edition No. 3'' 1997 Books Americana&lt;/ref&gt; After producing [[die-cast toy]] cars, Manoil began to produce toy soldiers in 1935. They were sculpted by Walter Baetz.

The company ceased trading in 1959.

The '''Maschen disc brooch''' is an [[Early Medieval]] [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]], which was found in 1958 during [[archaeological excavation]]s of the late [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[grave field]] near [[Maschen]], in the [[Lower Saxony]] district of [[Harburg (district)|Harburg]], [[Germany]]. On its face side, the fibula shows an unidentified [[saint]] with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. It was found in a woman's grave of the beginning of the [[Christianization]] of [[northern Germany]], and is in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic Death, Showcase no. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication | publisher = Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | year =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =159 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

The [[cemetery]] was located on the western fringes of the ''{{lang|de|Hallonen}}'', an approximately {{convert|63|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} mountain range which is running out on the {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} ''{{lang|de|Fuchsberg}}'' some {{convert|1200|m|ft}} southeast of the village center of Maschen. During [[sand]] extraction from the Fuchsberg for the construction of the nearby [[Bundesautobahn 1]], two [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|tumuli]] were discovered in 1958. 

The following excavations revealed that both grave [[mound]]s were disturbed to the undisturbed ground. Except for a few [[ceramic]] vessel shards and a [[razor]] from several later [[burial]]s on the hill, no further [[Feature (archaeology)|findings]] were recorded. While pushing off the [[humus]]layer {{convert|20|m|ft}} north of the tumuli, the first late Saxon flat graves appeared in the ground. Additionally some soil discolorations appeared at a brim of the sand mine some {{convert|80|m|ft}} east, indicating burial pits. During the initially launched rescue excavation, the complete burial site were excavated and documented in a three-week operation. It was the first fully documented late Saxon burial site of northern Germany so far with a total of 210 examined burials. 

21 burials were oriented in south-north direction and the majority of 189 burials were created in west-east orientation. The Maschen disc brooch was found in the grave No. 54 of a wealthy woman.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | title = Das Reihengräberfeld von Maschen | journal = Hammaburg N.F | volume = 8 | year = 1988 | issn = 0173-0886 | isbn = 3-529-01356-0 | pages = 161-171 (164-165) | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

The Maschen disc brooch lay with its face side down on the woman's chest. The brooch has a diameter of {{convert|30|mm|in}} and is made of different colored [[vitreous enamel]] in [[cloisonné]] technique on a [[copper]] plate. The copper base of the brooch is can shaped, and the enamel plate was fixed in the copper base on a bed of [[loam]] by [[flange|flanging]] the protruding edges of the bases wall. The needle apparatus was not preserved. The remaining hinges indicate that it was a needle with a coil spring. Both the metal parts and enamel inlays are slightly worn. A [[radiology|radiological]] examination revealed that the enamel layer has a thickness of {{convert|0.4|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; The front face of the disc brooch depicts a stylized chest portrait on a now red background. The face and neck of the portrayed person are made of now greenish white enamel. Its eyes and nose region is formed by a curved bar made of copper, ending in two loops as stylized eyes. Around the head a kind of halo is shown, made of whitish to light blue enamel. The upper body has a semi-elliptical shape. The body is decorated by two widely arced copper bars from the neck towards the shoulders, which end there in small loops. The area around the neck of the figure is made of now light blue to turquoise enamel. The lower chest area, below the copper bars, is made of a now dark blue enamel.

== Interpretation ==
[[File:Scheibenfibel Todtglüsingen.jpg|thumb|The almost identical Todtglüsingen disc brooch]]
Due to its halo-like ornament around the head, the figure on the Maschen disc brooch is interpreted as an unspecified saint, and may possibly depict [[Jesus Christ]]. The addition of the fibula as a [[grave good]] indicates that the buried woman was an early Christian. She may have promised herself a salvation effect from the depicted figure, as the brooch was found placed with its face side on her chest.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

Due to the geographical orientation of the burial and its location within the cemetery, the burial has been [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dated]] to the period between 800 and 900 AD, which marks the beginning of the thorough Christianization of Northern Germany.&lt;ref name="Articus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

So far, some 100 comparison finds of fibulae of the Maschen disc brooch type were known, but they all came from stray finds or were collected from the surface without any assignment to a specific grave, and therefore a more precise dating of this type of brooches has been impossible before.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

By the end of 2012 another nearly identical piece was found in a construction area at the [[Tostedt]] district of Todtglüsingen. The origin of this fibula is believed to be the [[Lower Rhine region]] and the noticeable accumulation of finds at the [[Niederelbe]] area may indicate that it has faced an increased popularity especially in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brandt | first = Jochen | title = Frisch vom Acker | editors = Mitteilungen des Museums- und Heimatvereins Harburg-Stadt und -Land e.&amp;nbsp;V., Helms-Museum | journal = Helms-Museum Aktuell | number = 29 |date=March 2013 | pages = 4 | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Metropolitan Opera House''' was an [[opera house]] located at 1411 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[New York City]]. Opened in 1883 and demolished in 1967, it was the first home of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Company.

==History==

Sometimes referred to as "the old Met", the Metropolitan Opera House opened on October 22, 1883, with a performance of ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. It was located at 1411 Broadway, occupying the whole block between West 39th Street and West 40th Street on the west side of the street in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] of [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Nicknamed "The Yellow Brick Brewery" for its industrial looking exterior, the original Metropolitan Opera House was designed by [[J. Cleaveland Cady]]. On August 27, 1892, the nine-year-old theater was gutted by fire. The 1892−93 season was canceled while the opera house was rebuilt along its original lines.  During that season, the Vaudeville Club, which eventually became the [[Metropolitan Opera Club]], was founded and hosted entertainment in the undamaged portions of the house.

In 1903, architects [[Carrère and Hastings]] extensively redesigned the interior of the opera house. The familiar golden auditorium with its sunburst chandelier, and curved [[proscenium]] inscribed with the names of six composers ([[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]), dates from this time. The first of the Met's signature gold [[damask]] stage curtains was installed in 1906, completing the look that the old Metropolitan Opera House maintained until its closing.

[[File:Metropolitan Opera House program cover 1935.jpg|thumb|left|Metropolitan Opera House program cover depicting the [[proscenium|Proscenium arch]] in 1935]]
In 1940, ownership of the opera house shifted from the wealthy families who occupied the theater's boxes to the non-profit Metropolitan Opera Association. At this time the last major change to the auditorium's interior was completed. The second tier of privately held boxes (the "grand tier") was converted into standard row seating. This enlarged the seating capacity and left only the first tier of boxes from the "golden horseshoe" of the opera house's origins as a showplace for New York society.

The Met had a seating capacity of 3,625 with 224 standing room places.

While the theater was noted for its excellent acoustics and elegant interior, as early as the 1900s the backstage facilities were deemed to be severely inadequate for a large opera company. Scenery and sets were a regular sight leaning against the building exterior on 39th Street where crews had to shift them between performances. Various plans were put forward over the years to build a new home for the company and designs for new opera houses were created by various architects including [[Joseph Urban]]. Proposed new locations included [[Columbus Circle]] and what is now [[Rockefeller Center]], but none of these plans came to fruition. Only with the development of [[Lincoln Center]] on New York's [[Upper West Side]] did the Met finally have the opportunity to build a modern opera house.

The Metropolitan Opera said goodbye to its old house on April 16, 1966, with a sentimental gala farewell performance featuring nearly all of the company's current leading artists. Long-time Met star soprano [[Zinka Milanov]] made her last Met appearance that night, and among the many invited guests was soprano [[Anna Case]], who had made her debut at the house in 1909. The final performance at the opera house was given not by the Met, but by the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], which concluded a short run of appearances on May 8, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ballet: Our Revels Now Are Ended at the Old Metropolitan; Bolshoi Gives House Its Last Performance Hurok Invites Dancers of the Past for Finale| url=https://article.archive.nytimes.com/1966/05/09/82433033.pdf| last=Barnes| first=Clive| date=May 9, 1966| page=48| work=[[The New York Times]]| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater was purchased by [[Jack D.

It was replaced by a 40-story office tower, 1411 Broadway, intended to provide a steady income for the opera company. Designed by [[Irwin S. Chanin]] and completed in 1970, the building was later sold by the Metropolitan Opera and today it is owned by 1411 TrizecHahn-Swig LLC, a partnership of the [[TrizecHahn]] and Swig real estate companies. Since 1966, the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] at Lincoln Center has been home to the Metropolitan Opera.{{clear left}}

'''''Mona Lisa Smile''''' is a 2003 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced by [[Revolution Studios]] and [[Columbia Pictures]] in association with [[Red Om Films|Red Om Films Productions]], directed by [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], written by [[Lawrence Konner]] and [[Mark Rosenthal]], and starring [[Julia Roberts]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Julia Stiles]] and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]. The title is a reference to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', the famous painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and the [[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|song of the same name]], originally performed by [[Nat King Cole]], which was covered by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] for the movie. Julia Roberts received a record $25 million for her performance, the highest ever earned by an actress at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.forbes.com/2007/01/17/richest-women-entertainment-tech-media-cz_lg_richwomen07_0118womenstars_slide_9.html | title = The 20 Richest Women In Entertainment |work=Forbes | date = January 17, 2007 | accessdate = July 15, 2011 | first1=Lea | last1=Goldman | first2=Kiri | last2=Blakeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1953, Katherine Ann Watson ([[Julia Roberts]]), a 30-year-old graduate student in the department of [[Art History]] at UCLA and Oakland State, takes a position teaching "History of Art" at [[Wellesley College]], a conservative [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's]] [[Private school|private]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[Massachusetts]]. At her first class, Katherine discovers that her students have already memorized the entire textbook and syllabus, so she uses the classes to introduce them to Modern Art and encourages discussion about topics such as what makes good art. Katherine comes to know her students and seeks to inspire them to achieve more than marriage to eligible young men.

Betty Warren ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) is highly opinionated and outspokenly conservative. Betty doesn't understand why Katherine is not married and insists that there is a universal standard for good art. She writes editorials for the college paper, exposing campus nurse Amanda Armstrong ([[Juliet Stevenson]]) as a supplier of contraception, which results in Amanda being fired; other editorial attack's Katherine for advocating that women should seek a career instead of being wives and mothers as intended. Betty can't wait to marry Spencer ([[Jordan Bridges]]) as their parents have arranged and expect the traditional exemptions from attending class as a married woman: Katherine insists she will be marked on merit and attendance, resulting in more conflict.

Connie Baker ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) begins dating Betty's cousin, Charlie ([[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]]) but Betty persuades her that he is only using her as his parents have arranged for him to marry Deb MacIntyre.  Connie ends the relationship, believing Betty's story to be true. However, some weeks later, Connie and Charlie reconnect, with Charlie saying he has already decided for himself that he is not going to marry Deb, so he and Connie get back together.

Joan Brandwyn ([[Julia Stiles]]) dreams of being a lawyer and has enrolled as pre-law, so Katherine encourages her to apply to [[Yale Law School]].  She is accepted, but decides not to go because she wants to start a life with her new husband Tommy ([[Topher Grace]]).  She tells Katherine that choosing to be a wife and mother does not make her any less intelligent.

Giselle Levy ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]) has several lovers and liberal views about sex. She admires Katherine for encouraging the students to be independent. Giselle earned the enmity of Betty, whose conservative views conflict with her liberal ones.

Katherine declines a proposal from her California boyfriend ([[John Slattery]]) because she doesn't love him enough and begins seeing the Wellesley Italian professor, Bill Dunbar ([[Dominic West]]). Bill is charming and full of stories about Europe and his heroic actions in Italy during the war. He has also had affairs with students (including Giselle), and Katherine makes him promise that it will never happen again. The relationship progresses but when Katherine learns that Bill spent the entire war at the Army Languages Center on Long Island, she decides to break up with him because he is not trustworthy. Bill responds that Katherine didn't come to Wellesley to help the students find their way, but to help them find her way.

Within six months of the wedding Betty's marriage falls apart as Spencer has an affair and failing to find solace with her mother, she visits Katherine. Eventually, influenced by her, Betty files for divorce and looks for an apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. When Mrs. Warren confronts Betty for what she's done, she reveals her frustration with her mother for not supporting her when she went to her for help when she found out about Spencer's affair and that the only person who cared about her was Katherine. Therefore, Betty reveals she's going to have a life of her own, has applied to [[Yale Law School]] and will room with Giselle.

Katherine's course is highly popular, so the college invites her to return but with certain conditions: she must follow the syllabus, submit lesson plans for approval, keep a strictly professional relationship with all faculty members, and not talk to the girls about anything other than classes. Katherine decides to leave in order to explore Europe. In the final scene, Betty dedicates her last editorial to Katherine, claiming that her teacher is "an extraordinary woman who lived by example and compelled us all to see the world through new eyes." As Katherine's taxi speeds up, all her students follow on their bicycles and Betty is seen struggling to keep up with the taxi as a last effort to thank Katherine for changing her life.

==Box office==
In its first opening weekend, ''Mona Lisa Smile'' opened at #2 at the U.S. Box office raking in $11,528,498 [[USD]] behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weekend Box Office December 19–21, 2003|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2003&amp;wknd=51&amp;p=.htm|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of its run, while the film had grossed $141,337,989 worldwide, its U.S. domestic gross did not meet its $65 million budget, falling short at $63,860,942.

==Reception==
''Mona Lisa Smile'' received mixed to negative reviews from film critics. Critical aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the movie a 34% "rotten" rating based on 153 reviews, and an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Though ''Mona Lisa Smile'' espouses the value of breaking barriers, the movie itself is predictable and safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mona_lisa_smile |title=Mona Lisa Smile (2003) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mona-lisa-smile |title=Mona Lisa Smile Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical review, Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote, "it's ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'' as a chick flick, without the compelling drama and inspiration... even Roberts doesn't seem convinced. She gives a rather blah performance as if she's not fully committed to the role... Rather than being a fascinating exploration of a much more constrained time in our social history, the film simply feels anachronistic. The film deserves a solid 'C' for mediocrity and muted appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2003-12-18-mona-lisa_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Claudia | last1=Puig | title=Crooked 'Smile' | date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Elizabeth M. Tamny of the ''Chicago Reader'' shared this negative assessment, writing "Part of the problem is simply that ''Mona Lisa Smile'' is a Hollywood film, and Hollywood isn't good at depicting the life of the mind... And Julia Roberts is no help--you either like her or you don't, but either way it has little to do with talent. She's not so much an actor as a vessel for earnest reactions. The fact is... It's easier to take on an extremely black-and-white version of the most salient question from this film--can women bake their cake and eat it too?--than try to answer it in the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tamny|first=Elizabeth M.|date=January 15, 2004|title=History Versus Her Story|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/history-versus-her-story/Content?oid=914311|work=Chicago Reader|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction from Wellesley alumnae==
In a message to Wellesley alumnae concerning the film, Wellesley College president [[Diana Chapman Walsh]] expressed regret, given that many alumnae from the 1950s felt that the film's portrayal of Wellesley was inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/President/DCW/Announcements/monalisasmile.html |title=Message from the President to Wellesley College alumnae concerning the film, ''Mona Lisa Smile'' |first1=Diana Chapman |last1=Walsh |date=January 9, 2004 |publisher=Wellesley College |accessdate=August 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812084301/http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/President/DCW/Announcements/monalisasmile.html |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus controversy==
During the filming of ''Mona Lisa Smile'', the [[Wellesley College]] campus broke into controversy surrounding the casting of student extras with use of the phrase "not too tan" in a casting call for current Wellesley students, sparking a fear that [[Casting (performing arts)|casting directors]] were using race to discriminate against potential extras. Producers claimed that they were merely stressing the importance of finding women that reflected the time period.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The controversy spilled over into the local media, and producers considered a compromise of hiring willing minority students to act as production assistants. The college issued a press release highlighting the realities of Wellesley in 1953 and defending their decision to allow the film to shoot on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 3, 2003|title=Wellesley College Is Among the Stars of the Film, "Mona Lisa Smile"|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Releases/2003/120303.html|work=Wellesley College|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ciudadela de Meybod, Irán, 2016-09-20, DD 04.jpg|thumb|General view.]]
The '''Narin Qal'eh''' (In [[Persian Language|Persian]]: نارین قلعه) or '''Narin Castle''' is a mud-brick fort or castle in the town of [[Meybod]], [[Iran]]. Structures like these constituted the government stronghold in some of the older (pre-Islamic) towns of central [[Iran]]. Some of these castles incorporate mud bricks of the [[Medes]] period and of the [[Achaemenid]] and [[Sassanid]] dynasties.

The ruins of the structure stands 40 meters (130&amp;nbsp;ft) high from its base. Although built some 2,000 years ago, it contains what seems to be a type of plumbing system (made out of a kind of mortar called ''[[sarooj]]'') which was built into its massive walls. It is also peculiarly similar in design to ''Ali Qapu'' palace of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]; it has a terrace high on top of the structure whose circulation is provided by two helical stairwells (whose walls have caved in, making it inaccessible). The structure also has a large underground chamber (filled now by rubble), possibly a prison. Four towers surround the entire compound, and a large gate furnishes access to a large courtyard. The structure seems to have been the victim of numerous earthquakes throughout the ages.

Some believe that the Narin castles are descendants of ancient fire-temples; some of the castles in Narin and [[Meybod]], in [[Yazd province]], are also called ''nareng'' castles (orange castles), possibly by folk etymology. The castle at Meybod is currently under study. Yet this castle has not been faring very well.

Unfortunately today, the ruins of Narin Gahl'eh is nothing more but the site of a local garbage dump, and what is even more depressing is that Iran contains thousands of such structures, decaying in their own rubble.

Although there are some bricks from Medes period, there are rumors that this castle was built around 7000 years ago, this building ( city) unlike all other buildings ( for exp.: [[Susa]]) has built as an old city in 3 different floors, at ground level you will see common people life form, then commercial and business part and then royal part (except the military part on the roof for patrolling and watching far distances in case of military invasion. ( No religious floor or section at all!)

The position of this city is unlike all others as you can watch over 70 kilometers in every direction from the top of the roof,yet again it is centered between mountains so for an invasion you had to climb those mountains first then go another 70 kilometers and only after that you had to  prepare yourself for all other normal events when you wanted to invade a castle (like rivers of water and burning oil, etc.)

Although all outer gates have been destroyed the inner castle still exists. You can still see some of the outer walls.

The '''Oakland Asian Cultural Center''', also referred to as the '''OACC''', is an Oakland-based nonprofit cultural center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Good Music, Talk in Oakland|url = http://blog.sfgate.com/wwong/2009/10/14/good-music-talk-in-oakland/|website = City Brights: William Wong|accessdate = 2015-11-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that carries out Asian and [[Pacific Islander]] American arts and culture programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Northern California Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places|last = Williams|first = Mark|publisher = Globe Pequot|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the Pacific Renaissance Plaza in [[Chinatown, Oakland|Oakland Chinatown]], residing three blocks away from the 12th Street Civic Center BART station on Broadway.

In the early 1980s, a community coalition asked for a space for a pan-Asian Cultural Center and the Asian Library, expressing a desire for an artistic and cultural space in the Chinatown area of Oakland. Historian Eve Ma notes that the ''Oakland Asian Cultural Center'' started in December 1984 as the East Bay Chinese Culture Center. In 1987, as it began acquiring help from the city government and recognizing that Chinatown's composition had changed, the Center changed its name, broadening its aim to include all Asian cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Politics and Institutionalization of Panethnic Identity|last = Kwon|first = Soo Ah|date = June 2013|journal = Journal of Asian American Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since opening its own facility in 1996 Oakland’s Chinatown district, the OACC has offered cultural programs including performances, workshops, festivals, school tours, classes, and exhibitions.

== Services ==
The OACC has educational programming and cultural activities for residents of Oakland Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saving Chinatown|url = http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/saving-chinatown/Content?oid=4554270|website = East Bay Express|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community groups and artists hold weekly classes in dance, martial arts, art, history, and language at the center. The activities offered at the center range from traditions that span across the world, including [[Ikebana|Japanese flower arrangement]], [[Buddhist meditation|Theravada Buddhist meditation]], [[Gong Fu|Chinese Gong Fu]] and Mongolian traditional dance.

The space has an auditorium with a stage, conference rooms, dance studio, lobby, and kitchen that serve as ongoing and one-time resources for local nonprofit organizations, schools, government agencies, [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]], and individuals. The auditorium is named after Edward W. Chin. Chin donated $250,000 towards the completion of the center's auditorium, a space that is used for major events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Yellow Journalist: Dispatches from Asia America|last = Wong|first = William|publisher = Temple University Press|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
In the past, the OACC hosted events featuring traditional and contemporary Asian arts, music, and dance with family-friendly activities and vendors such as the [[Mid-Autumn Festival|Harvest Moon Festival]] Celebration and Elements of Rhythm: Drums of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Heartbeat of the Earth|url = http://sff.org/the-heartbeat-of-the-earth/|website = sff.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring events include the Lunar New Year Celebration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/367549412/abstract/85B7F285F2CC4232PQ/14?accountid=14496|title = Ringing In the Year of the Ox: How Asian America celebrates the Lunar New Year|last = |first = |date = February 27, 1997|work = Asianweek|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian Heritage Street Celebration, and OACC Gala.

Art exhibits are considered '''off-site''' if they are presented outside the traditional venues of museums, art galleries or other cultural institutions. This does not necessarily mean the work is uncurated, or created outside of an institutional collaboration. Artwork may be shown off-site simply because it is [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] work. But more specifically the term implies a project that is considered too avant-garde or too unconventional to be shown in a gallery situation.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter-Smith, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kermode, off-site projects are
:"... by their very nature artistic gestures that have continuity with non-art environments, art that circumvents gallery space - usually detached and abstract - and goes straight to a public that often has little or no direct experience of art, thus democratizing ''aesthetic opportunities''."&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avant-garde]] art and American pop culture have had an intriguing relationship from the time of the art form's inception in America to the current day. The art form, which began in the early half of the nineteenth century in [[Europe]],&lt;ref name = ABC&gt;{{Cite book|author=Crane, Diana|title=The Transformation of the Avant Garde: the New York Art World|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to rise slowly in [[United States|America]] under the guise of [[Dadaism]] in 1915. While originally formed under a group of artists in [[New York City]] who wanted to counter [[popular culture|pop culture]] with their art, music, and literature the art form began to grow into prominence with American pop culture due to a variety of factors between the 1940s to the 1970s. However, from many factors that arose in the late 1970s, avant-garde began to both lessen in prominence and began to blend with the pop culture to the point in which most art critics considered the art form extinct.

== Avant Garde and Kitsch ==
Though his first published essays dealt mainly with literature and theatre, art still held a powerful attraction for [[Clement Greenberg]], so in 1939, he made a sudden name as a visual art writer with possibly his most well-known and oft-quoted essay, "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]", first published in the journal ''[[Partisan Review]]''. In this Marxist-influenced essay, Greenberg claimed that true [[avant-garde]] art is a product of the Enlightenment's revolution of critical thinking, and as such resists and recoils from the degradation of culture in both mainstream capitalist and communist society, while acknowledging the paradox that, at the same time, the artist, dependent on the market or the state, remains inexorably attached ''"by an umbilical cord of gold"''. Kitsch, on the other hand, was the product of industrialization and the urbanization of the working class, a filler made for the consumption of the working class: a populace hungry for culture, but without the resources and education to enjoy cutting edge avant garde culture. Greenberg writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money – not even their time." &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement. "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." [[Partisan Review]]. 6:5 (1939) 34–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Greenberg, avant garde art was too "innocent" to be effectively used as propaganda or bent to a cause, while kitsch was ideal for stirring up false sentiment.

Greenberg appropriated the German word "[[kitsch]]" to describe this low, concocted form of "culture", though its [[connotation]]s have since been recast to a more affirmative acceptance of nostalgic materials of capitalist/communist culture. "Avant Garde and Kitsch" is clearly a politically motivated essay, in part a response to the destruction and repression of Modernist Art in [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and represents a denouncement of the growing totalitarian threat in Europe and the "retrogression" of fascism.

==Further definition==
[[Avant-garde]], as sociologist Diana Crane states, “was an art-form that had started in Europe that had started in the early nineteenth century.” While the art form has survived for this long, she states that the concept of the art form is “highly ambiguous” and it has been through many phases throughout its existence, including [[Dadaism]], [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Minimalism]], and [[pop art]]. Socially, however, each form of avant-garde is united with the idea that it is part of the definition of high culture, although this in itself is defined in a variety of fashions.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Ways to determine avant-garde===
Due to the ambiguity of the term, Crane gives a few considerations on what could be considered avant-garde and what is not. She states that avant-garde can be determined in its approach to the [[aesthetic]], through the social content of the artwork, and through the production and distribution of the artwork.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Aesthetics===
Through aesthetic, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does any of the following:
* '''If the artwork redefines artistic conventions.'''
* '''If it utilizes new artistic tools and techniques.'''
* '''And if it redefines the nature of the art objects.'''

An example of the aesthetic used in Avant-garde can include the artwork of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. For Duchamp's ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', he simply took a urinal and defined this as a ready-made art form. In this, he redefined artistic conventions by taking an item that was already made and employing the item for an artistic purpose. By doing this, he also employed a new technique in the production of art by taking something that was already produced and redefined the object he was using by taking a urinal and using it for art.

===Through Social Content===
Through social content, a piece of artwork can be determined avant-garde if it does one of the  following:
*; If the artwork incorporates in its artworks social or political values that are critical of or different from the majority culture.
:For example, in ''The Art of Humanism: Art in a Time of Change'', Barry Schwartz states that one of the roles of avant-garde art was to provide a counter-cultural force in the art world.
*; If it redefines the relationship between high and popular culture
:Like pop artists using images from advertisements and comic strips to employ a different meaning to those images
*; And if it adopts a critical attitude toward artistic institutions
:This is seen by the Dadaist attack on the legitimacy of art

===Through production and distribution===
Through its production and distribution, an artwork can be described as avant-garde if it redefines the social context for the production of art, in terms of critics, role models, and the audience; if it does one of the following:

*; The artwork redefines the organizational context for the production, display, and distribution of art
:A good example of this is the usage of alternative spaces in order to make the art appear unsellable.
*; The artwork redefines the nature of the artistic role or the extent to which the artist participates in other social institutions, which provides a good niche of avant-garde artists in the middle class.

===Differences with Post-Modernism===
While the two terms are used interchangeably today, some argue that the difference between the two lie in their approach to innovating art. According to Jochen Schulte-Sasse,&lt;ref name = BCD&gt;{{Cite book|author=Büger, Peter|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two differ in the fact that [[Post-modernism]] wants to destroy old conceptions of art to replace them with new (without any reference to the social impact of the art). According to Diana Crane, post-modernists do this through a variety of ways, namely through creating effects of polysemy, ambiguity, and parody. Post-modernists also only focused on the technique of their art rather than the social impacts of their art. However, avant-garde wants to innovate art and also communicate social issues within it. It could also be defined that post-modernism uses their art with the intent to shock the person viewing the art while avant-garde, while it also often shocks the viewer, uses their art to communicate a message through the art while also using the art to shock the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Crane, Diana|title=Postmodernism and the Avant-Garde: Stylistic Change in Fashion Design|journal=Modernism/Modernity 4.3|year=1997}} pp.123-140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres of the avant-garde==
While avant-garde is a solitary art form, it has had a variety of subgenres attached to the art form throughout its history, with each communicating their own distinct messages. Some of them, like Dadaism and Pop Art, use the art to provide a social commentary.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Others, like Abstract Expressionism, use outer-worldly figures and colors to evoke an emotional response.&lt;ref name = CDE&gt;Abstract Expressionism." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1963/Abstract-Expressionism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there are some like Minimalism&lt;ref name = FGH&gt;"minimalism." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; which use their art for the sake of making art without any emotional or social meanings behind them. While there are myriad different avant-garde subgenres that came about during its popularity in America, the four subgenres that played the biggest roles in American Popular Culture are Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and Pop Art.

===Dadaism===
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' is an example of Dadaist [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Ready-Mades]]]]
{{Main|Dada}}
Dadaism was the first major subgenre of avant-garde art to cross over into America. Dadaist artists, in many ways, wanted to contrast from the typical artist at the time from their idea of being against typical artistic conventions at the time and being anti-art. A good example of their anti-art approach came through what Dadaists call the “ready-mades,” the most notable being [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s Fountain, which was a porcelain urinal. Ready-mades such as this caused great debate in the art community concerning the definition of art and how Dadaists should play in this definition.&lt;ref name = DEF&gt;”Dada” Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010.

While Dadaist pieces cannot be determined through a particular artistic form, many Dadaist artists collaborated in groups with each other in order to create their art, united on either to create art based on social issues (particularly in Europe) or to mock the art world in general (mostly in America). In America, the center of this movement came from two locations in the New York-area:  at Alfred Stieglitz’s New York gallery “291,” and at the studio of Walter Arensberg. In addition to group collaboration, artists of the Dada movement depended more on spontaneity and chance than following other established artists. They focused on rejecting the ideas formed by established artists and art creation and used methods such as collage, photomontage, and found-object construction to create their art. While this art form started strong in 1916 in Germany, it eventually faded out by 1922 in both Europe and America. However, despite its decline, Dada would play a major influence on other avant-garde and nihilistic art-forms in the future, including the Punk movement in the '1970s.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name = EFG&gt;{{Cite book|author=Marcus, Greil|title=Lipstick Traces: a Secret History of the Twentieth Century.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract Expressionism===
{{Main|Abstract Expressionism}}
Abstract Expressionism was another major avant-garde genre that, unlike Dadaism, was born in and popular in the United States. A number of artists that were practitioners of this art form include [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Mark Rothko]]. Much like Dadaism in America, the center of the movement was in New York City.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

====Commonalities====
Also, much like Dadaism, although many of the artists worked together in creating their art, the art pieces cannot be determined through one particular art form. Pieces often varied differently between painting styles from both the techniques that were used in the piece and quality of expression of the pieces.  Despite the drastic differences between pieces, Abstract Expressionism shares several broad characteristics.  These characteristics includes:

* Each piece depicts forms that are not found in the visible world
* Each emphasize free, spontaneous, and personal emotional expressionism
* They exercise a freedom of technique with emphasis on exploitation of the physical character of the paint to evoke expressive qualities (violence, lyricism, etc.)
* They show similar emphasis on the unstudied and intuitive application of that paint in a form of psychic improvisation akin to the automatism of the Surrealists, with a similar intent of expressing the force of the creative unconscious in art.
* They display the abandonment of conventionally structured composition built up out of discrete and segregable elements and their replacement with a single unified, undifferentiated field, network, or other image that exists in unstructured space.
* Finally, the paintings fill large canvases to give these aforementioned visual effects both monumentality and engrossing power.

There are also three main techniques in which categorize Abstract Expressionism. First, there is [[Action Painting]], which is characterized by a loose, rapid, dynamic, or forceful handling of paint in sweeping or slashing brush strokes and in techniques partially dictated by chance, such as dripping or spilling the paint directly onto the canvas. Examples of this include Jackson Pollock dripping commercial paints on raw canvas to build up complex and tangled skeins of paint into exciting and suggestive linear patterns and Willem de Kooning used extremely vigorous and expressive brush strokes to build up richly colored and textured images. The second category of Abstract Expressionism is represented by a variety of styles ranging from [[Color field]], to [[Lyrical abstraction]]; delicate imagery and fluid shapes and fields of color included in works by [[Clyfford Still]], [[Philip Guston]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]] to the more clearly structured, forceful, almost calligraphic pictures of [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. Finally, the last form of Abstract Expressionism is the third and least emotionally expressive approach was that of Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Ad Reinhardt]]. These painters used large areas, or fields, of flat colour and thin, diaphanous paint to achieve quiet, subtle, almost meditative effects. While Abstract Expressionism's roots could be traced back as far as 1919, the peak of its popularity were in the 1950s to the 1960s.  This, like Dadaism before, shows another influential avant-grade artistic genre that suffered from a short peak of popularity.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

===Minimalism===
{{Main|Minimalism}}
Minimalism was an avant-grade genre from the 1910s to the late 1960s which was characterized by extreme simplicity of a form and a literal approach. Its origins could be stemmed from many artists, including Kandinsky, Picabia, Delaunay, Kupka, Survage and Malevich, who focused on reducing art to its basic element. A great example of his art was the painting of a black square on a white ground. Other minimalist artists that were famous at this time included painters such as Jack Youngerman, Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Al Held, and Gene Davis  and sculptors such as  Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Tony Smith, Anthony Caro, and Sol LeWitt.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt; [[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazimir Malevich]], Black Square, 1923, oil on canvas, State [[Russian Museum]], St.Petersburg]]

In many ways the rise of Minimalism came as a result of those who were dissatisfied with the Abstract Expressionist movement, primarily from the Action Paintings of the movement. The reason for many was that they believed that Action painting was too personal and insubstantial, and they adopted the point of view that a work of art should not refer to anything other than itself.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

====Similarities====
Unlike other genres of avant-garde at the time, minimalist art used not only a set of philosophical properties when it came to the production of their In order to rid their art of any extra-visual influence, Minimalist paintings used hard edge painting, a simplistic form, and a linear approach to emphasize two-dimensionality and to allow the viewer an immediate, purely visual response to art in comparison to any other sort of response.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

===Hard-Edge Painting===
{{Main|Hard-Edge Painting}}
Hard-edge painting is characterized by large, simplified, usually geometric forms on an overall flat surface; precise, razor-sharp contours; and broad areas of bright, unmodulated color that have been stained into unprimed canvas. It differs from other types of geometric abstraction in that it rejects both lyrical and mathematical composition because, even in this simplified field, they are a means of personal expression for the artist. Minimal hard-edge painting is the anonymous construction of a simple object. (Make a reference to the part of the encyclopedia entry that this came from)&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

====Similarities between Minimalist Sculpture====
Much like minimalist painting, minimalist sculpture used extremely simple, monumental geometric forms made of fiberglass, plastic, sheet metal, or aluminum, either left raw or solidly painted with bright industrial color in order to convey the art for the usage of the visual response without allowing the art to create responses elsewhere. An example of Minimalist Sculpture is “Free Ride” by Tony Smith, which is a black geometrical structure the size of a door opening on a white background.&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

===Pop Art===
{{Main|Pop Art}}

One of the last major avant-garde artforms that proved to be very influential to the American pop culture was Pop Art. This art form had much of its roots in Great Britain in the early 1950s, but made its way into the American culture by the late 1950s and remained a popular art form in America from the 1960s. Some of the famous practitioners of this era include Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg.&lt;ref name = GHI&gt;"Pop art." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469967/Pop-art&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Similarities====
Pop art, also like minimalism, has clear commonalities between their pieces. Primarily, each piece uses commonplace items (comic strips, soup cans, road signs, and hamburgers) as the subject matter of their pieces. They emphatically present any iconography that has created a major impact on contemporary life without praise or condemnation but with overwhelming immediacy, and by means of the precise commercial techniques used by the media from which the iconography itself was borrowed. It was also an attempt to return to a more objective, universally acceptable form of art after the dominance in both the United States and Europe of the highly personal Abstract Expressionism. It was also iconoclastic, rejecting both the supremacy of the “high art” of the past and the pretensions of other contemporary avant-garde art. Pop art became a cultural event because of its close reflection of a particular social situation and because its easily comprehensible images were immediately exploited by the mass media. Despite its opposition to other avant-garde art forms at its time, Pop art was a derivative of Dada, especially praising the art of  Marcel Duchamp, who with his “ready-mades” also praised many objects and imagery of American pop culture.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

==Relationship Before the 1940's==
Before World War II there were some significant artists and art movements in the United States, but, according to sociologist Diana Crane, these art movements never were directly inspired by art movements from Europe. However, due to the numbers of immigrants from Europe who were involved with the avant-garde movement in Europe, Dadaist artists from Europe like Marcel Duchamp moved to America carrying their avant-garde ideals with them. Once they arrived in New York City, many of these Dadaists decided to collaborate, making art to display to the public.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

Initially, while the Dadaists brought some attention to the New York art scene, they had very little attention outside of it. Some factors that played to the lack of attention of the Dadaists at the time included the lack of museums throughout the United States and the lack of funding to the artists who created and advertised the art.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Origins of European avant-garde===
According to Peter Burger, some of the theories involving aesthetics can come all the way back to the writings of Karl Marx. According to Burger, “ For Marx, this development is not merely one in economic theory. Rather, he feels that the possibility of a progress in knowledge is a function of the development of the object toward which insight directs itself... Marx demonstrates through the example of the category of labor also applies to objectifications in the arts... it is only with aestheticism that the full unfolding of the phenomenon of art became a fact, and it is to aestheticism that the historical avant-garde movements respond” &lt;ref name="BCD"/&gt;

Besides from the idea of Karl Marx's influence over the avant-garde movement, much of the movement came through social commentary from the wars that were fought during the time of its rise. Dadaism, for instance, was seized upon by the group as appropriate for their anti-aesthetic creations and protest activities, which were engendered by disgust for bourgeois values and despair over World War I. Another example of this is John Hartfield's usage of photomontage to express his anti-Nazi views.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;

===Relationship between the 1950s and 1980s===
As previously stated, as soon as many of the Dadaist movement from Europe immigrated over to the United States in the 1920s, they started making their art and presenting the art to the people of New York. Although it didn't initially take off, by the 1950s, their art and the art from artists that were inspired by these individuals began to rise in popularity.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;

There were a number of factors that lead to the rise of avant-garde art in the eyes of the American Popular Culture. First of all, due to the rise of the American Economy after World War II, the American  Government focused on enhancing the importance of the Fine Arts. To do so, congress passed bills in which expanded the number of museums around the nation and funded the government to allow the artists to produce more art.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

===Increasing the Museums===
Before the 1940s, Americans in many regions were unaware to the existence of avant-garde art because, according to Dore Ashton, “Although culture... had penetrated the hinterland in the form of public libraries, literary societies, and even music circles, the plastic arts had... lagged far behind” In order to increase the interest of the arts among the people and to allow them to be up-to-date with the rest of the world at that time, they decided to increase the number of museums in America from the 1940s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name = HIJ&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ashton, Dore|title=The New York School: A Cultural Reckoning.|publisher=Viking|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government Funding the Artist===
Along with the construction of museums, the Federal Government also realized that, to increase the interest of the people, there needed to be more art available. In addition to this, if the artists were to do so, they would need to form communities in which the artists could gather to produce their art. According to Sharon Zukin, “...real-estate developers profited from the increase in property values that resulted from the creation of an artistic community in Manhattan's SoHo district while political leaders benefited from the creation of a large pool of arts-related jobs.” Another reason the Federal Government felt a need to fund the artists at this time was to increase the patriotism of the people. If there was art depicting how grand, majestic, and free the United States of America is, they felt this would increase Patriotism among the people so the people would be willing to agree with whatever the government had to offer. According to Sharon Zukin, “The willingness of federal and state governments to fund art and artists were political interests that used traveling exhibitions as propaganda for the American way of life.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref name = IJK&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zukin, Sharon|title=Loft Living: Culture and Capital in Urban Change.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of early avant-garde on later avant-garde===
When looking at all of the major movements of avant-garde that were influential from this time period, almost all of these art forms trace back to earlier avant-garde art forms, namely Dadaism. For instance, in practice, Abstract Expressionism was influenced by Dada by the fact that the art form had its similarities not in the way that the art was constructed, but rather from the concept that the genres exemplify. Pop Art also marks its influences from Dada because, like the “ready-mades” which used commonplace items in a way that they were not originally intended. For the case of Dada, the “ready-mades” consisted of items such as toilets as art. For the case of pop art, it could have been anything that proved influential in popular culture, whether it be comic strips, soup cans, or magazine advertisements.&lt;ref name="DEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

Another example of how an earlier avant-garde genre influenced a later genre was the example of Dada's influence of Punk fashion in the 1970s. Much like how the Dadaists used their art to reflect the ideal of  the belief in nothing and the wish to become nothing through their art (as they often referred it as anti-art), the Punk culture used the same ideals for their fashion and their music (by describing their music as anti-music). In addition to the two matching the same ideal, both used their mediums to reflect the same approach: to shock the community through their art and to speak a political, often Marxist, message through their works.&lt;ref name="EFG"/&gt;

===Relationship Between high culture and popular culture===
Stemming from its Dadaist beginnings, avant-garde was a movement that served as a contrast from typical Popular Culture. Under the guise of Dada, it started in Europe as a way to display their anti-art rhetoric as well as to communicate to the public their disgust for bourgeois values and their disapproval of World War I. In America, while the art was not much about protesting bourgeois values and the war, it still served as a way to protest against typical art values as well as to establish the high, artistic culture to contrast American popular culture.&lt;ref name = DEF&gt;”Dada” Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 14 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149499/Dada&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Abstract Expressionist and Minimalist art also served as a way to contrast popular culture. In Abstract Expressionist art, the approach to contrast from the depiction of real-world qualities by creating art using forms that do not exist in the real world. In Minimalist art, the approach was to contrast from the complicated works of the time, including those of fellow avant-garde genre Abstract Expressionism. Through this, the artist created their art with the sole intent of making art; not with a complicated political statement, not with a cultural reference, etc. It solely was art for art itself.&lt;ref name="CDE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FGH"/&gt;

However, Pop art and its practitioners, while continuing to do some contrast between high culture and popular culture, began to blur the two by using elements of popular culture and transforming those images in a way which were not the original intent of those elements, much like the ready-mades of the Dadaist artists before them. It sometimes came through subverting the images coloration, such as what Andy Warhol did with pictures of soup cans and actress Marilyn Monroe. In other times, it came through taking a comic strip out of its initial context and using that for a piece. However, despite trying to contrast the two, at many times many of the artists became celebrities in popular culture while practicing their contrast between that and the High Culture.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;

==Avant-garde's demise==
After the end of the Pop Art movement, many art critics began to question the rising generation of artists who were influenced by the Pop artists shortly before, even to the point that some considered avant-garde dead. There are various reasons, but three primary indications for its demise are:[[File:Blinklv.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blink-182 performing live in 2009.]]

# In their beginnings, the pop artists made a distinction between American Pop Culture and High Culture by changing the intent on items that provided a major impact on American society. However, as time went on, many of these same artists whose goals were to subvert well-known icons to fit their art became celebrities themselves. As a result, since many avant-garde artists who supported the High Culture began to be well known in Popular culture, the differences between the two cultures were becoming less distinguishable as time went on.&lt;ref name="GHI"/&gt;
# By the time the 1990s approached, the Punk movement began to be part of the American culture. Indications of this transition include the rise of punk-inspired grunge music provided by bands like Nirvana and the rise of pop-punk bands such as Green Day and Blink 182. As punk music began to increase in popularity by this time, the lyrics, fashion, and the music itself began to be saturated by Popular Culture until the point where most of its avant-garde influence seemed to be transparent.
# With the definition of high culture more vague than it was back in its inception, many artists attempted to create art that seemed similar to avant-garde, but rather than focusing on building up the High Culture, the art was rather made to create shock and to create art of the future. Such art that focused on shock and not about the social impact of the art were considered by art critics to be beginnings of Post-modernism.

'''"Remember about the Gas{{snd}} Do not buy Russian goods!"''' ({{lang-uk|Пам'ятай про газ{{snd}} не купуй російських товарів!}}) is a [[nonviolent resistance]] social [[boycott]] of [[Russia]]n goods in [[Ukraine]] that arose as a reaction to political pressure of the Russian Federation on Ukraine in the [[2005–06 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|gas conflict of 2005–2006 years]]. The campaign had started in December 2005, probably with putting up flyers by unknown activists in [[Kirovohrad]]. After publicity this idea had been taken by other social and political organizations. Active actions were being continued in this campaign mainly in the gas conflict of 2005–2006 and [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|2008–2009]] between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.

== Reactions ==
In December 2005, former Rada Chairman [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] said he would not send his friends any [[SMS]] with the text "Remember about the Gas{{snd}} Do not buy Russian goods", because he believes that it will increase the ethnic strife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maidanua.org/static/news/1135889313.html Литвин не вміє писати смс і не знає про міжнаціональну ворожнечу] {{uk icon}}. Maidan. 29 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, scientists of the Institute of State and Law of the National Academy of Sciences Ukraine expressed that the campaign resulted in strengthening agitation [[Party of Regions]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] during the [[Political campaign|election campaign]] in [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary elections]] to the introduction of Russian as a second language in Ukraine, and for closer integration of Ukraine with Russia within the [[Common Economic Space (CIS)|Common Economic Space]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eli.org.ua/upload/iblock/d00/magazine_file_8.pdf Вибори та демократія] {{uk icon}}.

After putting up flyers in [[Kirovohrad]] by unknown activists, several grocery stores stopped to do orders of Russian chocolate and [[Baltika Breweries|beer "Baltika"]].&lt;ref name="Gazeta.ua_20.02.2006"/&gt;

According to activists in early 2006 Spiritual Directorate of Buddhists Ukraine "Ninhma in Ukraine" supported its decision to boycott Russian goods. On their [http://ningma.org.ua/ website] they allegedly hung a banner "Do not buy Russian goods!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://maidanua.org/static/news/1136604767.html Українські буддисти також за бойкот російських товарів] {{uk icon}}.

== Estimations ==
According to historian Yaroslav Svatko he expressed in February 2006, the campaign was unexpected for the Russian government and led to unexpected consequences for her spontaneous, decentralized distribution in society the idea of separation of Ukrainian interests of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Yaroslav Svatko.

== Name ==
From the beginning of the campaign name came from the phrase "Remember about the gas" and "do not buy Russian goods" probably with leaflets those were handed by unknown activists in [[Kirovohrad]]. It was used by the activists of Alliance "Maidan" as "Remember the gas{{snd}}do not buy Russian goods!"&lt;ref name="Maidan_23.12.2005"/&gt; In that form phrase was most particularly through the media. But also phrase "Remember the gas{{snd}} do not buy Russian goods" (without the exclamation mark) was widely used. In 2009, the option "Remember the gas! Do not buy Russian goods!"&lt;ref name="Maidan_01.01.2009"/&gt; It was also used as well as other derivative forms.

== Successors ==
In August 2013, public campaign with similar name and concept was emerged in response to [[export blockade of Ukraine by Russia]]. It also got wide publicity and distribution in Ukraine, called "[[Do not buy Russian goods!]]" Later one more campaign was appeared{{snd}} "[[Boycott Russian Films]]".

'''Rosalind Epstein Krauss''' (born November 30, 1941) is an American [[art critic]], [[art theory|art theorist]] and a professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/html/dept_faculty_krauss.html Columbia Faculty directory]&lt;/ref&gt; Krauss is known for her scholarship in 20th-century [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]]. As a critic and theorist she has published steadily since 1965 in ''[[Artforum]],'' ''[[Art International]]'' and ''[[Art in America]]''. She was associate editor of ''Artforum'' from 1971 to 1974 and has been editor of ''[[October (journal)|October]]'', a journal of contemporary arts criticism and theory that she co-founded in 1976.

==Early life==
Krauss was born to Matthew M. Epstein and Bertha Luber &lt;ref name="theartstory.org"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm] Rosalind E. Krauss biography&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington D.C. and grew up in the area, visiting art museums with her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]] in 1962, she attended [[Harvard University|Harvard]],&lt;ref name="artcritical.com"&gt;[http://www.artcritical.com/2013/08/30/rosalind-krauss-interview/] The Real Thing: An Interview with Rosalind E. Krauss by David Plante at: http://www.artcritical.com/&lt;/ref&gt; whose Department of Fine Arts (now Department of History of Art and Architecture) had a strong tradition of the intensive analysis of actual art objects under the aegis of the [[Fogg Art Museum|Fogg Museum]].

Krauss wrote her dissertation on the work of [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]].&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Krauss received her Ph.D. in 1969. The dissertation was published as ''Terminal Iron Works'' in 1971.&lt;ref name="artcritical.com"/&gt;

In the late-1960s and early-1970s Krauss began to contribute articles to art journals such as ''Art International'' and ''[[Artforum]]'' — which, under the editorship of Philip Leider, was relocated from California to New York.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"/&gt; She began by writing the "Boston Letter" for ''Art International,'' but soon published well-received articles on [[Jasper Johns]] (''Lugano Review'', 1965) and [[Donald Judd]] (''Allusion and Illusion in [[Donald Judd]],'' ''[[Artforum]]'', May 1966). Her commitment to the emerging [[minimal art]] in particular set her apart from [[Michael Fried]], who was oriented toward the continuation of modernist abstraction in [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]] and [[Anthony Caro]]. Krauss's article ''A View of [[Modernism]]'' (''[[Artforum]]'', September 1972), was one signal of this break.

==Career==
===Founding ''October''===
Krauss became dissatisfied with ''Artforum'' when in its November 1974 issue it published a full-page advertisement by featuring the artist [[Lynda Benglis]] aggressively posed with a large latex [[dildo]] and wearing only a pair of [[sunglasses]] promoting an upcoming exhibition of hers at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]].&lt;ref name="bookreview"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Challenging Art: Artforum 1962–1974 |last = Cohen |first=David |journal = The Art Bulletin |volume=84 |issue=3 |date=September 2002 |pages=535–538|doi=10.2307/3177317|last2=Newman|first2=Amy |jstor=3177317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doss"&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century American Art |series=Oxford History of Art |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |location = [[Oxford]] |year= 2002 |last = Doss |first =Erika |isbn =0-19-284239-0 |pages=184 |chapter = Feminist Art and Black Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Benglis' image is now popularly cited as an important example of gender performativity in contemporary art, it provoked mixed responses when it first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Susan. "{{cite web|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/nparadoxavolumes.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829124953/http://www.ktpress.co.uk/nparadoxavolumes.htm |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}" "Sizing Up the Dildo: Lynda Benglis' ''Artforum'' Advertisement as a Feminist Icon", ''[[n.paradoxa]]'' 15 (January 2005): 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Krauss and other Artforum personnel attacked Benglis' work in the following month's issue of ''Artforum'', describing the advertisement as exploitative and brutalizing, and soon left the magazine to co-found ''[[October (journal)|October]]'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"/&gt;

''October'' was formed as a politically-charged journal that introduced American readers to the ideas of French [[post-structuralism]], made popular by [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="theartstory.org"/&gt; Krauss used ''October'' as a way of publishing essays on post-structuralist art theory, [[Deconstruction]]ist theory, [[psychoanalysis]], [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref name="theartstory.org"/&gt;

The founders included Krauss, Annette Michelson and the artist [[Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe]]. Krauss was appointed as its founding editor. Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe withdrew after only a few issues, and by the spring of 1977, [[Douglas Crimp]] joined the editorial team. In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by [[Yve-Alain Bois]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], Denis Hollier, and John Rajchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trikster.net/2/crimp/1.html |title=Mathias Danbolt, Front Room – Back Room: An Interview with Douglas Crimp |work=Trikster – Nordic Queer Journal #2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic===

====Hunter College====
Krauss taught at [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] before joining the faculty at [[Hunter College]] in 1974. She was promoted to professor in 1977 at Hunter and was also appointed professor at the Graduate Center of [[City University of New York|CUNY]]. She held the title of Distinguished Professor at Hunter until she left to join the [[Columbia University]] faculty in 1992. In 1985, a monograph of essays by Krauss, titled ''The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths'' was published by [[The MIT Press]].

====Columbia University====
Previously [[Meyer Schapiro]] Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia, in 2005 Rosalind Krauss was promoted to the highest faculty rank of [[University Professor (Columbia)|University Professor]]. She has received fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and has been a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts and of the Institute for Advanced Study. She received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for criticism from the [[College Art Association]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a fellow of the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]] since 1992 and was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1994. She recently received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of London]].

===Curator===
Krauss has been curator of many art exhibitions at leading museums, among them exhibitions on [[Joan Miró]] at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] (1970–73), on [[surrealism]] and photography at the [[Corcoran Museum of Art]] (1982–85), on [[Richard Serra]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (1985–86), and on [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] at the Guggenheim (1992–94). She prepared an exhibition for the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris called "Formlessness: Modernism Against the Grain" in 1996.

==Critical approach==

===Greenbergian tradition===
Krauss's attempts to understand the phenomenon of modernist art, in its historical, theoretical, and formal dimensions, have led her in various directions. She has, for example, been interested in the development of photography, whose history – running parallel to that of modernist painting and sculpture – makes visible certain previously overlooked phenomena in the "high arts", such as the role of the indexical mark, or the function of the archive. She has also investigated certain concepts, such as "formlessness", "the optical unconscious", or "pastiche", which organize modernist practice in relation to different explanatory grids from those of progressive modernism, or the avant-garde.

Like many, Krauss had been drawn to the criticism of [[Clement Greenberg]], as a counterweight to the highly subjective, poetic approach of [[Harold Rosenberg]]. The poet-critic model proved long-lasting in the New York scene, with products from [[Frank O'Hara]] to Kynaston McShine to [[Peter Schjeldahl]], but for Krauss and others, its basis in subjective expression was fatally unable to account for how a particular artwork's objective structure gives rise to its associated subjective effects.

Greenberg's way of assessing how an art object works, or how it is put together, became for Krauss a fruitful resource;&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=The Medium Inquisitor|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=21 October 1993|volume=40|issue=17|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1993/oct/21/the-medium-inquisitor/|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if she and fellow "Greenberger", [[Michael Fried]], would break first with the older critic, and then with each other, at particular moments of judgment, the commitment to [[formal analysis]] as the necessary if not sufficient ground of serious criticism would still remain for both of them. Decades after her first engagement with Greenberg, Krauss still used his ideas about an artwork's 'medium' as a jumping-off point for her strongest effort to come to terms with post-1980 art in the person of [[William Kentridge]]. Krauss would formulate this formalist commitment in strong terms, against attempts to account for powerful artworks in terms of residual ideas about an artist's individual genius, for instance in the essays "The Originality of the Avant-Garde: A [[Postmodernist]] Repetition" and "Photography's Discursive Spaces." For Krauss, and for the school of critics who developed under her influence, the Greenbergian legacy offers at its best a way of accounting for works of art using public and hence verifiable criteria.

===Translating ephemeralities into prose===
Whether about ([[Cubist]] [[collage]], [[Surrealist]] photography, early [[Giacometti]] sculpture, [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Brâncuși]], [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]) or about art contemporaneous to her own writing ([[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Cindy Sherman]]), Krauss translates the ephemeralities of visual and bodily experience into precise, vivid English, which has solidified her prestige as a critic. Her usual practice is to make this experience intelligible by using categories translated from the work of a thinker outside the study of art, such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Georges Bataille]], or [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, she participated in the translation of Lacan's key text "[[Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment|Television]]" which was published in October and later reissued in book form by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|Norton]]. Her work has helped establish the position of these writers within the study of art, even at the cost of provoking anxiety about threats to the discipline's autonomy. She is currently preparing a second volume of collected essays as a sequel to ''The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths'' (1986).

In many cases, Krauss is credited as a leader in bringing these concepts to bear on the study of modern art. For instance, her ''Passages in Modern Sculpture'' (1977) makes important use of [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s phenomenology (as she had come to understand it in thinking about minimal art) for viewing modern sculpture in general. In her study of Surrealist photography, she rejected [[William Rubin]]'s efforts at formal categorization as insufficient, instead advocating the psychoanalytic categories of "dream" and "automatism", as well as [[Derrida|Jacques Derrida]]'s "grammatological" idea of "spacing." See "The Photographic Conditions of Surrealism" (''October'', winter 1981).

===Picasso's collages===
Concerning Cubist art, she took Picasso's collage breakthrough to be explicable in terms of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'s ideas about the differential relations and non-referentiality of language, rejecting efforts by other scholars to tie the pasted newspaper clippings to social history. Similarly, she held Picasso's stylistic developments in Cubist portraiture to be products of theoretical problems internal to art, rather than outcomes of the artist's love life. Later, she explained Picasso's participation in the ''rappel à l'ordre'' or [[return to order]] of the 1920s in similar [[structuralism|structuralist]] terms. See "In the Name of Picasso" (''October'', spring 1981), "The Motivation of the Sign" (in Lynn Zelevansky, ed., ''Picasso and Braque: A Symposium'', 1992), and ''The Picasso Papers'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998).

===Freudian theory===
From the 1980s, she became increasingly concerned with using a [[psychoanalytic]] understanding of drives and the unconscious, owing less to the Freudianism of an [[André Breton]] or a [[Salvador Dalí]], and much more to the structuralist [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] and the "dissident surrealist" [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]].&lt;ref name="Chilvers, Ian 2009. p. 384"/&gt; See "No More Play", her 1984 essay on [[Giacometti]], as well as "Corpus Delicti", written for the 1985 exhibition ''L'Amour Fou: Photography and Surrealism'', ''Cindy Sherman: 1975–1993'' and ''The Optical Unconscious'' (both 1993) and ''Formless: A User's Guide'' with Yve-Alain Bois, catalog to the exhibition ''L'Informe: Mode d'emploi'' (Paris: Centre Pompidou, 1996).

===Interpreting Pollock===
Years after her time at ''[[Artforum]]'' in the 1960s, Krauss also returned to the drip painting of [[Jackson Pollock]] as both a culmination of modernist work within the format of the "easel picture", and a breakthrough that opened the way for several important developments in later art, from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s happenings to [[Richard Serra]]'s lead-flinging process art to [[Andy Warhol]]'s oxidation (i.e. urination) paintings. For reference, see the Pollock chapter in ''The Optical Unconscious,'' several entries in the ''Formless'' catalog, and "Beyond the Easel Picture", her contribution to the [[MoMA]] symposium accompanying the 1998 Pollock retrospective (''Jackson Pollock: New Approaches''). This direction provided intellectual validation for the explosive Pollock markets; but it exacerbated already tense relations between herself and more radical currents in visual/cultural studies, the latter growing steadily impatient with the traditional western art-historical canon.

In addition to writing focused studies about individual artists, Krauss also produced broader, synthetic studies that helped gather together and define the limits of particular fields of practice. Examples of this include "Sense and Sensibility: Reflections on Post '60s Sculpture" (''Artforum'', Nov. 1973), "Video: The Aesthetics of Narcissism" (''October'', spring 1976), "Notes on the Index: Seventies Art in America", in two parts, ''October'' spring and fall 1977), "Grids, You Say", In ''Grids: Format and Image in 20th Century Art'' (exh. cat.: Pace Gallery, 1978), and "Sculpture in the Expanded Field" (''October'', spring 1979). Some of these essays are collected in her book ''The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths''.

His research interests include [[the Holocaust in art and literature#theatre|Holocaust drama]], [[Yiddish theatre]], [[gay and lesbian theatre]], Spanish playwright [[Federico García Lorca]], and the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glam.ac.uk/hass/1186/376  Staff Details - Sam Boardman-Jacobs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070702083158/http://www.glam.ac.uk/hass/1186/376 |date=2007-07-02 }} [http://www.glam.ac.uk University of Glamorgan] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QiptXTeQ?url=http://www.glam.ac.uk/ |date=2007-07-30 }}. Retrieved on April 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These interests are reflected in his plays.

He won acclaim&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/individuals/individuals_details.asp?individualID=100 Sam Boardman-Jacobs], [http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/index.asp Theatre in Wales.] Retrieved on April 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for his work on Holocaust and Yiddish drama with the [[Manchester Youth Theatre]] and received a grant from the European Association of Jewish Culture in 2002 for his play ''Trying To Be'', an exploration of Jewish identity set in contemporary Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcultureineurope.org/bio.htm 2002 Grant Recipients], [http://www.jewishcultureineurope.org European Association for Jewish Culture]. Retrieved on April 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sam recently took an MA in Choreography at Laban, London, and now makes choreographic dance theatre with  Found Reality Dance Theatre, Cardiff, of which he is artistic director.

''Play Federico For Me'' is the fictional story of Catalan actress [[Margarita Xirgu]], who, during her exile after the Spanish Civil War, depends upon the ghost of Federico García Lorca, in her political-artistic battle with [[Eva Perón]] over the first performance of Lorca's "The House of Bernarda Alba". His translation and adaptation of Lorca's ''[[El público]]'' was produced by the Found Reality Theatre Company in 2005. His 2007 radio play, ''The Sixth Column Has Better Legs'', describes the experiences of four chorus girls in [[Siege of Madrid|Madrid]] while the city is under siege.

''Passion for the Impossible'' tells the story of [[Violette Leduc]] and [[Jean Genet]] in wartime [[Paris]] and ''Red Hot and Blue'' is the story of singer [[Libby Holman]], on the night before her suicide, as she looks back over a life that included a murder trial, an affair with [[Montgomery Clift]] and early [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] campaigning during the [[Second World War]].

In 2003 he taught for the Lemonia Disabled Writers' Residential Course, a project organised by [[Graeae Theatre Company]], Writernet and [[Tŷ Newydd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writernet.co.uk/projects__partners/recent_projects/lemonia_2003/lemonia_full_report.phtml  Lemonia - Full Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001021153/http://www.writernet.co.uk/projects__partners/recent_projects/lemonia_2003/lemonia_full_report.phtml |date=2006-10-01 }}, [http://www.writernet.co.uk/php/map.php?id=294  Writernet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428090957/http://www.writernet.co.uk/php/map.php?id=294 |date=2007-04-28 }}. Retrieved on April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The production of his 2004 play, ''Embracing Barbarians'', based on the political and sexual fantasies of dying Greek poet [[Constantine Cavafy]], Sam attempted to make the piece accessible to both deaf and hearing performers and audiences, while casting a deaf performer in the role of a hearing character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/plays/author_playlist.asp?author=Sam+Boardman-Jacobs|Sam Boardman-Jacobs - ''Embracing Barbarians'' synopsis] [http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/index.asp Theatre in Wales.] Retrieved on April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He has taught on several  Writing Menoring and Dramaturgy courses at venues ranging from The Soho Theatre and  The Actor's centre London to the Arvon Foundation and Ty Newydd in North Wales and on  MA in Scriptwriting courses in Cardiff and Exeter. He now teaches Master classes in Scriptwriting and Dramaturgy in France and the UK.

He was also a scriptwriter for 12 years on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Archers]]'' and one of the  writers for [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Brookside]]''. He translates from Spanish to English.

'''''A Scene from the Great Flood''''' or ''''''The Great Flood''''' is an 1826 painting of [[Noah's flood]] by [[Joseph-Désiré Court]]. It was first exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] on 4 November 1827 although - as a laureate of the Prix de Rome - he could not compete for the awards of that Salon. The French state purchased the work for 3000 francs and it is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6234">[[Image:Standrewssarcophagus.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The St Andrews Sarcophagus.]]

The '''Saint Andrews Sarcophagus''' is a [[Picts|Pictish]] monument dating from the second half of the 8th century. The [[sarcophagus]] was recovered beginning in 1833 during excavations by [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|St Andrew's Cathedral]], but it was not until 1922 that the surviving components were reunited. The sarcophagus is currently on display at the Cathedral museum in [[St Andrews]], close to the site of its discovery.

==Description==
As originally constructed the sarcophagus would have comprised two side panels, two end panels, four corner pieces and a roof slab. The roof slab is entirely missing, as are most of one side and one end panel and a corner piece so that the extant sarcophagus is essentially L-shaped. The external dimensions of the sarcophagus are 177&amp;nbsp;cm by 90&amp;nbsp;cm and a height of 70&amp;nbsp;cm. The stone used is a local sandstone.

The surviving side panel shows, from right to left, a figure breaking the jaws of a lion, a mounted hunter with his sword raised to strike a leaping lion, and hunter on foot, armed with a spear and assisted by a hunting dog, about to attack a wolf. Although it is not certain that the first two figures represent the same person, 19th century illustrations depict them as if they are. The surviving end panel is much simpler, essentially a cross with four small panels between the arms. The fragments of the missing end panel are similar, but not identical, to the surviving one.

==Discovery==
The Sarcophagus was discovered within the grounds of The Cathedral near the St Regulus Chapel.  The Cathedral had been in use from when it was constructed during the 1100s until it was stripped of all its altars and images, left in ruins and abandoned after 1559 during the Reformation.  Much of its remaining stonework was recycled over the years into buildings in the town of [[St Andrews]].&lt;ref name=Buist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buist|first1=George|editor1-last=Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|title=On the Ancient Sculptured Monument Discovered at St Andrews, in 1833 [speech given February 27, 1854]|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|date=1855|volume=1|pages=234–237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyI9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 27, 2016|publisher=Neill &amp; Company|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical opinion==
[[Image:ÓengusmacFergusa.JPG|300px|thumb|right|This is the royal figure on the St Andrew's sarcophagus. The figure is dressed like a late Roman emperor, bearing on the neckline of the garment what is probably a ''kaiserfibel'' like that depicted on [[Justinian]] in the mosaic at [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]]. This is in the grandest tradition of ''imitatio imperii''. It may therefore be taken as an indirect depiction of the king who commissioned it.&lt;ref&gt;See T. M. Charles Edwards, "'The Continuation of Bede', s.a. 750: high-kings of Tara and 'Bretwaldas'".&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Historians differ on who was likely to have been interred in the sarcophagus. Although it is generally presumed that it was commissioned by the [[List of kings of the Picts|Pictish King]] [[Óengus I|Óengus, or Onuist]], a Christian who died in 761, whether it was actually used for his corpse,&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Douglas.

The '''Swan Service''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Schwanenservice'') is a large service of [[baroque]] [[Meissen porcelain]] which was made for the First Minister of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], [[Heinrich von Brühl]].  [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], [[Elector of Saxony]] and also [[King of Poland]], had made Brühl the Supervisor of the Meissen works in 1733, then in August 1739 its Director.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, 343; Untermyer, 118&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swan Service has been called "the most famous high baroque production in Meissen porcelain",&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, 343&lt;/ref&gt; "a triumph of modelling and firing",&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most fabulous tableware conceived in porcelain".&lt;ref&gt;Grigaut&lt;/ref&gt;  After earlier work with prototypes, the Meissen designers and modellers [[Johann Joachim Kändler]], Johann Friedrich Eberlein and (from about 1741) Johann Gottlieb Ehder created the service, which consists of over 2,200 individual pieces, between 1737 and 1742.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, 343&lt;/ref&gt;

A service on such a scale and with such lavish sculptural elements was unprecedented; a later large Meissen service, the [[Möllendorff Dinner Service]] of the 1760s had under 1,000 pieces.  The distinctive characteristic of the service, from which it gets its name, is its decoration in very low [[relief]]: each plate or other piece of flatware has a delicate background with radiating bands based on a [[scallop]] shell, against which there is in the central well a pair of swans on the water amid [[bullrush]]es, and a [[Crane (bird)|crane]] in the air, descending to join another on the left.  The standing crane grasps a fish in his beak, and the head of another fish can be seen in the water beneath the swan on the right. ''Brühl'' in German means a damp, marshy place, so the theme of the service was a play on its owner's name.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, 345&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1738 Kändler spent three days in the royal natural history collection at [[Dresden]], where "I drew all sorts of shells and examined them closely, so that the ... service could be realized in the most natural manner".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted, Untermyer, 118&lt;/ref&gt;  Such relief backgrounds were a speciality of Meissen under Kändler, but were usually more geometrical, as in the [[Ozier Pattern|"osier" patterns]], imitating [[wickerwork]], or the "Dulong border" (from 1743) with a rather neoclassical [[scroll (art)|plant-scroll]] pattern.&lt;ref&gt;There were "old" and "new" osier patterns (''Altozier'' and ''Neuozier'', the latter introduced in 1742), Wrightsman, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

Large pieces include opulent centrepieces, numerous candelabra, [[tureen]]s. There are other items including teapots and cups and wall-[[Sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s as well as the standard items of dinnerware.&lt;ref&gt;Untermyer, 118&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration, apart from the small painted flowers of the pattern called ''indianische Blumen'' ("Indian flowers"), is themed around water and the life within, though often mixing fresh water and marine forms. Several parts of the service depict figures from Greco-Roman mythology, like [[Glaucus]] and the dolphin-riding [[Galateia]]. Almost all pieces of the original service bear the painted [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] [[coat of arms]] of Heinrich von Brühl and his wife, countess Franziska Kolowrat-Krakowsky, though pieces were also produced for other customers.  Other painted decoration on the flatware pieces is gold rims and small flowers;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, 343–345&lt;/ref&gt; the figures on the larger pieces are more fully painted.

==History==
Brühl was a notoriously extravagant, indeed downright greedy, figure, who was (unlike the king himself, who owned the Meissen factory) allowed as Director to commission and receive Meissen pieces free. He made lavish use of this privilege, although the Swan Service seems to have been by way of a wedding present from the king for Brühl's marriage in November 1737.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 139–161; Ostrowski, 343&lt;/ref&gt;  Brühl's level of entertaining was exceptional even for the period, and the ''[[service à la française]]'' used at the time required large numbers of pieces of tableware, especially for Brühl, who served at every "publick entertainment" 80 to 100 different dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 153–155&lt;/ref&gt;

Work began by Kändler in 1736, when some sample plates were produced. Work making the moulds began in December 1737, and most shapes were completed by 1741;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrowski, 343&lt;/ref&gt; the service was delivered piecemeal as pieces were finished.  Meissen still possess the moulds, and these were used at the time and later to produce items outside the Brühl service itself, including some in limited editions today.  Mostly, these lack the armorials.&lt;ref&gt;Untermyer, 118; [http://www.meissen.com/de/limitierte-kunstwerke/meissen-als-wertanlage/schwanenservice Modern reproductions from Meissen]&lt;/ref&gt;

About half the service appears to have been lost in World War II, in particular when the Soviet [[Red Army]] occupied Schloss Pförten, the family castle in today's [[Brody, Żary County]] in [[Poland]], where the main part was stored, which then burnt down. It is said that pieces were used as targets in a version of [[clay pigeon shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bonhams.com/press_release/11582/ Bonham's Press release, 2012], "Chocolate cup and saucer are among rare items of important Meissen service saved from obliteration"&lt;/ref&gt;  Other items from the service had long been dispersed, which helped to promote its fame, and many museums have items from it, with a trickle of pieces from the original production still appearing on the art market.  London auction prices in 2015 include £31,250 for a teacup and saucer, £18,125 for a slop bowl, £6,875 for small fragments of three candlesticks, £15,000 for a saucer and £8,125 for a mustard-pot cover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bonham's]], London sales of "Fine European Ceramics": 2 December 2015, Lots 46, 44 and 45; 17 June 2015, Lots 61 and 62 respectively.

A '''talent agent''', or '''booking agent''', is a person who finds jobs for [[actor]]s, [[author]]s, [[film director]]s, [[musician]]s, [[model (profession)|model]]s, [[professional athlete]]s, [[writer]]s, [[screenwriter]]s, [[broadcast journalist]]s, and other professionals in various entertainment or broadcast businesses. In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are [[modeling agency|modeling agencies]], commercial talent agencies, [[literary agent|literary agencies]], voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more.

Having an agent is not required, but does help the artist in getting jobs (concerts, tours, movie scripts, appearances, signings, sport teams, etc.). In many cases, casting directors, or other businesses go to talent agencies to find the artists for whom they are looking. The agent is paid a percentage of the star's earnings (typically 10%). Therefore, agents are sometimes referred to as "10 percenters." Various regulations govern different types of agents. The regulations are established by artist's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates. There are also professional associations of talent agencies.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}Talent agents are considered gatekeepers to their client's careers. They have the ability to reshape and reconstruct their client's image. They are dealmakers and assist their client by orchestrating deals within the entertainment industry, more specifically in the Hollywood entertainment industry. 

In California, because talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts, the agencies must be licensed under special sections of the California Labor Code, which defines an agent as a "person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for an artist or artists."&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Paul.(2008) "Hollywood Film Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p.167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the largest agencies by size are [[William Morris Endeavor]] (WME), [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579322721786447490 | title=Hollywood Isn't Enough for Talent Agency CAA | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=Feb 3, 2014 | accessdate=20 March 2014 | author=BEN FRITZ, ERICH SCHWARTZEL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Talent Agency]] (UTA) and [[ICM Partners]] {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

==Types of talent agents and agencies==

===Sports agents===
{{main article|Sports agent}}

===Literary agent===
{{main article|Literary agent}}

===Broadcast journalist agencies===
Some talent agencies specialize in the representation of television news broadcast journalists and television news magazine hosts. The journalists and hosts represented by these agents primarily work at television stations in local markets or at networks. There are many job titles for broadcast news journalists such as anchors, reporters, weathercasters, sportscasters, correspondents and hosts.

===Commercial and Theatrical agents===
Actors may be interested in working theatrically (stage, film or television) as well as in commercials. Some agents will handle all types of acting work, while others may specialize in a particular area. Some agents work only in the field of television, or only in film and television. Typically, the larger the agency, the more specialized the agents within the agency.

An agent has two sets of clients:  the "talent" (actors, models, voice-over artists, etc.) and the "buyer". The buyer can be a casting director, advertising agency, [[film studio|production company]], photographer, or direct client if the client has an "in-house" production staff. Agents promote talent to the buyers, submitting talent who have the appropriate age, race, sex, look, talent, etc. that the buyer is seeking for his/her project. Usually, an agent submits the actor's [[head shot]] or the model's [[composite card]] or [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] to the buyer. After the buyer has made choices, the agent then arranges an audition (or for models, a "go-see" or open call). After the buyer has met the talent, the buyer will contact the agent if any of the talent will be hired. The agent will coordinate the details of wardrobe, directions, etc., as well as negotiate the contract or pay.

Note that the agent's job is to get the talent auditions; the talent is the only person who can get the job. For their work, agents take a 10 to 20% commission of the gross, depending on whether the job is [[trade union|union]] (such as SAG-AFTRA) or not. Union jobs are paid per negotiated guidelines, but in non-union jobs the pay is sometimes delayed.

A well established agent will have networks upon networks of contacts. Also, agents have access to professional casting services. Many of these casting resources are not available to the general public.

Although most of the successful agents are private individuals unknown to the public, some are celebrities in their own right. Notable current and former talent agents includes [[David Begelman]], [[Ari Emanuel]], [[Freddie Fields]], [[Johnny Hyde]], [[Irving Paul Lazar|Irving "Swifty" Lazar]], [[Sue Mengers]], Quincy Sims, [[Lew Wasserman]], [[Jadin Wong]] and The Handbook.

===Modeling agencies===
{{main article|Modeling agency}}

===Music agents===
In the music world, booking agents are different from [[talent manager]]s. Booking agents are the people who actually book [[Concert|shows]] for the artists they represent. These agents make all of the arrangements with the promoters of the shows. The booking agent presents the [[music promoter|promoter]] or producer of the concert with a [[contract|performance agreement]], which stipulates the artist's requirements. Items may include [[stage lighting|lighting]], sound, meals, hotel accommodations, and transportation. For concert buyers, they work to find the artist who will fit in the need and available budget.

Many of the major booking agencies refuse to represent clients who are not already signed to a major [[record label]] and have national distribution of their music. Because of this, artists on [[independent record labels]] often seek representation with an independent booking agency.

Bars and nightclubs that specialize in presenting live music on a regular basis often employ an individual to assemble the schedule of events. This individual is the venue's buyer, and should not be confused with the booking agent, who presents a roster of available acts to the buyer. Booking agents may also have contacts known as free-lance promoters. These are individuals who agree to produce a concert by locating a venue, providing a sound system and assembling a staff. Producing a show in this manner, at a location rented out for a single evening, is called “four-walling,” as the process entails renting a venue and receiving no additional services or technical equipment other than the space itself. This has often been the only available option for underground musicians lacking enough popular appeal to gain access to more conventional performance venues (see: [[Punk rock]]), but is also used among the genre of [[rave]]s and various DJ-related events.

The cost factor of having a booking agent must be weighed against what the agent can do for clients and buyers alike. Some agents represent several different types of artists, while others represent artists in one main area/genre.

Some music agencies deal exclusively with [[cover bands]], listing exclusive and non-exclusive artists on their rosters. In addition, some agencies will also work with a third party company to build specific bands using their own database of vetted musicians, whilst other cover band agencies work with [[session musicians]], that provide a 'flexible' line up for each act.

===Cruise ship industry===
Booking agents are also used for the cruise ship industry where several different categories of entertainers are needed. These can include individual musicians to be part of the ship's orchestra, small bands and ensembles as well as variety entertainers such as singers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians and acrobats. Artists looking to work on cruise ships will sign an employment contract with the cruise line and a separate commission contract with the booking agent. The agent will usually be based in the country of origin for the artist.

===Music managers===&lt;!--Linked to from "Music management"--&gt;
{{main|Talent manager#Music managers}}
A music manager (or band manager) handles many career issues for bands, singers, record producers, and DJs. A music manager is hired by a musician or band to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotions, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers is extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, business manager (who is sometimes a [[certified public accountant]]), [[Tour promoter|tour managers]], and sometimes even a personal assistant. Responsibilities of a business manager are often divided among many individuals who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers must assume multiple roles: booking agent, graphic designer, [[publicist]], promoter, and accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getsigned.com/trench01.html When Does My Band Need A Manager?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203221153/http://www.getsigned.com/trench01.html |date=3 February 2009 }} Getsigned.com 16 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist's career develops, responsibilities grow. A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding music producers, and developing relationships with record companies, publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. The duties of an active music manager will focus on developing a reputation for the musician and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, and booking shows. A music manager will gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.

===Online voice talent agents===
With the advent of the internet, established and new talent can have a thriving career in the voice over industry through online casting websites. Whilst there are sites that allow any person to join, a new wave of 'professionals only' casting websites is emerging. In an industry where radio and television voice overs can be recorded in home studios because of technology becoming so affordable, high paying jobs are no longer sourced exclusively through traditional voice talent agents.

==History==

Since the decline in viewership in theaters, from the 1950s to 1960s, a monumental shift occurred in how studios produced films and reduced the cost of exclusive and expensive actors. After the shift, actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity, and so were able to work with other studios. This shift has meant that agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option. Agents became third parties who negotiated between studios and clients, making the need for the agents' services an imperative for each party.

In the 1980s new agencies were established to compete with the "Big five."  In 1991 Bauer-Benedek merged with Leading Artists Agency to form what became United Talent Agency. These agencies were Traid Artists and InterTalent. Traid Artist would eventually be sold to [[William Morris Agency]] in 1992, and InterTalent would diminish when its partners dispersed between UTA and ICM in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Paul(2008). The Star System: The Production of Hollywood Stardom in the Post-Studio Era, p. 168-171. Blackwell Publishing, Inc., MA. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-3388-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2000s, Hollywood's largest talent agencies were known as the "big five"&lt;ref&gt;"Though suits are still the standard at the Big Five agencies (C.A.A., William Morris, I.C.M., U.T.A. and Endeavor)" Laporte, Nicole. "[http://www.observer.com/node/51319 Let's Dress It Down, Ari.]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414175729/http://www.observer.com/node/51319 |date=14 April 2009 }} ''[[New York Observer]]'', 25 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; or "top five".&lt;ref&gt;"Skirmishes among [Hollywood]'s top five agencies are escalating." Horn, John. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/03/entertainment/et-word3 Summer battle royale for agents.]" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Artists Agency (CAA), William Morris Agency (WMA), United Talent Agency (UTA), [[International Creative Management]] (ICM), and [[Endeavor Talent Agency|Endeavor]].  In 2009 two of the agencies, Endeavor and the William Morris Agency, merged to form William Morris Endeavor (WME). In 2012, International Creative Management completed a management buyout and formed a partnership with the new name, ICM Partners.

==Difference between agents and managers==
The difference between the roles of agents and managers has become smaller and more blurred.&lt;ref&gt;"The Difference Between an 'Agent' and a 'Manager', Slate.com.

Various state laws and labor guild rules govern the roles reserved to agents, as well as specifying certain special rights, privileges, and prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Talent Agents.  "Talent Agency Licensing," http://www.agentassociation.com/frontdoor/agency_licensing.cfm{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the state of California, the labor code requires licensing of talent agencies and includes regulations such as criminal background checks, maintaining separate operating accounts and client trust accounts, and limits total commissions to twenty-five percent, among other regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"Laws Relating to Talent Agencies," California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/talent/talent_laws_relating_to_talent_agencies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, management companies are described as "often unregulated."&lt;ref&gt;"Agents and Managers," SAG-AFTRA Website.  http://www.sagaftra.org/content/agents-and-managers&lt;/ref&gt; Agents also have certain privileged powers in situations of verbal agreement and can legally agree to a binding employment offer on behalf of their client.

A prominent difference between agents and managers under California state law is that licensed talent agents and employment agents are the only entities legally allowed to seek work on behalf of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Richard (March 25, 2013). "Walking on the California Talent Agency Act's Thin Ice: Personal Managers Beware," Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbusch/2013/03/25/walking-on-the-california-talent-agency-acts-thin-ice-personal-managers-beware/&lt;/ref&gt;  This legal distinction has enabled artists such as the Deftones, Pamela Anderson, Nia Vardalos, Freddie Prinze Jr., and others to break contracts with their managers and avoid commissions owed according to those contracts by proving "unlicensed procurement" in court.&lt;ref&gt;DLSE - Talent Agency Cases. http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/dlse-tacs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Because the enforcement against talent managers procuring work is largely carried out through civil litigation and not criminal penalties, managers directly seek out work in defiance of state laws, as clients out of self-interest will seldom object to them doing so and cases alleging illegal procurement are infrequent.

The Writer's  Guild, Screen Actor's Guild, and Director's Guild, among labor guilds, strike agency franchise agreements that specify certain regulations and privileges reserved solely for agents including setting maximum commissions at ten percent of a talent's gross earnings.  Managers do not face the same restrictions.

The '''Ventidio Basso Theater''' is the communal theater, concert hall, and opera house, located on via del Trivio, in front main cloister of the church of San Francesco, near piazza del Popolo, in the city of [[Ascoli Piceno]] region of [[Marche]], Italy. The exterior was erected in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]]-style, with grand interiors.

==History==
Ascoli Piceno had a communal theater since 1579, located at the site of the palazzo Anzianale. In 1839, the then-existing Teatro Comunale di Legno closed for performances. In order to build a larger arena, a design was commissioned in 1827 from [[Ireneo Aleandri]] and construction pursued from 1840 to 1846, when it stopped due to lack of funds. However construction was then sponsored by the engineer Marco Massimi and the merchant Gabriele Gabrielli, and directed by the architect [[Giambattista Carducci]].

The facade is sober with an entrance through an ionic colonnade. The second floor has a temple front [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] with pilasters. The atrium is decorated with stucco statues by [[Giorgio Paci|Giorgio]] and [[Emidio Paci]], depicting Apollo and Minerva, the muses of tragedy, comedy, music, and dance. The theater ceiling was decorated by [[Ferdinando Cicconi]], with medallions depicting ''Donizetti'', ''Rossini'', ''Bellini'', and ''Verdi''. [[Cesare Recanatini]] painted for the Theater a curtain a Vedute of the Piazza del Popolo. Another sipario depicts the ''Triumph of Ventidio Basso for his Victory over the Parthians'' by Vincenzo Podesti (brother of Francesco Podesti|Francesco]]). The theater has four rows of balconies with seating for over 800 spectators.

In 1846, the first performances were of the operas of ''[[Ernani]]'' and [[I Puritani]], with the soprano [[Anna De la Grange]], in leading roles. She is one of the busts in the atrium. Refurbishments over the years include electric lighting (1907) and cinema projector (1917). The theater was closed for restoration in 1979, only to re-open in 1994.

==Name of the Theater==
The theater is named by Ventidio Basso, local made prisoner during the Social Wars of the Roman Republic. He became a military and political leader for Julius Caesar and Marc Antony. Ventidio has honored with a triumph for a victory against the Parthians in 38-39 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comuneap.gov.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1504 Comune of Ascoli Piceno&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilteatroventidiobasso.it/ Teatro Ventidio Basso], official site.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Untouchables''''' is an American crime drama that ran from 1959 to 1963 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Television Network, produced by [[Desilu Productions]]. Based on the [[The Untouchables (1957 book)|memoir of the same name]] by [[Eliot Ness]] and [[Oscar Fraley]], it fictionalized Ness's experiences as a [[Bureau of Prohibition|Prohibition agent]], fighting crime in Chicago in the 1930s with the help of a special team of agents handpicked for their courage, moral character, and incorruptibility, nicknamed [[the Untouchables (law enforcement)|the Untouchables]]. The book was later made into a film in 1987 (also called ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'') by [[Brian De Palma]], with a script by [[David Mamet]], and a second, less-successful [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|TV series]] in 1993.

A dynamic, hard-hitting action drama, and a landmark television crime series, ''The Untouchables'' won series star [[Robert Stack]] an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Best Actor in a Dramatic Series]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/robert-stack/biography.html |title=Robert Stack |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=2015-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018143452/https://movies.yahoo.com/person/robert-stack/biography.html |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Untouchables Desilu Playhouse 1959.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Photo of the cast for ''The Untouchables'' as seen on Desilu Playhouse: Only Robert Stack (third from left) and [[Abel Fernandez]] (second from right) were used in the actual television series. [[Keenan Wynn]] is seen here at the right of Robert Stack, [[Peter Leeds]] (who played LaMarr Kane, replaced in the series by [[Chuck Hicks]]) is to the right of Wynn, and TV's [[The Adventures of Kit Carson|Kit Carson]], [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]] as Marty Flaherty (replaced by [[Jerry Paris]] in the series), is on the far right. Actor [[Paul Dubov]], who played Jack Rossman (replaced in the series by [[Steve London]]), is missing from this photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fZZ_8GEt5s |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The series originally focused on the efforts of a real-life squad of [[Prohibition]] agents employed by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] and led by Eliot Ness (Stack), that helped bring down the bootleg empire of "Scarface" Al Capone, as described in Ness's bestselling 1957 memoir.  This squad was nicknamed "The Untouchables", because of their courage and honesty; they could not be bribed or intimidated by the Mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DY0Ix4_Qk4C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=The+Untouchables+could+not+be+bribed+or+intimidated+by+the+Mob.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_XQXctDAS2&amp;sig=SFLWgQZ6SOj2jV1hhKsNqwfTMcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5WydUsLmB4_aoASbmYKQBw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Untouchables%20could%20not%20be%20bribed%20or%20intimidated%20by%20the%20Mob.&amp;f=false |title=The Everything Mafia Book: True Life Accounts of Legendary Figures, Infamous ... |author=James Mannion |page=47 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netplaces.com/mafia/the-real-untouchables/the-taxman-cometh.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Netplaces.com |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=2015-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413075058/http://www.netplaces.com/mafia/the-real-untouchables/the-taxman-cometh.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot Ness himself had died suddenly in May 1957, shortly before his memoir and the subsequent TV adaptation were to bring him fame beyond any he experienced in his lifetime.

The pilot for the series was a two-part episode entitled "The Untouchables" originally aired on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'' on April 20 and 27, 1959.  Later retitled "The Scarface Mob", these episodes, which featured [[Neville Brand]] as Al Capone, were the only episodes in the series to be more-or-less directly based on Ness's memoir, and ended with the conviction and imprisonment of Capone. CBS, which had broadcast most of Desilu's television output since 1951 beginning with ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', was offered the new series following the success of the pilot film. Chairman [[William S. Paley]] rejected it on the advice of network vice president Hubbell Robinson. ABC agreed to air the series, and ''The Untouchables'' premiered on October 15, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v012/p0056-p0073.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922235834/http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v012/p0056-p0073.pdf |date=September 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pilot movie, the mobsters generally spoke with unrealistic pseudo-Italian accents, but this idiosyncratic pronunciation was dropped when the series debuted.

The weekly series first followed the premise of a power struggle to establish a new boss in Capone's absence (for the purpose of the TV series, the new boss was [[Frank Nitti]], although this was contrary to fact). As the series continued, there developed a highly fictionalized portrayal of Ness and his crew as all-purpose crime fighters who went up against an array of gangsters and villains of the 1930s, including [[Ma Barker]], [[Dutch Schultz]], [[Bugs Moran]], [[Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll]], [[Legs Diamond]], [[Lucky Luciano]], and in one episode, [[Nazi]] agents.

The terse narration by gossip columnist [[Walter Winchell]], in his distinctive New York accent, was a stylistic hallmark of the series, along with its melancholy theme music by [[Nelson Riddle]] and its shadowy black-and-white photography, influenced by [[film noir]].

[[File:Robert Stack Untouchables 1962.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Stack as Eliot Ness with [[Gloria Talbott]], 1962]]
The show drew harsh criticism from some Italian-Americans, including [[Frank Sinatra]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gay Talese|Talese, Gay]]: "[[Frank Sinatra Has a Cold]]", page 27. [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]], April 1966&lt;/ref&gt; who felt it promoted negative stereotypes of them as mobsters and gangsters. The Capone family unsuccessfully sued CBS, Desilu Productions, and Westinghouse Electric Corporation for their depiction of the Capone family. In the first episode of the first season, the character of "Agent (Rico) Rossi", a person of Italian extraction who had witnessed a gangland murder, was added to Ness's team.

On March 9, 1961, [[Anthony Anastasio]], chief of the Brooklyn waterfront and its [[International Longshoremen's Association]], marched in line with a picket group who identified themselves as "The Federation of Italian-American Democratic Organizations". In protest formation outside the ABC New York headquarters, they had come together to urge the public boycott of [[Liggett Group|Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company]] (L&amp;M) products, including Chesterfield King cigarettes, the lead sponsor of ''The Untouchables''. They expressed displeasure with the program, which to them vilified Italian-Americans, stereotyping them as the singular criminal element.  The boycott and the attendant firestorm of publicity had the effect Anastasio and his confederates wanted.  Four days after the picket of ABC, L&amp;M, denying it had bowed to intimidation, announced it would drop its sponsorship of ''The Untouchables'', maintaining the decision was based on network-scheduling conflicts.  The following week, the head of [[Desilu]], [[Desi Arnaz]] (who had attended high school with Capone's son [[Albert Francis Capone|Albert]]), in concert with ABC and the "[[Italian-American Civil Rights League|Italian-American League to Combat Defamation]]", issued a formal three-point manifesto:

* There will be no more fictional hoodlums with Italian names in future productions.
* There will be more stress on the law-enforcement role of "Rico Rossi", Ness's right-hand man on the show.
* There will be an emphasis on the "formidable influence" of Italian-American officials in reducing crime and an emphasis on the "great contributions" made to American culture by Americans of Italian descent.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Jay S., in association with the editors of ''TV Guide'', "''TV Guide: The First 25 Years,''"  Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978, p. 52-53, {{ISBN|0-671-23065-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series also incurred the displeasure of the powerful director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[J. Edgar Hoover]], when the fictionalized scripts depicted Ness and his Treasury agents involved in operations that were actually the province of the FBI.  The second episode of the series, for example, depicted Ness and his crew involved in the capture of the Ma Barker gang, an incident in which the real-life Ness played no part.  The producers agreed to insert a spoken disclaimer on future broadcasts of the episode stating that the FBI had primary responsibility for the Barker case.

''The Untouchables'' was an unusually violent program for its time and its excessive violence and surprisingly frank depictions of drug abuse and prostitution were described by the National Association for Better Radio and Television as "not fit for the television screen".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151004213035/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tgAjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K80FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=901,2668583&amp;dq=] &lt;/ref&gt;

In an article titled "The New Enemies of 'The Untouchables'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ayn Rand |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_nonfiction_the_ayn_rand_column |title=The Ayn Rand Column |publisher=AynRand.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayn Rand]] argued that the persistent, superficial attacks received by ''The Untouchables'' were due to its appeal and its virtues: its moral conflict and moral purpose.

===Episodes and cast===
[[File:The Untouchables cast 1961.JPG|180px|thumb|The cast from left: Abel Fernandez, Nicholas Georgiade, Paul Picerni, (seated) Robert Stack (not shown: Steve London)]]
[[File:Neville Brand as Al Capone The Untouchables 1959.JPG|thumb|180px|Neville Brand as Al Capone]]
The series had 118 episodes which ran 50 minutes each.  Though the book chronicled the experiences of Ness and his cohorts against Capone, and in reality the Untouchables disbanded soon after Capone's conviction, the series continued after the pilot and book ended, depicting the fictitious further exploits of the Untouchables against many, often real life, criminals over a span of time ranging from 1929 to 1935. The television episodes were broadcast in no chronological timeline, but were set mostly in the early 1930s (for example, one episode, "You Can't Pick the Number", begins with Winchell's words, "October 1932: the depth of the [[Great Depression|Depression]]"). A few episodes were set primarily in a locale other than Chicago (such as the one dealing with the shootout involving Ma Barker and her gang.) Characters and "facts" in the majority of the episodes were more often than not entirely fictitious or loosely based composites of true-life criminals of that era. The gripping theme music was by Nelson Riddle.

[[Quinn Martin]] produced the show's first season, which contained elements that could be found in future TV series produced by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Jonathan.  ''Quinn Martin, Producer''.  Jefferson:  McFarland, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent Untouchables were portrayed by:
*[[Robert Stack]] as Agent [[Eliot Ness]]
*[[Abel Fernandez]] as Agent William Youngfellow
*[[Nicholas Georgiade]] as Agent Enrico "Rico" Rossi
*[[Paul Picerni]] as Agent Lee Hobson, (second season on)
*[[Steve London]] as Agent Jack Rossman (portrayed in the pilot by [[Paul Dubov]])

Other Untouchables members who were prominent at first, but didn't last past the pilot or the first season, were portrayed by :

*[[Jerry Paris]] as Agent Martin Flaherty, (first season only-portrayed in the pilot by [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]])
*Chuck Hicks as Agent LaMarr Kane (first season only-portrayed in the pilot by [[Peter Leeds]])
*[[Anthony George]] as Agent Cam Allison, (first season only)
*[[Keenan Wynn]] as Agent Joe Fuselli (pilot episode only)
*[[Eddie Firestone]] as Agent Eric Hansen (pilot episode only)
*[[Robert Osterloh]] as Agent Tom Kopka (pilot episode only)

In addition to the Untouchables themselves, there were several recurring allies in more than one episode:
*[[Frank Wilcox]] as Federal District Attorney Beecher Asbury
*[[Robert Bice]] as Police Capt. Johnson
*[[Jason Wingreen]] as Police Capt. Dorset
*[[Raymond Bailey]] as US Attorney for New York John Carvell
*[[Barbara Nichols]] as Brandy La France, showgirl and wife/widow of an informant, appearing in both the pilot and premiere
*[[Dane Clark]] as Dr. Victor Garr
*[[John Gabriel (actor)|John Gabriel]] as Dr. Daniel Gilford
*[[Barbara Stanwyck]] as Lt. Agatha Stewart, head of the Missing Persons Bureau
*[[Ed Asner]] as Frank, one of Agatha Stewart's assistants
*[[Virginia Capers]] as June, one of Agatha Stewart's assistants

The show also had several recurrent gangsters, many of them loosely based on real life gangsters of the time period:

*[[Frank Nitti]], Capone's enforcer who takes over the Chicago mob after Capone is imprisoned, portrayed by [[Bruce Gordon (actor)|Bruce Gordon]], and appearing in far more episodes than any other gangster
*Joe Kulak, portrayed by [[Oscar Beregi, Jr.]]
*[[Dutch Schultz]], portrayed in different episodes by [[Lawrence Dobkin]], [[Robert J. Wilke]], and [[Warren J. Kemmerling]]
*[[Jake Guzik|Jake "Greasy Thumb" Guzik]], portrayed in the pilot by [[Bern Hoffman]], and in the series by [[Nehemiah Persoff]]
*[[George "Bugs" Moran]], portrayed in different episodes by [[Lloyd Nolan]], Robert J. Wilke, and [[Harry Morgan]]
*[[Louis Lepke Buchalter]], portrayed in different episodes by [[Gene Roth]], [[Robert Carricart]], and [[Joseph Ruskin]]
*[[Lucky Luciano]], portrayed by Robert Carricart
*Pete Konitz, portrayed by [[Carl Milletaire]]
*Frankie Resko, portrayed by [[Grant Richards]]
*[[Al Capone]], portrayed by [[Neville Brand]], and appearing only in the 2 hour pilot and a 2 part episode
*[[Louis Campagna]], portrayed by [[Frank Dekova]]
*Augie Viale, portrayed by [[John Beradino]]
*Little Charlie Sebastino, portrayed by [[Henry Silva]]
*Louis Latito, portrayed by [[Joe De Santis]]
*Archie Devlin, Capone's attorney, portrayed by [[George N. Neise]]
*Lucky Quinn, portrayed by [[John Kellogg (actor)|John Kellogg]]
*[[Joe Aiello]] portrayed in different episodes by [[H. M. Wynant]] and Grant Richards
*Phil D'Andrea, portrayed by [[Wally Cassell]], and appearing only in the pilot and premiere
*"Fur" Sammons, portrayed by [[Richard Benedict]], and appearing only in the pilot and premiere
*Tony "Mops" Volpe, portrayed by [[Herman Rudin]], and appearing only in the pilot and premiere

Finally, heard in every episode, but never shown onscreen:

*Announcer: Les Lampson
*Narrator: [[Walter Winchell]]

Paul Picerni and Nicholas Georgiade were cast as gangsters in Capone and Nitti's mob in the 1959 pilot before being cast in the series.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Steve London's character of Untouchable Jack Rossman (played in the "Scarface Mob" pilot by [[Paul Dubov]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0239532/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056449/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm&lt;/ref&gt; was in the series since the original season-one series episode, "The Empty Chair", not from season two on as is commonly reported.
&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; The character of Untouchable William Youngfellow, portrayed by Abel Fernandez, has been mistakenly referred to by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] as "Youngblood". This name is incorrect.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75nuntouchables.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Desi Arnaz: 02/21/76: The Untouchables |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=February 21, 1936 |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast history==
''The Untouchables'' originally aired as a segment of the anthology series ''Desilu Playhouse'' in 1959.  It was picked up as a regular series by ABC for the 1959 season and was aired on Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:30pm from 1959 to 1962, switching to Tuesday evenings from 9:30 to 10:30pm for its final season (1962-63).

Desilu Productions president Desi Arnaz had originally offered the role of Ness to [[Van Johnson]]. Johnson's wife and manager rejected the deal, and demanded double the salary offer. Arnaz refused and signed Stack, instead. Arnaz had had a long business relationship with CBS, which had aired many Desilu programs, including ''I Love Lucy'' and ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''.  When CBS refused to buy the program, Arnaz sold it to ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Warren G. Harris 'Lucy &amp; Desi'&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Neville Brand reprised his role as Al Capone in the movie ''The [[George Raft]] Story''.

Some segments were released to theaters as movies: ''The Scarface Mob'' (from the two-part pilot), ''The [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] Express'' (from "The Big Train"), and ''The Gun of Zangara'' (from "Unhired Assassin").

On November 10, 1991, NBC ran the two-hour movie ''The Return of Eliot Ness'', with Robert Stack as Ness. It was set in 1947, after Capone's death, and depicted Ness investigating the death of an Untouchables agent named Labine.

==Legacy==

''The Untouchables'' was a landmark television series, that has spawned numerous imitators over the decades, such as ''[[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|S.W.A.T.]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culttvstore.com/index.php/information/series-formats-v15-27/item/206-crime-story |title=Crime Story |publisher=Culttvstore.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (Five-O's creator and executive producer, [[Leonard Freeman]], served as executive producer on ''The Untouchables{{'}}'' final season), Robert Stack's two later series, ''[[Strike Force (TV series)|Strike Force]]'' and ''[[Most Wanted (1976 TV series)|Most Wanted]]'', ''[[The Hat Squad]]'', and the 1993 [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|''The Untouchables'' syndicated TV series]].

It also inspired the big-budget motion pictures ''[[Al Capone (film)|Al Capone]]'' starring [[Rod Steiger]], ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (with [[Kevin Costner]]), ''[[Gangster Squad (film)|Gangster Squad]]'', ''[[Mulholland Falls]]'', and others.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
''The Untouchables'' is one of two series from 1959, the other being ''[[The Detectives (1959 TV series)|The Detectives]]'', together credited with the concept of depicting a ''group'' of crime fighters.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Previously, most TV crime dramas had followed one of two formats: either a duo composed of a stalwart police officer or detective and his trusty sidekick/partner (''Dragnet'', ''The Lineup''), or a lone-wolf [[private investigator|private eye]] or police detective (''Peter Gunn'', ''Richard Diamond'', ''M-Squad'').

The series was spoofed in the 1963 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon short "[[The Unmentionables]]", with [[Bugs Bunny]] playing the role of Elegant Mess, a crime fighter who is assigned to infiltrate a black market ring operated by [[Rocky and Mugsy]]. The series was also spoofed on an episode of the 1961-62 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]/[[Hanna Barbara]] cartoon series ''[[Top Cat]]'' entitled "The Unscratchables". NBC's ''"Saturday Night Live"'' spoofed The Untouchables several times during the 1970s, with [[Dan Aykroyd]] playing Eliot Ness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_912eS5WV7w&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1988 book, ''The Critics' Choice—The Best of Crime and Detective TV'', authors [[Max Allan Collins]] and John Javna chose ''The Untouchables'' as one of the "Top 10 Best Police TV Series (Police Procedurals) of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best of Crime &amp; Detective Tv the Critics' Choice|author1=Max Allan Collins|author2=John Javna|isbn=0-517-57055-6|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Best-Crime-Detective-Critics-Choice/dp/0517570556/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390750916&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+best+of+crime+and+detective+tv |title=The Best of Crime &amp; Detective TV (The Critics' Choice) |author1=Max Allan Collins |author2=John Javna |isbn=9780517570555 |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lebanon (Pa.) ''Daily News'' said of ''The Untouchables'': "Between the hard-nosed approach, sharp dialogue, and a commendably crisp pace (something rare in dramatic TV at the time), this series is one of the few that remains fresh and vibrant. Only the [[monochrome]] presentation betrays its age. ''The Untouchables'' is one of the few Golden Age TV shows that deserves being called a classic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long |first=Harry H. |url=http://www.ldnews.com/ci_21273752/from-reel-disc-gunsmoke-simplistic-tale-good-versus |title=From Reel to Disc: 'Gunsmoke' simplistic tale of good versus evil – Lebanon Daily News |publisher=Ldnews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018143452/http://www.ldnews.com/ci_21273752/from-reel-disc-gunsmoke-simplistic-tale-good-versus |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Theatre Royal''' was a [[patent theatre]] located in [[Cork (city)|Cork City]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/U305794/The-New-Theatre-Royal-Cork?img=46075&amp;bool=phrase|title=The New Theatre Royal, Cork|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Theatre Royal was founded by local actor [[Spranger Barry]] in 1760. It was modelled on the [[Crow Street Theatre]], [[Dublin]]. 

The theatre was destroyed by fire on [[April Fool's Day]] 1840. In 1853 it was rebuilt, and in the 1860s it was [[Renovation|refurbished]] under the direction of [[John Benson (architect)|Sir John Benson]], and re-opened on 26 December 1867. 

In 1875 the theatre was sold to the postal service and Cork's GPO opened on the site in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2011/1867-theatre-royal-cork/|title=1867 - Theatre Royal, Cork - Architecture of Cork City, Lost Buildings of Ireland - Archiseek - Irish Architecture|date=15 January 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://irishamericancivilwar.com/2015/10/09/the-polopticomorama-bringing-the-american-civil-war-to-life-in-irish-theatres-1863/|title=The ‘Polopticomorama’: Bringing the American Civil War to Life in Irish Theatres, 1863|date=9 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last three plays performed were [[James Sheridan Knowles]]' ''Virginius''; [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''; and [[John Wilson (playwright)|John Wilson]]'s ''Belphegor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=sRxmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;lpg=PT104&amp;dq=%22Theatre+Royal,+Cork%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T2K9iiKVoq&amp;sig=tbiS21fYSxOjdYMVK8h_V1Hbd8o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlv7XArOHUAhXHKsAKHV11AEwQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Theatre+Royal,+Cork%22&amp;f=false|title=Little Book of Cork|first=Kieran|last=McCarthy|date=7 September 2015|publisher=History Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
An 1867 description from the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'':
{{Quote|The theatre is constructed to hold two thousand persons, and is divided into two tiers of [[Box (theatre)|boxes]], a capacious [[Orchestra pit|pit]], [[Theater_(structure)#Seating_and_audience|stalls, private boxes, and a spacious gallery]], from which latter “[[Wiktionary:coign of vantage|coign of vantage]]” an excellent view of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] is afforded, while the tenants of the boxes are screened from the view of [[The gods (theatrical)|the god]]s – an important consideration in a town where gallery criticism is often extended unceremoniously to the well-dressed class of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/history/illustratedlondonnews/cork-relatedexcerptsfromtheillustratedlondonnews/1866-1885/cork_theatre_royal_p560_1867.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Theorica''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{lang|grc|Θεωρικά}}''') (also '''Theoric Fund''' and '''Festival Fund''') was in [[ancient Athens]] the name for the fund of monies expended on festivals, sacrifices, and public entertainments of various kinds; and also monies distributed among the people in the shape of largesses from the state.&lt;ref name="DGRA"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Kennedy  | first = Charles Rann  | author-link = Charles Rann Kennedy  | contribution = Theorica  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]  | volume =   | pages = 1126–1127  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1133.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There were, according to [[Xenophon]], more festivals at Athens than in all the rest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''De Rep. Ath.'' iii. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides those open to the whole body of the people, there were many confined to the members of each tribe, [[deme]], and house.  These last were provided for out of the private funds of the community who celebrated them.  At the most important of the public festivals, there were not only [[sacrifice]]s, but [[procession]]s, theatrical exhibitions, gymnastic contests, and games, celebrated with great splendor and at a great expense.

Theorika was created or reinstated&lt;ref&gt;Some ancient sources cite [[Pericles]] as the founder of the theorika (Plutarch’s Pericles 9.1 and Plato’s Gorgias 515E); [[Agyrrhius|Agyrrhios]], an Athenian demagogue, is also mentioned as the first to have initiated this public largesse by Aristotle in ''Athenian Constitution'' 41.3.  See also Buchanan, James ''Theorika''.  New York 1962 (p. 29-53).&lt;/ref&gt; around 350 BCE, after the [[Social War (357-355 BC)|Social War (357-5 BCE)]],&lt;ref&gt;Justin (6.9.1) dates the establishment of the theorika sometime at the end or after the battle of Mantinea in 362 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Athenian statesman [[Eubulus (statesman)|Eubulus]], an administrator to the theorikon treasury sometime after 354/3 until Cephisophon of Aphidna replaced him in 343/2, and Diophantus.  The Social War had plunged Athens into serious military and financial difficulties, thus creating an incentive to help the Athenian people by means of largesse.  It was established to provide enough money for poorer Athenian citizens to be able to purchase tickets for yearly festivals of public worship and theatrical productions, such as the [[Dionysia]], [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]], [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinia]] and [[Thargelia]]. A portion of the expense was defrayed by the individuals, upon whom the burden of {{lang|grc|λειτουργία}} devolved; but a considerable, and perhaps the larger, part was defrayed by the public [[treasury]].  The religious embassies to [[Delos]] and other places, and especially those to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympian]], [[Nemean Games|Nemean]], [[Isthmian Games|Isthmian]], and [[Pythian Games]], drew largely upon public funds, though a part of the cost fell upon the wealthier citizens who conducted them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Antiquitates juris publici Graecorum'' p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of money contributed to this treasury varied between “15 [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm talents] or less and not much under 100 talents”.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. ''The Athenian Boule''. Oxford 1972: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an epitome (Dem. 1 hyp. 5) of [[Demosthenes]]’ [[Olynthiacs|''First Olynthiac'']], a scholar named [[Libanius]]&lt;ref&gt;Libanius’ explanation is accepted by some, but the information he provides is often questioned.  Edward M. Harris raises sound arguments for doubt in his book ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens'' (New York 2006):  “The road to historical error is often paved with good intentions.  Certainly no one had better intentions than the scholar Libanius…” (p. 121).&lt;/ref&gt;  explains that in Athens there were no stone seats (only wooden benches) at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]], and also originally no charge for admissions into the festival.  Due to the lack of seating available, fights would break out as everyone rushed to find a bench; the leaders of the community decided to charge an admissions fee of two [[Obolus|obols]] to prevent further violence.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"&gt;Blake, W. E. “New Literary Fragments on Demosthenes” Trans Proc Am Philol Assoc 57 (1926) p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was paid to the [[lessee]] of the theater (called {{lang|grc|Θεατρώνης}}, {{lang|grc|Θεατροπώλης}}, or {{lang|grc|ἀρχιτέκτων}}) who undertook to keep it in good repair, and constantly ready for use, on condition of being allowed to receive the profits.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  But because poorer citizens could not afford to pay for admittance, Athens established a fund that covered the costs of their tickets.  Each citizen was allotted one [[drachma]] to cover the ticket cost of two obols (διωβελία) on each day of the three-day Dionysia.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"/&gt;   The payments would differ depending on the fluctuations of the state treasury and how many days the festivals lasted.

This payment continued to be exacted after the stone theater was built. [[Pericles]], to relieve the poorer classes, passed a law that enabled them to receive the price of admission from the state; after which all those citizens who were too poor to pay for their places applied for the money in the public assembly, which was then frequently held in the theater.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"/&gt;

In time this donation was extended to other entertainments besides theatrical ones: the sum of two [[Obolus|obols]] being given to each citizen who attended; if the festival lasted two days, four obols; and if three, six obols ; but not beyond that. Hence all theoric largesses received the name of ''diobelia'' ({{lang|grc|διωβελία}}).  The sums thus given varied at different times, and of course depended on the state of the public treasury.  These distributions of money, like those of grain and flour, were called ''dianomai'' ({{lang|grc|διανομαί}}), or ''diadoseis'' ({{lang|grc|διαδόσεις}}).  They were often made at the [[Dionysia]], when the allies were present, and saw the surplus of their tribute distributed from the orchestra.  The appetite of the people for largesses grew by encouragement, stimulated from time to time by designing [[demagogue]]s; and in the time of [[Demosthenes]] they seem not to have been confined to the poorer classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''Philip.'' iv. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  The German classical scholar [[Philipp August Böckh]] calculated that from 25 to 30 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] were spent upon them annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens'' p. 224, 2d ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Theoric Board ==

In the earlier times there was no person, or board of persons, expressly appointed to manage the Theoric fund.  The money thus appropriated was disbursed by the ''[[Hellenotamiai]]''.  After the anarchy, the largess system having been restored by [[Agyrrhius]], a board of managers was appointed, possibly consisting of ten men, who were called by many names ({{lang|grc|ἀρχὴ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικῷ}}, {{lang|grc|οἱ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικὸν τεταγμέμοι}} or {{lang|grc|κεχειροτονημένοι}}, {{lang|grc|θεωρικὴ ἀρχὴ}} &amp;c.).  They were elected by show of hands at the period of the great [[Dionysia]], one from each tribe,  and served four-year terms.  In the time of Eubulus many other branches of the administration were placed under the control of this board; as the management of the civil expenditure, the office of the ''[[Apodektai]]'', the building of docks, [[arsenal]]s, streets, &amp;c.  This was dictated by an anxiety on the part of the people that no part of the revenue should be improperly diverted from the Theoric fund, which they thought would be prevented by increasing the powers of its managers.  But these extraordinary powers appear not to have been of long continuance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschines]], ''Against Ctesiphon'' 57, ed. Steph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], p. 170, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmuth, ''Hellen. Alt.'' vol. ii. pt. i. pp. 124—127, 1st ed&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] explains:

“''All the officials concerned with civilian administration are appointed by lot, apart from the treasurer of the army fund (ταμίας στρατιωτικόν), the men in charge of the festival fund and the curator of the water supply; these are elected, and hold office from one [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]] to the next.''”  (Ath. Const. 43.1)

As public revenue greatly increased in the Athenian state, so too did the Theoric administration; according to Demosthenes there was an increase to as much as 400 talents a year from a previous amount of 130 talents (Phil. iv 37-8).  As a result of this growth the Theoric Board began to extend itself into a powerful position over other public works, activities and boards that were supervised by the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|βουλή]] (Council of Five Hundred).  The boule had previously controlled the state revenue and the expenditures, as well as the appropriations of monies to the magistrates, with the help of the different boards: the poletai (Auctions Board) and the apodektai (Board of Receivers).&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes''. Oxford 1991: p. 253; see also Arist. ''Ath. Const.'' 47.2-48.1.&lt;/ref&gt;   When the Theoric administration rose in power and worked together with the boule, it put the administration in a position where “it must have had a fair chance of securing for itself the lion’s share of the appropriations and possibly supplementing this share by a surplus”.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. “The Theoric Fund and the graphe paranomon against Apollodorus” GBS XVII (1976): p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;   The powerful position also enabled its board members to acquire confidential knowledge, information once only shared among those in the boule, on the activities of other departments.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. “Athenian Democracy After 403 BC” CJ 75.4 (April–May,1980): p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;   This weakened the monopoly of the boule and, as a result, the Theoric officials were able to gain supreme financial insight and replace the boule as the main resource of finances.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes ''Ath. Boule'' p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;   Men seeking popularity in Athens recognized this growth of power and influence as a source of great opportunity, and eventually the Theoric Board eclipsed and absorbed all other financial offices.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 282.&lt;/ref&gt;   Utilizing this power, the Theoric Board proceeded to oversee the leasing of mines, the financing of expensive public works, such as roads and buildings, and money for the Athenian navy. [[Aeschines]] scornfully describes this new monopoly of power in his speech ''Against [[Ctesiphon (orator)|Ctesiphon]]'':

“''…they [the Theoric Board] also controlled the dockyards, had charge of the naval arsenal that was building, and were Superintendents of Streets; almost the whole administration of the state was in their hands.''” (3.25)

== Demosthenes, Philip II, and the Stratiotika ==

Before the theorika was established, the stratiotika (τὰ στρατιωτικά), or Military (Stratiotic) Fund, received any remaining surplus revenue if Athens was at war; this provided financing for military expenditures.  But immediately after the Social War, all surplus revenue was allotted to the theorika until Demosthenes fought to have it redirected back to the stratiotika in 339/8.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 105.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes was a strong proponent in the fight against the rising power of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and believed that all surplus monies should be used for military campaigns rather than for domestic public works; Eubulus, on the other hand, was very much against expensive foreign expeditions.  After the Social War Eubulus and his followers, the “peace party”, believed that the Athenian αρχή was no more, so they used the theorika to “restrain the [[Deme|demos]] from rash imperialistic adventures”&lt;ref&gt;Mader, Gottfried “Pax Duello Mixta: Demosthenes and the Rhetoric of War and Peace” CJ 101.1 (2005-6): p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  and to convince the people that peace was beneficial.  The theorika had become, in a sense, a psychological tool for this political party to repress the war mentality by exploiting the selfishness of the Athenians.  It was also a “crucial factor in the process of shaping and distorting perceptions”,&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; which might explain the denial of Philip as an immediate threat, and also why the Athenians were more thorough in their organizations of festivals than with their own military (Dem. Phil. i 35-6).  In the ''First Olynthiac'', delivered in 349 BCE, Demosthenes complains that Athens has the means to fight Philip but would rather use its money for pleasure:

“''Such are my views on the expeditionary force.  With regard to the supply of money, you have money, men of Athens; you have more than any other nation has for military purposes.  But you appropriate it yourselves, to suit your own pleasure.  Now if you will spend it on the campaign, you have no need of a further supply; if not, you have--or rather, you have no supply at all.  ‘What!’ someone will cry, ‘do you actually move to use this money for military purposes?’  Of course I do not.  Only it is my opinion that we must provide soldiers and that there must be one uniform system of pay in return for service.  Your opinion, however, is that you should, without any trouble, just appropriate the money for your festivals.  Then the only alternative is a war-tax, heavy or light, as circumstances demand.  Only money we must have, and without money nothing can be done that ought to be done.  There are other proposals before you for raising supplies; choose whichever of them you think expedient, and, while there is yet time, grapple with the problem.''” (19-20)

Meanwhile a protective law had been passed in Athens illegalizing proposals on the use of the money in the theorika, especially if the suggestions were contradictory to the purpose of the fund (merismos).  Demosthenes’ caution when approaching the topic of the theorika in the ''First Olynthiac'' proves that such a law was in existence.  Also during this time, in the face of either resisting Philip to retrieve their possessions or betraying their allies and losing them, their [[Cleruchy|cleruchies]] and the [[Thracian Chersonese]], [[Apollodorus of Acharnae]] proposed in the boule (in which he was a member in 348 BCE) that the Athenian people should decide whether the surplus should be used for the theorika or the stratiotika  (Dem. 59.4 Against [[Neaira (hetaera)|Neaera]]).  The vote was unanimous that the money should be used for the stratiotika against Philip, but, because this type of proposition was still illegal, Apollodorus found himself being indicted by Stephanos of Eroiadai, who drew up a [[graphe paranomon]] (γραφή παρανόμων) against him; he was ultimately fined one talent and his decree was made null and void.&lt;ref&gt;Trevett, Jeremy ''Apollodorus the Son of Paison''. Oxford 1992: p. 138-9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Following this vote, Eubulus threatened death to anyone who tried to put the interests of the theorika below that of the stratiotika, making the act a capital offense.  After Apollodorus’ indictment and Eubulus’ new law, Demosthenes openly suggested in his ''Third Olynthiac'', a speech delivered in 349 BCE in lieu of Philip’s hostilities against [[Olynthus]], that the state get rid of the theorika because of its hampering effect upon their current crisis.  He also asked to eliminate military exemptions for those who ran the Dionysian festivals in Athens, as it was demoralizing for the men who wished to serve their country:

“''In plain language I mean the laws for administering the Theoric Fund, and also some of the service regulations.  The former distribute the military funds as theatre-money among those who remain in the city; the latter give impunity to deserters and in consequence discourage those willing to serve.  When you have repealed these laws and made the way safe for wise counsel, then look round for someone who will propose what you all know to be salutary measures.  But until you have done this, do not expect to find a statesman who will propose measures for your benefit, only to be ruined by you for his pains.  You will never find one, especially as the only result would be that the proposer would get into trouble without improving the situation, and his fate would also make good advice more dangerous for the future.  Yes, men of Athens, and you ought to insist that those who made these laws should also repeal them.''”  (3.10-11)

The idea of demoralization is echoed by Libanius.  Instead of being paid wages&lt;ref&gt;Libanius is incorrect here; hoplites did not receive payment for their military services (Harris 121).&lt;/ref&gt; for serving in the army and enduring the dangers of warfare, Athenian citizens preferred to stay home and attend the religious festivals.  Eubulus posed an argument two years after the ''First Olynthiac'' that the Athenians had to accept peace with Philip (the [[Peace of Philocrates]], which Aeschines supported), otherwise they would have to go to the [[Pireus|Piraeus]], pay a war-tax (eisphora) to finance the fleet and transfer the money from the theorika to the stratiotika (Dem. On the False Embassy 19.291).  Eubulus had laid out the different options for the Athenians: they could accept peace with Philip or, if they chose to continue the war, they would have to support it using their own means of financing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. M. ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens''. Cambridge 2006: p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes’ goal, by criticizing the theorika, was to snap the Athenians out of their denial and mistaken beliefs so that they could recognize the “absurd contradiction between domestic priorities and external exigencies, between the comfortable illusion of peace and the growing crisis in the north.”&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the ''Fourth Philippic''&lt;ref&gt;Some modern scholars consider the Fourth Philippic to be inauthentic—otherwise it was probably delivered right after the Third Philippic in 341 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Demosthenes’ attitude towards the theorika was changing:

“''Now there is also another matter, the misrepresentation of which by unfair obloquy and in intemperate language is injuring the State, and furthermore is affording a pretext for those who are unwilling to perform any of their duties as citizens; indeed, you will find that in every case where a man has failed to do his duty, this has been given as the excuse.  I am really afraid to speak on this subject, but I will do so nevertheless; for I think I shall be able, with advantage to the State, to plead the cause both of the poor against the rich and of the property-owners against the necessitous.  If we could banish from our midst both the obloquy which some heap upon the Theoric Fund, and also the fear that the Fund will not be maintained without doing a great deal of harm, we could not perform a greater service nor one more likely to strengthen the whole body politic.''” (4.35-37)

Demosthenes’ political party, the “war party”, had always “traditionally (especially in the great days of the Empire) been interventionist externally but ‘Athens-first’ internally.”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J. J. ''Theorika''. New York 1962: p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;   Seeing that the theorika was crucial to preserving social peace in Athens ([[Demades]], in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Mor. 1011b'', referred to it as the “glue of the democracy”), he needed to appeal to both worlds as an impartial arbiter.  In the ''Fourth Philippic'' he speaks on behalf of the poor in Athens, reminding the wealthy, who criticized the theorika at its inception, that when the public revenue did not exceed 130 talents a year they remained dutiful and paid their property taxes.  With the growth of revenue reaching 400 talents a year, the wealthy no longer felt the weight of financial responsibility upon their shoulders and it was of his opinion that the poor should be able to profit from the increase as well (Phil. iv 37-9).

In 339 BCE the situation in Athens became much more alarming than in 348 when Philip had attacked Olynthus and its allies, a matter Athens (excluding Demosthenes) did not consider an immediate threat. In 339 Philip had seized [[Elateia]] in [[Phocis]], which was a closer and more serious danger to Athens.  Demosthenes did not have any trouble persuading the Assembly to allocate all the public funds to the stratiotika and Philochorus, in a fragment preserved by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (ad Ammaeus 1.11), further illustrates Demosthenes’ success:

“''The people, after listening to the letter [a letter of allegations Philip made against the Athenians] and to the exhortations of Demosthenes, who advocated war and framed the necessary resolutions, passed a resolution to demolish the column erected to record the treaty of peace and alliance with Philip, and further to man a fleet and in every other way to prosecute the war energetically.''”

== The Diminishment of the Theorika ==

The fact that Demosthenes did not face charges for breaking Eubulus’ law suggests that he was able to have the law repealed sometime around 339.  In the year 337/6 Demosthenes became the head of the theorika and donated 10,000 drachmas of his own money (Aesch. 3.24) while revenues were being funneled to the stratiotika; but his donations lasted only one year.  Upon the reinstitution of the theorika he attempted, through private gifts and a large festival, to make up for the privileges the Athenians had lost after adopting his financial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Blake p. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;   Shortly after Demosthenes’ promotion the Theoric Board was weakened by the law of Hegemon, which prohibited men from holding offices for more than four years; before this law, Theoric officials could be elected over and over again in successive terms.  Hegemon was a member of the opposition party along with Aeschines and Demades, and it is difficult to determine a political reason behind his law other than it was “an intended slap at Demosthenes”.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 72-3.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] had also become a rival for the boule’s control over finances and climbed the ladder of power until he assumed jurisdiction over the state’s treasury in 337/6 as the Controller of Finances (ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως), which the Theoric Board had previously monopolized.  He governed this seat for twelve consecutive years until 326/5 when his and Demosthenes’ rival, [[Menesaechmus|Menesaichmus]], took over the position.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its diminishment of powers, the Theoric Board existed in some way or another up until Aristotle’s ''Athenian Constitution'' (326-323 BCE).  Lycurgus was using most of the state’s income to pay for its defense, building projects, and religious festivals, which maintained some sense of the theorika’s continuation in Athens.  One of the last references to the theorika involved Demades’ notorious attempt at bribing the Athenians.  In 331 [[Agis III|King Agis III]] of Sparta persuaded Athens to join him in Sparta’s revolt against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].  The Athenians begged [[Demades]], who was then a member of the Theoric Board, to grant money to be used towards the deployment of [[trireme]]s to aid in the rebellion.  His response, as recorded in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Morals'' (Praecepta Gerendae Reipublicae 818 E-F), was:

“''You have money, for I have made provision for the Festival of the Pitchers that each of you receive a [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm half-mina]; but if you prefer to use the money for this enterprise, use your own money for the Festival.''”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 80. (His translation)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Demades’ bribery successfully kept the Athenians from taking up arms against Alexander.

[[File:George Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|George Berkeley]]
'''''Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous''''', or simply '''''Three Dialogues''''', is a 1713 book on [[metaphysics]] and [[idealism]] written by [[George Berkeley]]. Taking the form of a dialogue, the book was written as a response to the criticism Berkeley experienced after publishing ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]''.&lt;ref name="Turbayne"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Turbayne| first=C. M.| authorlink=Colin Murray Turbayne| title=Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind| journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]| volume=20| issue=1|  date=September 1959| pages=85–92| jstor=2104957| doi=10.2307/2104957}} &lt;br /&gt; Repr. in {{cite book| last1=Engle| first1=Gale| last2=Taylor| first2=Gabriele| title=Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge: Critical Studies| location=Belmont, CA| publisher=Wadsworth| year=1968| pages=24–33}} In this collection of essays, Turbayne's work comprised two papers that had been published in [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]:
* "Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind"
* C. Turbayne's reply to [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105263 S.A. Grave "A Note on Berkeley's Conception of the Mind"] ([[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]], 1962, vol. 22, No. 4).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Three important concepts discussed in the ''Three Dialogues'' are [[perception|perceptual]] relativity, the conceivability/[[master argument]]{{efn|"master argument" was coined by André Gallois&lt;ref&gt;A. Gallois, [http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6135_Gallois_on_Berkeley.djvu "Berkeley's Master Argument."] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714063318/http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6135_Gallois_on_Berkeley.djvu |date=2012-07-14 }} ''The Philosophical Review'' 83 (1974), pp. 55-69&lt;/ref&gt;}} and Berkeley's [[phenomenalism]]. Perceptual relativity argues that the same object can appear to have different characteristics (e.g. shape) depending on the observer's [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. Since objective features of objects cannot change without an inherent change in the object itself, shape must not be an objective feature.

==Background==

In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Berkeley |first=George |year=1709 |contribution= |title= An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision |edition= 2 |publisher=Jeremy Pepyat  |publication-date=1709 |publication-place=Dublin  |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1o85AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AdyOzLl2K0NEC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=12 July 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work, ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710), which, after its poor reception, he rewrote into the ''Three Dialogues'' (1713).&lt;ref name="Turbayne"/&gt;

==Hylas and Philonous==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Berkeley's views are represented by Philonous (Greek: "lover of mind"), while [[Hylas]] (Greek: "matter") embodies the Irish thinker's opponents, in particular [[John Locke]].

In The First Dialogue, Hylas expresses his disdain for [[skepticism]], adding that he has heard Philonous to have "maintained the most extravagant opinion... namely, that there is no such thing as ''material substance'' in the world."  Philonous argues that it is actually Hylas who is the skeptic and that he can prove it. Thus, a philosophical battle of wit begins.

Philonous questions Hylas systematically regarding what humans know of the world, first examining secondary qualities, such as heat, to show that such qualities do not exist outside the individual mind. He then moves on to primary qualities such as extension and shape, and likewise argues that they, too, are dependent entirely on one's [[perception]] (e.g., From a distance, a great mountain appears to be small, and the shape of a thing may change dramatically under a microscope).

Hylas's view of matter (which has its origin in the Platonic theory of forms [http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2f.htm], or abstract entities that exist outside of the sensible world){{citation needed|date=October 2013}} is systematically destroyed by Philonous (Berkeley).  The basic argument is that because matter is only known to us by its sensible qualities, it is impossible to describe or even imagine matter without these qualities.  For in the absence of sensible qualities, matter, by definition, loses its essential qualities.

Berkeley's argument goes further: sensible qualities are not inherent in matter. Rather, they are ascribed and understood by the mind.  Color, sound, temperature and even shape are qualities entirely dependent on a mind.  Indeed, without a "mind," it becomes impossible to imagine "matter."  The answer to the question, "If a tree falls in the forest and no mind is present, does it make a noise?" is answered by Berkeley's immaterialism: There is no tree.  However, God is always perceiving everything.  In other words, there is ''always'' a mind present.  A human (and thus a human mind) need not be present for the tree to make a sound, for the mind of God is always present, or so Berkeley argues.  It is this mind of God that gives sensible qualities to matter, not matter itself.

In his own time Berkeley faced opposition from many philosophers who held to the Platonic view.  These philosophers thought Berkeley vulgar because his own view seemed to confirm the views held by the lower classes.  Roughly speaking, the "common view" was that God created everything and that the things on earth were the real things.  Some philosophers did not believe in God, and believed matter on earth was but an imitation of actual matter that existed in another dimension.  Berkeley sided with the common view.

The philosophy presented is often misinterpreted.  The criticism is that Berkeley claims that we live in an illusory world, when in fact, Berkeley advocates for the acceptance of ideas as real "things."  When we refer to an object, we don't refer to a material form, but to the idea of the object that informs our senses.  Berkeley doesn't propose that ''nothing'' is real; he proposes that ''ideas themselves'' compose reality.

The important place of '''women in dance''' can be traced back to the very origins of civilization. Cave paintings, Egyptian frescos, Indian statuettes, ancient Greek and Roman art and records of court traditions in China and Japan all testify to the important role women played in ritual and religious dancing from the start. In the [[Middle Ages]], what has become known as [[ballet]] had its beginnings in Italian court festivals when women frequently played the parts of men. It was however in late 17th-century France that the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Paris Opera]] produced the first celebrated ballerinas. While women began to dominate the ballet scene in the 18th century, it was with the advent of [[Romantic ballet]] in the 19th century that they became the undisputed centre of attraction with stars playing the leading roles in the works of [[Marius Petipa]], appearing in theatres across Europe from Milan's [[La Scala]] to the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg. More recently, women have played a leading role in developing various forms of [[modern dance]] including [[flamenco]] and [[expressionist dance]].

==History==
Women have always played a predominant role in dance, as can be seen from its earliest history until the emergence of formal dances in the 15th century which developed into [[ballet]].

===Antiquity===
Cave paintings from as long ago as 6000 BC provide scenes of dancing women. Examples can be seen in the [[Grotta dell'Addaura|Addauta Cave]] near [[Palermo]] and in the [[Roca dels Moros]] in [[Catalonia]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]], women performed ritual dances for religious ceremonies such as funerals, as illustrated by frescos on the pharaohs' tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/music.htm|title=Egyptia Dance and Music|publisher=Kibbutz Reshafim|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest records of organised dance and of professional female dancers come from Egypt. Especially in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], women were organised into groups known as [[khener]], apparently being joined by men only at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raqssharqisociety.org/femaledanceancientegypt.pdf|title=Female Dance in Ancient Egypt|author=Patricia Spencer|publisher=The Raqs Shardi Society|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Indian subcontinent too, there is early evidence of dancing women, most notably a bronze statuette from [[Mohenjo-daro]] in the [[Indus Valley]] dating from around 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/prodCollections.asp?pid=44&amp;id=1&amp;lk=dp1|title=Pre-History &amp; Archaeology|publisher=National Museum, Janpath, New Delhi|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webetab.ac-bordeaux.fr/Pedagogie/EPS/spip/IMG/pdf/les_grands_courants_danse.pdf|title=Les grands courants de la danse|author=Elisabeth Gouet|publisher=Académie de Bordeaux|accessdate=2 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; While men's early participation in dancing rituals appears to have been connected to hunting and fighting, women's dance was above all related to fertility, both agricultural and human.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;

Dance in [[Ancient Crete|classical Crete]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] seems to have been influenced by the [[Dance and Dancers in Ancient Egypt|dances of Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/849211/Western-dance/22101/Dance-in-Classical-Greece#toc22102|title=Dance in classical Greece|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of ancient Greek art from the 6th and 5th centuries BC depicting dancing women.&lt;ref name=ml&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvm.qc.ca/mlandry/folklore/historiq.htm|title=La Danse au fil des âges|author=Michel Landry|publisher=CÉGEP du Vieux Montréal|accessdate=2 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virgins of [[Delos]] danced in a circle to honour [[Apollo]]&lt;ref name="Calame2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Calame|first=Claude|title=Choruses of Young Women in Ancient Greece: Their Morphology, Religious Role, and Social Functions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DhfmgSz1eR4C&amp;pg=PA35|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1525-3|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Terpsichore]] was the [[Muse]] of dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/588097/Terpsichore|title=Terpsichire|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century BC, the ''[[Greek chorus|choros]]'' became a lasting feature of Greek theatre while women known as the Dyonysiac, frequently depicted on Greek vases, dance in frensy, celebrating [[Dionysus]], the god of wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=ab82|title=History of Dance: Dance and Music|publisher=History World|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Rome, female singers and dancers performed in the annual celebrations of [[Isis]] which included mystery plays representing the resurrection of [[Osiris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/suic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;prodId=SUIC&amp;action=e&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE|title=Women in Ancient Music: Arts and Humanitites Through the Eras|author= Edward I.

The Bible contains several accounts of women dancing, in particular the celebrations led by [[Miriam]] after the [[Crossing the Red Sea|crossing of the Red Sea]] when women are said to have danced and played hand-drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/women-with-hand-drums-dancing-bible|title=Women with hand-drums, dancing: Bible|author=Carol Meyers|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=4 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[David]] had returned from slaying [[Goliath]], women came out singing and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/kjv/1_samuel/18-6.htm|title=1 Samuel 18:6|publisher=Bible Hub|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], Matthew tells the story of how [[Salome]] danced for [[Herod the Great|Herod]] in order to be given the head of John the Baptist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2014-14&amp;version=NIV|title=John the Baptist Beheaded, Matthew 14-14|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China and Japan===
In China too there is a long recorded history of women dancers since the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1046–256 BC) reaching a peak in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Chinese Aesthetic Tradition |author= Zehou Li |page=5 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |others=translated by Maija Bell Samei |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0824833077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus dances performed by women in the Zhou dynasty were known as ''xi''. The [[Chinese variety art|ancient theatrical spectacles]] called ''baixi'' probably involved dancing girls in dresses with fluttering silk sleeves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xip.fi/atd/china/the-early-history-of-chinese-theatre.html|title=The Early History of Chinese Theatre|publisher=Theatre Academy Helsinki|accessdate=6 April 2014 |isbn=978-952-9765-56-0|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texts from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771–476 BC) contain descriptions of professional dancing girls while the Nishang Yuyi dance, created by the Emperor [[Li Longji]] (685–762), stages virgin women dancing as if in a magic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeldance.co.il/toldot/articles/153|title=Dance History of China|author=Yaron Margolin|publisher=Israel Dance|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 12th-century Japan, the [[Shirabyoshi]] were famous for their dancing and poetry. One of the most famous was the court dancer [[Shizuka Gozen|Shizuka]] who appears in the Japanese literature of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immortalgeisha.com/history_01.php|title=History of the Geisha, Part One: 1100AD - 1750AD|publisher=Immortal Geisha|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], with the spread of Christianity across Europe, the church generally frowned upon dance although there was often dancing at [[folk dance|folk festivals]], particularly at the beginning of May. In France and Italy, chain and circular dances such as the ''[[Carol (music)|carole]]'', and the ''tresque'' were popular from the 4th to 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamarotte.fr/?page_id=586|title=Danses médiévales et renaissance|publisher=La Marotte|accessdate=6 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually danced in a closed circle with men and women interspersed and holding hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullally|first=Robert|title=The Carole: A Study of a Medieval Dance|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|publisher=Ashgate|year=2011|pages=41–50|isbn=978-1-4094-1248-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the lively [[saltarello]] from Naples became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries. Groups of [[courtesan]]s dressed as men performed the dance at [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s.&lt;ref name="Caroso1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caroso|first=Fabritio|title=Courtly Dance of the Renaissance: A New Translation and Edition of the Nobiltà Di Dame (1600)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBwqMyKQvM4C&amp;pg=PA43|year=1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28619-8|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of ballet==
In the 15th century, court festivities in Italy became ever more elaborate, often featuring formal dances. One of the early masters was [[Domenico da Piacenza]] (c. 1400–1470) who compiled a manual of dance: ''De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/pnd/|title=De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi|publisher=pbm.com|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, too, professional dancing began to take shape when dancers performed for [[Henry III of France]] at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] in the early 1580s. Further presentations were made for [[Louis XIII]], who frequently took the main part himself. But it was, above all, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] (1643–1715) that the foundations were laid for what became known as ballet. The king not only had the rules of dance written down but established the [[Académie Royale de Danse]] in 1661, which developed into today's [[Paris Opera Ballet]].&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; Many of the early ballets were created by the Italian-French composer [[Jean Baptiste Lully]] and the French choreographer [[Pierre Beauchamp]], often assisted by [[Molière]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/dance/history.html|title=History of Ballet|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=8 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, female parts in the early ballets were taken by young men; but, in 1681, a young woman known as [[De Lafontaine|Mademoiselle De Lafontaine]] danced in Lully's ''Le Triomphe de l'amour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/326306/La-Fontaine|title=La Fontaine
|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to be the leading ballerina in at least 18 other productions at the Paris Opera between 1681 and 1693, establishing the supreme importance of women in ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100047735|title=Mlle de Lafontaine|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lafontaine was succeeded by [[Marie-Thérèse de Subligny]] who became the first ballerina to perform in London when she appeared with [[Claude Ballon]] in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100539716|title=Marie-Thérèse Subligny|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said to be the best ballerina of her day, with beautiful eyes and a fine figure, Subligny danced at the Paris Opera from 1688 until her retirement in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://operabaroque.fr/Cadre_baroque.htm|title=Le Triomphe de l'amour|publisher=Le magazine de l'opéra baroque|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next leading dancer of the Opéra was [[Françoise Prévost]] (1680–1741), whose precision, lightness and grace contributed much to classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475670/Francoise-Prevost|title=Françoise Prévost|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She persuaded conductor [[Jean-Féry Rebel]] to compose suites specifically for ballet. His ''Caprice'', ''Boutade'', ''Les Caractères de la danse'' and ''La Terpsichore'' brought her considerable success. In particular, her personal interpretation of the steps in ''Caprice'' served as an example for other soloists while she transformed the ''Caractères'' into a sequence illustrating different types of lover, both male and female. Prévost trained two highly successful dancers, [[Marie-Anne de Cupis de Camargo|Marie Camargo]] (1710–1770) and [[Marie Sallé]] (1707–1756), who added their personal preferences to her ''Caractères'', each developing individual styles. They would take her place as [[prima ballerina]]s after she retired from the opera in 1730.&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Lynn|title=Women’s Work: Making Dance in Europe Before 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By5TNdV4dGUC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-22530-8|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greskovic2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greskovic|first=Robert|title=Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2COs6yh_LS0C&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-87910-325-5|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camargo proved to be a tremendous success, not only as a result of her dazzling footwork (especially her [[entrechat|entrechat à quatre]]), but because she introduced slightly shorter skirts and new hair styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90467/Marie-Camargo|title=Marie Camargo|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=9 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also discarded high-heeled shoes, introducing dancing slippers which facilitated the execution of the more demanding routines.&lt;ref name="Kassing2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kassing|first=Gayle|title=History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6035-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dancing demanding routines, which had previously been performed exclusively by men, Camargo further consolidated the image of the ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1700-1750.html|title=

Sallé sought more from ballet than skillful demonstrations of technique as favoured by proponents of traditional ballet. She believed music, steps, decor and costumes should all contribute to a graceful, expressive performance combining [[pantomime]] with dance in what became known as [[ballet d'action]]. As many in the Paris Opera did not share her views, she decided to move to the more liberal London. At [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], she caused a sensation in 1734 as Galatea in ''Pygmalion'', a ballet she had choreographed herself. Discarding the usual attire of a ballerina, she chose to wear a simple muslin tunic and allow her hair to fall freely over her shoulders.&lt;ref name="Garfunkel2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfunkel|first=Trudy|title=On Wings of Joy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyTwwDm3YT4C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2002|publisher=E-reads/E-rights|isbn=978-0-7592-2862-7|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she even decided to dress as a man while performing the role of Cupid but the reviews were extremely critical. As a result, she returned to Paris where she danced at the Opéra until her retirement in 1740 at the young age of 33. Thereafter, she occasionally danced for the court at [[Château de Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Brooks2007"/&gt;

During the second half of the 18th century, the dominating star of the Paris Opera was [[Marie-Madeleine Guimard]] who may not have had the technique of Sallé but was nevertheless recognized for her sensuous movements, her numerous suitors and her exotic attire. Other stars included [[Marie Allard]] (1738–1802) who joined the Paris Opera in 1756 where she was trained by [[Gaétan Vestris]], becoming not just an étoile but also his wife. Although she was rather corpulent and frequently pregnant, she was acclaimed for her impressive footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1750-1830.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1750 à 1830|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=11 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic ballet==
The most successful period for female ballet dancers was around the 1830s and 1840s when they became the great stars of [[Romantic ballet]]. The Italian-Swedish [[Marie Taglioni]] (1804–1884) not only excelled at the Paris Opera when she danced ''[[La Sylphide]]'' in 1832 but extended her fame to Saint Petersburg's [[Mariinsky Ballet]] as well as to the stages of Berlin, Milan and London until her retirement in 1847. It was she who developed ballet's [[en pointe]] (dancing on the tips of the toes) while introducing new fashions in dress and hair styling which became popular throughout Europe. The Austrian [[Fanny Elssler]] (1810–1884) gained fame and fortune by dancing the flirtatious Spanish [[cachucha]] in ''Le Diable boiteux'', performing not only in Austria, Germany, France, England and Russia but also in the United States. Nevertheless, in 1845 she refused to dance with her rivals Marie Taglioni, [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Fanny Cerrito]], and [[Lucile Grahn]] in [[Jules Perrot]]'s ''[[Pas de Quatre]]''.&lt;ref name=vam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/romantic-ballet/|title=Romantic Ballet|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=16 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1830-1848.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1830 à 1848:La danse romantique|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=16 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, the ''Pas de Quatre'' caused a sensation, bringing together the four greatest ballerinas of the day. In addition to Marie Taglioni, Italy's Grisi (1819–1899) had become famous both in Paris and Saint Petersburg for her ''[[Giselle]]'', while Cerrito from Naples had become the star of [[La Scala]] in Milan. Grahn (1819–1907), a Dane trained by Bournonville, was based in Paris but had also danced in London, Saint Petersburg and Milan before settling in Germany.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt;

Several notable Italian ballerinas emerged in the second half of the 19th century, reaching their zeniths in Russia. Italian-born [[Virginia Zucchi]] (1849–1933) first danced in Italy and Germany but her interpretations of [[Marius Petipa]]'s ballet in Russia were so successful that the Tzar insisted she should join the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] in Saint Petersburg. In the mid-1880s, she starred in ''[[Coppélia]]'', ''[[La fille mal gardée]]'' and ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'', revolutionizing ballet in Russia through the extraordinary power of her performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803133549548|title=Virginia Zucchi|publisher=Oxford Index|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierina Legnani]] (1863–1930) from Milan followed as similar path, also dancing at the Mariinsky from 1892 where she originated famous roles in Petipa's ballets including ''[[Cinderella (Fitinhof-Schell)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[Raymonda]]'', gaining the title of [[prima ballerina assoluta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100058642|title=Pierina Legnani|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlotta Brianza]] (1867–1930), also from Milan, first gained fame at [[La Scala]] with which she toured the United States.

==20th-century ballet==
New, more dynamic approaches to ballet developed from the beginning of the 20th century, the most influential being [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], promoting innovative collaborations between choreographers, composers and dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/ART309940|title=

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Ballet also began to develop in London, thanks mainly to the efforts of two women. Polish-born [[Marie Rambert]] (1888–1982) who had also gained experience with the Ballets Russes founded the [[Ballet Club]] (later the Rambert Dance Company) in 1926 introducing new choreographers such as [[Frederick Ashton]]. Even more influential, [[Ninette de Valois]] (1898–2001) spent three years with the Ballets Russes before creating London's [[Vic-Wells Ballet]] in 1931 (later becoming the Royal Ballet) where [[Alicia Markova]] (1910–2004) was the first prima ballerina, starring in ballets from the Mariinsky's classical productions. Markova left to form her own touring company in 1937. Ten years later [[Margot Fonteyn]] (1919–1991) became the company's prima ballerina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/establishment-of-british-ballet/|title=The Establishment of British Ballet|publisher=V&amp;A|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of her fame came in 1961 when she embarked on a partnership with [[Rudolf Nureyev]], first in ''[[Giselle]]'', until she retired in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nureyev.org/rudolf-nureyev-biography-margot-fonteyn/|title=Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, the perfect partnership|publisher=Rudolf Nureyev Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

As ballet developed in the United States, [[Maria Tallchief]] (1925–2013), the first major American prima ballerina, was promoted by the choreographer [[Bronislava Nijinska]] (1891–1972) when she joined the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] in New York in 1942. She danced as a soloist in [[George Balanchine]]'s arrangements for ''[[Song of Norway]]'' in 1944. As Balanchine's wife, she soon became the star of the [[New York City Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/arts/dance/maria-tallchief-brilliant-ballerina-dies-at-88.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Maria Tallchief, a Dazzling Ballerina and Muse for Balanchine, Dies at 88|author=Jack Anderson|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 April 2013|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Chase]] (1897–1986) was a co-founder of the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1939 and became its artistic director for over 40 years, overseeing the production of a wide variety of new ballets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/arts/dance-view-lucia-chase-helped-create-the-ballet-world-we-know.html|title=Dance View: Lucia Chase Helped Create the Ballet World we Know|author=Anna Kisselgoff|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 January 1986|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several outstanding American ballerinas have emerged over the years including [[Gelsey Kirkland]] (born 1952), who performed the leading role in ''[[The Firebird]]'' when she was just 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gelsey-kirkland-9365803#controversy-and-comeback&amp;awesm=~oCmUgMJASHMm00|title=Gelsey Kirkland|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=24 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suzanne Farrell]] (born 1945) who was the star of Balanchine's ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/far0bio-1|title=Suzanne Farrell Biography|publisher=Academy of Achievement|accessdate=24 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of dance==
[[File:Flamenco dancer 3467.jpg|thumb|200px|Flamenco dancer]]
Women have also contributed significantly to most other forms of dance, in particular [[flamenco]], [[modern dance]], [[expressionist dance]], [[belly dance]] and [[cabaret]] which led to [[musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/dance101/forms.asp|title=Dance Forms: An Introduction |publisher=ArtsAlive.ca|accessdate=17 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flamenco===
Flamenco music originated in the south of Spain in the 15th century, probably resulting from the influence of the Moors with possible origins in India. While many of the singers who emerged in the 18th century were men, women increasingly gained fame as dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.org/es/flamenco/evolucion-etapa-hermetica-primeros-cantaores/|title=Flamenco: Evolución. Etapa Hermética. Primeros cantaores|publisher=Andalucía.org|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest was [[Juana la Macarrona]] (1860–1947) who first performed in Seville with singer [[Silverio Franconetti]] but soon become popular not only throughout Spain but across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyoflamenco.es/index.php/aula-flamenca/artistas/baile/509-la-macarrona|title=La Macarrona|publisher=Noticias y Ocio|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lola Flores]] (1923–1995) is remembered for singing and dancing Andalusian folklore, especially flamenco, [[copla (music)|copla]] and [[chotis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andalucia.com/history/people/lolaflores.htm|title=Lola Flores|publisher=Andalucia.com|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelita Vargas]] (born 1946) is considered to be one of the greatest stars of Andalusian flamenco dancing, touring Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsaraflamenco.fr/Angelita-Vargas.html?lang=fr|title=Angelita Vargas|publisher=Apsâra Flamenco|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dance===
Led by women, various styles of [[modern dance]] began to develop towards the end of the 19th century. [[Loie Fuller]] (1862–1928) from Chicago was one of the pioneers. She employed her own natural approach to movement and improvisation, later becoming a star at the [[Folies Bergères]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsalive.ca/en/dan/meet/bios/artistDetail.asp?artistID=168|title=Loie Fuller|publisher=Dance: National Arts Centre|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Greek art, [[Isadora Duncan]] (1877–1927) from San Francisco paved the way to the modern free dance style believing it was more important to express the essence of life through movement rather than to follow the precepts of classical ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdc.edu/wolfson/academic/ArtsLetters/art_philosophy/Humanities/beginnings/beginnings_of_modern_dance.htm|title=The Beginnings of Modern Dance|publisher=Miami Dade College|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised on a farm in New Jersey, [[Ruth St. Denis]] (1879–1968) developed her own interpretations of Oriental dance as an expression of spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/stdenis_essay_hecht.pdf|title=Ruth St. Denis (1879—1968): America's Divine Dancer |publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Martha Graham]] (1894–1991) exerted considerable influence on the development of modern dance through her New York-based [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095902861|title=Martha Graham|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female figures who contributed to developments in the mid-20th century include [[Doris Humphrey]] (1895–1958) who choreographed Afro-American spirituals and [[Helen Tamiris]] (1905–1966) who played an important part in choreographing early musicals.&lt;ref name="HendersonStacey2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Lol|last2=Stacey|first2=Lee|title=Encyclopedia of Music in the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8W2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-92946-6|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/tamiris-helen|title=Helen Tamaris|author=Pauline Tish|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major choreographer of Broadway musicals was German-born [[Hanya Holm]] (1893–1992), a student of Mary Wigman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/theater/hanya-holm-is-dead-at-99-influential-choreographer.html|title=Hanya Holm Is Dead at 99; Influential Choreographer|author=Jennifer Dunning|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 November 1992|accessdate=20 April 2014|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressionist dance===
The German [[Mary Wigman]] is credited as the creator of [[expressionist dance]]. Inspired by Oriental percussion, she often stressed the macabre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatre-dance.cahss.ualr.edu/waynesweb/Expressionism/ExpressionisticDance.htm|title=Expressionistic Dance: Mary Wigman|publisher=Twentieth Century Dance|accessdate=18 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hertha Feist]] (1896–1990), also from Germany, was an expressionist dancer and choreographer. She established her own school in Berlin, combining gymnastics with nudism and dance although her ambitions were later seriously curtailed by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=fmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-kultur.de/tanz/feist2.htm|title=Feist|author=Frank-Manuel Peter|publisher=SK Stiftung Kultur|accessdate=19 February 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also an associate of Wigman, [[Gret Palucca]] (1902–1993) opened her own schools in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s but they were later closed because of her Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adk.de/de/archiv/archivbestand/darstellende-kunst/kuenstler/Gret_Palucca.htm|title=Gret Palucca|publisher=Akademie der Künste|accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her students, [[Dore Hoyer]] (1911–1967), who was also an associate of Mary Wigman, developed her own programmes before the [[Second World War]] in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. After the war she became ballet director at the [[Hamburg State Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk-kultur.de/tanz/hoyer.htm|title=Dore Hoyer (1911-1967)|publisher=SK Stiftung Kultur|accessdate=19 April 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belly dance===
While belly dancing appears to have its origins in the distant past, it was introduced to Europe and North America towards the end of the 19th century. Several of Egypt's film actresses performed belly dancing in the musicals of the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleenah.com/history.html|title=Bellydance Unveiled: A Brief History|publisher=Aleenah.com|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early stars included [[Tahia Carioca]] (1919–1999), [[Samia Gamal]] (1924–1994) and [[Nelly Mazloum]] (1929–2003).&lt;ref name="Hammond2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Andrew|title=Popular Culture in the Arab World: Arts, Politics, and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O06bOHRW7s8C&amp;pg=PA192|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-416-054-7|pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s, belly dance became increasingly popular across the United States with stars including [[Dalilah (bellydancer)]] (1936–2001), Dahlena and [[Serena Wilson|Serena]] (1933–2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellydance.org/articles/bellydance_history.html|title=Belly Dance History ~ An American Odessey: A History of Modern US Bellydance|author=Helen Waldie|publisher=IAMED|accessdate=20 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabaret===
Women started to sing and dance in the cabarets of Paris in the 1890s, emphasizing the female body by introducing seductive movements highlighting their breasts and hips. Most of them had no formal training, the exception being [[Cléo de Mérode]] (1875–1966) who left the Paris Opera to perform at the [[Folies Bergère]].&lt;ref name=be&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/nvaget/danseuse/ladanseuse/ladanseuse/1890-1914.html|title=La Danseuse: Evolution et Révolution: Les années 1890 à 1914: La Belle Epoque|publisher=Mount Holyoke|accessdate=21 April 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major choreographer was Algerian-born [[Mariquita (dancer)|Mariquita]] (1830–1922) who became ballet director at the Folies Bergère and the [[Opéra Comique]].

'''Yolande Moreau''' (born 27 February 1953) is a Belgian comedian, actress, [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]]. She has won three [[César Awards]] from four nominations.

==Life and career==
Moreau has won three [[César Awards]]: one for Best First Film (in 2005) and two for Best Actress (in 2005 and 2009). She has more awards than any other Belgian actress.

She made her cinematic debut with director [[Agnès Varda]] in two movies: Sept pièces (1984) and [[Vagabond (film)|Vagabond]] (1985). In 1989, she joined [[Jérôme Deschamps]] and [[Macha Makeieff]]'s troupe, of which she became one of the stars, especially on the TV programme, ''[[Les Deschiens]]''. She played La Levaque in [[Germinal (1993 film)|Germinal]] (1993) directed by [[Claude Berri]], a [[concierge]] in the film ''[[Amélie]]'' (2001) and Mama Chow in ''[[Micmacs (film)|Micmacs]]'' (2009) (both directed by [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]), a mime in ''[[Paris, Je T'aime]]'' (2006) and a lovesick woman in ''[[Vagabond (film)|Vagabond]]'' (1985) directed by [[Agnès Varda]]. She made her directorial debut with the movie [[When the Sea Rises]], which she co-wrote and starred in. The movie was acclaimed by critics, and Yolande Moreau won two [[César Awards]] for Best Debut and Best Actress. Moreau stars in the French horror thriller film ''[[La Meute|The Pack]]'', which premiered at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37479/the-pack-too-crazed-cannes The Pack Too Crazed for Cannes?]&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2013 film ''[[Henri (2013 film)|Henri]]'' was screened in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/readResonnances/59683.html |title=List of films in Cannes Directors' Fortnight |date=24 May 2013|accessdate=24 May 2013|work=Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 June 2017, she was the guest of honor at the [[Brussels Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/le-festival-de-bruxelles-fait-la-fete-a-yolande-moreau-59392bdbcd700225434c5103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bx1.be/news/le-brussels-film-festival-a-fait-la-fete-a-yolande-moreau/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum history=== 
The '''Yup'ik Museum''' as the '''Bethel Museum''' got its start thanks to a $5000.00 grant awarded to the City of Bethel in 1965, as part of Alaska's Purchase Centennial, celebrating 100 years of the [[Alaska Purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from Russia.&lt;ref name="yupikmuseum"/&gt; The original museum was located in a log house, made with trees cut and shipped downriver from Bethel by barge. By 1968, the Bethel Council on the Arts managed the museum. The City of Bethel took over management of the museum again, and the objects were moved into a new log cabin. On July 4, 1970, it opened and was renamed the '''Yugtarvik Regional Museum'''. The log cabin was gutted by fire in 1980, damaging both the building and collection. It was broken into several times since opening and closed periodically for lack of volunteer staff. In 1995, with the opening of the new YPCC the museum was moved to AVCP and renamed the '''Yupiit Piciryarait Museum'''.&lt;ref name="yupikmuseum"/&gt;

===Exhibition===
The museum has three galleries. Two galleries display the permanent [[Exhibit (educational)|exhibits]] of the Yup'ik (and Cup'ik) and the [[Alaskan Athabaskans]] of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in ancient and contemporary times. The third gallery is reserved for temporary exhibits that changes every 3 months that include some Native collections.&lt;ref name="heritagecenter2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yupikmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaska.org/detail/yupiit-piciryarait-cultural-center-and-museum|title=Yupiit Piciryarait Cultural Center and Museum|work=Alaska.org|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has housed numerous temporary exhibits in order to stimulate cultural education and honor the lives of generations past.&lt;ref name="cubackpack"/&gt; The museum's first exhibit is the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "Crossroads Alaska".&lt;ref name="tuzzypiciryarait"/&gt; [[Ann Fienup-Riordan]]'s ''Agayuliyararput (Our Way of Making Prayer): The Living Tradition of Yup'ik Masks'' exhibit opened in 1996 at the museum.

(AVCP) is the recognized tribal organization and non-profit [[Alaska native corporation|Alaska Native regional corporation]] and operates the gift shop&lt;ref name="heritagecenter2005"/&gt; But, the [[Calista Corporation]] is a for-profit corporation business corporation and was formed at a meeting of the AVCP in Bethel on January 3, 1972, as a direct result of [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) of 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calistacorp.com/sites/default/files/documents/shareholderhandbook.pdf|format=PDF|title=Calista Corporation : Shareholder Handbook|publisher=Calistacorp.com|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Village Council Presidents is interested in increasing the connections between this facility and the surrounding villages.&lt;ref name="heritagecenter2005"/&gt;
