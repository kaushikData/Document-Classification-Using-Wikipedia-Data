The APEX Business-IT Global Case Challenge is an annual event held in May which typically lasts for 4 or 5 days. Each year, the competition features a unique, “live” case which highlights genuine challenges that businesses face. Participating teams compete in a 24-hour deliberation to develop and present integrated solutions that use [[IT]] to address these challenges and meet business needs.&lt;ref name="SMU hosts inaugural international business-IT competition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apex.smu.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SMU-hosts-inaugural-intl-business-IT-competition.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023054924/http://apex.smu.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SMU-hosts-inaugural-intl-business-IT-competition.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2014 |title=SMU hosts inaugural international business-IT competition |last=Zhang |first=Y |publisher=The Business Times |date=4 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the competition, participants also partake in a topical workshop held by industry experts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16108">An '''abstract''' is a brief summary of a research article, [[thesis]], review, [[academic conference|conference]] [[proceedings|proceeding]], or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 117. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript, acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or [[patent application]].  Abstracting and indexing [[List of academic databases and search engines|services for various academic disciplines]] are aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject.

The terms '''précis''' or '''synopsis''' are used in some publications to refer to the same thing that other publications might call an "abstract". In [[management]] reports, an [[executive summary]] usually contains more information (and often more sensitive information) than the abstract does.

==Purpose and limitations==
Academic literature uses the abstract to succinctly communicate complex research. An abstract may act as a stand-alone entity instead of a full paper. As such, an abstract is used by many organizations as the basis for selecting research that is proposed for presentation in the form of a poster, platform/oral presentation or workshop presentation at an [[academic conference]]. Most literature database search engines index only abstracts rather than providing the entire text of the paper. Full texts of scientific papers must often be purchased because of copyright and/or publisher fees and therefore the abstract is a significant selling point for the reprint or electronic form of the full text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gliner|first1=Jeffrey A.|last2=Morgan|first2=George A.|title=Research Methods in Applied Settings: An Integrated Approach to Design and Analysis|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=978-0-8058-2992-1}}{{page number|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract can convey the main results and conclusions of a scientific article but the full text article must be consulted for details of the methodology, the full experimental results, and a critical discussion of the interpretations and conclusions.

An abstract allows one to sift through copious numbers of papers for ones in which the researcher can have more confidence that they will be relevant to his or her research. Once papers are chosen based on the abstract, they must be read carefully to be evaluated for relevance. It is generally agreed that one must not base reference citations on the abstract alone, but the content of an entire paper.

According to the results of a study published in ''[[PLOS Medicine]]'', the "exaggerated and inappropriate coverage of research findings in the news media" is ultimately related to inaccurately reporting or over-interpreting research results in many abstract conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yavchitz|first1=Amélie|last2=Boutron|first2=Isabelle|last3=Bafeta|first3=Aida|last4=Marroun|first4=Ibrahim|last5=Charles|first5=Pierre|last6=Mantz|first6=Jean|last7=Ravaud|first7=Philippe|last8=Bero|first8=Lisa A.|title=Misrepresentation of randomized controlled trials in press releases and news coverage: a cohort study|journal=[[PLOS Medicine]]|date=11 September 2012|volume=9|issue=9|pages=e1001308|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001308|pmid=22984354|pmc=3439420}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' concluded that "inconsistencies in data between abstract and body and reporting of data and other information solely in the abstract are relatively common and that a simple educational intervention directed to the author is ineffective in reducing that frequency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitkin|first1=Roy M.|last2=Branagan|first2=Mary Ann|title=Can the accuracy of abstracts be improved by providing specific instructions? A randomized controlled trial|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]|date=15 July 1998|volume=280|issue=3|pages=267|doi=10.1001/jama.280.3.267|pmid=9676677}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other "studies comparing the accuracy of information reported in a journal abstract with that reported in the text of the full publication have found claims that are inconsistent with, or missing from, the body of the full article."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopewell|first1=Sally|last2=Clarke|first2=Mike|last3=Moher|first3=David|last4=Wager|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Middleton|first5=Philippa|last6=Altman|first6=Douglas G|last7=Schulz|first7=Kenneth F|last8=von Elm|first8=Erik|title=CONSORT for reporting randomized controlled trials in journal and conference abstracts: explanation and elaboration|journal=[[PLOS Medicine]]|date=22 January 2008|volume=5|issue=1|pages=e20|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050020|pmid=18215107|pmc=2211558}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright ==
Abstracts are protected under [[copyright]] law just as any other form of written [[speech communication|speech]] is protected.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, publishers of scientific articles invariably make abstracts freely available, even when the article itself is not. For example, articles in the biomedical literature are available publicly from [[MEDLINE]] which is accessible through [[PubMed]].

==Structure==
An academic abstract typically outlines four elements relevant to the completed work:
* The research focus (i.e. statement of the problem(s)/research issue(s) addressed);
* The [[Research#Research methods|research methods]] used (experimental research, case studies, questionnaires, etc.);
* The results/findings of the research; and
* The main conclusions and recommendations
It may also contain brief references,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2608546/Journal-Paper-Submission-Guidelines |title=Journal Paper Submission Guidelines |publisher=Docstoc.com |date=2008-11-15 |accessdate=2009-04-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504015941/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2608546/Journal-Paper-Submission-Guidelines| archivedate= 4 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some publications' [[style guide|standard style]] omits references from the abstract, reserving them for the article body (which, by definition, treats the same topics but in more depth).

Abstract length varies by discipline and publisher requirements. Typical length ranges from 100 to 500 words, but very rarely more than a page and occasionally just a few words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Berry|title=Can apparent superluminal neutrino speeds be explained as a quantum weak measurement?|year=2011|volume=44|issue=49|journal=J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. |arxiv=1110.2832|bibcode=2011JPhA...44W2001B|last2=Brunner|last3=Popescu|last4=Shukla|pages=2001|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/49/492001|first2=N|first3=S|first4=P}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abstract may or may not have the section title of "abstract" explicitly listed as an antecedent to content. Abstracts are typically sectioned logically as an overview of what appears in the paper, with any of the following subheadings: Background, Introduction, [[Goal|Objective]]s, [[Scientific method|Method]]s, Results, Conclusions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Abstracts in which these subheadings are explicitly given are often called '''structured abstracts''' by publishers. In articles that follow the [[IMRAD]] pattern (especially [[original research]], but sometimes other article types), structured abstract style is the norm.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} (The "A" of abstract may be added to "IMRAD" yielding "AIMRAD".) Abstracts that comprise one paragraph (no explicit subheadings) are often called '''unstructured abstracts''' by publishers. They are often appropriate for [[review article]]s that don't follow the IMRAD pattern within their bodies.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''The hydrodynamics of dolphin drafting'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
by Daniel Weihs, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.

'''Abstract:'''

'''Background'''
Drafting in cetaceans is defined as the transfer of forces between individuals without actual physical contact between them. This behavior has long been surmised to explain how young dolphin calves keep up with their rapidly moving mothers. It has recently been observed that a significant number of calves become permanently separated from their mothers during chases by tuna vessels. A study of the hydrodynamics of drafting, initiated inmechanisms causing the separation of mothers and calves during fishing-related activities, is reported here.

'''Results'''
Quantitative results are shown for the forces and moments around a pair of unequally sized dolphin-like slender bodies. These include two major effects. First, the so-called Bernoulli suction, which stems from the fact that the local pressure drops in areas of high speed, results in an attractive force between mother and calf. Second is the displacement effect, in which the motion of the mother causes the water in front to move forwards and radially outwards, and water behind the body to move forwards to replace the animal's mass. Thus, the calf can gain a 'free ride' in the forward-moving areas. Utilizing these effects, the neonate can gain up to 90% of the thrust needed to move alongside the mother at speeds of up to 2.4 m/s. A comparison with observations of eastern spinner dolphins (''Stenella longirostris'') is presented, showing savings of up to 60% in the thrust that calves require if they are to keep up with their mothers.

'''Conclusions'''
A theoretical analysis, backed by observations of free-swimming dolphin schools, indicates that hydrodynamic interactions with mothers play an important role in enabling dolphin calves to keep up with rapidly moving adult school members.

==Abstract types==

===Informative===
The '''informative abstract,''' also known as the '''complete abstract,''' is a compendious summary of a paper's substance including its background, purpose, methodology, results, and conclusion.&lt;ref name = Finkelstein&gt;{{cite book|last = Finkelstein|first = Leo, Jr |pages = 212-214|title = Pocket Book of Technical Writing for Engineers and Scientists|date = 2007|publisher = McGraw Hill|isbn = 978-0071259255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csu-abstracts&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Abstracts |url= https://writing.colostate.edu/guides/page.cfm?pageid=1252&amp;guideid=59|publisher=[[Colorado State University]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually between 100 and 200 words, the informative abstract summarizes the paper's structure, its major topics and key points.&lt;ref name = Finkelstein/&gt; A format for scientific short reports that is similar to an informative abstract has been proposed in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hortolà, Policarp|title=An ergonomic format for short reporting in scientific journals using nested tables and the Deming's cycle|year=2008|volume=34|issue=2|journal=Journal of Information Science|doi=10.1177/0165551507082590|pages=207–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informative abstracts may be viewed as standalone documents.&lt;ref name = Finkelstein/&gt;

===Descriptive===
The '''descriptive abstract,''' also known as the '''limited abstract''' or the '''indicative abstract,''' provides a description of what the paper covers without delving into its substance.{{sfn|Finkelstein Jr|pp=211-212}} A descriptive abstract is akin to a [[table of contents]] in paragraph form.{{sfn|Finkelstein Jr|pp=211-212}}

==Graphical abstracts==
During the late 2000s, due to the influence of [[computer storage]] and retrieval systems such as the [[Internet]], some scientific publications, primarily those published by [[Elsevier]], started including [[graphics|graphical]] abstracts alongside the text abstracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graphical Abstracts|url=https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/graphical-abstract|website=[[Elsevier]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic is intended to summarize or be an exemplar for the main thrust of the article. It is not intended to be as exhaustive a summary as the text abstract, rather it is supposed to indicate the type, scope, and technical coverage of the article at a glance. The use of graphical abstracts has been generally well received by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bui|first1=Lily|title=A Glance at Graphical Abstracts|url=http://cmsw.mit.edu/glance-at-graphical-abstracts/|website=Comparative Media Studies: Writing|publisher=[[MIT]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016|date=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romans|first1=Brian|title=Are graphical abstracts a good idea?|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/02/are-graphical-abstracts-a-good-idea/|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016|date=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some journals also include [[video abstract]]s and animated abstracts made by the authors to easily explain their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Abstracts|url=http://pubs.acs.org/JACSbeta/vabstracts/index.html|website=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientific publishers currently encourage authors to supplement their articles with graphical abstracts, in the hope that such a convenient visual summary will facilitate readers with a clearer outline of papers that are of interest and will result in improved overall visibility of the respective publication. However, the validity of this assumption has not been thoroughly studied, and a recent study statistically comparing publications with or without graphical abstracts with regard to several output parameters reflecting visibility failed to demonstrate an effectiveness of graphical abstracts for attracting attention to scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pferschy-Wenzig | first1 = EM | last2 = Pferschy | first2 = U | last3 = Wang | first3 = D | last4 = Mocan | first4 = A | last5 = Atanasov | first5 = AG | date = Sep 2016 | title = Does a Graphical Abstract Bring More Visibility to Your Paper? | url = | journal = Molecules | volume =  21| issue = | page =  1247| doi = 10.3390/molecules21091247 | pmid = 27649137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstract quality assessment ==
Various methods can be used to evaluate abstract quality, e.g. rating by readers, checklists (not necessary in structured abstracts), and readability measures (such as [[Flesch Reading Ease]]).&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ufnalska|first1=Sylwia B.|last2=Hartley|first2=James|title=How can we evaluate the quality of abstracts?|journal=European Science Editing|date=August 2009|volume=35|issue=3|pages=69-71|url=http://europeanscienceediting.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eseaug2009.pdf|issn=0258-3127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{grading}}
In '''[[Denmark]]''', the [[Education in Denmark|educational system]] has historically used a number of different systems of '''[[Grade (education)|grading]]''' student performances, several of which are described below. The current grading system is the ''7-trins-skala'' (7-step-scale) which replaced the ''13-skala'' in 2006.

== Current scale ==
Starting with the academic year 2005-06, a new scale was introduced, ''7-trins-skalaen'' ("7-step-scale"; colloquially dubbed the ''12-scale''), designed to be compatible with the [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS-scale]]:

The leading 0 in 00 and 02 is used to prevent fraud with grades.

Furthermore, Undervisningsministeriet (the Ministry of Education) will adapt to a more international way of grading, by handing out a set number of grades per class. This is because in other countries, the grade A (12) is given twice as often as it is in Denmark (because of strict grading on absolute standards).

== Previous scales ==
=== 1788: Latin scale ===
The [[Latin]] scale had five steps:
*''Laudabilis præ ceteris''
*''Laudabilis''
*''Haud illaudabilis''
*''Non contemnendus''
*''0''
''0'' was an outright failing grade - there was a limitation of the number of ''non contemendus'' there could be in a passing student's examination. The highest grade, ''laudabilis præ ceteris'' was explicitly named a grade for exceptional purposes only.

=== 1805: Ørsted scale ===
The first version of the Ørsted scale had six steps:
*''Ug'' - ''udmærket godt'' - excellently good (numeral value: 8)
*''Mg'' - ''meget godt'' - very good (7)
*''G'' - ''godt'' - good (5)
*''Tg'' - ''temmelig godt'' - pretty good (1)
*''Mdl'' - ''mådeligt'' - all right (−7)
*''Slet'' - bad (−23)
A student could not pass an exam if he/she had got ''mdl'' in Danish essay or Latin or ''slet'' in Latin essay.

In 1845 the numeral values were added in order to enable the calculation of an average grade - also the ''g'' was named the minimum passing grade.

=== 1871: Extended Ørsted scale ===
In 1871 the Ørsted scale was extended with plus and minus-steps, and numeral values were added accordingly.
*''Ug'' (8)
*''Ug−'' (7⅔)
*''Mg+'' (7⅓)
*''Mg'' (7)
*''Mg−'' (6⅓)
*''G+'' (5⅔)
*''G'' (5)
*''G−'' (3⅔)
*''Tg+'' (3⅓)
*''Tg'' (1)
*''Tg−'' (−1⅔)
*''Mdl+'' (−4⅓)
*''Mdl'' (−7)
*''Mdl−'' (−12⅓)
*''Slet+'' (−17⅔)
*''Slet'' (−23)

The ''g'' was still the minimum passing grade.

=== 1903: Numeral scale ===
In 1903 the Ørsted-scale was scrapped for a numeral one, with five steps:
*''8''
*''6''
*''4''
*''2''
*''0''
''8'' and ''0'' were – like ''laudabilis præ ceteris'' – exceptional grades. You would fail if you had two or more zeroes in your exam.

=== 1911: New numeral scale ===
In 1911 another numeral scale was introduced:
*''6''
*''5''
*''4''
*''3''
*''2''
*''0''
''4'' was the minimum passing grade.

=== 1919: Extended Ørsted scale ===
In 1919 the extended Ørsted scale returned, with numerals.

=== 1943: Modified extended Ørsted scale ===
This version, introduced in 1943, changed the numerals (essentially by adding 7 to the former numbers) and removed the ''mdl−''- and ''slet+''-grades:
*''Ug'' (15)
*''Ug−'' (14⅔)
*''Mg+'' (14⅓)
*''Mg'' (14)
*''Mg−'' (13⅓)
*''G+'' (12⅔)
*''G'' (12)
*''G−'' (10⅔)
*''Tg+'' (9⅓)
*''Tg'' (8)
*''Tg−'' (5⅓)
*''Mdl+'' (2⅔)
*''Mdl'' (0)
*''Slet'' (−16)

=== 1963: 13-scale ===
The 13-scale was introduced in 1963 and used until 2006 (2007 in [[University|universities]]). The scale started out as a relative scale but has since its introduction in 1963 changed to an absolute scale at all levels of education. 
*''13'' - given for exceptionally independent and excellent performance. 
*''11'' - given for independent and excellent performance
*''10'' - given for excellent but not particularly independent performance
*''9'' - given for good performance, a little above average
*''8'' - given for average performance
*''7'' - given for mediocre performance, slightly below average
*''6'' - given for just acceptable performance
*''5'' - given for hesitant and not satisfactory performance
*''03'' - given for very hesitant, very insufficient and unsatisfactory performance
*''00'' - given for completely unacceptable performance

The gaps between '''00''' &amp; '''03''', '''03''' &amp; '''5''' and '''11''' &amp; '''13''' are there to signify a larger difference between those grades. The leading 0 in '''00''' and '''03''' is used to prevent fraud with grades. The lowest passing grade is '''6''' and '''00''', '''03''' and '''5''' are failing grades.

The highest grade '''13''' and the lowest grade '''00''' are the grades most rarely given. 

'''00''' is nearly impossible to achieve, presuming one knows even a single fact taught in that particular class. It is given for a truly incompetent performance. At exams, '''00''' is given to students attending, but who cannot answer a single question. Absentees get a "-" and aren't allowed to attend a second exam.

'''13''' is a fairly rare grade outside of exams and requires a performance way beyond the expected.
One of the reasons why the 13 scale was replaced with the 7 scale was because of the grade 13. 13s are only given to the students that have gone above and beyond the stated curriculum. To gain it you needed to know more than what was taught in class. It required truly independent study. As no other EU countries used grades above perfect understanding of the curriculum, 13 was untranslatable to other grading systems. 

In the table below, the Danish grading scale is compared with the ECTS and the U.S. academic grading scales (4.0/4.3/4.5) by [http://www.wes.org World Education Services].

The average of grades given in Danish [[Secondary education in Denmark|secondary school]]s in 2003 was 8.22.

This scale was replaced by the 7-step-scale in 2005; see [[#Current scale|above]].

The grade point average (GPA) in [[Venezuela]] ranges from 0 to 20 points, with 20 being the highest possible grade.&lt;ref name=Classbase&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/Countries/venezuela/Grading-System|website=Classbase|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decimal]] points are also sometimes used, depending on the [[academic institution]].

Venezuelan grades are easily changed into [[percentages]] by multiplying by 5. Rounding of averages is generally done to the second decimal; hence, a 13.95 is rounded up to a 14.0, whereas a 13.94 is rounded down to a 13.9. A passing grade is usually a 10 (50%), but some schools and universities may require a higher passing grade overall, or sometimes by subject.

Some [[universities]] have different grading systems, 5 or 10 point grading scale, with or without decimals.

The following table shows the system used by the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] for converting Venezuelan grades into American grades.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;{{cite web|url=https://registrar.uic.edu/uic_faculty_staff/scales/166.html|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this represents just one example, it is representative of similar scales used by other universities such as the [[University of South Florida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Academic Criteria |url=http://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/documents/venezuela-ug.pdf |publisher=University of South Florida |accessdate=19 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119201817/http://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/documents/venezuela-ug.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Colorado State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credential Guide|url=http://www.graduateschool.colostate.edu/documents/International-Credential-Guidebook.pdf?11/3/2015%205:51:46%20PM|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Accreditation Service for International Schools, Colleges and Universities''' ('''ASIC UK''') is an independent international educational standards assessment agency based in the United Kingdom. ASIC has been appointed by the [[United Kingdom Government]]'s [[Home Office]] [[UK Border Agency]]. 

== Activities ==
ASIC is one of the accreditation bodies that has been recognized since 2007 by the now superseded [[UK Border Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/nationality/guide_an.pdf|title=Guide AN|publisher=Home Office|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/12/private-colleges-sacrificed-anti-immigrant | last=Alderman | first=Geoffrey | title=Private colleges are being sacrificed to please the anti-immigrant body | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to its own website, ASIC has accredited 148 colleges and universities in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asic.org.uk/collegedirectoryUK.php|title=UK College Directory|publisher=Accreditation Service for International Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 80 worldwide, of which 15 are US-based institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asicuk.com/international-directory/|title=International Directory|publisher=Accreditation Service for International Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asicuk.com/international-directory/|title=International Directory|date=19 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 criticism ==
In 2009, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Maurice Dimmock, ASIC's director and chief officer, had been sacked in 2003 from his job at [[Northumbria University]] as director of overseas operations.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|last1=Norfolk|first1=Andrew|title=Man Given Job Of Closing Down Bogus Colleges Was Sacked By University|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article1800918.ece|accessdate=19 November 2015|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that the newspaper had "established that the Home Office received, and ignored, concerns about ASIC and Mr Dimmock before it granted the company a contract. Northumbria University wrote to the UK [[Home Office]] in May 2007 to question the role the company was about to be given in distinguishing between genuine and bogus colleges."&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; [[Universities UK]], the advocacy group for British Universities, complained to the UK Immigration Minister concerning ASIC being given an accreditation role in the UK immigration scheme. In a letter to the [[Home Affairs Committee]], Advocacy UK wrote: "There is a lack of information and transparency about (ASIC's) management, governance and financial structures. Several of the colleges that it accredits have been associated with inappropriate activities."&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; The government response to this was a statement that the 2007 decision was made on the basis of the [[Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills]]'s report that they were satisfied with the way ASIC was operating. ASIC responded to the allegations concerning its work of distinguishing between genuine colleges and those acting fraudulently had been hampered  "by the Home Office’s refusal to tell ASIC how many student visas were issued for each college it inspects."&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

In July 2009, ASIC submitted a response memorandum providing answers to the letter written by [[Diana Warwick, Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe]], Chief Executive of [[Universities UK]] in which she had expressed concerns about the government’s decision to approve the ASIC as one of the accreditation bodies within the new [[immigration]] system. In the response, ASIC provided information as to its accreditation and inspection processes and responded to charges regarding the organization's governance and finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmhaff/595/595we07.htm|title=House of Commons - Home Affairs Committee - Written Evidence|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|website=www.publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
As of 2009, ASIC was headquartered in a village near Middlesbrough and had a staff of five. Its directors were Maurice and Margaret Dimmock.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2975">The '''Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges''' ('''ACCSC''') is a private, [[non-profit organization]] in the [[United States]] that provides [[accreditation]] to [[Private school|private]] [[post-secondary education]]al institutions. It is recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]] as an independent accrediting agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html|title=Accreditation in the United States: Regional and National Institutional Accrediting Agencies |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |accessdate=February 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1965,&lt;ref name=year&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview / About|url=http://www.accsc.org/About-Us/Overview.aspx|publisher=ACCSC Website|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is based in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

The U.S. Department of Education identifies the scope of ACCSC recognition as the accreditation of private post-secondary institutions offering non-degree programs or [[associate degree|associate]], [[bachelor's degree|bachelor’s]] and master's degrees in programs that are "predominantly organized to educate students for occupational, trade and technical careers, and institutions that offer programs via distance education."&lt;ref name=depteducation&gt;{{citation |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html|title=Accreditation in the United States: Regional and National Institutional Accrediting Agencies |publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, ACCSC reported that it extended accreditation to 789 schools with a combined enrollment of more than 250,000 students.&lt;ref name=2010t&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Dr. Michale S. McComis Before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|url=http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/McComis.pdf|work=Full Committee Hearing - For-Profit Schools: The Student Recruitment Experience|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=11 June 2012|format=PDF|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's diligence was called into question when it was revealed that the [[University of Northern New Jersey]], which was accredited by the commission, never actually offered any classes. Instead, it was a front organization used by federal investigators to trap criminals engaged in student visa fraud. It is unclear how such an institution was able to meet credible accreditation standards&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/nyregion/new-jersey-university-was-fake-but-visa-fraud-arrests-are-real.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Albert White Hat''' (November 18, 1938{{snd}}June 13, 2013) was a teacher of the [[Lakota language]], and an activist for [[Brulé|Sičháŋǧu Lakȟóta]] traditional culture. He translated the Lakota language for Hollywood movies, including the 1990 movie ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', and created a modern Lakota orthography and textbook.

== Early life ==
Albert White Hat was born near [[St. Francis, South Dakota]], on the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Rosebud Reservation]] to a traditional family. "His grandfather was Chief [[Hollow Horn Bear]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/albert-white-hat-preserver-of-lakota-language-dies-at-74/2013/06/23/a05d49be-da81-11e2-9df4-895344c13c30_story.html|title=Albert White Hat, preserver of Lakota language, dies at 74|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2013-06-23|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spoke only Lakota as a child. He attended day school in [[Spring Creek, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name = "worldwisdom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert White Hat, Sr.: Life and Work| work = World Wisdom|accessdate=2013-06-21|url=http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Albert-White-Hat-Sr.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of his peers at St. Francis Jesuit Mission School, who were sent to boarding school at age five, he was not sent until age sixteen.&lt;ref name="sdmagazine"&gt;{{Cite news|issue=March/April|last=Andrews|first=John|title=Saving their Language: Speakers Try to Revive Laktoa and Dakota Before They Disappear|work=South Dakota Magazine: Celebrating Life in South Dakota|accessdate=2013-06-29|year=2009|url=http://southdakotamagazine.com/lakota-saving-their-language}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I grew up with a lot of the older people, listened to the stories. And those stories were inside of me. And I went into a boarding school system, and they killed those stories in that system. I came out of there totally ashamed of who I am, what I am. In the late sixties, I went back to the culture, on my own. I let my hair grow, I started speaking my language. And one of those times, I fasted. I did the vision quest, for five years.&lt;ref name = "thewest"&gt;{{Cite episode| publisher = PBS| number = 8 |series=The West| title=One Sky Above Us (1887-1914)| at = Segment: "This Isn't History"| accessdate = 2013-06-29| url = https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/program/episodes/eight/thisisnthistory.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Teacher of Lakota language and culture==
After graduating from St. Francis Jesuit Mission School, he held various jobs. White Hat pushed for instruction in the Lakota language in the [[Todd County, South Dakota]] school district when his children entered school in the 1960s. Lakota language was not a part of the South Dakota state curriculum at the time. Eventually he learned to create his own lesson plans, and became a Lakota language teacher himself.&lt;ref name = "sdmagazine"/&gt; He became chair of the "Committee for the Preservation of the Lakota Language" in 1982.&lt;ref name = "bostoncom"/&gt;

White Hat spent twenty-five years teaching the [[Lakota language]] at [[Sinte Gleska University]] on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, and became the head of the Sinte Gleska Lakota Studies Department."&lt;ref name="bostoncom"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Eaton, Kristie|title=Author, teacher of endangered Lakota language dies|work=Boston.com|accessdate=2013-06-21|date=2013-06-18|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/2013/06/18/author-teacher-endangered-lakota-language-dies/V494ZednQSGTOewoDKeFiK/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a teaching method that uses extensive examples from the culture of the Brule Lakota, and became known as a scholar of the language. He would teach Lakota culture to "both tribal members and non-Native Americans."&lt;ref name="bostoncom"/&gt; He has been quoted as saying, "When we teach a language to a student, we should develop in that student another heart and another mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading and Writing the Lakota Language: Albert White Hat Sr., Jael Kampfe, Vine Deloria Jr.: 9780874805727|work=Books|accessdate=2013-06-29|url=https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Writing-Lakota-Language-Albert/dp/0874805724/ref=cm_cr-mr-title/178-5162618-8522268}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assembled his notes into a book in 1999, ''Reading and Writing the Lakota Language.''&lt;ref name="ictmn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lakota Educator, Author, and Linguist Albert White Hat Walks On|work=Indian Country Today Media Network|accessdate=2013-06-21|date=2013-06-19|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/19/lakota-educator-author-and-linguist-albert-white-hat-walks-149949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013134304/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/19/lakota-educator-author-and-linguist-albert-white-hat-walks-149949|archive-date=2014-10-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the "first native Lakota speaker to publish a Lakota textbook and glossary."&lt;ref name = "bostoncom"/&gt;

She left the Dolls in February 2010, in order to pursue a solo singing and acting career, but also due to the overemphasis on the group's main singer, [[Nicole Scherzinger]].

Roberts is also well-known in the [[United Kingdom]], due to her participation in reality shows such as ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 12)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in 2012 and ''[[The Jump]]'' in 2015. She was a judge for two seasons of ''[[Dancing on Ice]]''.

==Life and career==

===1981–2002: Early life and career beginnings===
Roberts was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and attended [[Shadow Mountain High School]]. She is of [[Welsh People|Welsh]] descent. She began dancing at the age of three and singing at eight. Roberts' father was a drummer for [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]], later becoming an [[car dealer|auto dealer]] and her mother was a Pilates instructor. They both inspired her to be a part of the entertainment industry.

Roberts' hair was brunette during her teenage years, as shown in [[Aaron Carter]]'s "Oh Aaron" and "Not Too Young, Not Too Old" music videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btdH4TWz2_A |title=Aaron Carter – I'm not too old, Not too Young |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During high school summer breaks, Roberts traveled to California to study modern dance. After high school, at 19 years old, she moved permanently to Los Angeles. Roberts has appeared in television commercials and music videos such as [[Counting Crows]] "[[Accidentally in Love]]", [[Josh Groban]]'s "[[You Raise Me Up]]", [[Jane's Addiction]]'s "True Nature", [[Aaron Carter]]'s "[[Oh Aaron]]" and "[[Not Too Young, Not Too Old]]" and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s "[[Trouble (Pink song)|Trouble]]". Roberts cites [[Goldie Hawn]], [[Kate Moss]], [[Sienna Miller]] and [[Gwen Stefani]] as her main role models and inspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrucan|first=Catrin|title=Celebrity secrets: Ashley Roberts|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/fashion-beauty/398834/Celebrity-secrets-Ashley-Roberts|accessdate=May 31, 2013|newspaper=express.co.uk|date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003–10: The Pussycat Dolls===
{{main|The Pussycat Dolls}}
[[File:Pussycat Dolls performing Buttons.jpg|left|thumb|The Pussycat Dolls performing "[[Buttons (song)|Buttons]]" in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] during the Doll Domination Tour]]
Within six months of her move, Roberts auditioned for [[the Pussycat Dolls]]. At that time [[the Pussycat Dolls]] were an underground modern [[burlesque]] troupe. Following their growing popularity, [[music producer]]s [[Jimmy Iovine]] and [[Ron Fair]] became involved with the group helping them to transform into a franchise. The former dance troupe evolved into a [[Pop music]] recording group. The only troupe members who remained after the re-casting process were [[Robin Antin]] (taking on the creative, executive and managerial roles), [[Carmit Bachar]], [[Cyia Batten]], Kasey Campbell, [[Kimberly Wyatt]], [[Jessica Sutta]] and Ashley Roberts. After a few more auditions, singers [[Nicole Scherzinger]], [[Melody Thornton]] and [[Kaya Jones]] were added to the line-up. In 2004, they recorded "We Went as Far as We Felt Like Going" for the ''[[Shark Tale]]'' soundtrack and recorded the single, "[[Sway (song)|Sway]]" which is featured on the soundtrack of [[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|''Shall We Dance?'']]. Jones left the group in 2005, Batten and Campbell had left earlier.

The Pussycat Dolls were launched into mainstream recognition following the release of [[PCD (album)|''PCD'']], which contained the number-one singles "[[Don't Cha]]", [[Buttons (The Pussycat Dolls song)|"Buttons"]] and "[[Stickwitu]]". Roberts sang co-lead with Bachar and Sutta in the "[[Stickwitu]]" single B-side, "[[Santa Baby]]". Bachar's departure from the group preceded the release of their second and final studio album, ''[[Doll Domination]]'', which contains hit singles, "[[When I Grow Up (The Pussycat Dolls song)|When I Grow Up"]], "[[I Hate This Part (Pussycat Dolls song)|I Hate This Part]]" and "[[Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)]]". Roberts recorded a solo song called "Played" for the ''[[Doll Domination]]'''s deluxe edition.

On January 29, 2010, [[Jessica Sutta]] revealed to ''[[E!Online|E! Online]]'' that she had been ousted from the group, following a broken rib she sustained whilst on tour with the group, and thus confirmed her exit.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Pussycat Dolls|[53]]]&lt;/sup&gt; On February 26, [[Kimberly Wyatt]] confirmed she was also leaving the group.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Pussycat Dolls|[54]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The next day, Ashley Roberts announced her departure from the group via her website.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Pussycat Dolls|[53]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In a letter to her fans, she made the following announcement:&lt;ref name="ashleyroberts.tumblr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ashleyroberts.tumblr.com/post/416718432/letter-to-my-fans-its-time-to-answer-your-question/|title=Tumblr.com|date=February 27, 2010|publisher=Ashleyroberts.tumblr.com|accessdate=March 8, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310133953/http://ashleyroberts.tumblr.com/post/416718432/letter-to-my-fans-its-time-to-answer-your-question|archivedate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Yes, I have left the Pussycat Dolls. I love you all sooo much!!! I am so grateful to have the love and support of all of you. It was an amazing ride and I learned so much! You all mean the world to me and I'm excited to take you all on a new adventure. An adventure full of creativity, inspiration, learning, growing and lots of fun.}}
Wyatt would later go on to confirm that all of the members had left the group, including Melody Thornton.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Pussycat Dolls|[55]]]&lt;/sup&gt;Despite these changes, on May 24, a rumored third line-up would join Scherzinger.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Pussycat Dolls|[56]]]&lt;/sup&gt; However, in late 2010, Scherzinger officially left the group to pursue a solo career.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Pussycat Dolls|[57]]]&lt;/sup&gt; As a result, the original recording group line-up had officially disbanded. The group has sold 54 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]] of all time.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Pussycat Dolls|[2][3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Roberts made her film debut as Brooke in the dance/drama/romance film ''[[Make It Happen (film)|Make It Happen]]'' with actress [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] and [[Riley Smith]]. Production lasted from August 8 to September 17, 2007, and the film was directed by [[Darren Grant]] and distributed by [[The Weinstein Company]]. It premièred on August 8, 2008 in the UK to mixed but mainly positive reviews.

The attribute hierarchy method ('''AHM'''), is a cognitively based [[psychometric]] procedure developed by Jacqueline Leighton, Mark Gierl, and Steve Hunka at the Centre for Research in Applied Measurement and Evaluation (CRAME) at the [[University of Alberta]]. The AHM is one form of cognitive diagnostic assessment that aims to integrate [[cognitive psychology]] with [[educational psychology|educational measurement]] for the purposes of enhancing instruction and student learning.&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;Leighton, J. P., Gierl, M. J., &amp; Hunka, S. M. (2004). The attribute hierarchy model for cognitive assessment: A variation on Tatsuoka's rule-space approach. Journal of Educational Measurement, 41, 205–237.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''cognitive diagnostic assessment''' (CDA), is designed to measure specific knowledge states and cognitive processing skills in a given domain.  The results of a CDA yield a profile of scores with detailed information about a student’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses. This cognitive diagnostic feedback has the potential to guide instructors, parents and students in their teaching and learning processes. 

To generate a diagnostic skill profile, examinees’ test item responses are classified into a set of structured attribute patterns that are derived from components of a [[cognitive model]] of task performance.  The cognitive model contains attributes, which are defined as a description of the procedural or declarative knowledge needed by an examinee to answer a given test item correctly.&lt;ref name="Leighton" /&gt; The inter-relationships among the attributes are represented using a hierarchical structure so the ordering of the cognitive skills is specified. This model provides a framework for designing diagnostic items based on attributes, which links examinees' test performance to specific inferences about examinees' knowledge and skills.

== Differences between the AHM and the rule space method ==

The AHM differs from Tatsuoka's '''Rule Space Method''' (RSM)&lt;ref&gt;Tatsuoka, K. K. (1983). Rule space: An approach for dealing with misconceptions based on item response theory. Journal of Educational Measurement, 20, 345–354.
&lt;/ref&gt; with the assumption of dependencies among the attributes within the cognitive model. In other words, the AHM was derived from RSM by assuming that some or all skills may be represented in hierarchical order. Modeling cognitive attributes using the AHM necessitates the specification of a hierarchy outlining the dependencies among the attributes.  As such, the attribute hierarchy serves as a cognitive model of task performance designed to represent the inter-related cognitive processes required by examinees to solve test items. This assumption better reflects the characteristics of human cognition because cognitive processes usually do not work in isolation but function within a network of interrelated competencies and skills.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, D. (2001). Why development does (and does not) occur: Evidence from the domain of inductive reasoning. In J. L. McClelland &amp; R. Siegler (Eds.), Mechanisms of cognitive development: Behavioral and neural perspectives (pp. 221–249). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the RSM makes no assumptions regarding the dependencies among the attributes. This difference has led to the development of both [[Item response theory|IRT]] and non-IRT based psychometric procedures for analyzing test item responses using the AHM.
The AHM also differs from the RSM with respect to the identification of the cognitive attributes and the logic underlying the diagnostic inferences made from the statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gierl, M. J. (2007). Making diagnostic inferences about cognitive attributes using the rule-space model and attribute hierarchy method. Journal of Educational Measurement, 44, 325–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification of the cognitive attributes ==

The RSM uses a post-hoc approach to the identification of the attributes required to successfully solve each item on an existing test. In contrast, the AHM uses an a priori approach to identifying the attributes and specifying their interrelationships in a cognitive model.

== Diagnostic inferences from statistical analysis ==

The RSM using statistical pattern classification where examinees' observed response patterns are matched to pre-determined response patterns that each correspond to a particular cognitive or knowledge state.  Each state represents a set of correct and incorrect rules used to answer test items.  The focus with the RSM is identification of erroneous rules or misconceptions. The AHM, on the other hand, uses statistical pattern recognition where examinees' observed response patterns are compared to response patterns that are consistent with the attribute hierarchy.  The purpose of statistical pattern recognition is to identify the attribute combinations that the examinee is likely to possess. Hence, the AHM does not identify incorrect rules or misconceptions as in the RSM.

== Principled test design ==
The AHM uses a construct-centered approach to test development and analysis. Construct-centered emphasizes the central role of the construct in directing test development activities and analysis. The advantage of this approach is that the inferences made about student performance are firmly grounded in the construct specified. Principled test design&lt;ref&gt;Gierl, M. J., &amp; Zhou, J. (2008). Computer adaptive-attribute testing: A new approach to cognitive diagnostic assessment. To appear in the Special Issue of ''Zeitschift fur Psychologie-Journal of Psychology'', (Spring, 2008), Adaptive Models of Psychological Testing, Wim J. van der Linden (Guest Editor).&lt;/ref&gt; encompasses 3 broad stages: 
# cognitive model development
# test development
# psychometric analysis.

Cognitive model development comprises the first stage in the test design process. During this stage, the cognitive knowledge, processes, and skills are identified and organized into an attribute hierarchy or cognitive model. This stage also encompasses validation of the cognitive model prior to the test development stage.

Test development comprises the second stage in the test design process.  During this stage, items are created to measure each attribute within the cognitive model while also maintaining any dependencies modeled among the attributes.

Psychometric analysis comprises the third stage in the test design process. During this stage, the fit of the cognitive model relative to observed examinee responses is evaluated to ascertain the appropriateness of the model to explain test performance. Examinee test item responses are then analyzed and diagnostic skill profiles created highlighting examinee cognitive strengths and weaknesses.

== Cognitive model development ==

=== What is a cognitive model? ===
[[File:Pic1.ahm.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Visual Representation of the four general forms of hierarchical structures in a cognitive model]]
An AHM analysis must begin with the specification of a cognitive model of task performance.  A cognitive model in educational measurement refers to a "simplified description of human problem solving on standardized educational tasks, which helps to characterize the knowledge and skills students at different levels of learning have acquired and to facilitate the explanation and prediction of students' performance".&lt;ref&gt;Leighton, J. P., &amp; Gierl, M. J. (2007). Defining and evaluating models of cognition used in educational measurement to make inferences about examinees' thinking processes. Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice, 26, 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;  These cognitive skills, conceptualized as an attribute in the AHM framework, are specified at a small grain size in order to generate specific diagnostic inferences underlying test performance. Attributes include different procedures, skills, and/or processes that an examinee must possess to solve a test item. Then, these attributes are structured using a hierarchy so the ordering of the cognitive skills is specified.  

The cognitive model can be represented by various hierarchical structures. Generally, there are four general forms of hierarchical structures that can easily be expanded and combined to form increasingly complex networks of hierarchies where the cognitive complexity corresponds to the nature of the problem solving task. The four hierarchical forms include: a) linear, b) convergent, c) divergent, and d) unstructured.

=== How are cognitive models created and validated? ===
Theories of task performance can be used to derive cognitive models of task performance in a subject domain.  However, the availability of these theories of task performance and cognitive models in education are limited.  Therefore, other means are used to generate cognitive models.  One method is the use of a [[task analysis]] of representative test items from a subject domain.  A task analysis represents a '''hypothesized''' cognitive model of task performance, where the likely knowledge and processes used to solve the test item are specified.  A second method involves having examinees [[think aloud protocol|think aloud]] as they solve test items to identify the actual knowledge, processes, and strategies elicited by the task,.&lt;ref&gt;Ericsson, K. A. &amp; Simon, H. A. (1993). Protocol analysis: Verbal reports as data. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leighton, J.P. (2004). Avoiding misconceptions, misuse, and missed opportunities: The collection of verbal reports in educational achievement testing. Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice, 23, 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The verbal report collected as examinees talk aloud can contain the relevant knowledge, skills, and procedures used to solve the test item. These knowledge, skills, and procedures become the attributes in the cognitive model, and their temporal sequencing documented in the verbal report provides the hierarchical ordering. A cognitive model derived using a task analysis can be validated and, if required, modified using examinee verbal reports collected from think aloud studies.

=== Why is the accuracy of the cognitive model important? ===
An accurate cognitive model is crucial for two reasons.  First, a cognitive model provides the interpretative framework for linking test score interpretations to cognitive skills.  That is, the test developer is in a better position to make defensible claims about student knowledge, skills, and processes that account for test performance.  Second, a cognitive model provides a link between cognitive and learning psychology with instruction.  Based on an examinee’s observed response pattern, detailed feedback about an examinee’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses can be provided through a score report.  This diagnostic information can then be used to inform instruction tailored to the examinee, with the goals of improving or remediating specific cognitive skills.

== An example of a cognitive model ==

The following hierarchy is an example of a cognitive model task performance for the knowledge and skills in the areas of ratio, factoring, function, and substitution (called the Ratios and Algebra hierarchy).&lt;ref name="jtla.org"&gt;Gierl, M. J., Wang, C., &amp; Zhou, J. (2008). Using the attribute hierarchy method to make diagnostic inferences about examinees’ cognitive skills in algebra on the SAT. Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment, 6 (6). Retrieved 24 October 2008, from http://www.jtla.org.&lt;/ref&gt; This hierarchy is divergent and composed of nine attributes which are described below. If the cognitive model is assumed to be true, then an examinee who has mastered attribute A3 is assumed to have mastered the attributes below it, namely attributes A1 and A2. Conversely, if an examinee has mastered attribute A2, then it is expected that the examinee has mastered attribute A1 but not A3.

|-

|-

|}&lt;/center&gt;

The hierarchy contains two independent branches which share a common prerequisite – attribute A1. Aside from attribute A1, the first branch includes two additional attributes, A2 and A3, and the second branch includes a self-contained sub-hierarchy which includes attributes A4 through A9. Three independent branches compose the sub-hierarchy: attributes A4, A5, A6; attributes A4, A7, A8; and attributes A4, A9.
As a prerequisite attribute, attribute A1 includes the most '''basic arithmetic operation skills''', such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers. Attributes A2 and A3 both deal with factors. In attribute A2, the examinee needs to have '''knowledge about the property of factors'''. In attribute A3, the examinee not only requires knowledge of factoring (i.e., attribute A2), but also the '''skills of applying the rules of factoring'''. Therefore, attribute A3 is considered a more advanced attribute than A2.

The self-contained sub-hierarchy contains six attributes. Among these attributes, attribute A4 is the prerequisite for all other attributes in the sub-hierarchy. Attribute A4 has attribute A1 as a prerequisite because A4 not only represents basic skills in arithmetic operations (i.e., attribute A1), but it also involves the '''substitution of values into algebraic expressions''' which is more abstract and, therefore, more difficult than attribute A1. The first branch in the sub-hierarchy deals, mainly, with functional graph reading. For attribute A5, the examinee must be able to '''map the graph of a familiar function with its corresponding function'''. In an item that requires attribute A5 (e.g., item 4), attribute A4 is typically required because the examinee must find random points in the graph and substitute the points into the equation of the function to find a match between the graph and the function. Attribute A6, on the other hand, deals with the '''abstract properties of functions''', such as recognizing the graphical representation of the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The graphs for less familiar functions, such as a function of higher-power polynomials, may be involved. Therefore, attribute A6 is considered to be more difficult than attribute A5 and placed below attribute A5 in the sub-hierarchy. 

The second branch in the sub-hierarchy considers the skills associated with advanced substitution. Attribute A7 requires the examinee to '''substitute numbers into algebraic expressions'''. The complexity of attribute A7 relative to attribute A4 lies in the concurrent management of multiple pairs of numbers and multiple equations. Attribute A8 also represents the '''skills of advanced substitution'''. However, what makes attribute A8 more difficult than attribute A7 is that algebraic expressions, rather than numbers, need to be substituted into another algebraic expression.
The last branch in the sub-hierarchy contains only one additional attribute, A9, related to '''skills associated with rule understanding and application'''. It is the rule, rather than the numeric value or the algebraic expression that needs to be substituted in the item to reach a solution.

== Cognitive model representation ==
The Ratio and Algebra attribute hierarchy can also be expressed in matrix form. To begin, the direct relationship among the attributes is specified by a binary '''adjacency matrix''' (A) of order ''(k,k)'', where ''k'' is the number of attributes, such that each element in the A matrix represents the absence (i.e., 0) or presence (i.e., 1) of a direct connection between two attributes.  The A matrix for the Ratio and Algebra hierarchy presented is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Each row and column the A matrix represents one attribute; the first row and column represents attribute A1 and the last row and column represents attribute A9.  The presence of a 1 in a particular row denotes a direct connection between that attribute and the attribute corresponding to the column position.   For example, attribute A1 is directly connected to attribute A2 because of the presence of a 1 in the first row (i.e. attribute A1) and the second column (i.e., attribute A2).  The positions of 0 in row 1 indicate that A1 is neither directly connected to itself nor to attributes A3 and A5 to A9.

The direct and indirect relationships among attributes are specified by the binary '''reachability matrix''' (R) of order ''(k,k)'', where ''k'' is the number of attributes.  To obtain the R matrix from the A matrix, [[boolean logic|Boolean addition and multiplication]] operations are performed on the adjacency matrix, meaning &lt;math&gt; R=(A+I)^n &lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' is the integer required to reach invariance, &lt;math&gt;n = 1,2,\cdots ,m&lt;/math&gt;, and ''I'' is the identity matrix.  The R matrix for the Ratio and Algebra hierarchy is shown next.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Similar to the A matrix, each row and column in the matrix represents one attribute; the first row and column represents attribute A1 and the last row and column represents attribute A9.  The first attribute is either directly or indirectly connected to all attributes A1 to A9.  This is represented by the presence of 1's in all columns of row 1 (i.e., representing attribute A1).  In the R matrix, an attribute is considered related to itself resulting in 1's along the main diagonal.  Referring back to the hierarchy, it is shown that attribute A1 is directly connected to attribute A2 and indirectly to A3 through its connection with A2. Attribute A1 is indirectly connected to attributes A5 to A9 through its connection with A4.

The potential pool of items is represented by the '''incidence matrix''' (Q) matrix of order (''k, p''), where ''k'' is the number of attributes and ''p'' is number of potential items.  This pool of items represents all combinations of the attributes when the attributes are independent of each other.  However, this pool of items can be reduced to form the '''reduced incidence matrix''' (Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), by imposing the constraints of the attribute hierarchy as defined by the R matrix.  The Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix represents items that capture the dependencies among the attributes defined in the attribute hierarchy.  The Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix is formed using Boolean inclusion by determining which columns of the R matrix are logically included in each column of the Q matrix.  The Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix is of order (''k,) ''where ''k'' is the number of attributes and ''i ''is the reduced number of items resulting from the constraints in the hierarchy.  For the Ratio and Algebra hierarchy, the Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix is shown next.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix serves an important test item development blueprint where items can be created to measure each specific combination of attributes.  In this way, each component of the cognitive model can be evaluated systematically.  In this example, a minimum of 9 items are required to measure all the attribute combinations specified in the Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix.

The expected examinee response patterns can now be generated using the Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix.  An expected examinee is conceptualized as a hypothetical examinee who correctly answers items that require cognitive attributes that the examinee has mastered.  The '''expected response matrix''' (E) is created, using Boolean inclusion, by comparing each row of the attribute pattern matrix (which is the transpose of the Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix) to the columns of the Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix.  The expected response matrix is of order (''j,i''), where ''j'' is the number of examinees and i is the reduced number of items resulting from the constraints imposed by the hierarchy.  The E matrix for the Ratio and Algebra hierarchy is shown below.

If the cognitive model is true, then 58 unique item response patterns should be produced by examinees who write these cognitively-based items.  A row of 0s is usually added to the E matrix which represents an examinee who has not mastered any attributes.  To summarize, if the attribute pattern of the examinee contains the attributes required by the item, then the examinee is expected to answer the item correctly.  However, if the examinee's attribute pattern is missing one or more of the cognitive attributes required by the item, the examinee is not expected to answer the item correctly.

== Test development ==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

== Role of the cognitive model in item development ==
The cognitive model in the form of an attribute hierarchy has direct implications for item development. Items that measure each attribute must maintain the hierarchical ordering of the attributes as specified by the cognitive model while also measuring increasingly complex cognitive processes. These item types may be in either [[multiple choice]] or [[free response|constructed response]] format. To date, the AHM has been used with items that are scored dichotomously where 1 corresponds to a correct answer and 0 corresponds to an incorrect answer. Therefore, a student's test performance can be summarized by a vector of correct and incorrect responses in the form of 1's and 0's. This vector then serves as the input for the psychometric analysis where the examinee's attribute mastery is estimated.

=== Approach to item development ===
The attributes in the cognitive model are specified at a fine grain size in order to yield a detailed cognitive skill profile about the examinee's test performance. This necessitates many items that must be created to measure each attribute in the hierarchy. For computer-based tests, automated item generation (AIG) is a promising method for generating multiple items "on the fly" that have similar form and psychometric properties using a common template.&lt;ref&gt;Bejar, I. I., Lawless, R. R., Morley, M. E., Wagner, M. E., Bennett, R. E., &amp; Revuelta, J. (2003). A feasibility study of on-the-fly item generation in adaptive testing. Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment, 2 (3). Retrieved 24 October 2008, from http://www.jtla.org.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example of items aligned to the attributes in a hierarchy&lt;ref name="jtla.org"/&gt;==
Referring back to the pictorial representation of Ratio and Algebra hierarchy, an item can be constructed to measure the skills described in each of the attributes.  For example, attribute A1 includes the most '''basic arithmetic operation skills''', such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers. An item that measures this skill could be the following: examinees are presented with the algebraic expression &lt;math&gt;4(t + u) + 3 = 19&lt;/math&gt;, and asked to solve for (t + u). For this item, examinees need to subtract 3 from 19 and then divide 16 by 4. 

Attribute A2 represents '''knowledge about the property of factors'''. An example of an item that measures this attribute is "If (p + 1)(t – 3) = 0 and ''p'' is positive, what is the value of t?” The examinee must know the property that the value of at least one factor must be zero if the product of multiple factors is zero. Once this property is recognized, the examinee would be able to recognize that because p is positive, (t – 3) must be zero to make the value of the whole expression zero, which would finally yield the value of 3 for t. To answer this item correctly, the examinee should have mastered both attributes A1 and A2.

Attribute A3 represents not only knowledge of factoring (i.e., attribute A2), but also the '''skills of applying the rules of factoring'''. An example of an item that measures this attribute is 
“&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } \frac{x+y}{a-b} = \frac{2}{3} \mbox{ , then } \frac{9x+9y}{10a-10b} = ? &lt;/math&gt;”. Only after the examinee factors the second expression into the product of the first expression would the calculation of the value of the second expression be apparent. To answer this item correctly, the examinee should have mastered attributes A1, A2, and A3.

== Psychometric analysis ==
During this stage, statistical pattern recognition is used to identify the attribute combinations that the examinee is likely to possess based on the observed examinee response relative to the expected response patterns derived from the cognitive model.

== Evaluating model-data fit ==
Prior to any further analysis, the cognitive model specified must accurately reflect the cognitive attributes used by the examinees.  It is expected that there will be discrepancies, or slips, between observed response patterns generated by a large group of examinees and the expected response patterns.  The fit of the cognitive model relative to the observed response patterns obtained from examinees can be evaluated using the Hierarchical Consistency Index.&lt;ref name="jtla.org"/&gt;  The ''HCI'' evaluates the degree to which the observed response patterns are consistent with the attribute hierarchy.  The ''HCI'' for examinee ''i'' is given by:

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; HCI_i = 1 - \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J\sum_{g\in s_j} X_{i_j}(1-X_{i_g})}{N_{c_i}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ''J'' is the total number of items, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is examinee ''i'' ‘s score (i.e., 1 or 0) to item j, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; includes items that require the subset of attributes of item ''j'', and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of comparisons for correctly answered items by examinee ''i''.  

The values of the HCI range from −1 to +1.  Values closer to 1 indicate a good fit between the observed response pattern and the expected examinee response patterns generated from the hierarchy.  Conversely, low HCI values indicate a large discrepancy between the observed examinee response patterns and the expected examinee response patterns generated from the hierarchy.  HCI values above 0.70 indicate good model-data fit.

=== Why is model-data fit important? ===
Obtaining good model-data fit provides additional evidence to validate the specified attribute hierarchy, which is required before proceeding with determination of an examinee’s attribute mastery.  If the data is not shown to fit the model, then various reasons may account for the large number of discrepancies including: a misspecification of the attributes, incorrect ordering of attributes within the hierarchy, items not measuring the specified attributes, and/or the model is not reflective of the cognitive processes used by a given sample of examinees.  Therefore, the cognitive model should be correctly defined and closely aligned with the observed response patterns in order to provide a substantive framework for making inferلبلبences about a specific group of examinees’ knowledge and skills.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, D.E., Hinton, G.E., &amp; Williams, R.J. (1986b). Parallel distributed processing (Vol. 1). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estimating attribute probabilities ===
Once we establish that the model fits the data, the attribute probabilities can be calculated.  The use of attribute probabilities is important in the psychometric analyses of the AHM because these probabilities provide examinees with specific information about their attribute-level performance as part of the diagnostic reporting process.  To estimate the probability that examinees possess specific attributes, given their observed item response pattern, an artificial [[neural network]] approach is used.

=== Brief description of a neural network ===
The neural network is a type of parallel-processing architecture that transforms any stimulus received by the input unit (i.e., stimulus units) to a signal for the output unit (i.e., response units) through a series of mid-level hidden units.  Each unit in the input layer is connected to each unit in the hidden layer and, in turn, to each unit in the output layer. 

Generally speaking, a neural network requires the following steps.  To begin, each cell of the input layer receives a value (0 or 1) corresponding to the response values in the exemplar vector.  Each input cell then passes the value it receives to every hidden cell.  Each hidden cell forms a linearly weighted sum of its input and transforms the sum using the [[logistic function]] and passes the result to every output cell.  Each output cell, in turn, forms a linearly weighted sum of its inputs from the hidden cells and transforms it using the logistic function, and outputs the result. Because the result is scaled using the logistic transformation, the output values range from 0 to 1.  The result can be interpreted as the probability the correct or target value for each output will have a value of 1.

The output targets in the response units (i.e., the examinee attributes) are compared to the pattern associated with each stimulus input or exemplar (i.e., the expected response patterns).  The solution produced initially with the stimulus and association connection weights is likely to be discrepant resulting in a relatively large error.  However, this discrepant result can be used to modify the connection weights thereby leading to a more accurate solution and a smaller error term.  One popular approach for approximating the weights so the error term is minimized is with a learning algorithm called the generalized delta rule that is incorporated in a training procedure called '''back propagation of error'''.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, D.E., Hinton, G.E., &amp; Williams, R.J. (1986a). Learning representations by back-propagating errors. Nature, 323, 533–536&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specification of the neural network ===
Calculation of attribute probabilities begins by presenting the neural network with both the generated expected examinee response patterns from Stage 1, with their associated attribute patterns which is derived from the cognitive model (i.e., the transpose of the Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; matrix), until the network learns each association.  The result is a set of weight matrices that will be used to calculate the probability that an examinee has mastered a particular cognitive attribute based on their observed response pattern.&lt;ref name="jtla.org"/&gt; An attribute probability close to 1 would indicate that the examinee has likely mastered the cognitive attribute, whereas a probability close to 0 would indicate that the examinee has likely not mastered the cognitive attribute.

== Reporting the results ==
[[File:Pic5.ahm.JPG|thumb|300px|A Sample Diagnostic Score Report for an Examinee Who Mastered Attributes A1, A4, A5, and A6]]

=== The importance of the reporting process ===
Score reporting serves a critical function as the interface between the test developer and a diverse audience of test users. A score report must include detailed information, which is often technical in nature, about the meanings and possible interpretations of results that users can make. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing&lt;ref&gt;American Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association, National Council on Measurement in Education. (1999). Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. Washington, D.C.: AERA.&lt;/ref&gt; clearly define the role of test developers in the reporting process. Standard 5.10 states:
When test score information is released to students, parents, legal representatives, teachers, clients, or the media, those responsible for testing programs should provide appropriate interpretations. The interpretations should describe in simple language what the test covers, what the scores mean, and how the scores will be used.

=== Reporting cognitive diagnostic results using the AHM ===
A key advantage of the AHM is that it supports individualized diagnostic score reporting using the attribute probability results. The score reports produced by the AHM have not only a total score but also detailed information about what cognitive attributes were measured by the test and the degree to which the examinees have mastered these cognitive attributes. This diagnostic information is directly linked to the attribute descriptions, individualized for each student, and easily presented. Hence, these reports provide specific diagnostic feedback which may direct instructional decisions. To demonstrate how the AHM can be used to report test scores and provide diagnostic feedback, a sample report is presented next.&lt;ref name="jtla.org"/&gt;
In the example to the right, the examinee mastered attributes A1 and A4 to A6. Three performance levels were selected for reporting attribute mastery: non-mastery (attribute probability value between 0.00 and 0.35), partial mastery (attribute probability value between 0.36 and 0.70), and mastery (attribute probability value between 0.71 and 1.00). The results in the score report reveal that the examinee has clearly mastered four attributes, A1 (basic arithmetic operations), A4 (skills required for substituting values into algebraic expressions), A5 (the skills of mapping a graph of a familiar function with its corresponding function), and A6 (abstract properties of functions). The examinee has not mastered the skills associated with the remaining five attributes.

== Implications of AHM for cognitive diagnostic assessment ==

=== Integration of assessment, instruction, and learning ===
[[File:Pic6.ahm.JPG|thumb|300px|Effects of the results of a Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment]]
The rise in popularity of cognitive diagnostic assessments can be traced to two sources: assessment developers and assessment users.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, K., &amp; Goodman, D. P. (2007). The demand for cognitive diagnostic assessment. In J. P. Leighton &amp; M. J. Gierl (Eds.), Cognitive diagnostic assessment for education: Theory and applications (pp. 19–60). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment developers see great potential for cognitive diagnostic assessments to inform teaching and learning by changing the way current assessments are designed.  Assessment developers also argue that to maximize the educational benefits from assessments, curriculum, instruction, and [[Educational assessment|assessment design]] should be aligned and integrated. 

Assessment users, including teachers and other educational stakeholders, are increasingly demanding relevant results from educational assessments. This requires assessments to be aligned with classroom practice to be of maximum instructional value.

The AHM to date, as a form of cognitive diagnostic assessment, addresses the path between curriculum and assessment design by identifying the knowledge, skills, and processes actually used by examinees to solve problems in a given domain. These cognitive attributes organized into a cognitive model becomes not only representation of the construct of interest, but also the cognitive test blueprint. Items can then be constructed to systematically measure each attribute combination within the cognitive model. 

The path between assessment design and instruction is also addressed by providing specific, detailed feedback about an examinee's performance in terms of the cognitive attributes mastered. This cognitive diagnostic feedback is provided to students and teachers in the form of a score report. The skills mastery profile, along with adjunct information such as exemplar test items, can be used by the teacher to focus instructional efforts in areas where the student is requiring additional assistance. Assessment results can also provide feedback to the teacher on the effectiveness of instruction for promoting the learning objectives.

The AHM is a promising method for cognitive diagnostic assessment. Using a principled test design approach, integrating cognition into test development, can promote stronger inferences about how students actually think and solve problems. With this knowledge, students can be provided with additional information that can guide their learning, leading to improved performance on future educational assessments and problem solving tasks.

==== Grading ====
The pass grades for BGCSE are, from highest to lowest, A*, A, B, C, D, E, F, G and U. The process to decide these grades involves the uniform mark scheme (UMS). Achieving less than 29% results in a U (unclassified). The maximum points a student can get is 48 points by six subjects. The table below shows the general grading system which is used when grading students in senior secondary which may be changed by BEC due to standardization.

Five is usually the minimum number of credits required for university entrance, with some universities specifying the need for six subjects that are all C+. There is no limit set on the number of subjects one can study, and a number of students take 9 or more subjects.

==== Subjects offered ====
A wide variety of subjects are offered at O-level by the Botswana Examinations Council. This table shows the majority of subjects which are consistently available for study.

A '''chemical garden''' is an experiment in [[chemistry]] usually performed by adding [[metal]] salts such as [[copper sulfate]] or [[cobalt(II) chloride]] to an aqueous solution of [[sodium silicate]] (otherwise known as waterglass). This results in growth of plant-like forms in minutes to hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1013931116107 | year = 2002 | author = Balköse, D. | journal = [[Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology]] | volume = 23 | pages = 253 | last2 = Özkan | first2 = F. | last3 = Köktürk | first3 = U. | last4 = Ulutan | first4 = S. | last5 = Ülkü | first5 = S. | last6 = Nişli | first6 = G. | issue = 3 |title = Characterization of Hollow Chemical Garden Fibers from Metal Salts and Water Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical garden was first observed and described by [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]] in 1646.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DxBKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | first = Johann Rudolf | last = Glauber | title = Furni Novi Philosophici | location = Amsterdam | publisher = Johan Jansson | year = 1646 | edition = German-language 1661 | chapter = LXXXV. Wie man in diesem Liquore von allen Metallen in wenig Stunden Bäume mit Farben soll wachsen machen. (How one shall make grow—in this solution, from all metals, in a few hours—trees with color) | pp = 186–189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its original form, the chemical garden involved the introduction of [[ferrous chloride]] (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) crystals into a solution of [[potassium silicate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Process ==

The chemical garden relies on most [[transition metal]] silicates being insoluble in water and coloured.

A metal salt such as [[Cobalt(II) chloride|cobalt chloride]] will start to dissolve in the water. It will then form insoluble cobalt silicate by a double decomposition reaction ([[Metathesis reaction|anion metathesis]]). This cobalt silicate is a [[semipermeable]] [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]]. Because the [[ionic strength]] of the cobalt solution inside the membrane is higher than the sodium silicate solution which forms the bulk of the tank contents, [[osmotic]] effects will increase the pressure within the membrane. This will cause the membrane to tear, forming a hole. The cobalt cations will react with the silicate anions at this tear so forming new solid. In this way growths will form in the tanks; these will be coloured (according to the metal) and may look like plants. The [[crystal]]s formed from this experiment will grow upwards, since the pressure at the bottom of the tank is higher than the pressure closer to the top of the tank, therefore forcing the crystals to grow upwards.

The upward direction of growth depends on the density of the fluid inside the semi-permeable membrane being lower than that of the surrounding waterglass solution. If one uses a very dense fluid inside the membrane, the growth is downward. For example, a fresh, green solution of trivalent chromium sulfate or chloride refuses to crystallise without slowly changing into the violet form, even if boiled till it concentrates into a tarry mass. That tar, if suspended in the waterglass solution, forms downward twig-like growths because all the fluid inside the membrane is too dense to float and thereby to exert upward pressure. The concentration of sodium silicate becomes important in growth rate.

After the growth has ceased sodium silicate solution can be removed by continuous addition of water at a very slow rate. This will prolong the life of garden. In one specific experimental variation a single tube can be obtained &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaab | first1 = F. | last2 = Kellermeier | first2 = M. | last3 = Kunz | first3 = W. | last4 = Morallon | first4 = E. | last5 = García-Ruiz | first5 = J.

== Common salts used ==

Common salts used in a chemical garden include:

* [[Alum|Aluminium potassium sulfate]]: White
* [[Copper(II) sulfate]]:  Blue
* [[Chromium(III) chloride]]: Green
* [[Nickel(II) sulfate]]: Green
* [[Iron(II) sulfate]]: Green
* [[Iron(III) chloride]]: Orange
* [[Cobalt(II) chloride]]: Purple
* [[Calcium chloride]]: White
* [[Zinc sulfate]]: White

== Practical uses ==

While at first the chemical garden may appear to be primarily a toy, some serious work has been done on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Julyan H. E. Cartwright, Juan Manuel García-Ruiz, María Luisa Novella, and Fermín Otálora, ''J. Colloid Interface Sci''. 2002, '''256''', 351–359. {{cite web |url=http://laue.lec.csic.es/~julyan/papers/Silica_gardens/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311000944/http://laue.lec.csic.es/~julyan/papers/Silica_gardens/ |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance this chemistry is related to the setting of [[Portland cement]], [[hydrothermal vent]]s and during the [[corrosion]] of steel surfaces tubes can be formed. A chemical garden helps one to understand the nature of that chemical substance.

The nature of the growth also is useful in understanding classes of related behavior seen in fluids separated by membranes. In various ways it resembles the growth of spikes or blobs of ice extruded above the freezing surface of still water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.ilstu.edu/~jrcarter/ice/diurnal/|title=Ice Formations Diurnal Freeze-Thaw Cycles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the patterns of growth of gum drying as it drips from wounds in trees such as [[Eucalyptus]] sap, and the way molten wax forms twig-like growths, either dripping from a candle, or floating up through cool water.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''David Matthias Lloyd-Jones''' (born 19 November 1934) is a British conductor who has specialised in British and Russian music.  He is also an editor and translator, especially of Russian operas.

== Biography ==
Lloyd-Jones was born in London.  Before [[World War II]], his family was evacuated and moved to West Wales to live on a farm.  There he had no contact with classical music until the age of nine, when he studied [[Mozart]] in school.  On his 10th birthday, his father took him to his first orchestral concert, at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]].  He quickly developed a love of British music, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and also of Russian music.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Colin. [http://www.naxos.com/news/default.asp?pn=News&amp;displayMenu=Interviews&amp;op=16 "Insights and Ideas from Conductor David Lloyd-Jones",] ''Fanfare Magazine'', January/February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].  

===Early career and Sadlers Wells===
Lloyd-Jones began his career in 1959 as a [[répétiteur]] at the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden.  He made his professional conducting debut in 1961 with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]].  He conducted the [[New Opera Company]] from 1961 to 1964.  He continued to build his reputation as a freelance conductor for orchestral and choral concerts.  He also conducted for BBC broadcasts and TV studio opera productions.&lt;ref name=Bach&gt;[http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Lloyd-Jones-David.htm David Lloyd-Jones profile at BachCantatas.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 he was appointed Assistant Music Director at Sadlers Wells Opera (now [[English National Opera]]), where he conducted a wide [[repertory]] which included the first British staging of ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]'' by [[Sergei Prokofiev]].

=== Opera North ===
Lloyd-Jones founded and became the first Music Director of [[Opera North]] in 1978, forming its orchestra, the English Northern Philharmonia (now the [[Orchestra of Opera North]]), of which he became Artistic Director.  Over the course of twelve seasons, he conducted over fifty productions in Leeds and other [[Northern England]] venues.  Highlights of his career at Opera North included the first British performance of [[Ernst Krenek|Krenek]]'s ''[[Jonny spielt auf]]'' and the British stage première of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]''.  Other notable Opera North productions which he conducted included [[Frederick Delius|Delius]]'s ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]'', [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]]'s ''[[Prince Igor]]'', [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Les Troyens]]'', [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]]'s staging of ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', a double-bill coupling (as at their first performances) of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Iolanta]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' – the latter choreographed by [[Matthew Bourne]] of [[Adventures in Motion Pictures]] – and the world première of [[Wilfred Josephs]]'s ''Rebecca''.

He also conducted orchestral concerts for Opera North, including at festivals in France and Germany.&lt;ref name=Bach/&gt; He stepped down from the position of Music Director in 1990.

===Other engagements and activities===
Lloyd-Jones has conducted at the Royal Opera House, [[Welsh National Opera]] and [[Scottish Opera]] and at the Wexford, Cheltenham, Edinburgh and Leeds Festivals.  He was Music Director of the Bradford Festival Choral Society.  He has also appeared in major cities throughout Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Israel, Japan, Australia and the Americas.

In the recording studio, Lloyd-Jones has specialised in British and Russian music, often for Hyperion and Naxos.&lt;ref name=Bach/&gt; His recordings have included the first commercial recording of [[Constant Lambert]]'s ''[[Summer's Last Will and Testament (Lambert)|Summer's Last Will and Testament]]'', released in 1992 and ''[[Tiresias (ballet)|Tiresias]]'', in 1999.

As an editor, he has tackled projects including the 1984, Ernst Eulenburg (London) miniature full score—in its [[Historical_editions_(music)#Opera|critical edition]]—of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Lamb, Andrew]].  "H.M.S. Pinafore, or, The Lass That Loved a Sailor", ''Music Library Association – Notes'', Vol. 61, No. 2, December 2004, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Lloyd-Jones conducted a professional recording of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s grand opera ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' for Chandos, which was released in 2010 and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In 1986 Lloyd-Jones was granted an honorary Doctor of Music of the [[University of Leeds]], and in 2007 he was awarded honorary membership of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], where he is a member of the Council.

Schools use [[English language|English]] as the language of instruction. They have a unique curriculum until class 10 and follow the [[Tamil Nadu Board of Secondary Education|Tamil Nadu State Board]] curriculum for classes 11 and 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soo|first=Neelam|title=Management of School Education|publisher=APH Publishing Corporation|date=December 1, 2003|pages=179|isbn=81-7648-500-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools are accredited on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/05/26/stories/2004052600660300.htm|title=Permanent recognition sought for matriculation schools |date=May 26, 2004|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the academic year 2008-09, 2.31 million students were enrolled in the matriculation schools with a boy to girl ratio of 1:0.9. From 2001 to 2008, the pass percentage has been 90 and above excepting for 2002 when it dipped to 87.

The '''Doctor of Business Administration''' (commonly abbreviated as DBA, DrBA, or BusD and most recently {{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/phdba/|title=PH.DBA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=2018-07-22|dead-url=|access-date=|df=}}) is a [[research doctorate]] awarded on the basis of advanced study and [[research]] in the field of [[business administration]]. The D.B.A. is a [[terminal degree]] in business administration.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127015732/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Ph.D., it represents the highest academic qualification in business administration. Successful completion of a D.B.A. or Ph.D. in business administration is required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university [[professor]] or [[Postdoctoral researcher | postdoctoral researcher]] in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title [[Doctor (title)|doctor]], which is often represented via the [[English honorific]] "Dr." or the [[post-nominal letters]] "DBA",or "Ph.D.".

D.B.A. candidates submit a significant project, typically referred to as a [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]], consisting of a body of original academic research that is in principle worthy of publication in a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinham |first1=S. |last2=Scott |first2=C. |doi=10.1080/03098770020030498 |title=The Experience of Disseminating the Results of Doctoral Research |journal=Journal of Further and Higher Education |volume=25 |pages=45–55 |year=2001 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates must [[Thesis defense|defend]] this work before a panel of expert examiners called a thesis, dissertation, or doctoral committee.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;FAQs AACSB {{cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117024642/http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and format==
Doctor of Business Administration programs have a dual purpose: contribute to business theory and further develop the professional practice (e.g. contribute to professional knowledge in business). Universities generally require candidates to have significant experience in business, particularly in roles with leadership or other strategic responsibilities. D.B.A. candidates specialize in areas such as management science, information technology management, organizational behaviour, economics, finance and the like. As with other doctorate programs, curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. According to the European higher education standards set by the [[Bologna Process]], the normal duration of doctorate programs like the D.B.A.{{Citation needed|reason=not clear where D.B.A. are mentionned into Bologna Process|date=March 2018}} and Ph.D is 4 years of full-time study.

The responsibility for the structure of doctoral programs resides within the graduate research committees or their equivalent within the university. As such, D.B.A programs have a specific set of university regulations and are subject to quality approval processes. Regulations include references to protocols for treating ethical issues in research. These regulations are widely used in Australian Universities. For instance, a D.B.A student cannot embark on the research phase before passing all his or her coursework. Furthermore, upon passing the proposal stage, he or she must clear ethics-related issues with an Ethics Committee. The D.B.A candidate must go through numerous internal moderations of the dissertation before submitting to external examinations (usually at least two). Successful candidates usually revise their dissertations numerous times before final approval is granted from the doctoral committee.

==Relationship between D.B.A. and Ph.D==
The Doctor of Business Administration and the Ph.D in Business Administration are equivalent degrees.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt; Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the United States. As such, both D.B.A. and Ph.D programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt; Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions. The D.B.A. and Ph.D in Business Administration are terminal degrees, allowing the recipient to obtain a tenure-track position.

In some cases, as in that of Harvard University, the distinction is solely administrative (Harvard Business School is not authorized to issue Ph.Ds; only the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may do so).&lt;ref&gt;Admissions FAQs Harvard http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/faqs/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases,the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.B.A. emphasizes applied research.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="athab"&gt;http://www.mba.athabascau.ca/titanweb/au/webcms.nsf/AllDoc/B432DD075D38015987257076007C6B25?Opendocument Athabasca University: DBA vs PhD&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, graduates of Ph.D programs generally migrate to full-time faculty positions in academia, while those of D.B.A. programs re-emerge in industry as applied researchers or executives. If working full-time in industry, graduates of D.B.A. and Ph.D programs often become [[Adjunct professors in the United States| adjunct professors]] in top undergraduate and graduate degree programs.

==Geographic distribution==
D.B.A. programs are offered worldwide. The majority, however, are offered in Europe (42 percent), followed by North America (28 percent) and the Asia-Pacific region (22 percent). 6 percent of the programs are offered in Africa and 2 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

'''Economic transparency''' refers to banks and other financial institutions that have made data available about their financial position and condition. The financial [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|collapse of renowned industries]] provoked demands for greater transparency to help improve corporate governance in the [[United States]] and other industrialized countries. Some economists assert that transparency is one of the most effective methods for regulation of economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.omicsonline.org/scholarly/economic-transparency-journals-articles-ppts-list.php|title=Economic Transparency|last=|first=|date=|website=International Journal of Economics &amp; Management Sciences|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, transparency and openness can help accelerate [[reform]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in [[Developing country|developing countries]] in situations which foreign aid and other US programmatic and diplomatic efforts will have less potency and influence. It can promote responsible practices that directly and indirectly support a broad range of US policy objectives, such as (1) exposing government corruption, (2) reducing the scope for government revenues to be siphoned offshore, (3) increasing collection of domestic tax revenues, (4) increasing the accountability and effectiveness of government spending (including aid), (5) reducing dependency on foreign aid, and (6) helping to prevent money laundering and terrorist finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cgdev.org/publication/ft/promoting-development-power-economic-transparency|title=Promoting the Development Power of Economic Transparency|last=|first=|publisher=WHITE HOUSE AND THE WORLD POLICY BRIEFS|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiscal transparency is perceived to be essential for informed decision making, for guaranteeing some accountability, and for maintaining fiscal discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GAVAZZA|first=ALESSANDRO|date=2009|title=Transparency and Economic Policy|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/76-3-1023.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAbkwggG1BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGmMIIBogIBADCCAZsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM1p9cWXJlPZX1y3l0AgEQgIIBbINSVFv511-k5eSTo6ogoEmDrmwQffTSc-7RjQAr0rgVLmuA9oziH6jycvnxtEH_R1Q1JsOAmQG1d5T99vbjZD-E-pJnD0XN3rNUY5cii0at4qWp_dVgAmp1H6RLh_YbpqeJM7n9ognbvRVM3zW-5arlT3OYyo8V0GhlEdjTNOjr4ifnSwcsjh4COvqqWKiMMvoQ5voQK7GFcMT3MGlTXi1g7uI2Jo-9YF7H97s7uqAK3A-5l12FYazXpaKOijphaFg-RG5MJd3RMkHnZhqGF1Dj2b2cdS97KwfE4umlCm9DLNv3Le5omHOk6DmeKqOjcunFPmUBKsuMFgr3rnFCDevIXVMxnCOkMYwXicLWhZITjlwmsDRGnDz7WiMTHvVk0WbvufKAMV_FSgjDfi822NcYYbeZrS6RKvQFOmeJ5M9j9e4tmufK1SWSop6RCg4VaVs_Q6e5LzzjilUraUfVJ0kB8s-z31bsM6DUuz8|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgar Bodenheimer''' (March 14, 1908 – May 30, 1991) was a [[German American]] [[author]] and [[professor]] of [[law]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durham |first=W.

==Biography==
Bodenheimer was born in [[Berlin]] in 1908.  He was educated in universities of [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], [[University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], and [[University of Berlin|Berlin.]]  After receiving his [[J.U.D.]] from the University of Heidelberg in 1933, he emigrated  to the [[United States]] to escape from the [[Nazis]]. Without an American legal degree, he began working for the firm of Rosenberg, Goldmark &amp; Colin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst C. |last=Stiefel |first2=Frank |last2=Mecklenburg |title=Deutsche Juristen im amerikanischen Exil (1933–1950) |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |year=1991 |isbn=3161456882 |pages=56–57 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later got his [[LL.B.]] from the [[University of Washington]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Carol Bruch |first=Carol |last=Bruch |title=Edgar Bodenheimer 1908–1991 |journal=American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=657–659 |doi= |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His career started in 1940 as an Attorney for the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], where he worked for two years before taking on the Principal Attorney position at the Office of [[Alien Property Custodian]] in Washington D.C.

In 1945, Edgar served in the Allies' "Office of Chief of Counsel for prosecution of Axis Criminality", OCCPAC, at the [[Nuremberg Trials]],&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, Edgar: ''Jurisprudence'', flyleaf. Harvard University Press, 1970 (3rd printing).&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing his degrees in both American and German law.

He joined the law faculty of the [[University of Utah]] in 1946, and became a professor at the [[UC Davis School of Law|Law School of University of California, Davis]] in 1966. Retiring in 1975, he continued writing and lecturing at [[UC Davis]] as Professor Emeritus until his death in 1991

'''[[Education]] in [[Mauritius]]''' is managed by the Ministry of Education &amp; Human Resources, which controls the development and administration of state schools funded by government, but also has an advisory and supervisory role in respect of private schools. The [[Higher education in Mauritius|Tertiary education]] is maintained by the Ministry of Tertiary Education, Science, Research and Technology. The government of Mauritius provides [[free education]] to its citizens from pre-primary to tertiary levels. Since July 2005, the government also introduced free transport for all students.

==History==
After the country became independent in 1968, education became one of the main preoccupations of the Mauritian Government to meet the new challenges awaiting the country. Considerable investment of resources, both human and material, has been put into the Education sector and impressive progress has been achieved in terms of free, universal, compulsory primary education, free textbooks, free secondary education and a fairly wide range of higher education courses at the [[University of Mauritius]].

Education has been free through the secondary level since 1976 and through the post-secondary level since 1988. The government has made an effort to provide adequate funding for education, occasionally straining tight budgets and even subsidised a great part of the expenditure in the Private Confessional schools, that is, schools under the control of the Catholic Church. However, the pre-primary schools are still privately owned mostly.

==Overview==
The Ministry of Education and Human Resources supervises and monitors all action related to the support to be provided to education. The Mauritius Qualification Authority is the regulator of the technical and vocational education and training sector.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Mauritius.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|title=World Data on Education|year=2010/11|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Higher education in Mauritius|Tertiary education]] is maintain by the Ministry of Tertiary Education, Science, Research and Technology. The Tertiary Education Commission has the responsibility for allocating public funds, and fostering, planning and coordinating the development of post-secondary education and training, its strategic plan envisages Mauritius as a regional knowledge hub and a centre for higher learning and excellence. It promotes open and distance learning to increase access to post-secondary education and lifelong learning, both locally and regionally.&lt;ref name="edu TEC"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.commonwealth-of-nations.org/Mauritius/Education|publisher=commonwealth-of-nations.org|title=Education |year=2006|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The education system in Mauritius is largely based on the British system since Mauritius was a former British colony. It consist of a 3+6+5+2 system of formal education. The education system in Mauritius is categorized into 4 main sectors – pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary. There is additionally a provision for pre-vocational and vocational education and training for school leavers and students outside of the academic stream.

Pre-primary schools accept students as from the age of three. Children from the age of five to eleven go to primary school. They are admitted in standard I and gradually moves on to standard 6. Primary education ends with a national examination which is the [[Certificate of Primary Education]] (CPE). Students passing CPE gains admittance to secondary schools, those with excellent results are admitted in National secondary schools. Secondary education is normally a 7-year study, starting from Form I to Form VI. The [[National Assessment At Form III]] is carried out in the third year of Secondary education. Varied subjects are taught and as from Form IV, students are streamlined according to subjects they choose. At the end of the 5th year of study at secondary level, students sit for the [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] [[School Certificate (Mauritius)|School Certificate]] (SC) examination. Passing the SC exam, allows them to continue another 2-year study ending with the [[Higher School Certificate (Mauritius)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) exam.&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://vcampus.uom.ac.mu/researchweek/conference2009/uploads/paper1082915.pdf|publisher=[[University of Mauritius]]|page=3|title=Education in Mauritius|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are compulsory in all schools. Students also has the option to learn any ancestral languages which are spoken in Mauritius, which include [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Hindi]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]]. Other languages includes [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], in 2012 the government also introduce [[Mauritian Creole]] in primary schools. The medium of instruction varies from school.

The school year consists of thirty nine weeks, divided into 3 terms of thirteen weeks.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt; For Secondary schools 1st Term is from 12 January to 6 April, 2nd Term from 23 April to 20 July and 3rd Term from 13 August to 1 November. For Primary schools the 1st Term is from 12 January to 6 April, 2nd Term from 23 April to 20 July and 3rd Term from 20 August to 9 November.

==Structure==

===Academic stream===

The academic stream is the standard stream of education, allowing progression from primary school to secondary school to tertiary institutions. Students who aim to seek admission in higher education or foreign institutions generally follow the academic stream.

===Vocational stream===
{{main|Vocational education in Mauritius}}

Those who wish to obtain career and technical qualifications, as well as those who fail to complete any stage or obtain any qualification of the academic stream from the [[Certificate of Primary Education]] onward, may enter into the vocational stream, which provides technical and vocational training and education (TVET) in life skills and job skills for employment and independent living. The vocational stream offers options outside of the academic stream for students to complete the compulsory stages of education, and to continue their formal education beyond the compulsory years, in vocational programmes of study. Those who successfully complete the [[Post-secondary qualifications in Mauritius#Higher National Diploma .28HND.29|Higher National Diploma]] (HND), a [[Post-secondary qualifications in Mauritius|post-secondary]] qualification, may then progress to the [[Bachelor's degree]] with advanced standing, and thus re-enter into the academic stream of formal education, with the option to progress onto postgraduate studies in [[Higher education in Mauritius|higher education]].

==Statistics==
The adult [[literacy rate]] for both sexes was estimated at 89.8% according to the census made by [[Statistics Mauritius]] in 2011. Male literacy was 92.3% and Female 87.3%.&lt;ref name="census 2011"/&gt; For the year 2011, government expenditure on education was estimated at about Rs 11,709 million, representing 12.5% of total expenditure.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt;

==Education sectors==

===Pre-primary education===
{{Main|Pre-primary education in Mauritius}}
{{See also|List of Pre-primary schools in Mauritius}}
Pre-primary education embraces children between 3 and 5 years old. The number of children in pre-primary schools was 33,901 out of which 51% were boys and 49% girls. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (number of students enrolled per 100 population aged 4–5) works out to 97% with an average of 13 pupils per teacher.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt; The number of pre-primary schools in March 2011 was 1,018, that is 985 in the Island of Mauritius and 33 in [[Rodrigues]]. 75% of these schools were privately run institutions, 18% operating on government primary school premises administered by the Early Childhood Care and Education Authority and the remaining 7% were administered by either Roman Catholic or Hindu Education Authorities or Municipal/Village Councils.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt;

===Primary education===
{{Main|Primary education in Mauritius}}
{{See also|List of Primary schools in Mauritius}}
As at March 2011, there were 305 primary schools with 116,068 pupils (51% boys, 49% girls). Total staff comprised 8,266 persons with 4,227 General Purpose Teachers and 1,350 Oriental Language teachers. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (number of students enrolled per 100 population aged 6–11) is 100% and the pupil/teacher ratio 27.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt; Children are enrolled in primary school from the age of five and enter Standard I and move automatically up to Standard VI. The system is highly competitive and a two-year preparation starts since Standard V up to Standard VI for the end of primary school examinations, the [[Certificate of Primary Education]] (CPE). The CPE is a national examination carried out by the Mauritius Examination Syndicate which devises the syllabus; prepares and prints the examinations papers and does the correction. Five subjects are compulsory and taken into account for the ranking process; [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Mathematics]], [[Science]], [[History]] and [[Geography]], [[Oriental languages]] are optional. Children  who fail the CPE  may have one re-sit. Those who do not pass the CPE at either attempt are not eligible to join the secondary system and may enter the Technical and vocational education. After the CPE exams children are admitted to regional secondary colleges according their zones, those with the best result are admitted in National Colleges. Pass rate for CPE examination increased from 68.1% in 2009 to 68.5% in 2010.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt;

Since 2002 the government has implemented educational programmes in some of the primary schools of the country in order to improve CPE exams results in the low achieving schools. The initiative is now known as ''Zones d'Education Prioritaires'' (Z.E.P) and in order to reach its objective, it seeks to involve the whole school community: school staff, parents, NGOs, business and community-based associations.&lt;ref name="ZEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/education/menuitem.017e502688c15504631e691048a521ca/?content_id=9b8f800e57af7010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |title=From Special Support Schools to 'Zones D'Education Prioritaires' |publisher=Government of Mauritius |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115182748/http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/education/menuitem.017e502688c15504631e691048a521ca/?content_id=9b8f800e57af7010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |archivedate=15 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary education===
{{Main|Secondary education in Mauritius}}
{{See also|List of secondary schools in Mauritius}}
The CPE determines admission to a secondary college. The child enters college in Form I and progresses through to Form VI, requiring seven years of schooling. From Form I to II internal examination is carried out by the schools. The domains of learning for students from Form I to Form III include: Languages ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Hindi]] and Other Languages), [[Mathematics]], [[Sciences]] (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), [[Technology]] (ICT, Design and Technology, Home Economics, Design, Clothing and Textiles), [[Health]] (Home Economics - Food and Nutrition and Human Development and [[Physical Education]]), [[Social sciences]] (History, Geography, Sociology) and [[Arts]] (Visual Arts, Music and Drama &amp; Dance) and Cross curricular Domains of Learning.&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/educationsite/file/Secondary%20Curriculum%20Framework.pdf|title=Domains of Learning - Forms I to III|author=Ministry of Education and Human Resource|publisher=Government of Mauritius|page=21|accessdate=24 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110072213/http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/educationsite/file/Secondary%20Curriculum%20Framework.pdf|archivedate=10 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past there were no major nationally devised curriculum since each school has to plan its work according to the level of the students. In 2012, the [[National Assessment At Form III]] was introduced for students in Form III, this examination is carried out by the [[Mauritius Examination Syndicate]].&lt;ref name="NationalForm3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/educationsite/file/National%20Assessment%20Form%20III%20-%20Handbook%20for%20schools.pdf |title=National Assessment at Form III 2012 |author=Ministry of Education and Human Resource |publisher=Government of Mauritius |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916011300/http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/educationsite/file/National%20Assessment%20Form%20III%20-%20Handbook%20for%20schools.pdf |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When students reach Form IV, they have to choose at least six major subjects for their Cambridge [[School Certificate (Mauritius)|School Certificate]] (SC) which is the [[GCE Ordinary Level|GCE 'O' Level]] examinations. This examination is carried out in Form V. 
[[File:Laureate celebration.jpg|thumb|Laureate Celebration]]
This is followed by a two-year upper secondary education (Lower VI and Upper VI) ending with the Cambridge [[Higher School Certificate (Mauritius)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) that is the [[GCE Advanced Level|GCE 'A' Level]]. Students have to specialise in 3 main subjects and 2 subsidiary ones for the A Level examination. HSC Students have the option to compete and those with the best results win scholarship for their tertiary education. The [[O-Level]] and [[A-Level]] examinations are carried out by the [[University of Cambridge]] through [[University of Cambridge International Examinations]], which devises the syllabus; prepares and prints the examinations papers and does the correction, in conjunction with the [[Mauritius Examinations Syndicate]].

At March 2011, there were 180 schools providing secondary education in the academic stream. The secondary school enrolment was 115,289 (48% boys, 52% girls) and the number of teachers was 7,873. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (number of students enrolled per 100 population aged 12–19) works out to 70% and the pupil/teacher ratio 15. For the Cambridge School Certificate (SC), the pass rate improved slightly from 77.6% in 2009 to 77.8% in 2010. For the Cambridge Higher School Certificate (HSC), it decreased from 78.8% in 2009 to 78.3% in 2010.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt;

===Tertiary education===
{{Main|Higher education in Mauritius}}
{{See also|List of tertiary institutions in Mauritius}}
Tertiary education which started in 1924 with the College of Agriculture has since developed into a diversified system, composed of public, private, regional and overseas institutions catering for a wide range of courses and programmes.&lt;ref name="TEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tec.intnet.mu/tertiary%20education%20system.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222132420/http://tec.intnet.mu/tertiary%20education%20system.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 December 2005 |title=Tertiary Education Commission Of Mauritius |accessdate=2007-01-19 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision of tertiary education extends beyond the local tertiary education institutions given that a significant number of Mauritian students either go overseas or resort exclusively to the open learning mode for pursuing their studies. Tertiary level enrolment went up by 6.9%, from 41,484 in 2009 to 44,334 in 2010.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt;

Tertiary institutions in Mauritius includes colleges, universities, Institutes of Technology/Polytechnic and other technical institutions. The country's two main public universities are the [[University of Mauritius]] and [[University of Technology, Mauritius|University of Technology]]. Universities, as in most countries worldwide, have three stages: Bachelor's (undergraduate), Master's (graduate), and Doctoral degrees. Undergraduate stage lasts for at least four years and graduate stage lasts for five years after completion of secondary education or one year after obtaining a bachelor's degree. The third stage of higher education results in obtaining a Ph.D. Degree. Private institutions and overseas institutions/bodies deliver tertiary-level programmes mostly in niche areas like Information Technology, Law, Management, Accountancy and Finance. A number of the institutions are overseas with their provisions made available through the [[distance education]] mode.

===Technical and vocational education===
{{Main|Vocational education in Mauritius}}
{{See also|Post-secondary qualifications in Mauritius}}
The Government has undertaken to ensure provision of educational facilities to students till they the reach the maturity age of 16 to enter the world of work. In this context the [[Vocational education in Mauritius|pre-vocational]] sector caters for around 4,000 students ejected at the end of the primary cycle, in view of their inability to meet the established benchmark for promotion to the mainstream in the secondary sector. Since its conception in the late 90s, the Prevocational Education has been providing a second chance to pupils who have failed the [[Certificate of Primary Education|CPE]] or who are above 13. The children previously completed a 3-year program in secondary schools in line with the [[National Trade Certificate Foundation Course]], but this has now been supplanted by a four-year technical and vocational education and training programme. Such programmes are offered by the [[Mauritius Institute of Training and Development]].&lt;ref name="prevoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/education/menuitem.2e5a61392ac97504631e691048a521ca/?content_id=5a41800e57af7010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |title=Pre Vocational Education |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116230706/http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/education/menuitem.2e5a61392ac97504631e691048a521ca/?content_id=5a41800e57af7010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-vocational education was dispensed in 126 schools in March 2011 with an enrolment of 7,270 students (64% boys, 36% girls) and 634 teaching staff. The pupil/teacher ratio was 11.&lt;ref name="edu stats"/&gt;

In addition to providing pre-vocational and vocational education and training options for early school leavers, institutions of technical and vocational education also provide further education and training for greater employability and career skills enhancement as well as practical training in a number of fields.

==Private Tuition==
In recent years private tuition has become very common among students due to the competitiveness of the education system; they would usually take private tuition after school hours and during the weekend. In October 2011, the government amended the Education Act to extend the ban on private tuition to pupils in Standards I to III to those in Standard IV. The government introduced the Enhancement Programme as an alternative to private tuition for students in Standards I to IV, a programme which covers the pedagogical aspects of the respective curriculum, as well as co-curricular and [[extra-curricular]] components to render the learning experiences more enriching, enjoyable and rewarding.&lt;ref name="tuition"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/pmosite?content_id=93c0c34076556210VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD |publisher=Government of Mauritius |title=CABINET DECISIONS – 15 JANUARY 2010 |author=Prime Minister's Office |year=2011 |accessdate=26 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117171949/http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/pmosite/?content_id=93c0c34076556210VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD |archivedate=17 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward "Ned" Paterson''' (1895–1974) was a pioneering art teacher in [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]). He is known for founding Cyrene School near [[Bulawayo]], and for introducing the [[Arts and Crafts]] style to Africans in both [[South Africa]] and Rhodesia. Some of his students were among the first professional African artists in Rhodesia.

== Early life and education ==

Paterson was born in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, and emigrated to South Africa with his family in 1901. He left school young and went to work at fourteen, serving part-time in the [[Transvaal Scottish]] Regiment. During World War I his regiment was called up, and Paterson served in the Namibian and East African campaigns before being demobilized in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;D. Walker. Paterson of Cyrene: A Biography. Gweru: Mambo Press, 1985, 1-8. {{ISBN|0869223402}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he was awarded a veteran's scholarship, and went to study at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] in London. Although he possessed a tremendous love of art, Paterson was not sufficiently talented to pursue an art career on his own. He returned to South Africa, joined the Transvaal diocese of the Anglican church in 1924, and completed his religious training in 1928 when he was ordained as a deacon.

== Year at Grace Dieu 1925 ==

Paterson's artistic influence first made itself felt at Grace Dieu, an Anglican high school for Africans near [[Pietersburg]], where he was posted for the 1925 school year. The school had an unusual syllabus that included carpentry and drawing. Paterson introduced the school's workshop students to [[bas relief]] carving, which he had learned in art school. This form of carving soon became the school's trademark style, and was continued by a nun called Sister Pauline after Paterson's departure.&lt;ref&gt;G. Butler. The Prophetic Nun. Johannesburg: Random House, 2000, 47. {{ISBN|095841954X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, the school developed what would become Africa's first art workshop, with students and attached professional carvers producing religious carvings on commission for churches needing furniture and ecclesiastical objects. [[Ernest Mancoba]] and [[Job Kekana]], two of South Africa's first professional black artists, emerged from this workshop.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morton, "Grace Dieu Mission in South Africa: Defining the Modern Art Workshop in Africa," in S. Kasfir and T. Forster, eds., African Art and Agency in the Workshop (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2013), 42-3. {{ISBN|9780253007414}}. https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0253007585&lt;/ref&gt; The African carvers at the workshop were not given the latitude to create their own designs at the workshop, but were instead given designs and asked to transfer them onto the wood. Paterson supplied many of the designs used at the workshop through the late 1930s as a means of augmenting his small income.

== Work in the Transvaal, 1928-1938 ==

After being ordained, Paterson served a number of African congregations for the Transvaal diocese for a decade in locations such as [[Sophiatown]] and [[Potchefstroom]]. During this time he helped decorate a number of new Anglican churches in his diocese, including many murals and carvings.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Paterson of Cyrene, 22-8.&lt;/ref&gt; All this work was erased in the 1950s when the Nationalist government relocated urban Africans to townships and destroyed their old neighborhoods. In 1933 Paterson was married to Mary Phillips, with whom he would have four children.

== Cyrene Mission, 1939-53 ==

The centerpiece of Paterson's career were his years in charge of Cyrene School, near [[Bulawayo]] in [[Rhodesia]], where he moved to in 1939. This school, which Paterson started from scratch, focused on practical and agricultural education. It was the first African school in Rhodesia to have art classes, which were made mandatory for all students. "Our aim is to turn out the self-contained burger type, able to farm rationally and to care for his cattle, able to build his own home and to make its furniture and even to enrich them by carving and design."&lt;ref&gt;E. Morton, "Ned Paterson and the Cyrene Mission Tradition," 2003, 71-2. https://www.academia.edu/6779249/Elizabeth_Morton_Ned_Paterson_and_the_Cyrene_Mission_Tradition&lt;/ref&gt;  All students took painting and drawing classes with Paterson until he left the school in 1953. He also established an arts workshop that met in the afternoons, which typically included disabled students unable to take part in sports or construction. These students also learned to carve, sculpt and produce linocut prints.

Cyrene became well known as Paterson sought to exhibit his artists and sell their work in order to recoup the heavy costs of providing art education. By 1944 his artists were selling strongly among White Rhodesians. In 1947 the repute of Cyrene was sufficient to attract a visit from the [[King George VI]]'s 1947 tour of southern Africa. In the wake of the ensuing publicity from the royal visit, traveling exhibitions of Cyrene student art toured South Africa, England, and the United States regularly from 1949-1953, raising enough money for Paterson to cover his annual budget deficits.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zilberg, "Drawing Paintings by Rhodesian School Children in the Smithsonian." 2013. https://www.academia.edu/3622672/Drawing_Paintings_by_Rhodesian_School_Children&lt;/ref&gt; These exhibitions made Paterson the best-known art educator in Africa of his era. Eventually a number of Rhodesia's first professional African artists emerged from Cyrene. These included [[Sam Songo]], Lazarus Khumalo, and [[Kingsley Sambo]].

== Salisbury art training, 1954-74 ==

Seeking new horizons, Paterson shifted to the growing urban capital of [[Harare|Salisbury]]. He continued to teach art to African children, first at Chirodzo (1954–61), Nyarutsetso (1961-68), and later at Farayi Art Center (1968–74). After moving to Salisbury, Paterson expected to have an important role at the new [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]], which was chartered in 1954 and established in 1957. Many of Paterson' students exhibited at the initial exhibitions, but soon Paterson and most of his students were marginalized by the National Gallery director, [[Frank McEwen]]. Several of Paterson's former pupils, [[Kingsley Sambo]], [[Boira Mteki]], and [[Thomas Mukarobgwa]], ended up in McEwen's "Workshop School". He and McEwen had a number of public spats, and Paterson was effectively shut out of all major National Gallery business thereafter.

== Artistic legacy ==

Paterson's legacy has had a mixed reception from scholars. Beyond any doubt, McEwen, whose writings and exhibitions set the tone for the burgeoning international reception of Zimbabwean art, silenced any discussion of Paterson's influence.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Jonathan Zilberg has sought to revive Paterson's reputation, maintaining that the history of [[Shona sculpture]] needs to be "liberated" by focusing on its origins with Paterson.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zilberg, "The Priest Who Made Frank McEwen's Workshop School Project Possible." 2013. https://www.academia.edu/5371536/The_Priest_Who_Made_Frank_McEwens_Workshop_School_Project_Possible&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent scholarship has taken a far more negative view. Randles, for instance, has maintained that mission stations such as Cyrene generally stunted the development of their artists.&lt;ref&gt;E. Randles. "Mission Art in Zimbabwe",  in G. Bourgois and E. De Palmenaer, eds., Zimbabwe, Legacies of Stone Past and Present, Vol. 2 (Tervuren: Royal Museum for Central Africa, 1997) 71-83. {{ISBN|9789075894172}}. https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9075894171&lt;/ref&gt; Morton, meanwhile, has maintained that Paterson's students typically copied his own limited style, and were never able to get the training they needed to progress technically. Only artists such as [[Kingsley Sambo|Sambo]], who broke away from Paterson, or [[Ernest Mancoba|Mancoba]], who insisted in designing his own works, were able to bypass the limited training they received from him. The rest of Paterson's students, according to Morton, produced for the tourist trade: "Paterson’s chief legacy is in tourist art".&lt;ref&gt;E. Morton, "Ned Paterson and the Cyrene Mission Tradition," 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=November 2016}}
'''Francis Wayland Parker''' (October 9, 1837{{spaced ndash}}March 2, 1902) was a pioneer of the [[progressive education|progressive school movement]] in the [[United States]]. He believed that education should include the complete development of an individual — mental, physical, and moral. [[John Dewey]] called him the "father of progressive education." He worked to create [[curriculum]] that centered on the whole child and a strong language background. He was against standardization, isolated drill and [[rote learning]]. He helped to show that education was not just about cramming information into students' minds, but about teaching students to think for themselves and become independent people.

==Biography==
[[File:Francis W. Parker School.JPG|240px|right|thumb|Colonel Parker founded the [[Francis W. Parker School (Chicago)|Francis W. Parker School]] in 1901, with the support of benefactor [[Anita McCormick Blaine]].]]
Parker was born in [[Bedford, New Hampshire]] in [[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough County]]. He was educated in the public schools and began his career as a village teacher in New Hampshire at age 16. He taught 75 children at Corser Hill at Boscawen, New Hampshire, making 15 dollars a month. Many of his students were older and had been exposed to more of the curriculum than him. After teaching in Boscawen, he began to teach in Auburn, New Hampshire, making 18 dollars a month.  At 16 years old, he taught in Hinsdale, Massachusetts, and eventually took charge of all the grammar schools in his town Piscataquis, New Hampshire.  At 21 years old he became the principal of a school in Carrolton, Illinois.

In August 1861, at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], Parker enlisted as a private in the [[4th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry]]. He was elected lieutenant and was later promoted to captain and commander of the company. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and commander of the 4th New Hampshire in January 1865, serving in [[St. Augustine]], Florida—part of that time in the brig. He was captured and held [[prisoner of war|prisoner]] in [[North Carolina]] in May 1865.

After the war ended, Colonel Parker resumed teaching, first in [[Ohio]], where he became the head of the [[normal school]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. In 1872, he traveled to [[Germany]] to study at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In Europe, Parker examined the new methods of [[pedagogy]] being developed there, proposed by European theorists, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Friedrich Fröbel]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and particularly [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]]. Parker asserted that students benefit most from reading works of high interest, thereby activating background knowledge. A supporter of balanced instruction, he encouraged the use of the elements of phonics, as well as lists of word families, onsets and rimes, to assist in word recognition. This innovative educator integrated the skill areas of reading, writing, listening and speaking. Parker advocated many of the current language experience and process writing approach methodologies. He believed that children should write across the content areas on subjects that interested them, for enjoyment and that the proper form would come with practice. All writing should be natural and connected to authentic and meaningful activities, using the child's own vocabulary; in other words, experience based writing. Parker was a teacher, principal and a lecturer, who wanted all children to have their own slate boards, so they could write and draw freely without fear of mistakes.

Between 1875 and 1880, Parker was able to put his philosophy into practice, when he served as superintendent of schools in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], [[Massachusetts]]. He was offered the job because of his dynamic personality and passion to change the current schooling system. There, he developed the [[Quincy Method]], which eliminated harsh discipline and de-emphasized rote memorization, replacing them with elements of progressive education, such as group activities, the teaching of the arts and sciences, and informal methods of instruction. He rejected tests, grading and ranking systems. The model was hailed as successful, when in 1879, responding to critics of the progressive methods, state-ordered testing showed that Quincy pupils surpassed the scores of other school children in Massachusetts.

He continued to implement his theories as superintendent of the [[Boston Public Schools]] (1880–83) and principal of the [[Chicago State University|Cook County Normal School]], [[Chicago]] (1883–99). While Principal of the Cook County Normal School he constantly experimented with the children of Cook County, trying to expand and develop his curriculum. He experimented with new theories and tried to perfect his plan for education. He was not afraid of failure, saying, "The road to success is through constant blundering". With his likeable personality and his progressive theories, he was able to reform the Cook County Normal School.  Reading, spelling, and writing became a subject known as communication.  Art and physical education were added to the weekly curriculum.  He taught science through the study of nature.  He even created a band with the children who studied music. 
During this period of time, Parker published five books on education, including: ''Talks on Teaching'' (New York, 1883); ''The Practical Teacher'' (1884); ''Course in Arithmetic'' (1884); ''Talks on Pedagogies'' (1894); and ''How to Teach Geography'' (1885). [[Dartmouth College]] awarded Parker the degree of [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1886. In the next phase of his educational career, Parker founded and served as principal (1899–1901) for a private experimental school, the Chicago Institute, which became the [[University of Chicago]] School of Education in 1901.

In 1901, Parker merged Chicago Institute with the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]] and worked with kindergarten and elementary school age children. To further put his theories into practice, the [[Francis W. Parker School (Chicago)|Francis W. Parker School]] opened in Chicago with an initial enrollment of one hundred and eighty students. [[Francis W. Parker School (San Diego)|A second school]] was founded in San Diego in 1912. Both schools exist today.

In poor health, Parker was sent by his doctors to the South for a better climate. He died at age 64 in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi]]. His ashes were returned to New Hampshire, in May 1902 and were interred at Piscataquog Cemetery, [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].

In addition to the schools in New York, Illinois, Indiana, and California, the [[Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School]] was founded in [[Massachusetts]] in 1995, in honor of Parker's contributions to the field of progressive education. An elementary school in Quincy also bears Parker's name, as does one in [[Rochester, N.Y.]]

'''Frank Vincent Zappa'''{{refn|group=nb|Until discovering his birth certificate as an adult, Zappa believed he had been christened "Francis Vincent Zappa" after his father, and he is credited as Francis on some of his early albums. The name on his birth certificate however is "Frank", not "Francis".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|15}}}} (December 21, 1940&amp;nbsp;– December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, activist and filmmaker. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; In a career spanning more than 30&amp;nbsp;years, Zappa composed [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], [[orchestra]]l and ''[[musique concrète]]'' works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band [[&lt;!--Do not capitalize--&gt;the Mothers of Invention]] and as a solo artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank-zappa-mn0000138699/biography|title=Frank Zappa {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitaker|first1=Sterling|title=The Day Frank Zappa Died|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/frank-zappa-death/|website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maume|first1=Chris|title=Gail Zappa: Frank Zappa's wife, muse and manager who ferociously protected his musical legacy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gail-zappa-frank-zappas-wife-muse-and-manager-who-ferociously-protected-his-musical-legacy-a6691251.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]], along with 1950s [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckley|first1=Peter|title=The Rough Guide to Rock: [The Definitive Guide to More Than 1200 Artists and Bands]|date=November 17, 2003|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|page=1211|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', combined songs in conventional [[rock and roll]] format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound [[collage]]s. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.

Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "Project/Object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums.&lt;ref name="semley2012"/&gt; His lyrics reflected his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so. Zappa's often comedic lyrics led [[AllMusic]] to describe him as the "godfather" of [[comedy rock]].&lt;ref name="Comedy rock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he personally disapproved of drugs and never used them again after briefly trying marijuana,&lt;ref name="Loder 1988"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rolling Stone Interview|year=1988|first=Kurt|last=Loder|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; but supported their decriminalization and regulation.

During Zappa's lifetime, he was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while critics found it lacking emotional depth. He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an [[independent music|independent artist]] for most of his career. He remains a major influence on musicians and composers. His honors include his 1995 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the 1997 [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. In 2000, he was ranked number 36 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxm64mApR05CJVCePlmcUFluSZyiAvKZ8 VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him at number 71 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Artists|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/frank-zappa-20110420|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|date=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 at number 22 on its list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Guitarists|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/frank-zappa-20111122|website=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|date=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1940s–1960s: Early life and career==

===Childhood===
Zappa was born on December 21, 1940 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. His mother, Rosemarie ({{nee}} Collimore) was of [[Italian Americans|Italian]] (Neapolitan and Sicilian) and [[French Americans|French]] ancestry; his father, whose name was anglicized to Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from [[Partinico]], [[Sicily]], with [[Greek Americans|Greek]] and [[Arab Americans|Arab]]&lt;!-- do not change this to Lebanese: the cited source says Sicilian, Greek, Arab and French--&gt; ancestry.{{refn|group=nb|"My ancestry is Sicilian, Greek, Arab and French. My mother's mother was French and Sicilian, and her Dad was Italian (from Naples). She was first generation. The Greek-Arab side is from my Dad. He was born in a Sicilian village called Partinico&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zappa |first1=Frank |authorlink=Frank Zappa |last2=Occhiogrosso |first2=Peter |title=Real Frank Zappa Book |date=1989 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-70572-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}}}

Frank, the eldest of four children, was raised in an Italian-American household where [[Italian language|Italian]] was often spoken by his grandparents.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone Book"&gt;''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|6}} The family moved often because his father, a [[chemist]] and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to [[Maryland]], where Zappa's father worked at the [[Edgewood, Maryland|Edgewood]] Arsenal [[chemical warfare]] facility of the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|20–23}} This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa| first = Barry| last = Miles| publisher=Atlantic Books| location = London| year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-84354-092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from [[asthma]], [[earache]]s and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]] problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of [[radium]] into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|10}} and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant enough evidence to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/nasopharyngeal-radium-fact-sheet|title=Nasopharyngeal Radium Irradiation (NRI) and Cancer|date=January 2003|work=National Cancer Institute|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411012948/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/nasopharyngeal-radium-fact-sheet|archivedate=April 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator [[Cal Schenkel]]. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|20–23}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|10}} In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|22}} They next moved to [[Monterey, California]], where his father taught [[metallurgy]] at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]. They soon moved to [[Claremont, California]],&lt;ref name=slaven03&gt;{{cite book|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa|edition=2nd|first1=Neil|last1=Slaven|publisher=Music Sales Group|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4EyfFjQ3DgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} then to [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]], before finally settling in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandiegotroubadour.com/wp-content/pdf/2005_11_Nov.pdf|format=PDF|title=Counter Culture Coincidence|work=San Diego Troubadour|last=Mendoza|first=Bart|page=4|date=November 11, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First musical interests===
{{quote box|quote=Since I didn't have any kind of formal training, it didn't make any difference to me if I was listening to Lightnin' Slim, or a vocal group called the Jewels&amp;nbsp;..., or Webern, or Varèse, or Stravinsky. To me it was all good music.|source= — Frank Zappa, 1989&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|34}}|width=25em}}

Zappa joined his first band at [[Mission Bay High School]] in San Diego as the drummer.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|29}} At about the same time, his parents bought a phonograph, which allowed him to develop his interest in music, and to begin building his record collection.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|22}} [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] singles were early purchases, starting a large collection he kept for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|36}} He was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|29}} Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began&lt;ref name="idol"/&gt; when he read a ''[[Look (American magazine)|LOOK]]'' magazine article about the [[Sam Goody]] record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as ''The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Volume One''.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} The article described [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse's]] percussion composition ''[[Ionisation (Varèse)|Ionisation]]'', produced by [[EMS Recordings]], as "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". Zappa decided to seek out Varèse's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the "mad scientist" looking photo of Varèse on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Thus began his lifelong passion for Varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers. He also liked the Italian classical music listened to by his grandparents, especially [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s opera arias.

[[File:Frank Zappa HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|upright|Zappa's senior yearbook photo, 1958]]
By 1956, the Zappa family had moved to [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], a small [[aerospace]] and farming town in the [[Antelope Valley]] of the [[Mojave Desert]] close to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; he would later refer to Sun Village (a town close to Lancaster) in the 1973 track "Village of the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Roxy_and_Elsewhere.html#Village|title=Lyrics of Village Of The Sun|first=Frank|last=Zappa|date=December 1973|work=Village Of The Sun, Roxy and Elsewhere|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Unfortunately, Varèse was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife and she suggested he call back later. In a letter Varèse thanked him for his interest, and told him about a composition he was working on called "[[Déserts]]". Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Varèse invited him to visit if he ever came to New York. The meeting never took place (Varèse died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="idol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zappa|first=Frank|title=Edgard Varese: The Idol of My Youth|journal=Stereo Review|pages=61–62|date=June 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|On several of his earlier albums, Zappa paid tribute to Varèse by quoting his: "The present-day composer refuses to die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Friendly Remainders: Essays in Music Criticism after Adorno|first1=Murray|last1=Dineen|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7735-8576-8|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C&amp;pg=PA122 Extract of page 122]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At [[Antelope Valley High School]], Zappa met Don Glen Vliet (who later changed his name to Don Van Vliet and adopted the stage name [[Captain Beefheart]]). Zappa and Vliet became close friends, sharing an interest in R&amp;B records and influencing each other musically throughout their careers.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|29–30}} Around the same time, Zappa started playing drums in a local band, the Blackouts.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|13}} The band was racially diverse and included [[Jim Sherwood|Euclid James "Motorhead" Sherwood]] who later became a member of the Mothers of Invention. Zappa's interest in the guitar grew, and in 1957 he was given his first instrument. Among his early influences were [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]. (In the 1970s/80s, he invited Watson to perform on several albums.) Zappa considered soloing as the equivalent of forming "air sculptures",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frank Zappa|first1=Barry|last1=Miles|publisher=Atlantic Books Ltd|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78239-678-9|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266 Extract of page 266]&lt;/ref&gt; and developed an eclectic, innovative and highly personal style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Academy Zappa: Proceedings of the First International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology (ICE-Z)|edition=illusdtrated|first1=Ben|last1=Watson|first2=Esther|last2=Leslie|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|year=2005|isbn=978-0-946719-79-2|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC&amp;pg=PA223 Extract of page 223]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa's interest in composing and arranging flourished in his last high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, [[arrangement|arranging]] and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|40}} He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album ''Freak Out!''&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting the rest of the class with juvenile antics.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|48}} In 1959, he attended [[Chaffey College]] but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|345}}

Zappa left home in 1959, and moved into a small apartment in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], Los Angeles. After meeting Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman during his short period of private composition study with Prof. [[Karl Kohn]] of [[Pomona College]], they moved in together in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], and were married December 28, 1960.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|58}} Zappa worked for a short period in advertising. His sojourn in the commercial world was brief, but gave him valuable insights into its workings.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|40}} Throughout his career, he took a keen interest in the visual presentation of his work, designing some of his album covers and directing his own films and videos.

===Studio Z===
Zappa attempted to earn a living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with a new version of the Blackouts.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|59}} Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films ''[[The World's Greatest Sinner]]'' (1962) and ''Run Home Slow'' (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer [[Timothy Carey]] and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|63}} The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|55}} Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album ''[[The Lost Episodes]]'' (1996).

During the early 1960s, Zappa wrote and produced songs for other local artists, often working with singer-songwriter [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] and producer Paul Buff. Their "[[Memories of El Monte]]" was recorded by [[the Penguins]], although only Cleve Duncan of the original group was featured.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, 1984, ''Mother!'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Buff owned the small [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cucamonga]], which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. At that time, only a handful of the most sophisticated commercial studios had [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|42}} Although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money to allow him to stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|74}} He appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s syndicated late night show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a bow borrowed from the band's bass player, as well as drum sticks, he proceeded to pluck, bang, and bow the spokes of the bike, producing strange, comical sounds from his new found instrument. With Captain Beefheart, Zappa recorded some songs under the name of the Soots. They were rejected by [[Dot Records]] for having "no commercial potential", a verdict Zappa subsequently quoted on the sleeve of ''[[Freak Out!]]''&lt;ref name=watson96&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play| first = Ben| last = Watson| year = 1996| publisher=St. Martin's Griffin| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-312-14124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}

In 1964, after his marriage started to break up, he moved into the Pal studio and began routinely working 12&amp;nbsp;hours or more per day recording and experimenting with [[overdubbing]] and [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#As a musical instrument|audio tape manipulation]]. This established a work pattern that endured for most of his life.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|43}} Aided by his income from film composing, Zappa took over the studio from Paul Buff, who was now working with [[Art Laboe]] at [[Original Sound]]. It was renamed Studio Z.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|80–81}} Studio Z was rarely booked for recordings by other musicians. Instead, friends moved in, notably James "Motorhead" Sherwood.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|82–83}} Zappa started performing in local bars as a guitarist with a [[power trio]], the Muthers, to support himself.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

An article in the local press describing Zappa as "the Movie King of Cucamonga" prompted the local police to suspect that he was making [[pornography|pornographic]] films.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|85}} In March 1965, Zappa was approached by a [[Vice unit|vice squad]] undercover officer, and accepted an offer of $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1965|fmt=eq}}) to produce a suggestive audio tape for an alleged [[Bachelor party|stag party]]. Zappa and a female friend recorded a faked erotic episode. When Zappa was about to hand over the tape, he was arrested, and the police stripped the studio of all recorded material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|85}} The press was tipped off beforehand, and next day's ''[[The Daily Report]]'' wrote that "Vice Squad investigators stilled the tape recorders of a free-swinging, a-go-go film and recording studio here Friday and arrested a self-styled movie producer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Harp |first=Ted |title=Vice Squad Raids Local Film Studio | newspaper=The Daily Report | place = Ontario, California | date = March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa was charged with "conspiracy to commit pornography".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|57}} This [[felony]] charge was reduced and he was sentenced to six months in jail on a [[misdemeanor]], with all but ten days suspended.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|86–87}} His brief imprisonment left a permanent mark, and was central to the formation of his anti-authoritarian stance.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|xv}} Zappa lost several recordings made at Studio Z in the process, as the police only returned 30 out of 80 hours of tape seized.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|87}} Eventually, he could no longer afford to pay the rent on the studio and was evicted.&lt;ref&gt;Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa managed to recover some of his possessions before the studio was torn down in 1966.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|90–91}}

==Late 1960s: The Mothers of Invention==

===Formation===
In 1965, [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] asked Zappa to take over as guitarist in local R&amp;B band the Soul Giants, following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone Book"/&gt; Zappa accepted, and soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer (even though he never considered himself a singer&lt;ref name="HighTimes1980"/&gt;). He convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]].&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|42}} They increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager [[Herb Cohen]], while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles [[underground music]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] when playing "Trouble Every Day", a song about the [[Watts riots]].&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|103}} Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], and was notable as one of the few African-Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. Wilson signed the Mothers to the [[Verve Records|Verve]] division of [[MGM Records|MGM]], which had built up a strong reputation for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves [[the Mothers of Invention]] as ''Mother'' was short for ''[[motherfucker]]''—a term that, apart from its profane meanings, can denote a skilled musician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | people = Nigel Leigh | title = Interview with Frank Zappa | medium = BBC Late Show | publisher=BBC [TV Show] | location = UMRK, Los Angeles, CA |date=March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debut album: ''Freak Out!''===
With Wilson credited as producer, the Mothers of Invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), which, after Bob Dylan's ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', was the second rock double album ever released. It mixed R&amp;B, [[doo-wop]], musique concrète,&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite book| title = The Words and Music of Frank Zappa| first = Kelly Fisher| last = Lowe| publisher=Praeger Publishers| location = Westport| year = 2006| isbn = 978-0-275-98779-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} and experimental [[sound collage]]s that captured the "freak" subculture of Los Angeles at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was dissatisfied with the final product, ''Freak Out'' immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the "relentless consumer culture of America".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|115}} The sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional [[session musician]]s were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from [[Chord chart|charts]] with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|112}} The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had [[dada]]ist elements. Yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs.&lt;ref name=watson05&gt;{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music| first = Ben| last = Watson| year = 2005| publisher=Omnibus Press| location = London| isbn = 978-1-84449-865-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10–11}} Most compositions are Zappa's, which set a precedent for the rest of his recording career. He had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most [[Overdubbing|overdubs]]. Wilson provided the industry clout and connections and was able to provide the group with the financial resources needed.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|123}} Although Wilson was able to provide Zappa and the Mothers with an extraordinary degree of artistic freedom for the time, the recording did not go entirely as planned. In a surviving 1967 radio interview, Zappa explained that the album's outlandish 11-minute closing track, "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet" was in fact an unfinished piece. The track (as it appears on the album) was created to act as the backing track for a much more complex work, but MGM refused to approve the additional recording time Zappa needed to complete it, so (much to his chagrin) it was issued in this unfinished form.&lt;ref&gt;"How We Made It Sound That Way", interview on WDET Detroit, November 13, 1967 (excerpt included as part of the [[The MOFO Project/Object|MOFO]] album, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the recording of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa moved into a house in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] with friend Pamela Zarubica, who appeared on the album.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|112}} The house became a meeting (and living) place for many LA musicians and [[groupie]]s of the time, despite Zappa's disapproval of their illicit drug use.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|122}} After a short promotional tour following the release of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa met [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]]. He fell in love within "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|65–66}} They married in 1967, had four children and remained together until Zappa's death.

Wilson nominally produced the Mothers' second album ''[[Absolutely Free]]'' (1967), which was recorded in November 1966, and later [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in New York, although by this time Zappa was in ''de facto'' control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|5}} Examples are "Plastic People" and "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|38–43}} As Zappa put it, "[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything."&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|135–38}} At the same time, Zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, ''[[Lumpy Gravy]]'', released by [[Capitol Records]] in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|140–41}} It is an "incredible ambitious musical project",&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|56}} a "monument to [[John Cage]]",&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical [[audio engineer|audio editing]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22630|pure_url=yes}} | title=Lumpy Gravy.

===New York period (1966–1968)===
The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 [[Bleecker Street]], above the [[Cafe au Go Go]]) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.&lt;ref&gt;James, 2000, ''Necessity Is&amp;nbsp;...'', pp. 62–69.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|140–141}} Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|147}} Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a "[[gook]] baby".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|94}}

Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as [[AMM (group)|AMM]] and [[Faust (band)|Faust]] also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (released 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22631|pure_url=yes}}|title=We're Only in It for the Money. Review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. ''We're Only in It for the Money'' featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the [[hippie]] and [[flower power]] phenomena.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; He sampled plundered surf music in ''We're only in It for the Money'', as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song ''Tomorrow Never Knows''.&lt;ref&gt;Cox and Warner, 2004, ''Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music'', p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The cover photo parodied that of [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{refn|group=nb|As the legal aspects of using the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept were unsettled, the album was released with the cover and back on the inside of the gatefold, while the actual cover and back were a picture of the group in a pose parodying the inside of the Beatles album.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|151}}}} The cover art was provided by [[Cal Schenkel]] whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|88}}

Reflecting Zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, ''[[Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets]]'' (1968), was very different. It represented a collection of [[doo-wop]] songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|58}} Zappa later noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same&amp;nbsp;... to doo-wop in the fifties?"&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|88}} A theme from Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' is heard during one song.

During the late 1960s, Zappa continued to develop the business sides of his career. He and Herb Cohen formed the [[Bizarre Records]] and [[Straight Records]] labels, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], as ventures to aid the funding of projects and to increase creative control. Zappa produced the double album ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' for [[Captain Beefheart]], and releases by [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Persuasions]], [[Wild Man Fischer]], and [[the GTOs]], as well as [[Lenny Bruce]]'s last live performance.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|173–175}}

In 1967 and 1968, Zappa made two appearances with [[the Monkees]]. The first appearance was on an episode of [[The Monkees (TV series)|their TV series]], "The Monkees Blow Their Minds", where Zappa, dressed up as [[Michael Nesmith|Mike Nesmith]], interviews Nesmith who is dressed up as Zappa. After the interview, Zappa destroys a car with a sledgehammer as the song "Mother People" plays. He later provided a cameo in the Monkees' movie [[Head (film)|''Head'']] where, leading a cow, he tells [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] "the youth of America depends on you to show them the way." Zappa had respect for what the Monkees were doing, and offered [[Micky Dolenz]] a position in the Mothers. RCA/Columbia/Colgems would not allow Dolenz out of his contract.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|158–59}}

In the Mothers' second European tour in September/October 1968 they performed for the {{ill|Internationale Essener Songtage|de}} at the [[Grugahalle]] in [[Essen]], Germany; at the [[Tivoli Gardens|Tivoli]] in Copenhagen, Denmark; for TV programs in Germany (''[[Beat-Club]]''), France, and England; at the [[Concertgebouw]] in Amsterdam; at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London; and at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zappateers.com/fzshows/6669.html September–October 1968: The 2nd European tour], zappateers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa and the Mothers of Invention returned to Los Angeles in mid-1968, and the Zappas moved into a house on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, only to move again to one on Woodrow Wilson Drive.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|178}} This was Zappa's home for the rest of his life. Despite being a success with fans in Europe, the Mothers of Invention were not faring well financially.&lt;ref name="walley116"&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first records were vocally oriented, but Zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. Zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his "electrical chamber music".&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|119–120}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|185–187}}
[[File:Frank 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Zappa with the Mothers of Invention, [[Boulevard de Clichy|Theatre de Clichy]], Paris, 1971]]
In 1969 there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing [[royalties]] whether they played or not.&lt;ref name="walley116"/&gt; 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM Records' interference, left them for [[Warner Bros. Records]]' [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] subsidiary where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.

In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|107}} but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|120}} Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|185–187}} Others were irritated by 'his [[Autocracy|autocratic]] ways',&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|123}} exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|116}} Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'' and ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'' (both released in 1970).

After he disbanded the Mothers of Invention, Zappa released the acclaimed solo album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22632|pure_url=yes}}|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Hot Rats. Review|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|194}} It features, for the first time on record, Zappa playing extended guitar solos and contains one of his most enduring compositions, "[[Peaches en Regalia]]", which reappeared several times on future recordings.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|74}} He was backed by jazz, blues and R&amp;B session players including violinist [[Don "Sugarcane" Harris]], drummers [[John Guerin]] and [[Paul Humphrey]], multi-instrumentalist and previous member of the Mothers of Invention [[Ian Underwood]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Shuggie Otis]] on bass, along with a guest appearance by [[Captain Beefheart]] (providing vocals to the only non-instrumental track, "Willie the Pimp"). It became a popular album in England,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|109}} and had a major influence on the development of the [[jazz-rock fusion]] genre.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|194}}

===Rebirth of the Mothers and filmmaking===
[[File:FRANK ZAPPA3.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Zappa in Paris, early 1970s]]
In 1970 Zappa met conductor [[Zubin Mehta]]. They arranged a May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, the music was mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie ''[[200 Motels]]''.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|109}} Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|88}} His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt that the quality of performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|142–56}}

Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of the Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the "of Invention"). It included British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]] (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of [[the Turtles]]: bass player [[Jim Pons]], and singers [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]], who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name "The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie", or "[[Flo &amp; Eddie]]".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|201}}

This version of the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album ''[[Chunga's Revenge]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|205}} which was followed by the double-album soundtrack to the movie ''200 Motels'' (1971), featuring the Mothers, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Theodore Bikel]], and [[Keith Moon]]. Co-directed by Zappa and [[Tony Palmer]], it was filmed in a week at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|183}} Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting.&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|183}} The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|207}} It was the first feature film photographed on [[videotape]] and transferred to [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]], a process that allowed for novel visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;Starks, 1982, ''Cocaine Fiends and Reefer Madness'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It was released to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|94}} The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|119–37}}

After ''200 Motels'', the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, ''[[Fillmore East – June 1971]]'' and ''[[Just Another Band from L.A.]]''; the latter included the 20-minute track "[[Billy the Mountain]]", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances—which used songs to build sketches based on ''200 Motels'' scenes, as well as new situations that often portrayed the band members' sexual encounters on the road.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|203–04}}{{refn|group=nb|During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. This performance was recorded, and Lennon released excerpts on his album ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' in 1972. Zappa later released his version of excerpts from the concert on ''[[Playground Psychotics]]'' in 1992, including the jam track "Scumbag" and an extended avant-garde vocal piece by Ono (originally called "Au"), which Zappa renamed "A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono.}}

===Accident, attack and aftermath===
[[File:Frank Zappa Mothers of Invention 1971.JPG|right|thumb|Zappa with the Mothers, 1971]]

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_WakaJawaka.ogg|description=The closing track on ''Waka/Jawaka'', one of Zappa's jazz-oriented albums.|title="Waka/Jawaka" (1971)|pos=right}}
On December 4, 1971, Zappa suffered his first of two serious setbacks. While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}} Immortalized in [[Deep Purple]]'s song "[[Smoke on the Water]]", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' compilation. After losing $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1971|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) worth of equipment and a week's break, the Mothers played at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], London, with rented gear. During the encore, audience member Trevor Howell pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}}

This attack resulted in an extended period of wheelchair confinement, making touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "Zomby Woof" and "[[Dancin' Fool]]"), resulting in chronic back pain.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|112–115}} Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.

During 1971–72 Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|101}} Musically, the albums were akin to ''Hot Rats,'' in that they featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|225–26}} Zappa began touring again in late 1972.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|225–26}} His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece [[big band]] referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Official recordings of these bands did not emerge until more than 30&amp;nbsp;years later on ''[[Wazoo (album)|Wazoo]]'' (2007) and ''[[Imaginary Diseases]]'' (2006), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top 10 album: ''Apostrophe ({{'}})''===
Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included [[Ian Underwood]] (reeds, keyboards), [[Ruth Underwood]] (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] (sax, flute and vocals), [[Bruce Fowler]] (trombone), [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]] (bass), [[Chester Thompson]] (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), [[George Duke]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin).

By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created [[DiscReet Records]], also distributed by Warner Bros.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|231}} Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album ''[[Apostrophe (')]]'' (1974), which reached a career-high No.&amp;nbsp;10 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] pop album charts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}} | title= Frank Zappa &gt; Charts and Awards &gt; Billboard Albums | work=AllMusic |accessdate=January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped by the No.&amp;nbsp;86 chart hit "[[Don't Eat the Yellow Snow Suite|Don't Eat The Yellow Snow]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53148|pure_url=yes}} | title= Apostrophe (').

===Business breakups and touring===
[[File:Frank Zappa - Capt. Beefheart - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Zappa with [[Captain Beefheart]], seated left, during a 1975 concert]]
Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|250}} Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' (1976) directly to [[Warner Bros.]], thereby bypassing DiscReet.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|253, 258–59}}

In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for ''[[Läther]]'' (pronounced "leather"), a four-LP project. ''Läther'' encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|131}} Zappa managed to get an agreement with [[Phonogram Inc.]], and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|261}} Zappa responded by appearing on the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], allowing them to broadcast ''Läther'' and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings.&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|248}} A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the ''Läther'' material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]].&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|267}}{{refn|group=nb|When the music was first released on CD in 1991, Zappa chose to rerelease the four existing albums. ''Läther'' was released posthumously in 1996. It remains debated whether Zappa had conceived the material as a four-LP set from the beginning, or only when approaching Phonogram.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|49}} In the liner notes to the 1996 release, Gail Zappa states that "As originally conceived by Frank, ''Läther'' was always a 4-record box set."}}

Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts,&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|49}} the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|261}} Drummer [[Terry Bozzio]] became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and original Mothers of Invention bassist [[Roy Estrada]] joined. Among other musicians were bassist [[Patrick O'Hearn]], singer-guitarist [[Ray White]] and keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]]. In December 1976, Zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the [[NBC]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|262}} Zappa's song "[[I'm the Slime]]" was performed with a voice-over by ''SNL'' booth announcer [[Don Pardo]], who also introduced "Peaches En Regalia" on the same airing. In 1978, Zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches. The performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member [[John Belushi]] during the instrumental piece "The Purple Lagoon". Belushi appeared as his Samurai Futaba character playing the tenor sax with Zappa conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Zappa, Frank, 1978, ''Zappa in New York'', Liner Notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The double album ''Sheik Yerbouti'' was the first release on [[Zappa Records]], and contained the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single "Dancin' Fool", which reached No.&amp;nbsp;45 on the ''Billboard'' charts,&lt;ref name="BBsingles"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}}|title=Frank Zappa&gt; Charts &amp; Awards&gt; Billboard Singles|work=AllMusic |accessdate=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Jewish Princess (song)|Jewish Princess]]", which received attention when a Jewish group, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), attempted to prevent the song from receiving radio airplay due to its alleged [[anti-Semitic]] lyrics.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|234}} Zappa vehemently denied any anti-Semitic sentiments, and dismissed the ADL as a "noisemaking organization that tries to apply pressure on people in order to manufacture a stereotype image of Jews that suits their idea of a good time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=He's Only 38 and He Knows How to Nasty|last=Peterson|first=Chris|journal=Relix Magazine|date=November 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's commercial success was attributable in part to "[[Bobby Brown (song)|Bobby Brown]]".

On December 21, 1979, Zappa's movie ''[[Baby Snakes]]'' premiered in New York. The movie's tagline was "A movie about people who do stuff that is not normal".&lt;ref&gt;Baby Snakes, 2003, ''DVD cover'', Eagle Vision.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2&amp;nbsp;hour and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes movie was based on footage from concerts in New York around Halloween 1977, with a band featuring keyboardist [[Tommy Mars]] and percussionist [[Ed Mann]] (who would both return on later tours) as well as guitarist [[Adrian Belew]]. It also contained several extraordinary sequences of [[clay animation]] by [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]] who had earlier provided animation sequences to Zappa for a 1974 TV special (which became available on the 1982 video ''[[The Dub Room Special]]'').&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|}}282 The movie did not do well in theatrical distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigpicturebigsound.com/article_501.shtml|title=Baby Snakes|format= DVD|last=Sohmer|first=Adam|date=June 8, 2005|publisher=Big Picture Big Sound |accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but won the Premier Grand Prix at the First International Music Festival in Paris in 1981.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|282}}

After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released ''[[Tinsel Town Rebellion]]'' in 1981. It was the first release on his own [[Barking Pumpkin Records]],&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of ''[[sprechstimme]]'' (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer [[Vinnie Colaiuta]]).&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|284}} the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and "The Blue Light" have been described as a "hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|165}} The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist [[Steve Vai]], who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|283}}

The same year the double album ''[[You Are What You Is]]'' was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen]] (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house,&lt;ref name="Mix2003"/&gt; thereby giving him complete freedom in his work.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|269}} The album included one complex instrumental, "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53163|pure_url=yes}}|title=You Are What You Is. Review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dumb All Over" is a tirade on religion, as is "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against [[Televangelism|TV evangelists]] such as [[Jerry Falwell]] and [[Pat Robertson]] for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money.&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|169–75}} Songs like "Society Pages" and "I'm a Beautiful Guy" show Zappa's dismay with the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] era and its "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".&lt;ref name=lowe /&gt;{{rp|169–75}}
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_SYNPYG.ogg|description=The title track on ''Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar'' features Zappa's guitar improvisations.|title=Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More|pos=left}}
In 1981, Zappa also released three instrumental albums, ''[[Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar]]'', ''Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More'', and ''The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar'', which were initially sold via mail order, but later released through the [[CBS]] label due to popular demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zappa|first=Frank|title=Absolutely Frank.

The albums focus exclusively on Frank Zappa as a guitar soloist, and the tracks are predominantly live recordings from 1979 to 1980; they highlight Zappa's improvisational skills with "beautiful performances from the backing group as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swenson|first=John|journal=Guitar World|date=November 1981|title=Frank Zappa: Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another guitar-only album, ''[[Guitar (Frank Zappa album)|Guitar]]'', was released in 1988, and a third, ''[[Trance-Fusion]]'', which Zappa completed shortly before his death, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guitar Gods: The 25 Players who Made Rock History |edition=illustrated |first1=Bob |last1=Gulla |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-313-35806-7 |page=251 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC&amp;pg=PA251 Extract of page 251]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Valley Girl" and classical performances===
In May 1982, Zappa released ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch]]'', which featured his biggest selling single ever, the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated song "[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]" (topping out at No.&amp;nbsp;32 on the ''Billboard'' charts).&lt;ref name="BBsingles"/&gt; In her improvised lyrics to the song, Zappa's daughter [[Moon Zappa|Moon Unit]] satirized the patois of teenage girls from the [[San Fernando Valley]], which popularized many "[[Valspeak]]" expressions such as "gag me with a spoon", "fer sure, fer sure", "grody to the max", and "barf out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2677879|pure_url=yes}}|title="Valley Girl" --song review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, two different projects were released, beginning with ''[[The Man from Utopia]],'' a rock-oriented work. The album is eclectic, featuring the vocal-led "Dangerous Kitchen" and "The Jazz Discharge Party Hats", both continuations of the sprechstimme excursions on ''Tinseltown Rebellion.'' The second album, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. I]]'', contained orchestral Zappa compositions conducted by [[Kent Nagano]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO). A second record of these sessions, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. II]]'' was released in 1987. The material was recorded under a tight schedule with Zappa providing all funding, helped by the commercial success of "Valley Girl".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|146–56}} Zappa was not satisfied with the LSO recordings. One reason is "Strictly Genteel", which was recorded after the trumpet section had been out for drinks on a break: the track took 40 edits to hide out-of-tune notes.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|146–56}}

Conductor Nagano, who was pleased with the experience, noted that "in fairness to the orchestra, the music is humanly very, very difficult".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|315}} Some reviews noted that the recordings were the best representation of Zappa's orchestral work so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53172|pure_url=yes}}|title=London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 1.

===Synclavier===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Zappa_NavalAviation.ogg|description=A Zappa composition for classical ensemble from ''Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger''|title=Naval Aviation in Art?|pos=right}}
For the remainder of his career, much of Zappa's work was influenced by his use of the [[Synclavier]] as a compositional and performance tool. Even considering the complexity of the music he wrote, the Synclavier could realize anything he could dream up.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–73}} The Synclavier could be programmed to play almost anything conceivable, to perfection: "With the Synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages&amp;nbsp;... with ''one-millisecond'' accuracy—every time".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–73}} Even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians,&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|319}} Zappa viewed the Synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|172–173}}

In 1984, he released four albums. ''[[Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger]]'' contains orchestral works commissioned and conducted by celebrated conductor, composer and pianist [[Pierre Boulez]] (who was listed as an influence on ''Freak Out!''), and performed by his [[Ensemble InterContemporain]]. These were juxtaposed with premiere Synclavier pieces. Again, Zappa was not satisfied with the performances of his orchestral works, regarding them as under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks Boulez's demands for precision.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|73}} The Synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].

The album ''[[Thing-Fish]]'' was an ambitious three-record set in the style of a Broadway play dealing with a [[dystopia]]n "what-if" scenario involving feminism, homosexuality, manufacturing and distribution of the AIDS virus, and a [[eugenics]] program conducted by the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;The musical was eventually produced for the stage in 2003.

===Digital medium and last tour===
Around 1986, Zappa undertook a comprehensive re-release program of his earlier vinyl recordings.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|340}} He personally oversaw the remastering of all his 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s albums for the new digital compact disc medium.{{refn|group=nb|For a comprehensive comparison of vinyl of CD releases, see {{cite web|url=http://lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/|title=The Frank Zappa Album Versions Guide&amp;nbsp;– Index|series=The Zappa Patio|publisher=lukpac.org/~handmade/patio|accessdate=January 7, 2008}}}} Certain aspects of these re-issues were criticized by some fans as being unfaithful to the original recordings.&lt;ref&gt;For example, new drum and bass parts were used on the 1960s albums ''We're Only in It for the Money'' and ''Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets''. See Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p.&amp;nbsp;327.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly twenty years before the advent of online music stores, Zappa had proposed to replace "phonographic record merchandising" of music by "direct digital-to-digital transfer" through phone or cable TV (with royalty payments and consumer billing automatically built into the accompanying software).&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|337–39}} In 1989, Zappa considered his idea a "miserable flop".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|337–39}}

The album ''[[Jazz from Hell]],'' released in 1986, earned Zappa his first [[Grammy Award]] in 1988 for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]]. Except for one live guitar solo ("St. Etienne"), the album exclusively featured compositions brought to life by the Synclavier. Although an [[instrumental]] album, containing no lyrics, Meyer Music Markets sold ''Jazz from Hell'' featuring an "explicit lyrics" sticker—a warning label introduced by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in an agreement with the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuzum|first=Eric|year=2001|title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-16772-1|pages=39, 255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa's last tour in a rock and jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a repertoire of over 100 (mostly Zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|346–50}} The tour was documented on the albums ''[[Broadway the Hard Way]]'' (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis); ''[[The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life]]'' (Zappa "standards" and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[Stairway to Heaven]]''); and ''[[Make a Jazz Noise Here]]''. Parts are also found on ''You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore'', volumes [[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4|4]] and [[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 6|6]]. Recordings from this tour also appear on the 2006 album [[Trance-Fusion]].

In 1990, Zappa was diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]]. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered inoperable.&lt;ref name="Pulse1993"/&gt; After the diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and [[Synclavier]] works. Shortly before his death in 1993 he completed ''[[Civilization Phaze III]]'', a major Synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|374–75}}{{refn|group=nb|It brought him a posthumous [[Grammy Award]] (with Gail Zappa) for [[Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package|Best Recording Package&amp;nbsp;– Boxed]] in 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search|title=Grammy Winners|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}}}

In 1991, Zappa was chosen to be one of four featured composers at the Frankfurt Festival in 1992 (the others were [[John Cage]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and [[Alexander Knaifel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Menn| editor-first=Don|contribution=Andreas Mölich-Zebhauser—Preparing the Ensemble Modern for the Frankfurt Festival|title=Zappa!

Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|369}} Zappa also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|369}} Zappa also performed in 1991 in [[Prague]], claiming that "was the first time that he had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to "try to keep your country unique, do not change it into something else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/Adieu_CA.html |title=Pražský Výběr—Adieu CA |website=Globalia.net |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UFtHqDrJ-fA|Frank Zappa Last Performance (Prague 1991)}} at 3:50&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1992, the concerts went ahead as scheduled but Zappa could only appear at two in Frankfurt due to illness. At the first concert, he conducted the opening "Overture", and the final "[[G-Spot Tornado]]" as well as the theatrical "Food Gathering in Post-Industrial America, 1992" and "Welcome to the United States" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor [[Peter Rundel]]). Zappa received a 20-minute ovation.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|371}} G-Spot Tornado was performed with Canadian dancer [[Louise Lecavalier]]. It was his last professional public appearance as the cancer was spreading to such an extent that he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found "exhilarating".&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|371}} Recordings from the concerts appeared on ''[[The Yellow Shark]]'' (1993), Zappa's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous ''[[Everything Is Healing Nicely]]'' (1999).

===Death===
Zappa died, after his long battle with prostate cancer, on December 4, 1993, 17 days before his 53rd birthday at his home with his wife and children by his side. At a private ceremony the following day, his body was buried in a grave at the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]], in Los Angeles. The grave is unmarked.&lt;ref name=watson05 /&gt;{{rp|552}}&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|379–80}} On December 6, his family publicly announced that "Composer Frank Zappa left for his final tour just before 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm on Saturday".&lt;ref name=slaven03 /&gt;{{rp|320}}

===Influences===
Zappa grew up influenced by [[avant-garde]] composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]]; 1950s blues artists [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]], [[Guitar Slim]], [[Johnny Guitar Watson]], and [[B.B. King]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afka.net/Articles/1987-01_Guitar_Player.htm|title=Frank Zappa On&amp;nbsp;...

His own heterogeneous ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around greater Los Angeles, were crucial in the formation of Zappa as a practitioner of [[underground music]] and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards "mainstream" social, political and musical movements. He frequently lampooned musical fads like [[psychedelia]], [[rock opera]] and [[disco]].&lt;ref name=watson96 /&gt;{{rp|13}}{{refn|group=nb|Among his many musical satires are the 1967 songs "Flower Punk" (which parodies the song "[[Hey Joe]]") and "Who Needs the Peace Corps?", which are critiques of the late-Sixties commercialization of the [[hippie]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Producer as Composer: Shaping the Sounds of Popular Music|edition=illustrated|first1=Virgil|last1=Moorefield |publisher=MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-262-51405-7|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZ0R4_Oxr-4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Television also exerted a strong influence, as demonstrated by quotations from show themes and advertising jingles found in his later works.&lt;ref name="quotes"/&gt;

===Project/Object===

===Techniques===

====Guitar playing====

Zappa is widely recognized as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. In a 1983 issue of ''Guitar World'', Jon Swenson declared: "the fact of the matter is that [Zappa] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/frank-zappa-talks-gear-praises-steve-vai-his-first-guitar-world-interview-1982 |title=Frank Zappa Talks Gear, Praises Steve Vai in His First Guitar World Interview from 1982 |publisher=Guitar World |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. A November 2016 feature by the editors of ''Guitar Player'' magazine wrote: "Brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, Zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." The symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. He was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by "unusual rhythmic combinations". His left hand was capable of smooth [[legato]] technique, while Zappa's right was "one of the fastest pick hands in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/artist-lessons/1026/frank-zappa-shut-up-n-learn-his-guitar-techniques--tab--audio/56754 |title=Frank Zappa: Shut Up 'N Learn His Guitar Techniques &amp;#124; TAB + AUDIO |publisher=GuitarPlayer |date=2016-11-23 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His song "Outside Now" from ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' poked fun at the negative reception of Zappa's guitar technique by those more commercially minded, as the song's narrator lives in a world where music is outlawed and he imagines "imaginary guitar notes that would irritate/An executive kind of guy", lyrics that are followed by one of Zappa's characteristically quirky solos in 11/8 time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Franรงois Couture |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/outside-now-mt0006332790 |title="Outside Now" – Frank Zappa &amp;#124; Song Info |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zappa transcriptionist Kasper Sloots wrote, "Zappa's guitar solos aren't meant to show off technically (Zappa hasn't claimed to be a big virtuoso on the instrument), but for the pleasure it gives trying to build a composition right in front of an audience without knowing what the outcome will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zappa-analysis.com/shuttxt.htm |title=Shut up 'n play yer guitar |website=Zappa-analysis.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  English guitarist and bandleader [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] opined that Zappa was "very interesting as a human being and a very interesting composer" and that he "was a very good musician but he was a dictator in his band," and that he "was taking very long guitar solos -- 10-15 minute guitar solos and really he should have taken two or three minute guitar solos, because they were a little bit boring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hit-channel.com/interview-john-mclaughlin-solo-mahavishnu-orchestra-miles-davis/151278 | title=Interview: John McLaughlin (solo, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis) • Hit Channel| date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tape manipulation====
In New York, Zappa increasingly used [[audio engineer|tape editing]] as a compositional tool.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|160}} A prime example is found on the double album ''[[Uncle Meat]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;James, 2000, '' Necessity Is&amp;nbsp;...'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; where the track "King Kong" is edited from various studio and live performances. Zappa had begun regularly recording concerts,{{refn|group=nb|In the process, he built up a vast archive of live recordings. In the late 1980s some of these recordings were collected for the 12-CD set ''You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore''.}} and because of his insistence on precise [[Out of tune|tuning]] and timing, he was able to augment his studio productions with excerpts from live shows, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Mix2003"&gt;
{{cite web|title=We are The Mothers&amp;nbsp;... and This Is What We Sound Like!|last=Michie|first=Chris|publisher=MixOnline.com|date=January 2003|url=http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound|accessdate=January 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308055438/http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound/|archivedate=March 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he combined recordings of different compositions into new pieces, irrespective of the [[tempo]] or [[Meter (music)|meter]] of the sources. He dubbed this process "[[xenochrony]]" (strange synchronizations&lt;ref&gt;Bob Marshall, "Interview with Frank Zappa", October 22, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;)—reflecting the Greek "xeno" (alien or strange) and "chronos" (time).&lt;ref name="Mix2003"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Zappa was married to Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman from 1960 to 1963. In 1967, he married [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/deathcert/zappa,%20frank_dc.pdf |format=PDF |title=Frank Zappa death certificate |website=Autopsyfiles.org |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rock Stars Do The Dumbest Things|first1=Margaret|last1=Moser|first2=Bill|last2=Crawford|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4299-7838-5|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exdHqRsPWAUC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=exdHqRsPWAUC&amp;pg=PT260 Extract of page 260]&lt;/ref&gt; He and his second wife had four children: [[Moon Zappa|Moon]], [[Dweezil Zappa|Dweezil]], [[Ahmet Zappa|Ahmet]] and [[Diva Zappa|Diva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story Of Frank Zappa|first1=Neil|last1=Slaven|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-85712-043-4|page=529|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lNRIZm_baQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4lNRIZm_baQC&amp;pg=PT529 Extract of page 529]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Zappa's death, his widow Gail created the Zappa Family Trust, which owns the rights to Zappa's music and other creative output: more than 60 albums were released during Zappa's lifetime and 40 posthumously.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-ca-ms-frank-zappa-legacy/|title=It's brother and sister against brother and sister in bitter fight over control of Frank Zappa's legacy|last=Randall Roberts|website=www.latimes.com|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Gail's death in October 2015, Zappa's youngest children, Ahmet and Diva, were given control of the trust with shares of 30% each, while his older children, Moon and Dweezil, were given smaller shares of 20% each.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-the-zappa-family-feud-w431684|title=Inside the Zappa Family Feud|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and politics==

===Drugs===
Zappa stated that he tried smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] approximately ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin or any of that other stuff".&lt;ref name="Loder 1988"/&gt; Zappa stated, "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would affect your life that you don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/Part03.html |title=Interview by Bob Marshall, October 22, 1988 – Part 03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130223085837/http://home.online.no/~corneliu/Part03.html |archivedate=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a heavy [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smoker]] for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.{{refn|group=nb|He considered such campaigns as [[yuppie]] inventions and noted that "Some people like garlic.&amp;nbsp;... I like pepper, tobacco and coffee. That's my [[metabolism]]".&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|234–35}}}}

While he disapproved of drug use, he criticized the [[War on Drugs]], comparing it to [[alcohol prohibition]], and stated that the [[United States Treasury]] would benefit from the decriminalization and regulation of drugs.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|329}} Describing his philosophical views, Zappa stated, "I believe that people have a right to decide their own destinies; people own themselves. I also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only so long as) individual citizens give it a 'temporary license to exist'—in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself. In a democracy, you own the government—it doesn't own you."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315–16, 323–24, 329–30}}

===Government and religion===
[[File:Praga 7 zappa havel.jpg|left|thumb|Zappa with [[Václav Havel]], 1990]]

In a 1991 interview, Zappa reported that he was a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] but added "that might not last long—I'm going to shred that".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=XgJvMwAscO0|''web Interview with Mienfoking Films''}} (4:50)&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a "[[Conservatism in the United States|practical conservative]]".{{Refn|group=nb|"Politically, I consider myself to be a (don't laugh) 'Practical Conservative'. I want a smaller, less intrusive government, and lower taxes. What? You too?"&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315}}}} He favored [[limited government]] and low [[Taxation|taxes]]; he also stated that he approved of national defense, [[Social Security (United States)|social security]], and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315–16, 323–24; 329–30}} He favored capitalism, [[entrepreneurship]], and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-19/business/fi-721_1_frank-zappa|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 19, 1989|title=Frank Zappa, Capitalist Rocker|author1=Apodaca, Patrice|accessdate=October 3, 2016|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Anti-communism|opposed]] communism, stating, "A system that doesn't allow ownership&amp;nbsp;... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw."&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|315–16, 323–24, 329–30}} He had always encouraged his fans to [[Voter registration|register to vote]] on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|348}} He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|365}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Routledge History of Social Protest in Popular Music |edition=illustrated |first1=Jonathan C. |last1=Friedman |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-136-44729-7 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC16oLUzlSIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BC16oLUzlSIC&amp;pg=PA151 Extract of page 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and [[anti-intellectualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview in Playboy|url=http://zappa.rockmetal.art.pl/wywiady/playboy.htm|publisher=Playboy|date=May 2, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President [[Ronald Reagan]], the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)]], [[televangelism]], and the [[Christian Right]], and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a "fascist theocracy".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Zappa, ''Does Humor Belong in Music?''

In early 1990, Zappa visited [[Czechoslovakia]] at the request of [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] [[Václav Havel]].

===Anti-censorship===

Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on [[CNN|CNN's]] ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' TV series and debated issues with ''Washington Times'' commentator [[John Lofton]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="CNN TV Debate"/&gt; On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the [[United States Senate]] Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by [[Tipper Gore]], wife of then-senator [[Al Gore]]. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 2000, ''Censorship'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the "Blank Tape Tax." Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://urbigenous.net/library/zappa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship,&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|267}} and called their proposal for voluntary [[Parental Advisory|labelling of records]] with explicit content "extortion" of the music industry.&lt;ref name=Occhiogrosso /&gt;{{rp|262}}

In his prepared statement, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. In this context, the PMRC's demands are the equivalent of treating [[dandruff]] by [[decapitation]].&amp;nbsp;... The establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, opens the door to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things certain Christians do not like. What if the next bunch of Washington wives demands a [[Yellow badge|large yellow "J"]] on all material written or performed by Jews, in order to save helpless children from exposure to concealed Zionist doctrine?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/p51.html|title=Record Labeling.

Zappa set excerpts from the PMRC hearings to Synclavier music in his composition "Porn Wars" on the 1985 album ''[[Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention]]'', and the full recording was released in 2010 as ''[[Congress Shall Make No Law...]]'' Zappa is heard interacting with Senators [[Fritz Hollings]], [[Slade Gorton]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name=lowe194&gt;{{cite book |title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa |first1=Kelly | last1=Fisher Lowe |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8032-6005-4 |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC&amp;pg=PA194 Extract of page 194]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Frank Zappa in popular culture}}

Zappa had a controversial critical standing during his lifetime. As [[Geoffrey Himes]] noted in 1993 after the artist's death, Zappa was hailed as a genius by conductor [[Kent Nagano]] and nominated by Czechoslovakian President [[Vaclav Havel]] to the country's cultural ambassadorship, but he was in his lifetime rejected twice for admission into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and been found by critics to lack emotional depth. In ''[[Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] dismissed Zappa's music as "sexist adolescent drivel ... with meters and voicings and key changes that are as hard to play as they are easy to forget."&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|date=December 12, 1993|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1993/12/12/pop-recordings/2e1e34bf-05aa-438b-b2c7-20f8e640600d/|title=Pop Recordings|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Himes:

{{quote|"Admirers and detractors agree that Zappa's music -- with its odd time signatures, unorthodox harmonies and fiendishly difficult lines -- boasts a rare cerebral complexity. But that's where the agreement ends. Some fans find his sophomoric jokes ("Don't Eat the Yellow Snow") and pop music parodies ("Sheik Yerbouti") a crucial counterbalance to the rarefied density of the music; other devotees find the jokes an irrelevant sideshow to music best appreciated in a chamber or orchestral setting. The critics find the humor's smug iconoclasm a symptom of the essential emptiness of Zappa's intellectual exercises."&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;}}

===Acclaim and honors===
{{quote box|quote=Frank Zappa was one of the first to try tearing down the barriers between rock, jazz, and classical music. In the late Sixties his Mothers of Invention would slip from Stravinsky's "Petroushka" into The Dovells' "Bristol Stomp" before breaking down into saxophone squeals inspired by Albert Ayler|source= — ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll''&lt;!-- found on p. 497 --&gt;|width=365px}}

''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004) writes: "Frank Zappa dabbled in virtually all kinds of music—and, whether guised as a satirical rocker, jazz-rock fusionist, guitar virtuoso, electronics wizard, or orchestral innovator, his eccentric genius was undeniable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Brackett|editor-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide: Completely Revised and Updated 4th Edition|year=2004|place=New York, New York|publisher=Fireside|page=903|isbn=978-0-7432-0169-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his work drew inspiration from many different genres, Zappa was seen as establishing a coherent and personal expression.

In 1971, biographer David Walley noted that "The whole structure of his music is unified, not neatly divided by dates or time sequences and it is all building into a composite".&lt;ref&gt;Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; On commenting on Zappa's music, politics and philosophy, [[Barry Miles]] noted in 2004 that they cannot be separated: "It was all one; all part of his 'conceptual continuity'."&lt;ref name=miles /&gt;{{rp|383}}
[[File:Zappa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Frank Zappa in 1977]]
''[[Guitar Player]]'' devoted a special issue to Zappa in 1992, and asked on the cover "Is FZ America's Best Kept Musical Secret?" Editor Don Menn remarked that the issue was about "The most important composer to come out of modern popular music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Don|last=Menn|editor-last=Menn|editor-first=Don|contribution=From the Editor|title=Zappa!

Among those contributing to the issue was composer and [[musicologist]] [[Nicolas Slonimsky]], who conducted premiere performances of works of [[Charles Ives|Ives]] and Varèse in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kozinn|first=Allan|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D61539F934A15751C1A963958260|title=Nicolas Slonimsky, Author of Widely Used Reference Works on Music, Dies at 101|date=December 27, 1996|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=August 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became friends with Zappa in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;In December 1981, the then 87-year-old Slonimsky made a guest appearance on piano at a Zappa concert. Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp.&amp;nbsp;295–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and said, "I admire everything Frank does, because he practically created the new musical millennium.

Conductor [[Kent Nagano]] remarked in the same issue that "Frank is a genius. That's a word I don't use often&amp;nbsp;... In Frank's case it is not too strong&amp;nbsp;... He is extremely literate musically. I'm not sure if the general public knows that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Menn|editor-first=Don|contribution=Kent Nagano—Premiering Zappa with the London Symphony Orchestra|title=Zappa!

There, it was written that "Frank Zappa was rock and roll's sharpest musical mind and most astute social critic. He was the most prolific composer of his age, and he bridged genres—rock, jazz, classical, avant-garde and even novelty music—with masterful ease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/frank-zappa|title=Frank Zappa|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/lifetime-awards|title=Lifetime achievement award|publisher=grammy.org|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ranked number 36 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; in 2000.

In 2005, the U.S. [[National Recording Preservation Board]] included ''We're Only in It for the Money'' in the [[National Recording Registry]] as "Frank Zappa's inventive and iconoclastic album presents a unique political stance, both anti-conservative and anti-counterculture, and features a scathing satire on hippiedom and America's reactions to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2005reg.html|title=The National Recording Registry 2005|date=May 24, 2005|series=National Recording Preservation Board|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him at No.&amp;nbsp;71 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.&lt;ref name="RSImmortals"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/frank-zappa-20110420|title=100 Greatest Artists|publisher=Rolling Stone Music|accessdate=May 1, 2013|date=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists from various fields have honored Zappa by naming new discoveries after him. In 1967, paleontologist Leo P. Plas, Jr. identified an extinct [[mollusc]] in Nevada and named it ''Amaurotoma zappa'' with the motivation that, "The specific name, ''zappa'', honors Frank Zappa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plas, Jr.|first=Leo P.|title=Mollusca from the Arrow Canyon Range, Clark County, Nevada|date=March 1972|journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]]|volume=46|pages=249–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, biologist Ed Murdy named a [[genus]] of [[gobiidae|gobiid]] fishes of New Guinea ''Zappa'', with a [[species]] named ''Zappa confluentus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murdy|first=E.O.|title=A Taxonomic Revision and Cladistic Analysis of the Oxudercine Gobies (Gobiidae: Oxudercinae)|publisher=Records of the Australian Museum|year=1989|isbn=978-0-7305-6374-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist Ferdinando Boero named a Californian [[jellyfish]] ''Phialella zappai'' (1987), noting that he had "pleasure in naming this species after the modern music composer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boero|first=Ferdinando|title=Life cycles of Phialella zappai n. sp., Phialella fragilis and Phialella sp.

Belgian biologists Bosmans and Bosselaers discovered in the early 1980s a Cameroonese spider, which they in 1994 named ''[[Pachygnatha zappa]]'' because "the ventral side of the abdomen of the female of this species strikingly resembles the artist's legendary moustache".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosmans|first=Robert|last2=Bosselaers|first2=Jan|title=Spiders of the genera ''Pachygnatha'', ''Dyschiriognatha'' and ''Glenognatha'' (Araneae, Tetragnathidae), with a revision of the Afrotropical species|date=October 1995|journal=Zoologica Scripta|volume=23|pages=325–52|doi=10.1111/j.1463-6409.1994.tb00392.x|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gene of the bacterium ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'' that causes urinary tract infections was in 1995 named ''zapA'' by three biologists from Maryland.

In the late 1990s, American paleontologists Marc Salak and Halard L. Lescinsky discovered a [[animal|metazoan]] fossil, and named it ''Spygori zappania'' to honor "the late Frank Zappa&amp;nbsp;... whose mission paralleled that of the earliest paleontologists: to challenge conventional and traditional beliefs when such beliefs lacked roots in logic and reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spygoria zappania New Genus and Species, a Cloudina-like Biohermal Metazoan from the Lower Cambrian of Central Nevada|last=Salak|first=Marc|last2=Lescinsky|first2=Halard L.|journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]]|volume=73|issue=4|date=July 1999|pages=571–76|doi=10.1017/s002233600003239x|bibcode=1974JPal...48..524M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, lobbying efforts initiated by psychiatrist John Scialli led the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] to name an [[asteroid]] in Zappa's honor: [[3834 Zappafrank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seachrist|first=Lisa|title=Space Rock Gets Zappa'd|journal=Science|volume=265|issue=5174|date=August 12, 1994|page=871|doi=10.1126/science.265.5174.871-c |pmid=17782133|bibcode=1994Sci...265..871.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The asteroid was discovered in 1980 by Czechoslovakian astronomer [[Ladislav Brožek]], and the citation for its naming says that "Zappa was an eclectic, self-trained artist and composer&amp;nbsp;... Before 1989 he was regarded as a symbol of democracy and freedom by many people in Czechoslovakia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/special/rocknroll/0003834.html|title=(3834) Zappafrank|publisher=IAU: Minor Planet Center ([[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]])|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1995, a bust of Zappa by sculptor Konstantinas Bogdanas was installed in [[Vilnius]], the Lithuanian capital (54.683, 25.2759). The choice of Zappa was explained as "a symbol that would mark the end of communism, but at the same time express that it wasn't always doom and gloom."&lt;ref name="Pompilio"/&gt; A replica was offered to the city of Baltimore in 2008, and on September 19, 2010 — the twenty-fifth anniversary of Zappa's testimony to the U.S. Senate — a ceremony dedicating the replica was held, and the bust was unveiled at a library in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/entertainment/bs-ae-zappa-cover-0917-20100916_1_gail-zappa-southeast-anchor-library-lithuania|title=Zappa comes home|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/news/bs-ae-zappa-rail-0917-2-20100916_1_southeast-anchor-library-zappa-plays-zappa-zappa-related|title=Zappa-looza: A full guide to the weekend's events|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kakha Bendukidze==
[[File:KakhaBendukidze.jpg|thumb|[[Kakha Bendukidze]].]]
The Free University was founded by [[Kakha Bendukidze]] ({{lang-ka|კახა ბენდუქიძე}}; 20 April 1956 – 13 November 2014), [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] statesman, businessman and philanthropist.

A biologist by education, Bendukidze started his own business, Bioprocess, which manufactured biochemicals for scientific research  in 1987. Soon he became known as one of Russia’s leading [[libertarian]]s. He led a working group on tax and currency within the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and pressed for changes in tax policy, which ultimately included adoption of a flat 13 percent [[tax rate]]. In Russia, he was a strong opponent of [[mercantilism|government intervention in the economy]], a view that put him at odds with President [[Vladimir Putin]]. Soon Bendukidze sold his stake and moved back to Georgia.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herszenhorn|first1=David M.|title=Kakha Bendukidze Dies at 58; Pushed Post-Soviet Market Change|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/world/europe/kakha-bendukidze-dies-at-58-pushed-post-soviet-market-change.html?emc=edit_th_20141116&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=21209710&amp;_r=0|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Rose Revolution]], shortly after returning from Russia, he was appointed as Minister of Economy by former President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] and the late Prime Minister [[Zurab Jvania]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="tabula1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous Reformist Kakha Bendukidze Dies at 58|url=http://www.tabula.ge/en/story/89804-famous-reformist-kakha-bendukidze-dies-at-58|website=tabula.ge|publisher=Tabula, 2009–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Minister of Economy (June–December 2004), Minister for Reform Coordination (December 2004 – January 2008) and Head of the Chancellery of [[Cabinet of Georgia|Government of Georgia]] (February 2008 – February 2009) and was the author of liberal reforms that overhauled Georgia’s post-Soviet economy.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituaries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/godfather-of-georgias-reforms-dies-at-58/2014/11/14/ea0cc3cc-6bef-11e4-bafd-6598192a448d_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Bendukidze and his service as the Minister of Economics gave Georgia a yearly 9.3% [[economic growth]] in 2004–2007 and almost four times more foreign investments. The government managed to decrease the taxes fourfold, the number of licenses by 90% and liberalize the [[labour market]]. These liberal steps were what lead to the formation of the previously almost non-existent [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="tabula1"/&gt;

He created a charity called the [[Knowledge Foundation]], and he was the force behind the establishment of the Free University of Tbilisi and the [[Agricultural University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

'''Heinz Gollwitzer''' (30 January 1917 &amp;ndash; 26 December 1999) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]].  He held the chair of Modern Political and Social History at the [[University of Münster]].

== Life ==
Gollwitzer was born in [[Nuremberg]] and grew up in [[Munich]]. After being severely wounded in [[World War II]] he took up his studies (history and German literature) at the [[University of Munich]], earning his Ph.D. in 1944. He earned his qualification to teach as a professor in 1950 with a thesis called “The Image of Europe and the European Thought – Contributions to the German History of Ideas”. He subsequently taught at universities in Munich and Münster until retiring in 1982. He died in Munich.

== Scientific focus ==
Gollwitzer's books mostly deal with the history of [[mentality|mentalities]] and [[history of political ideas|political ideas]], as well as with German regional history and biography. Due to the preponderance of structural history in the German [[scientific community]] during the post war age, his impact on colleagues and students was rather small. This outsider position was to change from the beginning of the early Nineties, when historians became more and more sensible to [[universal history]] as well as to the relevance of personality in history, such in the case of the [[German nobility]] from the end of the [[ancien régime]] to the end of middle European monarchies in 1918, which was one of Gollwitzer's basic scientific aims.

[[Full Professor]] '''Henri Kuprashvili''' ({{lang-ka|ჰენრი კუპრაშვილი}}) (born 13 September 1946 in [[Khashuri]]) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Doctor of [[Political Sciences]], First Class State Councillor who is most notable for breaking a [[Guinness record]] for [[human swimming|swimming]] the [[Dardanelles]], with his [[hands]] and [[Foot|feet]] bound in a traditional [[Georgian swimming|Georgian style of swimming]], also known as [[Colchis|Colchian]]. Kuprashvili has been awarded the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Georgia|Order of Vakhtang Gorgasali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSAJxot4Dm0 |title=The Order of Vakhtang Gorgasali Second Class. Henri Kuprashvili. Eduard Shevardnadze. YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Byron|George Byron Golden Medal]].

==Swimming==
He was the first man to swim the [[Dardanelles]], from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]], with his hands and feet bound in four places following the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[military]]-[[training]] swimming style known as "Hands and feet bound Colchian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GzaXnH_6YM&amp;list=TL8l_qDwmmzXg|title=CNN - 05.11.2002. Henry Kuprashvili YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed this swim in three and a quarter hours, on August 30, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiatoday.ge/people_detailes.php?id=2&amp;version=432 |title=Henry Kuprashvili |work=Georgia Today |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the event, Kuprashvili went through a vigorous training schedule, including a 2 kilometre swim at "[[Laguna Vere]]". On January 28, 2001, Kuprashvili completed this swim in 92 minutes, using the same military-training swimming style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgMCL6O6xak&amp;list=TLO8p1pMKOnBI|title=CNN - 17.02.01. Henry Kuprashvili YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuprashvili is planning to swim across the [[Bosporus]], the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and the [[English Channel]], using the same style of swimming.

Henry Kuprashvili took part in Cross-Continental Swimming across the Bosphorus Strait from Asia to Europe in 01:03:14 (distance 6500 m.) organized by National Olympic Committee of Turkey on July 7, 2013 (took 16th place among 50 swimmers). More than 1500 swimmers from 37 different countries of the World took part in the Marathon.

Henry Kuprashvili’s another student, 17-year-old Ana Lominadze, using old Georgian Military-training style “Mkherdruli Kolkhuri” (Military Colchian), swam across the Dardanelle’s Strait on 30 August 2012. She swam 5 500 meters in 50 minutes. She was the first woman on earth that swam across the Dardanelle’s Strait from Asia to Europe using Georgian Military-training swimming style. The competition was dedicated to this the tenth anniversary after Henry Kuprashvili swimming across the Dardanelles Strait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjYODRddqw0|title=Georgian Records Federation - Ana Lominadze's world record (CNN YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6mwoBcGJWs|title=17 летняя девушка плывет со связанными руками и ногами YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takvim.com.tr/Dunya/2012/09/02/balik-gibi-bogazi-gecti |title=Balık gibi boğazı geçti - Takvim - 02 Eylül 2012 |publisher=Takvim |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturkwebtv.com/2012/yasam/9/1/canakkale-bogazini-elleri-kollari-bagli-yuzerek-gecti |title=Çanakkale Boğazı'nı elleri-kolları bağlı yüzerek geçti CNN TÜRK Video |publisher=Cnnturkwebtv.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anna_Lominadze_swimming_Free_Colchian_style.jpg |title=File:Anna Lominadze swimming Free Colchian style.jpg - Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Kuprashvili is credited with reviving the [[Georgian swimming|Georgian style of swimming]], which consists of several styles ([[Georgian style of swimming “Lazuri” (free Kolkhuri)|“Lazuri” (Free Colchian)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/udrekeli#p/a/u/2/n4wfWpcdUnA |title=The first swimming championship in Georgian style of swimming Lazuri (free Kolkhuri) YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Mkherdruli Kolkhuri” (Military Colchian)- “Hands and feet bound Kolkhuri”, “Apkhazuri” ([[Abkhaz language|Abkhazian]]), “Okribula”, “Iberiuli” ([[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]]), “Takhvia” and partly “Khashuruli” and “Kizikuri”.), including the "Hands and feet bound Kolkhuri" as practised by Kuprashvili. He has initiated the study and development of a unique, Georgian method of swimming, and has written the first textbook about the methods of studying and training in Georgian national styles of swimming.

A swimming competition for young swimmers, trained in “Mkherdruli Kolkhuri” (Military Colchian) by Kuprashvili, was held  on September 3, 2006 at [[Tbilisi]].

==Penguin-related projects==
Perlman has created several films and books with [[penguin]] characters. Her short film ''The Tender Tale of Cinderella Penguin'' was adapted as the children's book  ''Cinderella Penguin''. Her satirical [[graphic novel]] ''Penguins Behind Bars'' was adapted as a 2003 Hulascope/NFB animated short of the same name, which received four awards including the Platinum Award for Independent Short Subject at the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.&lt;ref name=barscoll&gt;{{cite web|title=Penguins Behind Bars|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=51290|work=Collection page|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short aired on [[Adult Swim]], Cartoon Network's late night programming block, in 2003, but was not made into a full series. She has also written and illustrated the books ''The Emperor Penguin's New Clothes'' and ''The Penguin and the Pea''.&lt;ref name=Lenburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brownstein/&gt;

==National Film Board of Canada==
In addition to ''The Tender Tale of Cinderella Penguin'' and ''Penguins Behind Bars'', Perlman's NFB credits include the 1976 animated short ''Lady Fishbourne's Complete Guide to Better Table Manners'', winner of first prize in the instructional films category at the Ottawa International Film Festival,&lt;ref name=ladycoll&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Fishbourne's Complete Guide to Better Table Manners|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=11521|work=Collection page|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the 2005 short ''Invasion of the Space Lobsters'', a co-production of the NFB with the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], which is a "tongue-in-cheek look at doublespeak and bafflegab."&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Perlman Janet |url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/portraits/262/ |work=NFB Profiles |publisher=National Film Board of Canada |accessdate=25 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929154351/http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/portraits/262/ |archivedate=29 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an animator on ''The Hottest Show on Earth'' (1977) and co-directed ''[[Why Me? (1978 film)|Why Me?]]'' with Derek Lamb (1978), and contributed animation work to [[Alison Snowden]] and David Fine's Oscar-winning NFB co-produced short ''[[Bob's Birthday]]''.&lt;ref name=Lenburg/&gt;

===''ShowPeace'' Series===
While at the NFB, Perlman developed the ''ShowPeace'' animation series [[conflict resolution]], including her short film ''[[Bully Dance]]'', which received thirteen awards, including the Award for Best Animated Short Film from the Children's Jury and the Grand Prix de Montréal for Best Short Film at the Festival International du film pour enfants and First Prize in short film &amp; video animation in recognition of outstanding achievement in children's media from the [[Chicago International Children's Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="collbully"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bully Dance/La danse des brutes|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=33918|work=Collection page|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Perlman's films for the series, ''Dinner For Two'', received a dozen awards including a Grand Prix des Amériques at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] and a UNICEF Jury Award for Best Short Film at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Lenburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=colldinner&gt;{{cite web|title=Dinner for Two|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=33131|work=Collection page|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Dinner for Two'' was later adapted by Perlman as the book ''The Delicious Bug''.&lt;ref name=Brownstein/&gt;

==Hulascope Studio==
With film composer and former NFB colleague Judith Gruber-Stitzer, Perlman formed Hulascope Studio to produce animated projects for television.&lt;ref name=Lenburg/&gt; ''Penguins Behind Bars'', a parody of the [[women in prison film]]s of the 1950s, was co-produced by Hulascope and the NFB for [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]], and co-written by Perlman with Derek Lamb.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;{{cite news|last=Deneroff|first=Harvey|title=Cartoons on the Bay 2004 Report|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/cartoons-bay-2004-report/page/3,1|accessdate=25 January 2011|newspaper=[[Animation World Network]]|date=17 May 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918074014/http://www.awn.com/articles/cartoons-bay-2004-report/page/3,1|archive-date=2011-09-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
Perlman's latest film, originally entitled ''Llama Cookin'', which was entered into the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] before it even existed. With the film due at the festival in just two weeks, Perlman quickly assembled ''Llama Cookin'' with animation [[outtakes]] from her computer. Unhappy with the results, she tried to withdraw the film from the festival online but couldn't figure out how to do so. So she changed the title of the film to ''Sorry Film Not Ready'' in the online entry form, hoping festival organizers would get the message. But when the two-week deadline came, Perlman received a notification that they had yet to receive a film entitled ''Sorry Film Not Ready'' and were extending the deadline. So Perlman completed a one-minute film under the title ''Sorry Film Not Ready'' and it was accepted by the Ottawa festival.&lt;ref name=Brownstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=brew&gt;{{cite web|title=Sorry Film Not Ready" by Janet Perlman |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/shorts/sorry-film-not-ready-by-janet-perlman.html |work=[[Cartoon Brew]] |accessdate=25 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124012229/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/shorts/sorry-film-not-ready-by-janet-perlman.html |archivedate=24 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1994 Ottawa International Animation Festival, Perlman's short ''My Favourite Things That I Love'' proved popular but confusing to the audience, and the jury awarded her a tongue-in-cheek "Best Bad Taste Award" for the film. The film then went on to receive a "Most Horrible Music Award" from the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Brownstein/&gt;

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Die Philosophie mit den sieben freien Künsten.JPG|thumb|''{{lang|la|Philosophia et septem artes liberales}}'', the seven liberal arts. From the {{lang|la|[[Hortus deliciarum]]}} of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (12th century)]]
'''Liberal arts education''' (from [[Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|liberalis}} "free" and {{wikt-lang|la|ars}} "art or principled practice") can claim to be the oldest programme of [[higher education]] in Western history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liberalarts.org.uk/liberal-arts/|title=What is Liberal Arts? - Ancient, Medieval, Modern - Liberal Arts UK|website=www.liberalarts.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its origin in the attempt to discover first principles – 'those universal principles which are the condition of the possibility of the existence of anything and everything'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/882530818|title=Philosophy and modern liberal arts education : freedom is to learn|last=Nigel.|first=Tubbs,|isbn=9781137358912|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=882530818}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''liberal arts''' are those subjects or skills that in [[classical antiquity]] were considered essential for a free person ({{lang|la|liberalis}}, "worthy of a free person")&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Robert Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' [1948], trans. Willard R. Trask (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), p. 37. The classical sources include Cicero, ''De Oratore'', I.72–73, III.127, and ''De re publica,'' I.30.&lt;/ref&gt; to know in order to take an active part in civic life, something that (for [[ancient Greece]]) included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service. [[Grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]] were the core liberal arts (the [[trivium]]), while [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], the theory of [[music]], and [[astronomy]] also played a – somewhat lesser – part in education (as the [[quadrivium]]).&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liberal arts'' today can refer to academic subjects such as [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], and [[social science|social]] and [[science|physical sciences]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Oxford Dictionary| work = [[The Oxford Dictionary]] | url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/liberal-arts?q=Liberal+arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''liberal arts education'' can refer to overall studies in a liberal arts degree program. For both interpretations, the term generally refers to matters not relating to the [[professional]], [[vocational]], or [[Technology|technical]] curriculum.

==History==
[[File:4283 Print 13536kopie.jpg|thumb|''Allegory of the seven liberal arts,'' [[The Phoebus Foundation]] ]]
Rooted in the basic curriculum – the {{transl|grc|enkuklios paideia}} or "education in a circle" – of late [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and [[Hellenistic Greece]], the "liberal arts" or "liberal pursuits" (Latin {{lang|la|liberalia studia}}) were already so called in formal education during the [[Roman Empire]]. The first recorded use of the term "liberal arts" ({{lang|la|artes liberales}}) occurs in {{lang|la|[[De Inventione]]}} by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], but it is unclear if he created the term.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Bruce. ''Orators and Philosophers''. New York: College Entrance Examination Board, 1995. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Inventione''. Book 1, Section 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger]] discusses liberal arts in education from a critical [[Stoicism|Stoic]] point of view in ''[[Moral Epistles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Schneider |url=http://www.stoics.com/seneca_epistles_book_2.html#%E2%80%98LXXXVIII1 |title=Seneca – ''Epistle'' 88|publisher=Stoics.com |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact classification of the liberal arts varied however in Roman times,&lt;ref name="H. Lausberg, 1998 p. 10"&gt;H. Lausberg, ''Handbook of Literary Rhetoric'' (1998) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only after [[Martianus Capella]] in the [[5th century AD]] influentially brought the seven liberal arts as bridesmaids to the ''[[De nuptiis|Marriage of Mercury and Philology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; that they took on canonical form.

{{anchor|Seven liberal arts|The seven liberal arts}}

The four 'scientific' {{lang|la|artes}} – music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy (or astrology) – were known from the time of [[Boethius]] onwards as the ''[[quadrivium]]''. After the 9th century, the remaining three arts of the '[[humanities]]' – grammar, logic, and rhetoric – were grouped as the [[trivium (education)|''trivium'']].&lt;ref name="H. Lausberg, 1998 p. 10" /&gt; It was in that two-fold form that the seven liberal arts were studied in the [[Medieval university|medieval Western university]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = James Burke: The Day the Universe Changed ''In the Light Of the Above''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgXzwOV-WNI&amp;t=02m26s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner1983"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfQ2AAAAIAAJ|title=The Seven liberal arts in the Middle Ages|last=Wagner|first=David Leslie|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1983|isbn=9780253351852|accessdate=5 January 2013}} at Questia [https://www.questia.com/read/96213334/the-seven-liberal-arts-in-the-middle-ages]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], logic gradually came to take predominance over the other parts of the ''trivium''.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) pp. 141–3&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Gherardo di giovannid el fora, musica, in marziano capella de nuptiis philologiae et mercurii, ms. urb lat 329 f 149v bibl ap vat.jpg|thumb|Page from ''[[De nuptiis|Marriage of Mercury and Philology]]'']]

In the [[Renaissance]], the Italian humanists and their Northern counterparts, despite in many respects continuing the traditions of the Middle Ages, reversed that process.&lt;ref&gt;G. Norton ed., ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism Vol 3'' (1999)p. 46 and pp. 601–4&lt;/ref&gt; Re-christening the old trivium with a new and more ambitious name: {{lang|la|[[Humanitas|Studia humanitatis]]}}, and also increasing its scope, they downplayed logic as opposed to the traditional Latin grammar and rhetoric, and added to them history, Greek, and moral philosophy ([[ethics]]), with a new emphasis on poetry as well.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Humanities|educational curriculum of humanism]] spread throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and became the educational foundation for the schooling of European elites, the functionaries of political administration, the clergy of the various legally recognized churches, and the learned professions of law and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Nauert, ''Humanism and the Culture of Renaissance Europe (New Approaches to European History)'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal of a liberal arts, or humanistic education grounded in [[Classics|classical languages and literature]], persisted until the middle of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Bod, Rens; ''A New History of the Humanities'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Some subsections of the liberal arts are in the trivium—the verbal arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric—and in the quadrivium—the numerical arts of music and astronomy. Each subsection includes the analysis and interpretation of information.

Academic areas that are associated with the term liberal arts include:
* [[Arts]] ([[fine arts]], [[music education|music]], [[performing arts]], [[literature]])
* [[Philosophy]]
* [[Religious studies]]
* [[Social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[jurisprudence]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]])
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Natural Sciences]] ([[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[earth sciences]])

For example, the core courses for [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Doctor of Liberal Studies]] program&lt;ref&gt;Georgetown University Doctor of Liberal Studies curriculum http://scs.georgetown.edu/departments/6/doctor-of-liberal-studies/about-the-program/curriculum#curriculum&lt;/ref&gt; cover philosophy, theology, history, art, literature, and the social sciences. [[Wesleyan University]]'s [[Master of Arts in Liberal Studies]] program includes courses in visual arts, art history, [[creative writing|creative]] and professional writing, literature, history, mathematics, film, government, education, biology, psychology, and astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/masters/index.html|title=Graduate Liberal Studies - Wesleyan University|website=www.wesleyan.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary school==
The liberal arts education at the secondary school level prepares the student for [[higher education]] at a [[university]]. They are thus meant for the more academically minded students. In addition to the usual curriculum, students of a liberal arts education often study [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]].

Some liberal arts education provide general education, others have a specific focus. (This also differs from country to country.) The four traditional branches are:
* [[humanities]] education (specializing in [[classical languages]], such as [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]])
* modern languages (students are required to study at least three languages)
* lower level mathematical-scientific education
* economical and social-scientific education (students are required to study simple [[economics]], [[world history]], [[social studies]] and [[business informatics]])

Curricula differ from school to school, but generally include [[language]], [[mathematics]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[arts|art]] (as well as crafts and design), [[music]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[civics]] / citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;this subject has different names in the different states of Germany. See [[:de:Gemeinschaftskunde]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[social science]]s, and several foreign languages.

Schools concentrate not only on academic subjects, but on producing well-rounded individuals, so physical education and religion or ethics are compulsory, even in non-denominational schools which are prevalent. For example, the [[German constitution]] guarantees the [[separation of church and state]], so although religion or ethics classes are compulsory, students may choose to study a specific religion or none at all.

Today, a number of other areas of specialization exist, such as [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] specializing in economics, technology or [[domestic sciences]]. Some countries also have ''[[progymnasium]]''s, which may lead to studying in a gymnasium.

==In the United States==
{{main article|Liberal arts college}}
{{further information|Liberal arts colleges in the United States|Great books}}

In the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing [[undergraduate]] study in the liberal arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining Liberal Arts Education|url=http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/storage/Defining_Liberal_Education.pdf|publisher=Wabash College|accessdate=9 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021110926/http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/storage/Defining_Liberal_Education.pdf#|archive-date=21 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching at liberal arts colleges is often [[Socratic method|Socratic]], typically with small classes, and often has a lower [[student-to-teacher ratio]] than at large [[universities]]; professors teaching classes are often allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than primary research [[Professors in the United States|professors]] or [[teaching assistants|graduate student teaching assistants]] at [[universities]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Dartmouth College is a well-known liberal arts college, in addition to several small liberal arts colleges in the northeastern part of the United States.

In addition, most four-year colleges are not devoted exclusively or primarily to liberal arts degrees, but offer a liberal arts degree, and allow students not majoring in liberal arts to take courses to satisfy [[distribution requirements]] in liberal arts.

Traditionally, a bachelor's degree either in liberal arts in general or in one particular area within liberal arts, with substantial study outside that main area, is earned over four years of full-time study. However, some universities such as [[Saint Leo University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.saintleo.edu/academics/associate-programs/liberal-arts.aspx |title=Online Liberal Arts Associate Degree |publisher=Saint Leo University |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pennsylvania State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/letters-arts-and-sciences-associates/overview |title=Online Associate in Arts in Letters, Arts, and Sciences &amp;#124; Overview |publisher=Penn State University |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florida Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-aa-liberal-arts-degree/ |title=Associate's Degree in Liberal Arts – Liberal Arts Degree Online |publisher=Florida Institute of Technology |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New England College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Associates in Liberal Studies|url=http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/associates-degree-liberal-studies/|publisher=[[New England College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have begun to offer an [[associate degree]] in liberal arts. Colleges like [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, NH offer a unique program with only one degree offering, a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, and colleges like the [[University of Oklahoma College of Liberal Studies]] offers an online, part-time option for adult and nontraditional students.

Most students earn either a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree or a [[Bachelor of Science]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s bachelor of science degree in Applied Languages and Intercultural Studies http://www.modlangs.gatech.edu&lt;/ref&gt; degree; on completing undergraduate study, students might progress to either a liberal arts graduate school or a [[professional school]] ([[public administration]], [[engineering]], [[business]], [[law]], [[medicine]], [[theology]]).

==In Europe==
In most parts of Europe, liberal arts education is deeply rooted. In Germany, Austria and countries influenced by their education system it is called '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''humanistische Bildung''' (humanistic education). The term is not to be mixed up with some modern educational concepts that use a similar wording. Educational institutions that see themselves in that tradition are often a [[Gymnasium (school)|''Gymnasium'']]" (high school, grammar school). They aim at providing their pupils with comprehensive education (''[[Bildung]]'') in order to form personality with regard to a pupil's own humanity as well as their innate intellectual skills.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Going back to the long tradition of the liberal arts in Europe, education in the above sense was freed from scholastic thinking and re-shaped by the theorists of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; in particular, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Since students are considered to have received a comprehensive liberal arts education at ''gymnasiums'', very often the role of liberal arts education in undergraduate programs at universities is reduced compared to the US educational system.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Students are expected to use their skills received at the ''gymnasium'' in order to further develop their personality in their own responsibility, e.g. in universities' music clubs, theatre groups, language clubs, etc. Universities encourage students to do so and offer respective opportunities but do not make such activities part of the university's curriculum.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

As well as the colleges listed above, some universities in the Netherlands offer bachelors programs in Liberal Arts and Sciences ([[Tilburg University]]). Liberal arts (as a degree program) is just beginning to establish itself in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does [[St. Mary's University College (Belfast)|St. Marys University College Belfast]], both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology [[:Category:Liberal arts colleges at universities in the Netherlands|''university college'']] since the late 1990s. The four-year bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany.

In [[Scotland]], the four-year [[undergraduate]] [[Honours degree]], specifically the [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]], has historically demonstrated considerable breadth in focus. In the first two years of Scottish MA and BA degrees students typically study a number of different subjects before specialising in their Honours years (third and fourth year). The [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of Glasgow]] (at its Crichton Campus) are the only Scottish universities that currently offer a specifically named 'Liberal Arts' degree.

==In Asia==
The Commission on Higher Education of the [[Philippines]] mandates a General Education curriculum required of all higher education institutions; it includes a number of liberal arts subjects, including history, art appreciation, and ethics, plus interdisciplinary electives. Many universities have much more robust liberal arts core curricula; most notably, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] universities such as [[Ateneo de Manila University]] have a strong liberal arts core curriculum that includes philosophy, theology, literature, history, and the social sciences. [[Forman Christian College]] is a liberal arts university in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. It is one of the oldest institutions in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is a chartered university recognized by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]]. [[Habib University]] in [[Karachi]], Pakistan offers a holistic liberal arts and sciences experience to its students through its uniquely tailored liberal core program which is compulsory for all undergraduate degree students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2014/12/liberal-classes/ ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aurora.dawn.com/2014/03/01/liberal-to-the-core/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402183811/http://aurora.dawn.com/2014/03/01/liberal-to-the-core/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Underwood International College of Yonsei University, Korea, has compulsory liberal arts course for all the student body.

==In Australia==

[[Campion College]] is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] dedicated liberal arts college, located in the western suburbs of [[Sydney]]. Founded in 2006, it is the first tertiary educational liberal arts college of its type in [[Australia]]. Campion offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts as its sole undergraduate degree. The key disciplines studied are history, literature, philosophy, and theology.

In 1936 [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] changed its curriculum to focus on the [[Great Books of the Western World|Great Books]] of Western Civilization in order to provide a new sort of education that separated itself from the increasingly specialized nature of higher schooling. This was one of the first instances of a revival for the more classical approach to the Liberal Arts as expounded by Plato and Cicero. Later in the 1960s, in response to the sexual revolution and growing hostility toward free-speech, many small institutes began to incorporate in order to counter this culture of anti-academic thought. This is most notably the work of many small Catholic Liberal Arts institutions, like the [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]], that adopted the Great Books as a core for their humanities program while at the same time preserving the seven liberal arts as way of preparing their students to think for themselves rather than accept what their professors told them to think. With the introduction of the Great Books, the liberal arts education was now in direct conversation with the great minds of history who have shaped the modern world as we know it. At the same these colleges focused on the basic formation of one's intellect that came from exercising the tools of logic, grammar, and rhetoric.

It is no more barbarous than the Gothic style, a name intended to be a reproach. The Gothic, built up on the conception of the old basilica, ancient in origin, yet Christian in character, was misjudged by the Renaissance on account of some excrescences, and obscured by the additions engrafted upon it by modern lack of taste . . . .

This enables students to have flexibility and control over their programme of study and the content of their assessments."

'''Milken Community Schools''', colloquially '''Milken''', is a [[Private school|private]] [[Jewish]] [[high school]] and [[middle school]].  It is located on [[Mulholland Drive]] in the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel-Air]] area of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It is one of the largest [[Jewish day school]]s in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie G Fax, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/education/article/las_jewish_high_schools_are_all_over_the_map_20080229 "L.A.‘s Jewish high schools are all over the map"], ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dart1995"/&gt; Long affiliated with [[Stephen S. Wise Temple]], a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregation, the school is officially non-denominational, and became independent from the temple in July 2012.

{{Asof|1998}} it was the largest non-Orthodox Jewish high school in the United States.&lt;ref name="Helfand1998"&gt;Duke Helfand, [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/14/local/me-22629 "Milken High Is Dedicated by Founders: The $30-million campus is largest non-Orthodox Jewish high school in U.S."], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|1994}} it was the only Reform Judaism high school in the United States and was a part of the only K-12 Jewish education program west of [[Chicago]] that was not a part of [[Orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref name=Darthills&gt;Dart, John. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-06/news/we-59179_1_jewish-high-school EDUCATION : Reform Jewish High School Moving to Hills]." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. November 6, 1994. Retrieved on July 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school began in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles |Van Nuys]] in 1984 as the Golda Meir School, and was later renamed the Einstein Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Schmitt, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+$32+MILLION+SCHOOL%3B+MILKEN+FOUNDATION+AIDS+JEWISH+CAMPUS.-a083822114 "The $32 Million School; Milken Foundation Aids Jewish Campus"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', May 9, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; When the school became affiliated with Stephen S. Wise Temple, it was renamed Stephen S. Wise High School. After a large donation from [[Lowell Milken|Lowell]] and [[Michael Milken]]'s [[Milken Family Foundation]] the school, then reported to be the "largest non-Orthodox Jewish high school in the country", was named Milken Community High School.&lt;ref name="Dart1995"&gt;John Dart, [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-09/local/me-43880_1_jewish-high-school "Jewish School Renamed for Milkens"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 9, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, the school was renamed to Milken Community Schools, with the intention of creating a name that encompassed both the middle school and the high school. 

The Upper School was held in temporary trailers, on the lot where the new Middle School now stands, from 1994 to 1998 until the current Upper School campus was opened in 1998. This campus had a cost of $30 million.&lt;ref name="Helfand1998"/&gt; Until the Middle School campus was completed in 2009, the Middle School occupied temporary trailers on the parking lot of the [[Bel Air Presbyterian Church]] from 1981 to 2008.

The Middle School and Upper School have historically had the same name, yet after the completion of the new Middle School campus in 2009, the Middle School was officially renamed the David and Hillevi Saperstein Middle School of Milken Community High School after a subsequent donation from [[David I. Saperstein|David and Hillevi Saperstein]], while the Upper School remained the Milken Community High School. 

On March 25, 2011, Milken Community High School and Stephen S. Wise Temple announced that the school would become independent from the temple, effective July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lowenfeld, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/community/article/milken_school_stephen_s_wise_temple_severing_ties_20110325/ "Milken school, Stephen S. Wise Temple severing ties"], ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guerin Family Institute for Advanced Sciences, which opened in the fall of 2016, houses the Los Angeles areas only MIT-Inspired Fab Lab, joining a global network of Fab Labs spanning the world; a CAD lab; an Engineering Lab; and an International Classroom to connect students globally. Students have access to state-of-the-art equipment and complex professional grade industrial tools to help fabricate their ideas into reality.

Spiritual Practice takes place once a week, with varied options such as traditional-egalitarian minyan, yoga, meditation, doubters' minyan, and others.  An optional daily morning minyan is also offered.  Through the Advanced Jewish Studies Center (AJSC), numerous Judaic electives are offered, including comparative religion, intensive [[Talmud]] study, comparative film, and others.  The Kivun program, in which guest speakers lecture students on topics relating to Judaism, is offered most Fridays during oneg.

[[Image:TIF2.jpg|thumb|right|Tiferet Israel Fellowship]]
In partnership with the [[Alexander Muss Institute for Israel Education]] (AMIIE), MCHS offers an opportunity for students to learn and live in [[Israel]] for the Spring semester of the 10th grade. Through a full academic program, schedule of tiyyulim (field study and trips), personalized Chuggim (individualized activities) and partnership with [[Israelis|Israeli]] teens, Tiferet Israel Fellows learn inside and outside of the classroom and build relationships with the land and people of [[Israel]]. The semester abroad is followed by two years of additional programming. The junior year focuses on public presentation skills, training fellows how to best advocate for the State of Israel. The senior year concludes with an intensive seminar based at the Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, examining Israeli cultural and political issues.

'''Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts''' ({{lang-cnr|Црногорска академија наука и умјетности}}, ''Crnogorska akademija nauka i umjetnosti''; ЦАНУ, '''''CANU''''') is the most important scientific institution of [[Montenegro]].

It was founded in 1973 as the Montenegrin Society for Science and Arts (Црногорско друштво за науку и умјетност, ''Crnogorsko društvo za nauku i umjetnost'') and adopted its current name in 1976. It currently has 40 members ([[academician]]s) in three departments: natural sciences, humanities and arts.

The CANU has often been considered and described as a pro-[[Serbia]]n institution in Montenegro, as the academy' posits the Serb ethnic origin of the [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. In opposition to this, a splinter group of intellectuals had formed the [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (DANU) in 1997, registered as a [[non-governmental organization]], in an attempt to counter the official pro-Serbian academy.

Amid the constitutional reforms of 2007 CANU had resisted the standardization of the [[Montenegrin language]] supporting the interpretation according to which Montenegrin is a dialect of the [[Serbian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pobjeda.co.me/citanje.php?datum=2007-06-01&amp;id=119208 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007064930/http://www.pobjeda.co.me/citanje.php?datum=2007-06-01&amp;id=119208 |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of CANU's prominent members have actively participated in the campaign against Montenegro's independence in the 2006 [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]]. CANU president [[Momir Đurović]] had in 2007 maintained contacts with members of the pro-Serbian political opposition, and had visited the headquarters of the [[Serb People's Party (Montenegro)|Serb People's Party]] and its leader [[Andrija Mandić]] during the negotiations on language-naming in the new constitution. The Academy has also criticized Montenegrin government's decision to recognize [[Kosovo]]'s unilateral declaration of independence.

However, in 2015 DANU was merged into CANU, as all of its active members were accepted into membership and DANU was consequently disbanded, with CANU remaining the sole official scientific institution in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:541349-Ode-DANU-u-CANU&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amanda Zhao Wei''' ({{zh|s=赵巍|t=趙巍|p=Zhào Wēi}}) ([[circa|c.]] 1981 – October 2002) was a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] student in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], who was murdered in October 2002. Zhao was an [[English language|English]] student at [[Coquitlam College]] when she was reported missing on October 9, 2002, and her body was found inside a [[suitcase]] by hikers near [[Stave Lake]] on October 20, 2002, where an [[autopsy]] revealed that Zhao had been [[strangled]] to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Darcy Wintonyk | title = Chinese authorities make arrest in B.C. homicide| url= http://bc.ctvnews.ca/chinese-authorities-make-arrest-in-b-c-homicide-1.442993|date=October 13, 2009 | publisher = [[CTV Television|CTV]] |accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation | last = National Post| title = Suspects in Amanda Zhao slaying arrested in China| url= https://nationalpost.com/story.html?id=2096984|date=October 13, 2009 | publisher = [[National Post]] |accessdate=October 15, 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Chinese men that were living in Canada at the time, including Zhao's boyfriend, were arrested in China and charged by a [[Beijing]] court for Zhao's murder, with one being [[acquitted]] and one sentenced to 7-years imprisonment.

Amanda Zhao's murder and the subsequent investigation highlighted issues with the co-operation of Canada and China in matters of justice, and issues of [[jurisdiction]] within Canadian [[law enforcement]].

==Background==
Amanda Zhao Wei ({{zh|s=赵巍|t=趙巍|p=Zhào Wēi}}) was born in [[Circa|c.]] 1981 in the [[People's Republic of China]], was a Chinese national, and at the time of her death a 21-year-old [[international student]] studying [[English language|English]] at [[Coquitlam College]] located in [[Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], near the city of [[Vancouver]].

On October 9, 2002, Zhao was reported missing to the authorities, and just over a week later on October 20, her [[corpse]] was discovered contained within a suitcase by hikers near [[Stave Lake]], {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Vancouver.

==Investigation==
The two murder suspects in the case, Li Ang (李昂) and Zhang Han (张瀚), were arrested in China in the summer of 2009. The prime suspect Li Ang, who was Zhao's boyfriend at the time of murder, was initially in [[Canada]] when Zhao's body was found. Li was a Chinese national and a [[computer science]] student at [[Simon Fraser University]], located in the Vancouver area.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Citation | author =Susanna Ng | title = Family of murdered student Amanda Zhao arrives in Vancouver | url= https://www.straight.com/article-165079/family-murdered-student-amanda-zhao-arrive-vancouver |date=October 7, 2008 | publisher = [[Straight.com]] |accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zhang Han, who was Li's cousin, was also implicated in the case. He later confessed that he had helped Li dispose of Zhao's body and helped Li travel back to China after the murder.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Zhang's confession led to him being charged as an accessory after the fact in Zhao's murder.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, he was later acquitted by the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] because the confession had been improperly obtained.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Zhao, Li, and Zhang shared a [[basement]] apartment in [[Burnaby]] at the time of murder.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Eleven days before the body was found, Li reported to police that Zhao was missing after she went to buy groceries at the local [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] store.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Citation | last =  | title = Visiting parents demand justice in Zhao's slaying 6 years ago | url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/10/07/bc-amanda-zhao-parents.html |date=October 7, 2009 | publisher = [[CBC.ca|CBC]] |accessdate=October 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011154642/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/10/07/bc-amanda-zhao-parents.html|archivedate=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, three days after Zhao's body was found, Li returned to China.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Citation | last =  | title = Amanda Zhao's parents still crying for justice| url= http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=a6665963-535b-440b-88bd-5fc0823cae39|date=October 13, 2009 | publisher = [[canada.com]] |accessdate=October 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093702/http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=a6665963-535b-440b-88bd-5fc0823cae39|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Li was initially questioned by the RCMP on the case, but it was not until seven months after the murder that the RCMP issue a warrant for his arrest, and is being charged with second-degree murder ''[[in absentia]]'' by the [[Canadian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=China arrests two in Zhao slaying|url=http://news.globaltv.com/Suspect+Amanda+Zhao+slaying+arrested+China+report/2097023/story.html|date=October 13, 2009|publisher=[[Global Television Network]]|accessdate=October 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711101722/http://news.globaltv.com/Suspect+Amanda+Zhao+slaying+arrested+China+report/2097023/story.html|archivedate=2011-07-11|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Li had been taken into custody by the Chinese government but was later released due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Li was arrested by Chinese authorities again and [[convicted]] in September 2012, and sentenced to [[life in prison]]. Zhang was released and is not scheduled to be tried.  In 2014, Li's sentence was changed by the Supreme court of Beijing to 7 years.  The original first degree murder charge has been changed to secondary degree murder charge as the Supreme court of Beijing ruled that Zhao was accidentally killed by Li during a pillow play fight.  The court decision was controversial as the court ruled without any new evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/chinese-court-finds-boyfriend-guilty-of-murdering-amanda-zhao-in-bc/article4571154/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Chinese court finds boyfriend guilty of murdering Amanda Zhao in B.C |author=Mark MacKinnon| date=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The arrests for Amanda Zhao's murder took many years to complete, and responsibility was found to be mainly because the Canadian government is reluctant in giving evidence of murder cases to China, as Chinese authorities allow for [[capital punishment]] for murder, which is illegal in Canada. On October 13, 2009, Secretary of State for Multiculturalism [[Jason Kenney]] said that China's capital punishment policy has been a problem in the case.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Zhao's murder was of great interest in the Chinese community in Canada because it exposed the lack of an [[extradition treaty]] between Canada and the People's Republic of China for crimes committed in the two countries, and the lack of the RCMP's authority in retaining suspects within Canadian borders until the investigation of a crime is completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">A '''National History Museum''' or '''National Historical Museum''' is a [[history museum]] dedicated to presenting artifacts and exhibits reflecting the history of a particular [[nation]], usually its home country. The earliest public museums, the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Marjorie (2001), Curiosities and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Louvre|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/history-louvre|publisher=History of Louvre|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were focused on [[natural history]] and [[art]], respectively, and not necessarily on subjects related to the history of any nation. Following [[Napoleon]]'s use of the Louvre as a center of [[national pride]] during his reign, other countries began to use museums not just to store artifacts of aesthetic or educational value, but to portray the country itself in a positive light.

Historically, some national history museums have been used purely as propaganda tools through which governments attempt to convey an official history. For example, "the [[Nazi regime]] employed the museum as a deliberate tool of propaganda and 'public education'".&lt;ref name="Verheyen"&gt;Dirk Verheyen, ''United City, Divided Memories?: Cold War Legacies in Contemporary Berlin'' (2010), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It has further been argued that "the very idea of an officially sponsored national history museum is simply outdated" in light of the trend towards pluralistic interpretation of artifacts.&lt;ref name="Verheyen"/&gt; On the other hand, it has been argued that: "To create a national history museum that discards unitary national narratives as well as causal trajectories (the teleology of the nation)—in effect to subvert the form—is probably impossible".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ashton, Paula Hamilton, "Unfinished Business", in Daniel J. Walkowitz, Lisa Maya Knauer, eds., ''Contested Histories in Public Space: Memory, Race, and Nation'' (2008), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; One concern of national history museums, therefore, is how to fairly and neutrally depict negative periods in a nation's own history.

The '''National University of Laos (NUOL)''' is a [[university]] in [[Vientiane]], the capital of [[Laos]]. Founded in 1996, with departments brought in from other existing colleges, it is the only national university in the country. The NUOL accepts students from all over Laos, along with international students.

The university is a partner of the [[Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network]] (GMSARN) and [[ASEAN University Network]] (AUN).

==History==
National University of Laos "NUOL" was established by merging the higher education institutes which were under the supervision of several ministries into one university under the Ministry of Education in accordance to the Decree Number 50/PM of the Prime Minister of the [[Lao PDR]] dated 9 June 1995.

NUOL is a multi-campus structure, with five campuses including, Dongdok campus (Cenral), Sokpaluang campus (Faculty of Engineering), Nabong campus (Faculty of Agriculture), Donnokkhum campus (Faculty of Law) and Tadthong campus (Faculty of Water resource). It composes of 13 faculties, 2 institutes (Institute of Lao-Japan Human Resource Development and Institute of Chinese conficious), a Central Library, six centers and a small hospital.

NUOL has played 4 roles in 1/ providing higher education in areas required for the socio-economic development of [[Lao PDR]]; 2/ performing research in natural and social sciences; 3/ preserving the arts, culture and traditions of the nation; and 4/ providing academic services to society. It is known for its diversity programs in [[Bachelor degree]]s; some [[Master degree]] programs are conducted in its academic disciplines, and Doctoral degree programs, as well.

Since the opening of its first academic year on 5 November 1996, the number of students has increased from 8,053 (including 2,170 females) to around 40,000 in 2009-2010 academic year. Then, since the policy of increasing vocational manpower of country, the acceptable number of students come down to around 23,000 student in recent year. At present, NUOL is accepted as one of the main and important public organization in the [[Lao PDR]].

In modernization of the university toward digital-based university in the future, IT Center was established in 2002 and be directly supervised by president of NUOL. The IT Center of NUOL is upgraded its roles to 1/ Develop and Manage the ICT infrastructure in the whole university, 2/ Develop ICT human resource toward "ICT based society", 3/ Supporting and Doing research in the field of Computer Science and ICT, and 4/ to provide academic services. For strengthen the ICT system in line with the University ICT Development Plan, initialize in the academic year 2004-2005, ICT infrastructure had been supported by Sida-SAREC in 2005-2010. The ICT Development plan of university is adjusted or improved almost every year in order to catch up with the change of the technology. However, it is hard in order to take it into action due to the lack of budget for it investment. Many of ICT works are belong to the supports from outside, such as International organization activities. 2011, Since the project called "ASEAN Cyber University" which support by Republic of Korea, the e-Learning has been being done in NUOL.

'''Netroots''' is a term coined in 2002 by [[Jerome Armstrong]]&lt;ref name="isbn1-4165-6010-6" /&gt; to describe [[politics|political]] [[activism]] organized through [[blog]]s and other online media, including [[wiki]]s and [[social network service]]s.  The word is a [[portmanteau]] of '''[[Internet]]''' and '''[[grassroots]]''', reflecting the technological innovations that set netroots techniques apart from other forms of political participation.  In the United States, the term is used mainly in left-leaning circles.&lt;ref name=nyt-061119&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Safire |authorlink=William Safire |title=On Language: Netroots |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/magazine/19wwln_safire.html?ex=1321592400&amp;en=a21ab052f4bda85e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 19, 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term necessarily overlaps with the related ideas of [[e-democracy]], [[open politics]], and [[participatory democracy]]—all of which are somewhat more specific, better defined, and more widely accepted. Netroots outreach is a campaign-oriented activity that uses the web for complementing more traditional campaign activities, such as collaborating with [[grassroots]] activism that involves [[get out the vote]] and organizing through interconnecting local and regional efforts, such as [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]], and the netroots-grassroots coalition that propelled the election of [[Howard Dean]] to the [[Democratic National Committee|DNC]] Chair in January, 2005.

At times, the term netroots is used interchangeably with the term [[blogosphere]], though the blogosphere is considered a subset of netroots in that blogosphere describes just the online community of blogs, where netroots includes that plus a number of larger (mainly liberal) on-line outposts such as [[MoveOn]], [[Media Matters for America]] and [[Think Progress]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-4165-6010-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Eric Boehlert |title=Bloggers on the Bus: How the Internet Changed Politics and the Press |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=1-4165-6010-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates claim that the essential quality of the netroots is its flatness and inter-linked web connectiveness—that it constitutes communication points that reach out to influence traditional media, but is not directed outward from any one point. Through events like a [https://web.archive.org/web/20081210101422/http://blog.blawg.com/archive/2005/02/22/Blogswarm.aspx blogswarm], the netroots displays non-hierarchical and decentralized features.

== American origins of term ==

The first popular use of the term in its modern definition is [https://web.archive.org/web/20030223172938/http://www.mydd.com/archives/000319.html#000319 Netroots for Howard Dean], by [[Jerome Armstrong]] in December 2002 on [[MyDD]].  Democratic [[political consultant]] [[Joe Trippi]] credits the short lived success of his then-client [[Howard Dean]] to their listening and taking the lead from netroots activity.

The netroots also played a key role in drafting [[General Wesley Clark]] into the 2004 Presidential campaign.  The growing power of the netroots was seen most recently during the 2006 midterm elections. In one such instance, a volunteer for the senate campaign of Democrat [[Jim Webb|James Webb]] of Virginia filmed remarks by then-Senator [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]]. The remarks in question, in which Senator Allen referred to the volunteer as a "[[macaca (term)|macaca]]" (the volunteer was of South Asian ethnicity), were viewed by many as being racially insensitive. The video was posted on the popular video-sharing website [[YouTube]]. The resulting netroots attention to the video triggered a series of events that resulted in the defeat of the incumbent senator. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} James Webb had, in fact, been the subject of a successful netroots draft, which resulted in his entry into the Virginia senate race. Netroots activists also supported [[Ned Lamont]] in his 2006 primary victory over Democratic Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], wrote [[Ari Melber]] in ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060814/melber].

Blog writers have contributed to more than a few controversies and early netroots attention. Amongst these were the remarks made by then-Senate Minority Leader [[Trent Lott]] at a birthday celebration for then-Senator [[Strom Thurmond]], the Dubai Ports controversy, the [[Mark Foley]] congressional page controversy, and the recent US Attorney controversy [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/3/23/84416/7790]. In addition, the recent controversy regarding a Democratic presidential debate sponsored by Fox News, which the left-leaning netroots attempted to stop, ended with the debate being canceled [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0307/3097.html].

In a December 2005 interview with ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10629288/site/newsweek/], [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]], founder of [[Daily Kos]], described the netroots as "the crazy political junkies that hang out in blogs." He is also the co-author (with [[Jerome Armstrong]]) of the book ''[[Crashing the Gate|Crashing the Gate: Netroots, Grassroots and the Rise of People-Powered Politics]]'' ({{ISBN|1-931498-99-7}}).

[[William Safire]] explained the term's origin in the ''New York Times Magazine'' on November 19, 2006:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;''[[The Nation]]'s'' Web site cited the unabashedly liberal Jerome Armstrong's praise of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] "for reading blogs and being ready to work with the netroots."[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061030/melber] From these citations and a few of the million and a half others in a Google search, the word netroots has a left-of-center connotation. The earliest use I can find is in a Jan. 15, 1993, message on an e-mail list of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] from an "rmcdon[ell]" at the [[University of California at San Diego]], apparently complaining about an internal shake-up: "Too bad there's no netroots organization that can demand more than keyboard accountability from those who claim to be acting on behalf of the 'greater good.'"&amp;nbsp;... Popularizer of the term — unaware of the obscure, earlier citation when he used it — was the aforementioned (great old word) Armstrong on his blog, MyDD, on Dec. 18, 2002, as he went to work on the presidential campaign of Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont.... headlined his entry "Netroots for Dean in 2004" and told Internet readers where to get the first inkling of a groundswell: "O.K., so Dean is still polling 1 to 4 percent nationally, so what. Look at the netroots."&lt;ref name="nyt-061119" /&gt;}}

== Similar activities elsewhere ==

So-called netroots activity also takes place in [[Iran]], which has a disproportionately high number of bloggers, and in the [[United Kingdom]], where there is strong support for [[e-democracy]] in the form of [[local issues forum]]s have become an approved form of feedback on government performance. Netroots UK is a project started in 2011 in partnership with the US [[Netroots Nation]] organisers to strengthen the UK's netroots through training and networking. In Australia, the netroots "progressive" lobbying group [[GetUp]] has more members than all Australian political parties combined.

Netroots activity has also begun to spring up in student politics where online social networking programs such as [[Facebook]] have been used in student elections.

In Sweden [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] have initiated a network open to all "progressive" bloggers in Sweden. The network meets on a regular basis and holds a yearly gathering, Nätrot (Netroot in Swedish)[https://web.archive.org/web/20120325173042/http://www.netroots.se/ Netroots.se]. The first Nätrot gathering was held in the Swedish parliament 2006 with [[Joe Trippi]] as guest speaker. The second one, 2008 also in the Swedish parliament, and the third, Nätrot '09 was in Visby, Almedalen featuring [[John Aravosis]] from [http://www.americablog.com Americablog] and [[Jane Hamsher]] from [http://www.firedoglake.com Firedoglake].

In 2010, the book "Netroots - a progressive blog movement that set the agenda" (Netroots - En progressiv bloggrörelse som sätter agendan) was published in Sweden (author [[Johan Ulvenlöv]]). The book explains various bloggers about how media content changed after blog entry and how they are partially set the agenda.&lt;ref name="VK bloggen"&gt;{{cite news |first=Evelina |last=Burstrom |title=Boken om rödgröna bloggar |url=http://blog.vk.se/popkultur/etikett/Netroots |publisher=[[VK bloggen]] |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906050422/http://blog.vk.se/popkultur/etikett/Netroots |archivedate=September 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the largest gathering of progressive bloggers in Scandinavia took place in [[Stockholm]].

'''Raising Malawi''' is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] [[non-profit organization]] that was founded by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and Michael Berg in 2006. It is dedicated to helping with the extreme poverty and hardship endured by [[Malawi]]'s one million [[orphans]], primarily through health and education programming. Initially, the "Raising Malawi Academy for Girls" was to be constructed but following an audit by the [[Global Philanthropy Group]], which questioned expenditure on salaries and benefits as well as the management capacity and culture, the charity's school headmistress resigned in October 2010 and the project was scrapped.

In January 2012, the organisation announced a partnership to build 10 primary schools to serve over 1,000 children in rural Malawi. Children received primary education support, including academic scholarships, school uniforms, and learning materials. They will benefit from the construction of new or renovated primary and secondary schools. In December 2014 it was announced that the organization completed ten schools to educate 4,871 children in different locations in Malawi. The enterprise was in association with [[buildOn]] and will benefit children of all sexes and the project was completed within twelve months, six months ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first=|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna-announces-completion-of-10-schools-in-malawi-in-partnership-with-buildon-184920091.html |title=Madonna Announces Completion Of 10 Schools In Malawi In Partnership With buildOn|publisher=PR Newswire|date=2012-12-27|accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, [[President of Malawi]] [[Joyce Banda]] expressed criticism of Madonna and her charity, accusing her of exaggerating her charity's contribution and "bullying state officials." Madonna responded by releasing a statement saying she was saddened that Banda "has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths. I have no intention of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations." Later, it was confirmed that Banda had not approved the statement released written by her press team and was "incandescent with anger" over the mix-up. Madonna has since further strengthened her relationship with the Malawian government. In November 2014, Madonna and the Raising Malawi team visited the country and met with newly elected President Peter Mutharika as well as several Government Ministers. During the visit, President Mutharika named Madonna the Goodwill Ambassador for Child Welfare.  Madonna said in a statement, "I feel a deep commitment and love for the children of Malawi and am grateful for the support of the Government. I look forward to my new role as Goodwill Ambassador for Child Welfare."   &lt;ref name="madonnatribe.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.madonnatribe.com/en/2014/madonna-appointed-as-malawis-goodwill-ambassador-for-child-welfare/|title=Madonna appointed as Malawi's Goodwill Ambassador for Child Welfare|date=28 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
{{quote|Since 2006, Raising Malawi has been dedicated to bringing an end to the extreme poverty and hardship endured by Malawi's one million orphans. Co-founded by Madonna and Michael Berg, Raising Malawi uses a community-based approach to provide immediate direct physical assistance, create long-term sustainability, support education and psycho-social programs, and build public awareness through multimedia and worldwide volunteer efforts.&lt;br /&gt;As a part of its activities, Raising Malawi works to distribute financial support that will help community-based organizations provide vulnerable children with nutritious food, proper clothing, secure shelter, formal education, targeted medical care, and emotional support. We believe in empowering the smartest and most caring of those people, the ones who understand the challenges and the solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raisingmalawi.org/rm_mission.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904084114/http://www.raisingmalawi.org/rm_mission.php |archivedate=2008-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Charity fundraiser==
On February 6, 2008, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Gucci]] hosted a fundraiser on the North Lawn of the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City|New York]] to benefit Raising Malawi &amp; UNICEF. In attendance was [[Tom Cruise]], [[Rihanna]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Gwen Stefani]] [[Demi Moore]] and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicefusa.org/news/releases/a-night-to-benefit-raising.html|title=Press Releases - UNICEF USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, 2009, Madonna announced on the Raising Malawi website and her own official website that she vowed to match, dollar for dollar, every donation made towards all Raising Malawi projects.

==Programs==

===Education===
One of Raising Malawi's major focus areas is funding  education projects. Raising Malawi supports the basic education needs of Malawi orphans, including academic scholarships, school uniforms, and learning materials. Raising Malawi sponsors 600 children at a Malawian orphanage with educational funding, vocational scholarships and an HIV awareness soccer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raisingmalawi.org/pages/154 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613024741/http://www.raisingmalawi.org/pages/154/ |archivedate=2015-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna had co-sponsored investments into building a school, Raising Malawi Academy for Girls. The project however was scrapped due to financial &amp; tax irregularities.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gu7xv7yKeCLdGBhsZeIGb5f4uF3Q?docId=CNG.3d22b01370fecf73a221d556297b13b9.851&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Raising Malawi announced a partnership with [[buildOn]] to build 10 primary schools to serve over 1,000 children in Malawi. Children will receive primary education support, including academic scholarships, school uniforms, and learning materials. They will benefit from the construction of new or renovated primary and secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raisingmalawi.org/pages/progress |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925012718/http://www.raisingmalawi.org/pages/progress |archivedate=2009-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Raising Malawi blog. (2012, January 30th). Madonna honors commitment to help children of Malawi. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.raisingmalawi.org/blog/entry/madonna-honors-commitment-to-help-children-of-malawi/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124170943/http://www.raisingmalawi.org/blog/entry/madonna-honors-commitment-to-help-children-of-malawi/ |archivedate=2013-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 it was announced that Madonna's Raising Malawi organization completed ten schools to educate 4,871 children in different locations in Malawi. The enterprise is in association with [[buildOn]] and follows the original announcement of building an Academy for Girls which was scrapped. Instead the schools will benefit children of all sexes and the project was completed within twelve months, six months ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Health===

Fifty percent of Malawi's population is under 15 years of age, making pediatric care a top priority for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/malawi_statistics.html|title=Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raising Malawi has addressed this need since 2008 by supporting the pediatric surgery program at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, the country's commercial capital. Queen Elizabeth is the largest hospital in Malawi and serves a population of 700,000 people annually. It is also a public hospital meaning services are free. 
At Queen Elizabeth, Raising Malawi partners with one of only three pediatric surgeons in Malawi, who performs hundreds of life-saving surgeries annually and teaches local medical students and clinicians.  
Raising Malawi recently expanded its pediatric surgery work at Queen Elizabeth by launching a project with the Malawi Ministry of Health to construct a pediatric surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital. The facility will include the country's first pediatric ICU, will double the number of life-saving surgeries, and will improve longer health outcomes for children who are currently dying as they wait for ICU beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mwnation.com/madonna-build-paediatric-ward-qech/|title=Madonna to build paediatric ward at QECH - - The Nation Online|date=28 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Raising Malawi also collaborates with the Elizabeth Taylor Aids Foundation to bring Grassroot Soccer (GRS), a HIV/AIDS prevention and testing program, into the communities where Raising Malawi is active.  GRS is also active in the Mulanje region, one of the highest HIV infection areas in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-elizabeth-taylor-aids-foundation-etaf-builds-on-elizabeth-taylors-legacy-as-a-leader-and-crusader-in-the-fight-against-hivaids-234093511.html|title=The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) Builds On Elizabeth Taylor's Legacy As A Leader And Crusader In The Fight Against HIV/AIDS|first=The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS|last=Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girls' School===
Following an audit by the [[Global Philanthropy Group]], which questioned expenditure on salaries and benefits as well as the management capacity and culture, the charity's school headmistress was fired in October 2010. In January 2011 it was announced that plans to build a school, the charity's flagship project, were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/25/madonna-malawi-charity-squandered-millions|title=Madonna's Malawi charity 'squandered millions'|date=25 Mar 2011|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 the Board of Directors was removed. The collapse of the school project resulted in labour disputes and complicated a dispute with villagers who lost land to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/charity-workers-sue-madonna-malawi-school|title=Madonna sued by charity workers over scrapped Malawi school|date=28 Mar 2011|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also resulted in a legal suit by former employees at the school for wrongful termination.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

==Government Relations==
When Madonna visited Malawi in April 2013, [[President of Malawi]] [[Joyce Banda]] expressed criticism of Madonna and her charity, accused her of exaggerating her charity's contribution and "bullying state officials". The president's office accused her of being "a musician who desperately thinks she must generate recognition by bullying state officials instead of playing decent music on the stage" and added "For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22103748|title=Malawi labels Madonna a 'bully' after recent visit|publisher=BBC|date=2013-04-11|accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna responded by releasing a statement saying she was saddened that Banda "has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths. I have no intention of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations." Later, it was confirmed that Banda had not approved the statement released written by her press team and was "incandescent with anger" over the mix-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/12/malawi-president-attack-madonna-goof|title=Malawi president's attack on Madonna said to be a 'goof'|date=12 Apr 2013|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna and Raising Malawi  have since strengthened their relationship with the Malawian government. In November 2014, Madonna and the Raising Malawi team visited the country and met with newly elected President Peter Mutharika as well as several Government Ministers. During the visit, President Mutharika named Madonna the Goodwill Ambassador for Child Welfare.&lt;ref name="madonnatribe.com"/&gt;

==Documentary film==
In May 2008, Madonna hosted the premiere of a documentary film that she wrote and produced, titled ''[[I Am Because We Are]]'', at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/filmguide/I_Am_Because_We_Are.html&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Nathan Rissman, the film follows the stories of several Malawian children who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iambecauseweare.com|title=I AM BECAUSE WE ARE : A Documentary Film produced by Madonna|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary was also screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in connection with the 2008 amfAR Cinema Against AIDS gala,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raisingmalawi.org/blog_cannes.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927160207/http://www.raisingmalawi.org/blog_cannes.php |archivedate=2008-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Traverse City Film Festival]] in Michigan. On March 25, 2009, the documentary officially debuted on [[YouTube]] and [[Hulu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12038">'''Sara Little Turnbull''' (née Finkelstein; September 21, 1917 – September 4, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/business/sara-little-turnbull-product-designer-inspired-by-anthropology-and-nature-dies-at-97.html?_r=1 Sara Little Turnbull, Product Designer Inspired by Anthropology and Nature, Dies at 97]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American product designer, [[design]] innovator and educator.  She advised corporate America on product design for more than 50 years, and has been described as "corporate America's secret weapon."&lt;ref name="Vienne"&gt;Vienne, Veronique (November 2000) [http://www.metropolismag.com/html/content_1100/tur.htm "The Why of It All"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214071648/http://www.metropolismag.com/html/content_1100/tur.htm |date=2009-12-14 }}, ''Metropolis Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of America's first female [[industrial design]]ers and one of the first women to succeed in a post-World War II design industry dominated by men.  She helped to create essential products from medical masks to [[Corningware|CorningWare]], and founded and led the Process of Change: Laboratory for Innovation and Design at the [[Stanford Business School|Stanford Graduate School of Business]].  She approached design as a self-trained [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] and believed that a thorough understanding of the fine-grain details of how different cultures behaved was key to successful and innovative business solutions.&lt;ref name="CDF"&gt;[http://www.cdf.org/issue_journal/stanfords_sarah_little_turnbull_on_design.html "Stanford's Sarah (sic) Little Turnbull on Design"], Corporate Design Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Sara Finkelstein was born in Manhattan and raised in Brooklyn.  Her mother introduced her to the use of color and form by arranging fruits and vegetables in bowls. She attended [[Parsons School|Parsons School of Design]] on scholarships from the School Art League of NYC and the National Council of Jewish Women, graduating in 1939.  

Because she was 4'11" in height, she acquired the nickname "Little Sara," and then began to call herself Sara Little professionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saralittleturnbull.com/about.htm Sara Little Turnbull website]&lt;/ref&gt; She married James R. Turnbull (then executive vice president of Douglas Fir Plywood Assn in Tacoma, WA) in 1965, but used the name Sara Little for her entire career.  Later, when Turnbull became executive vice president of National Forest Products Assn, they moved to Washington, D.C., with an apartment at the [[Watergate complex]].  They were living there during the [[White House plumbers]] break-in.

== Career ==

=== House Beautiful ===
After college, Sara Little worked at [[Marshall Fields]] as a bench designer and assistant art director, then became art director at Blaker Advertising Agency.  She was eventually hired as an editorial assistant at ''[[House Beautiful]]'' magazine, where she wrote the  "Girl with a Future" column until she rose to the position of Decorating Editor, which she held for nearly two decades. 

At ''House Beautiful'', she anticipated and helped develop the American post-World War II domestic lifestyle.  By asking, "how we could help these people put their lives back together through ideas in our magazine?"&lt;ref name="Vienne" /&gt; she encouraged readers to utilize more informal space in the home (in what eventually became known as the [[family room]]), share living space with a roommate, and organize small spaces for maximum domestic efficiency (she lived for 20 years in a {{convert|400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} hotel room from which she also ran her international consulting practice).

=== Product Design ===
In 1958, Little left the magazine world and formed Sara Little Design Consultant. At the time, she wrote a trade article for ''Housewares Review'' entitled "Forgetting the Little Woman" (although she often referred to this article in subsequent interviews as "When Will The Consumer Become Your Customer?"). Her main argument was that most companies created products for retailers, instead of considering the people who were actually going to use them.&lt;ref name="CDF" /&gt; The story caught the attention of a few prominent CEO's and executives, including the heads of [[General mills|General Mills]], [[3m|3M]] and the [[Corning Glass]] consumer products division. All three companies eventually hired her as a product research consultant to assist in finding new applications for technologies developed for the war effort.  She helped create disposable medical and antipollution masks made from non-woven fibers,&lt;ref name="CDF" /&gt; nutritious soybean candy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030204122725/http://www.kqed.org/w/baywindow/speakingfreely/remarkable/sara_turnbull.html ''Speaking Freely: An Evening with Remarkable Women''], KQED Television
&lt;/ref&gt; and the ubiquitous freezer-to-oven CorningWare that was developed from a material originally used on missile cones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0611/spreadsheet_turnbull.html "Laboratory Director Shuts Red Door"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070429174627/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0611/spreadsheet_turnbull.html |date=2007-04-29 }}, November 2006, ''Stanford Business Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;   

During her 65-year design career she provided advice on [[strategic design]], consumer awareness, and cultural change to an international slate of companies such as: Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, Marks &amp; Spencer, American Can, DuPont, Ford, Nissan, Pfizer, Revlon, Elizabeth Arden, Lever Brothers, Motorola, NASA and Volvo.  She consulted on a range of domestic products including housewares, home storage systems, food, counters that cook, microwave cooking products, personal care, medication delivery systems, cosmetics, fabric processes (knit and non-wovens), space suits, furniture, toys, decoration and packaging, household cleaning products, pet care, tapes and adhesives, and car interiors.  

Many of her ideas arose from her intense interest in different cultures and the natural world. A self-trained cultural anthropologist, she traveled frequently to destinations such as [[Borneo]], [[Malaysia]], the [[The Philippines|Philippines]], [[India]] and [[Kenya]], always on the lookout for how people and animals solved the problems of everyday living. Her design for a pot lid was inspired by observing [[cheetah]]s grasping their prey in the wild. “It always starts with a fundamental curiosity,” she said of her quest for innovative product design. “When I can't find the answer in a book, I go out and search for it. The excitement of my life is that I have always jumped into the unknown to find what I needed to know.”&lt;ref name="CDF" /&gt; In another case, she began the design process for a burglar-proof lock by interviewing thieves in jail.&lt;ref name="Vienne" /&gt;  

In 1971, she established the Sara Little Center for Design Research at the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington State to archive and display her collection of over 5,000 artifacts gathered during her travels.  The collection includes body coverings and accessories, food preparation and dining implements, textiles, fine and folk art, much of which had influenced her concepts for domestic product design.  The collection was deaccessioned from the Tacoma Art Museum in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Tacoma Art Museum [http://www.tacomaartmuseum.org/Page.aspx?nid=92 website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713165836/http://www.tacomaartmuseum.org/Page.aspx?nid=92 |date=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is being re-established in Seattle, WA for design scholarship and educational purposes.

=== Process of Change: Laboratory for Innovation and Design ===
In 1988, Little founded and for the next 18 years directed the Process of Change: Laboratory for Innovation and Design at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Little Turnbull [http://biodesign.stanford.edu/bdn/people/sturnbull.jsp faculty page], Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory tracked changing trends in more than 375 areas including education, healthcare, aging, sexuality, food and nutrition, housing, clothing, and manufacturing.  Little used this information to fuel her design concepts.  "The quality of life of a people dictates what they design, what they make," she said.  "It's a reflection of life itself."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Heather (January 28, 2000) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/01/28/PN96035.DTL "Mother of Invention"], ''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt;

In her work with students at Stanford, Little continually emphasized digging deep into the "why" of a product before leaping into the "how," in order to avoid designing products that only addressed superficial symptoms rather than the deeper need.&lt;ref name="Vienne" /&gt; “The designer is the conscience of the company. We can't expect anyone else to fill this role.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Sara Little Turnbull at [[TAXI: The Global Creative Network]] [http://www.designtaxi.com/article.php?article_id=181 website], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; That’s why the Process of Change Laboratory delineated the need to know more. Design requires a background of scholarship, otherwise it remains a visual trick.”&lt;ref&gt;Video interview with Sara Little Turnbull conducted in 2006 by Paula Rees, special trustee for Sara Little Turnbull&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching, Awards and Honors ===

In addition to her work at Stanford, Sara Little has been a guest lecturer at schools such as Parsons School of Design, Rhode Island School of Design, MIT, Harvard, Illinois School of Technology, Copenhagen Business School, University of Washington, San Francisco State University and University of California Berkeley.  

She received a Distinguished Designer Fellowship from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1988; the Trailblazer Award from the National Home Fashion League (1980), and an honorary doctorate from [[Academy of Art University]] (2003).  In 2008, [[Chrysler]] Corporation established the Chrysler Sara Little Turnbull Scholarship at Academy of Art University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.academyart.edu/news/articles/academy-scholarship-rewards-emerging-industrial-designers.html |title =New Academy Scholarship Rewards Emerging Industrial Designers |date = |accessdate = |website = academyart.edu |publisher = [[Academy of Art University]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Modern Art Council of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] designated her a "Bay Area Living Treasure" in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/community/bmag/sbsm0202/spreadsheet_one.html "Spreadsheet One: The GSB's Living Treasure,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804210022/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/community/bmag/sbsm0202/spreadsheet_one.html |date=2012-08-04 }} February 2002, ''Stanford Business Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, at the age of 89, Sara Little received the Lifetime Achievement Award from [[Icograda]] (International Congress of Graphic Design Associations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/icograda-design-week-in-seattle "Icograda Design Week in Seattle"] AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) website&lt;/ref&gt;

UNIBE has been listed consistently as the best university in the Dominican Republic by [[QS Latin America University Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.listindiario.com/la-republica/2014/11/4/344021/Cuatro-universidades-dominicanas-estan-en-ranking-de-las-mejores-300-de-la&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hoy.com.do/universidades-de-rd-se-encuentran-en-el-ranking-qs-sobre-las-mejores-del-mundo/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{coord missing|Dominican Republic}}

UNIBE (Universidad Iberoamericana) is a private non-profit coeducational university in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Founded in 1982 as a result of the initiative of the Iberoamerican-Cooperation Institute and a Management Committee in the Dominican Republic. The document was signed on January 12, 1982, at a ceremony held at the Embassy of Spain.

The University began with self-effort of the Dominican authorities, and the main causes behind its foundation can be expressed as follows: the V Centenary of the Cultural Encounter between Spain and the American people, the desire to strengthen Hispanic ties between the American countries and Spain, as well as offering an answer to the educational needs of the country, as an institution of high academic quality and highly formative.

It acquired its legal status by the Decree No. 3371 of July 12, 1982. UNIBE academic life began on September 1, 1983, offering careers in law, Engineering and Medicine. The following year featured Architecture Business Administration as career offers, and by May 1985 the career of Dentistry, attracting a first group of Spanish students at the School of Dentistry, due to the facilities and the quality of education offered in this field.
[Edit] Functionality

In 1986 began offering the first post-graduate level specialization: School Health and Insurance. In August 2004, during the celebration in the Fifth Ordinary Session of the National Council of Higher Education, Science and Technology (CONESCYT) approved by Resolution 31-2004, which grants the full exercise of autonomy to the institution.

Through the years UNIBE expanded its offerings in other areas, 14 careers in total, with an enrollment over 3000 students and 5000 graduates.

==Career==

'''Women's Studio Workshop (WSW)''' is a nonprofit visual [[arts studio]] and [[private press]] offering residencies and educational workshops, located in [[Rosendale, New York]].

The workshop was founded in 1974 by Ann Kalmbach, [[Tatana Kellner]], Anita Wetzel, and Barbara Leoff Burge as an alternative space for female artists to create new work, gain artistic experience, and develop new skills. The studio operates throughout the year with artist residencies, gallery exhibitions, artist lectures, and diverse educational programs for children and adults. In addition, they operate a Summer Art Institute which includes options to study abroad. The studio supports projects in a wide range of media types, with a focus on [[Book Art|book arts]], [[Paper making|papermaking]], and printmaking methods: [[screen printing]], [[letterpress]], [[etching]], [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]. 

WSW is the largest publisher of [[Artist's book|artists' books]] in North America. {{CN|date=August 2018}} The workshop is represented in book arts and special collections of notable libraries, such as the [[Library of Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Library of Congress Acquires Rosendale Women’s Studio Handmade Book Collection. | date=6 June  2013 | type=Print  | newspaper=Hudson Valley Business Journal | pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book as Art: Artists' Books from the National Museum of Women in the Arts|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=9781568989921|pages=79–81|author=Krystyna Wasserman|author2=Joanna Drucker |author3=Audrey Audrey Niffenegger |type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dexter Library, [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and James Branch Cabell Library, [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].[http://www.library.vcu.edu/research/special-collections/cabell/book-art/] Editions by visiting artists published by the Women's Studio Workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hand, voice &amp; vision : artists' books from Women's Studio Workshop|year=2010|publisher=Women's Studio Workshop,|location=Rosendale, N.Y.|url=http://handvoicevision.com/|author=Kathy Walkup|author2=Grolier Club. |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have been featured in overview exhibitions and symposiums on contemporary book arts such as the Codex Book Fair and Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book art object|publisher=Codex Foundation|pages=355–357; 382;417|author=David Jury|author2=Peter Rutledge Koch |year=2008|type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pyramid Atlantic]] Book Arts Fair.

The '''École Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Montpellier''', or '''ENSCM''', is one of the [[France|French]] ''[[Grandes Ecoles]]'', situated in [[Montpellier]]. Although it may share academic staff and research activities with the [[University]] as well as research bodies such as [[CNRS]], the ENSCM has a particular status as an independent body with its own research laboratories.

Teaching chemistry in Montpellier started in 1676 with the creation of the first chair of [[chemistry]] at the University of [[Medicine]]. Later on, in 1803 the School of [[Pharmacy]] was established with a chair of Chemistry and then the Faculty of Science in 1809. The original Institute of Chemistry was founded in 1889 in order to gather the professors who were teaching the same subjects in different Faculties. In 1934, it left the old historic centre to settle in larger and more functional new buildings.

The ENSCM is still in the same buildings - a few minutes' walk from the old historic city center - which were renovated and enlarged. It also acquired new facilities on a second site, 3 kilometers away from the main one, called "La Galéra", which is equipped with a kilo-lab and on a third site, close to Université Montpellier II : the "Institut Européen des Membranes".

The ENSCM provides high level training for engineers and researchers in Chemistry and is renowned for its research activities in the following fields:

* Macromolecular Chemistry (particularly Heterochemistry)
* Soft Chemistry
* Design and development of solids (macromolecules, hybrid materials, catalytic materials and membranes), study of the properties and uses of these materials.

Research is carried out ( in partnership with CNRS, Universités Monpellier I et II) in “Unités Mixtes de Recherche” (Mixed Research Units)
* UMR 5076 : Molecular and Macromolecular Heterochemistry
* UMR 5618 : Catalytic Materials and Catalysis in Organic Chemistry
* UMR 5635 : Institut Européen des Membranes.

Some ENSCM Professors and researchers are members of a team carrying out research in the field of Biology and Health. : UMR 5160 : Health Pharmacology and Biotechnologies Centre, CNRS, Université Montpellier II, Université Montpellier 1.

The ENSCM is also a member of the “Fédération Gay Lussac” – network of “Grandes Ecoles” gathering 17 Schools of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Within this network, the ENSCM ranks very high both by the level of the student it recruits and the importance of the research activities carried out in its internationally renowned laboratories.
