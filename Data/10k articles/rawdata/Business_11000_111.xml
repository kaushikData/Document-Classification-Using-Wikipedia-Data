      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4299">{{about|the advertising executive|the geologist|Arthur A. Meyerhoff}}
'''Arthur E. Meyerhoff''' (1895–1986) was an [[advertising agency]] executive and [[entrepreneur]]. He was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]].
 
Meyerhoff founded his own agency, '''Arthur Meyerhoff Associates''', in 1932 after persuading the [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company]] that he could arrange for newspapers to place advertisements for Wrigley chewing gum on their comic pages. He then got the newspapers to agree to the idea.

During [[World War II]], [[Philip K. Wrigley]] was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[Major League Baseball]] club. Wrigley decided to found the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the [[military draft]] was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. He approached other Major League team owners, but the idea was not well received. Then, four non-Major League cities were selected that were in close proximity to the AAGPBL headquarters in Chicago and close to each other: [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] of [[Illinois]], [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] of [[Indiana]] and [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] of [[Wisconsin]]. Meyerhoff was given the responsibility of coordinating operations with city officials and civic leaders in the communities, as well as a projected budget was developed. In 1943 the league made an auspicious debut, but after the 1944 season Wrigley sold the AAGPBL to Meyerhoff.

It was under Meyerhoff management that expansion to six teams, as well as the publicity campaign of the AAGPBL reached its peak. He re-organized the league so that each franchise would be governed through a League Board of Directors with representatives from each franchise. Each club now had a voice in the adoption of rules and regulations and the direction of the sport. All assets were turned over to the new directors and Wrigley was no longer involved with the league. The AAGPBL excelled in attendance and performing during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/league/history.cfm All-American Girls Professional Baseball League History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422084111/http://www.aagpbl.org/league/history.cfm |date=April 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyerhoff also organized several companies outside his advertising agency to develop new products. One company he owned developed ''[[PAM (cooking oil)|PAM]]'', a substitute for fats or oils that can be sprayed on pots and pans. In the mid-1950s, when Meyerhoff was looking for a side business, he advertised for ideas and heard from two chemists who had developed something like a [[cooking spray]]. First, Meyerhoff had the formula perfected so it could be sprayed; then he campaigned for grocers to shelve ''PAM'' in the baking aisle with the flours, not the [[aerosol]] section next to [[insecticide]]s and [[hair spray]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1554116.html  Chicago Tribune - PAM: Edible W-40 Article]&lt;/ref&gt; The name PAM is an [[initialism]] for "Product of Arthur Meyerhoff."

In the 1960s Meyerhoff wrote his book ''The Strategy of Persuasion'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Strategy of Persuasion'' (Mass Market Paperback) - Arthur E. Meyerhoff - Publisher: Berkley, 1968. [[Amazon Standard Identification Number|ASIN: B001Q6BMP4]]&lt;/ref&gt; which reflects his point of views that the [[United States Information Agency]] should get out of the news business and into the business of selling [[democracy]] abroad. He sold his agency in 1979.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite web|title=A.E.

Meyerhoff died on August 29, 1986 at his home in [[Rancho Santa Fe, California]], at the age of 91.&lt;ref name=Obit /&gt;

'''Business Intelligence Markup Language''' (Biml) is a domain-specific [[XML]] dialect for defining [[business intelligence]] (BI) assets.  Biml authored BI assets can currently be used by the [[BIDS Helper]] add-on for [[Microsoft SQL Server]] [[Business Intelligence Development Studio]] (BIDS) and the [[Varigence]] Mist (now called BimlStudio) [[integrated development environment]]; both tools translate Biml metadata into [[SQL Server Integration Services]] (SSIS) and [[Microsoft Analysis Services|SQL Server Analysis Services]] (SSAS) assets for the [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. However, emitters can be created to compile Biml for any desired BI platform.

While Biml’s declarative design is sufficient to author BI assets, BimlScript extends the language by enabling authors to embed [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[VB.NET]] code within Biml, similar to how [[ASP.NET]] includes .NET code within static [[HTML]] markup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chenn|first=Ronen|title=BIDS helper new features ( April 2011 )|url=http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/bilive/archive/2011/05/16/bids-helper-new-features-april-2011.aspx|accessdate=October 1, 2012|newspaper=Business Intelligence,Technology, Thoughts, Thinking|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BimlScript is used to merge changes into existing Biml assets, automatically generate Biml code, and apply changes across multiple Biml files during compilation.

==History==

===Biml===

Biml is an XML dialect that specifies all aspects of a BI solution, including relational models, data transformation packages, multi-dimensional models, and tabular models.

Unlike other BI solutions, Biml has a "write once, target any platform" philosophy. This enables Biml users to switch their target platform without needing to change their code. Currently, Biml targets SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012 and 2014, emitting SSIS packages and SSAS cubes.

Because Biml is XML, it can leverage the vast ecosystem of tools for XML based languages. This also makes it human readable/writeable, so it is easier to edit by hand than the SSIS/SSAS files it generates.

In late 2009, Biml was extended with BimlScript. BimlScript allows C# or VB.NET code nuggets to be embedded directly within Biml. BimlScript's goal is to automate repetitive work in reusable scripts. Additionally, it's been used to automate package generation and build reusable patterns for BI tasks. BimlScript is also used to take metadata from various sources (relational database structure, relational data, flat files, annotations, etc...) and automatically generate Biml code from it.

===Mist===
[[Mist (IDE)|Mist]] is an IDE for authoring Biml code and building BI assets. Mist leverages visual design capabilities and [[debugging]] features to simultaneously edit entire business intelligence models, including relational tables, SSIS packages, and [[OLAP cube|cubes]].&lt;ref name="Leonard2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Andy|title=SQL Server 2012 Integration Services Design Patterns|year=2012|publisher=APress|isbn=978-1430237716|pages=456|author2=Masson, Matt |author3=Mitchell, Tim |author4=Moss, Jessica |author5= Ufford, Michelle |chapter=Chapter 17: Business Intelligence Markup Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mist also incorporates modern programming IDE features, including text editors with syntax highlighting, Intelliprompt and quick-info displays, source control integration, and multi-monitor support.

===BIDS Helper===
As Biml’s popularity has grown, key portions of the Biml engine, including dynamic package generation, have been contributed to the [http://bidshelper.codeplex.com BIDS Helper] open source project hosted on CodePlex.&lt;ref name="Tok2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tok|first=Wee-Hyong|title=Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Integration Services|year=2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn= 978-0735665859|author2=Parida, Rakesh |author3=Masson, Matt |author4=Ding, Xiaoning |author5= Sivashanmugam, Kaarthik  |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch|first=John|title=Biml Package Generator|url=http://bidshelper.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Biml%20Package%20Generator|work=BIDS Helper|accessdate=September 30, 2011|date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BimlScript community===
[http://www.bimlscript.com BimlScript.com] is a community website for developing and sharing Biml solutions to BI problems, and contributing Biml content to share with others. Along with tutorials, walkthroughs, and videos, the site provides an online Biml editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to BimlScript.com|url=http://bimlscript.com/Blog|work=BimlScript.com|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code generation==
Biml files are compiled to produce BI assets for a chosen platform. Currently, it’s possible to generate assets for Microsoft’s SSIS, SSAS, and SQL Server platforms, for the 2005, 2008 (R2), 2012 and 2014 releases. Other platforms may be targeted in the future.

==Syntax==
{{See also|XML#Key_terminology|l1=XML Terminology}}
Biml has a syntax that’s common to all XML languages. Tags begin and end with &lt; and &gt;, respectively. Furthermore, tags can have attributes and nested elements.

===Biml===

====Declaration====
Biml documents begin with a common declaration
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Root types====
Biml has a well-defined set of root types, indicating the various kinds of BI assets that can be created

* Connections
* Databases
* Schemas
* Tables
* Dimensions
* Facts
* Packages
* File Formats
* Script Projects
* Cubes
* Principals

====Example====
This is an example of the AdventureWorks DimCurrency table, authored in Biml

&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
  &lt;Dimensions&gt;
    &lt;Dimension Name="DimCurrency" SchemaName="Target.dbo" AttributeAllMemberName="All Source Currencies" DimensionType="Currency" FriendlyName="Currency"&gt;
      &lt;Columns&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyAlternateKey" DataType="StringFixedLength" Length="3" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyName" DataType="String" Length="50" /&gt;
      &lt;/Columns&gt;
      &lt;Keys&gt;
        &lt;Identity Name="IK_DimCurrency"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/Identity&gt;
        &lt;UniqueKey Name="AK_DimCurrency_CurrencyAlternateKey"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/UniqueKey&gt;
      &lt;/Keys&gt;
      &lt;Indexes&gt;&lt;/Indexes&gt;
      &lt;Attributes&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency" EstimatedCount="101" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencySource" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyName" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency Code" EstimatedCount="105" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencyIsoCode" Usage="Key" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyKey" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
          &lt;NameColumn ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
      &lt;/Attributes&gt;
      &lt;Relationships&gt;
        &lt;Relationship Name="Source Currency" ParentAttributeName="Source Currency Code" ChildAttributeName="Source Currency" Type="Rigid" /&gt;
      &lt;/Relationships&gt;
    &lt;/Dimension&gt;
  &lt;/Dimensions&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===BimlScript===
All BimlScript tags begin and end with &lt;# and #&gt; delimiters, respectively. Special types of BimlScript tags use augmented versions of these delimiters, to indicate specific usages.

====Directives====
A Biml file, with BimlScript, begins with at least one directive. Directives provide instructions to the Biml engine, regarding how to process the BimlScript and generate its Biml. Directives are single tags that begin with &lt;#@. Each directive begins with a single term, followed by attributes that supply required values.

The two most common directives are template and import.

=====Template=====
This directive indicates that the file's BimlScript uses the C# programming language.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ template language="C#" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=====Import=====
This directive specifies .NET namespaces that should be imported for the file. It is functionally equivalent to the C# using statement or VB.NET Imports statement.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Delimiters====
When authoring BimlScript, additional delimiters may be used. These delimiters match the behavior of T4 template delimiters.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Delimiter !! Description
|-
| &lt;# || Defines statements, in .NET code, that provide control flow in a Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#= || Evaluates .NET code, converts it to a string, and then embeds it in the Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#+ || Defines properties, methods, and files that are excluded from the Biml file but may be accessed by other BimlScript code nuggets.
|}

====Example====
This BimlScript example imports a database's assets via a connection, declared in a separate file, named "AdventureWorksLT". Each schema and table from the imported database is then embedded directly within the Schemas and Tables collections, respectively.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt; 
&lt;#@ template language="C#" hostspecific="True" tier="2" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions.SchemaManagement" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.CoreLowerer.SchemaManagement" #&gt;

&lt;#+ public ImportResults Results
{ 
    get 
    { 
        return ((AstOleDbConnectionNode)RootNode.Connections["AdventureWorksLT"]).ImportDB();
    }
}
#&gt; 

&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;Databases&gt;
        &lt;Database Name="MyDatabase" ConnectionName="AdventureWorksLT" /&gt;
    &lt;/Databases&gt;
    &lt;Schemas&gt;
        &lt;#=Results.SchemaNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Schemas&gt;
    &lt;Tables&gt; 
        &lt;#=Results.TableNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Tables&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example shows how developers can use Biml and BimlScript to:
# Import schemas and tables directly from a database, and use them without needing to manually copy their structure.
# Have any changes to the assets be automatically reflected the next time this code is run.
# Import the assets and convert them to Biml using only two simple lines of code.

'''Business continuity''' is the planning and preparation of a company to make sure it overcomes serious incidents or disasters and resumes its normal operations within a reasonably short period. This concept includes the following key elements: {{CN|date=October 2018}}
#[[Resilience (organizational)|Resilience]]: critical business functions and the supporting infrastructure are designed in such a way that they are materially unaffected by relevant disruptions. Resilience is established through controls that are preventive or deterrent in nature. Examples include redundancy and spare capacity; 
#Recovery: arrangements have to be made to recover or restore business functions that fail for some reason. Recovery is established through controls focused on detection, mitigation, and correction.
#[[Contingency management|Contingency]]: the organization establishes a generalized capability and readiness to cope effectively with disruptions, including those that were not, and perhaps could not have been, foreseen. Contingency preparations constitute a last-resort response if resilience and recovery arrangements should prove inadequate in practice. 

Typical disasters that business continuity covers include fires, floods, accidents caused by key people, server crashes or virus infections, insolvency of key suppliers, negative media campaigns and market upheavals (ex. stock market crashes). The locations of these disasters and the company real estates may be independent.

== Responsibility ==
The management of business continuity falls largely within the sphere of [[quality management]] and [[risk management]], with some cross-over into related fields such as [[governance]], [[information security]] and [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]].  Risk management is an important tool for business continuity as it provides a structured way to identify the sources of business disruption and assess their probability and harm. It is expected that all business functions, operations, supplies, systems, relationships, etc. that are critically important to achieve the organization's operational objectives are analyzed and included in the business continuity plan. Business Impact Analysis is the generally accepted risk management term for the process of determining the relative importance or criticality of those elements, and in turn drives the priorities, planning, preparations and other business continuity management activities.

If there is no business continuity plan implemented and the organization in question is facing a rather severe threat or disruption that may lead to bankruptcy, the implementation and outcome, if not too late, may strengthen the organization's survival and its continuity of business activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gittleman, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
One important way to achieve business continuity is the use of international standards, program development, and supporting policies. These standards ensure that proven methods and concepts for business continuity are used. As with many quality management standards though, the primary task of identifying relevant potential disasters, making plans for evacuation, buying spare machines and servers, performing backups and bringing them off-site, assigning responsibility, performing drills, educating employees and being vigilant cannot be replaced by adherence to standards. As such, commitment by management to see business continuity as an important topic and assign people to work on it, remains the most important step in establishing business continuity.

Several business continuity standards have been published by various standards bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Business Continuity Plan |publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security |url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/continuity |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*International Organization for Standardization:

** BS 25999-2:2007, "Specification for Business Continuity Management”, formally specified a set of requirements for a business continuity management system.  It too was withdrawn in 2012 when it was (in effect) replaced by ISO 22301.

==Program==

Ongoing management-level process to ensure that necessary steps are regularly taken to identify probable accidents, disasters, emergencies, and/or threats. It also involves (1) assessment of the probable effect of such events, (2) development of recovery strategies and plans, and (3) maintenance of their readiness through personnel training and plan testing. See also business impact analysis

==Policies==

Policies are those things mandated by the management of an organization that will always be performed according to a preset design plan, and supporting all business functions within an organization.

==Business impact analysis (BIA)==

The entire concept of business continuity is based on the identification of all business functions within an organization, and then assigning a level of importance to each business function.  A business impact analysis is the primary tool for gathering this information and assigning criticality, recovery point objectives, and recovery time objectives, and is therefore part of the basic foundation of business continuity.

The BIA can be used to identify extent and timescale of the impact on different levels of an organization. For instance it can examine the effect of disruption on operational, functional and strategic activities of an organization.
Not only the current activities but the effect of disruption on major business changes, introducing new product or services for example, can be determined by BIA.

Most standards require that a business impact analysis should be reviewed at defined intervals appropriate for each organization and whenever any of the following occur:
* Significant changes in the internal business process, location or technology
* Significant changes in the external business environment – such as market or regulatory change &lt;ref&gt;BCI Good Practice Guidelines 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document management==

In large information technology environments, personnel turnover is inevitable and must be planned as part of business continuity.  The solution to the problems associated with turnover, is complete and up-to- date documentation.  This ensures that new personnel will have the information they need to quickly become knowledgeable and productive with respect to the business functions they are tasked to support.  This also implies that business function related documentation is largely generated (rather than written) from existing systems and managed in an automated manner.

==Change management==
{{main|change management}}
Regulations require that changes to business functions be documented and tracked for auditing purposes and is designated as "change control".  This brings a level of stability to the business functions by requiring the support personnel to document and coordinate proposed changes to the underlying systems.  As this process becomes more and more automated, the emphasis will be less upon personnel control, and more upon regulatory compliance.

==Audit management==

One of the most costly and time-consuming aspects of information technology management is dealing with auditors.  One of the goals of business continuity is [[data center automation]], which includes audit management.  All modern business functions should be designed with the concept of automatically generating the requisite audit compliance information and documentation as part of conducting day-to-day business.  This dramatically reduces the time and cost associated with manually producing this information.

==Service level agreements (SLA)==

The interface between management and information technology is the [[Service level agreement]] (SLA). This provides a written contract stipulating the expectations of management with regard to the availability of a necessary business function, and the deliverables that information technology provides in support of that business function.

==Communications systems==

Another component of business continuity is communications in times of duress. Members of the disaster recovery team must be able to communicate effectively among themselves as well as with managers, directors, customers, partners, and even with the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/buildng-business-continuity.aspx|title= Building Communications Into Business Continuity|publisher= Dell.com|accessdate= 2012-06-22|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201212950/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/buildng-business-continuity.aspx|archivedate= 2011-02-01|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid some of the potential problems associated with disrupted communication channels, the business continuity plan should include a lead manager who will be in charge of all communications in that area, the cooperation of executives and public relations people, and scheduled exercises to put the plan into practice.

==Other components==
{{example farm|section|date=September 2018}}

The following is a list of logical entities within an information technology environment which aid business continuity:
* Virtualization (provides a means to achieve resiliency)
* Networking design (can support resiliency by design)
* Resource or service groups
* [[Journaling file system]] is a means to achieve resiliency
* [[High availability]], along with [[Redundancy (engineering)]], describes a principle or means of achieving of resiliency
* [[Continuous monitoring]] (can be a means to maintain resiliency or improve recoverability)

== Planning (BCP)==
{{Main|Business continuity planning}}

Planning, prevention, and preparation are a key part of any business continuity management system and have direct read across from civil contingencies planning.  The activity begins with understanding the business to identify potential risks and threats to critical business activities both internally and from the external environment.  It is also advisable to examine the resilience of suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mbtmag.com/blog/2017/12/holding-it-all-together Demrovsky, Chloe. ''Holding It All Together''. Manufacturing Business Technology Magazine, December 22, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The components of the business continuity methodology required for manifestation into a documented plan include:

Set of documents, instructions, and procedures which enable a business to respond to accidents, disasters, emergencies, and/or threats without any stoppage or hindrance in its key operations. Also called business resumption plan, [[disaster recovery plan]], or recovery plan.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Alan. Constructing a Successful Business Continuity Plan. ''Business Insurance Magazine'', March 9, 2015. http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150309/ISSUE0401/303159991/constructing-a-successful-business-continuity-plan&lt;/ref&gt;

Should also include:  purpose, scope, objectives and assumptions that were used to develop the plan.    Key accountabilities including authority to invoke, instructions subsequent to invocations, and a detailed communications plan must be included in the plan to ensure efficient resumption of operations.

Task of identifying, developing, acquiring, documenting, and testing procedures and resources that will ensure continuity of a firm's key operations in the event of an accident, disaster, emergency, and/or threat. It involves (1) risk mitigation planning (reducing possibility of the occurrence of adverse events), and (2) business recovery planning (ensuring continued operation in the aftermath of a disaster).

Guidelines are those things which are recommended to be performed according to a preset design plan.  However depending upon the needs and requirements of the target business function, these items may or may not be performed, or may be altered during implementation.

'''''Capitalism''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] first published in 1995 by [[Interactive Magic]], developed by [[Enlight Software|Enlight]] for the [[Mac OS|Macintosh]] and [[MS-DOS]] and designed by [[Trevor Chan]]. Other similar business simulation games include ''[[Industry Giant]], Entrepreneur'' and ''[[The Corporate Machine]].'' ''Capitalism'' may be the first successful [[business simulation game]].

The aim of ''Capitalism'' is to become the most profitable business in the world while competing in several different markets against a number of different corporations. The player must run a business as the [[chief executive officer]] while preventing the business from going [[bankrupt]] or being bought out by a competitor.

A more advanced version was developed and released as ''Capitalism Plus'' on January 1, 1996, featuring world maps, more products and enhanced management capabilities which was published by [[Brøderbund]]. A sequel was released entitled ''[[Capitalism II]]'' in 2001. An expanded version of ''Capitalism II'', called ''Capitalism Lab'', was released December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalismlab.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Capitalism'' is a simulation game which can be played in two different ways. The player may start their own business or play a scenario with a pre-made business with a set goal. In a new game, the player begins with a maximum of $200,000,000 [[Capital (economics)|initial capital]]. Each store can be stocked with up to four different items.  As a real world model it is necessary to take into account land cost, overhead, demand for the products, and competition. The player can build several types of firms including department stores, factories, research and development centers, farms, mines, oil wells, and logging camps.

The most common [[business model]] to pursue in ''Capitalism'' is [[retail]] by running a chain of department stores. However, the player can venture into any market segment they want including [[manufacturing]], which includes another set of considerations such as suppliers and [[raw material]] shortages. Manufacturing begins with building a factory and planning the internal operation layout of the structure. Purchasing, manufacturing, sales and advertising can all be used in factories.

The player can also choose to run [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) operations as either their sole business or alongside running other operations such as department stores and factories. R&amp;D ultimately improves the player's product quality by increasing ''technology gain''. R&amp;D for any product can last from 6 months to 10 years in the game, with the technology gain being higher when the R&amp;D duration is increased. New products can also be produced using R&amp;D.

== Scenarios ==
[[Image:Capitalism scenario.png|thumb|right|The scenario screen enables players to choose a scenario to play.]]
''Capitalism'' includes seventeen scenarios with pre-made situations and businesses and a certain goal. The scenarios are generally more difficult to succeed in that competitors often have the starting advantage. Each scenario has a different goal and different environment and competitor situation. For example, the ''Alternative Challenge'' scenario restricts the [[Market (economics)|market]] to two cities while in ''"D" for Diversification'' the player must manage a profitable broad-based corporation and manage a large number of firms at the same time.

Some of the scenarios require the player to dominate a particular market in terms of [[market share]]. For example, ''Food Dominance'' sets a goal of dominating the [[food industry]] within 50 years while earning an annual operating profit of no less than $20 million. In ''Fortress of the Beverage King'', the player must dethrone the Beverage King 'James Zandman' as the dominator of the [[beverage industry]] within 50 years.

Most scenario games disable the [[stock market]] option in an attempt to make the player focus on completing the scenario goals. The initial capital given in each scenario depends on the difficulty of the goals set. Each time a player successfully completes a scenario within the time limit set and with all goals reached, they will receive a bonus score and be added to the 'Hall of Fame' list.

== Other features ==
''Capitalism'' includes many different features designed to reduce effort and save time in basic gameplay. From the main menu, players can use 'Quick Start' to choose from eight instructional games to learn about retailing, market analysis, farming, manufacturing, branding and advertising, research and development, raw material production and the stock market. These lessons are included in the game to introduce a new player to the concepts and basic gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;''Capitalism Plus Manual'', page 20. Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of ''Capitalism'' is the layout plan library, which can store layout plans for all types of buildings available in the game. It enables the player to save previously used layout plans into a library as a record and then apply them to buildings to save time rather than creating new layout plans. Layout plans can be replaced, added, deleted or sorted.&lt;ref&gt;''Capitalism Plus Manual'', page 65. Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Capitalism Plus'' ==
[[Image:Capitalism plus box.jpg|thumb|right|''Capitalism Plus'' retail box cover.]]
A more advanced version of the original ''Capitalism'' was developed and released as ''Capitalism Plus'' on Jan 1, 1996 and published by [[Brøderbund]] for [[Windows 95]] only. It added world maps, more products and enhanced management capabilities to the game in addition to improved [[SVGA]] graphics, more markets to dominate and random events including riots, disease and technology breakthroughs. With ''Capitalism Plus'', a map and scenario editor program was also added enabling players to configure products, industries, goals and other items.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117233814/http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/pc/reviews/capitalism-plus-3df01b.html Yahoo!

Shortly after the release of ''Capitalism'' in 1995, a review in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' commented, "The game is complex, but don't let the novel-sized manual fool you. It may be daunting at first, but this is one of those sims that you'll play for hours without even noticing." The reviewer scored it four out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Capitalism|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|pages=159, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Capitalism'' also made appearances on [[The Discovery Channel]],{{cn|date=April 2018}} and [[CNBC|CNBC-TV Cable]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In 1996, [[Harvard University]] and [[Stanford University]] began using ''Capitalism'' for educational purposes. Professor Tom Kosnik said, "Capitalism is a world-class, hands-on learning experience I've used at Stanford School of Engineering and Harvard Business School. Gamers not only learn the subtleties of growing an entrepreneurial business but also learn about leadership and team building necessary in any business situation." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enlight.com/eng/html/about_tl.htm Enlight - Timeline; 1995, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1996, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' reviewed ''Capitalism'', saying:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007BGOH Amazon.com, Capitalism Plus Reviews - BusinessWeek, October 21, 1996] (original source: BusinessWeek, abstracted from capalive.com)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''Capitalism'' isn't just for those who aspire to be the next Michael Dell or Sam Walton. It can be a fun and useful exercise for anyone who wants to test their entrepreneurial mettle without, for once, taking any risk. Players can choose to compete against computer-controlled rivals in four different industries: farming, manufacturing, raw material mining, and retailing. For a truly adventurous and time-consuming game, players can mix and match industries as captains of giant conglomerates. As in the real world, players compete locally, in one city, or fight it out on the global stage. With so many possibilities, Capitalism is an intense strategy game, much like chess, where players must constantly think ahead. As such, it could easily overwhelm novices. But by adjusting several factors — competency and managerial style of the computer-controlled rivals, for example, can be varied from very aggressive to conservative — gameplay can be suited to various styles and speed. The game even allows a player to hire presidents to manage the day-to-day operations of different divisions so the player can concentrate on the big picture.}}

In 2000, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' named ''Capitalism'' among the fifteen most difficult games ever, saying: "[''Capitalism'' is] so complicated it should come with a free [[MBA]] in every box.{{cn|date=April 2018}}"  The magazine has also praised the game as highly enjoyable and addictive.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

''PC Gamer'' nominated ''Capitalism'' as the best simulation of 1995, although it lost to ''[[Apache (video game)|Apache]]''.&lt;ref name=pcgamerusawards&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1996 | title=The Year's Best Games | pages=64, 65, 67, 68, 71, 73-75 | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | author=Editors of ''PC Gamer'' | volume=3 | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles John Biddle''' (April 30, 1819 – September 28, 1873) was an [[United States|American]] [[soldier]], [[lawyer]], [[U.S. Congressman|congressman]], and newspaper editor.

==Biography==
Biddle was born and died in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He was the son of [[Nicholas Biddle (1786-1844)|Nicholas Biddle]], president of the [[Second Bank of the United States]], and nephew of Congressman [[Richard Biddle]]. Charles Biddle graduated from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1837, where he studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1840.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}
[[File:Captain Charles John Biddle.png|thumb|left|Biddle during the Mexican-American War]]
Biddle served in the [[Mexican–American War]], serving as [[Captain (United States)|captain]] and company commander in the [[Regiment of Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen]]. He was [[Brevet (military)|brevetted]] to the rank of [[Major (United States)|Major]] for gallantry in the [[Battle of Chapultepec]]. At the close of the war, he returned to Philadelphia to practice law.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}

In May 1861, following the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] and President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call to arms, he was appointed a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[Pennsylvania Reserves]], rising in May to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in command of the [[13th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment|42nd Pennsylvania Volunteers Infantry (13th Reserves)]], also known as the 1st Pennsylvania Rifles. In October of that year he was elected to the [[Thirty-seventh United States Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Edward J. Morris]]. He was tendered a commission as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], but declined it, and then resigned from the army in February 1862.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}

After the war, he became one of the proprietors and editor-in-chief of the ''Philadelphia Age'', and retained that position for the remainder of his life. His literary work was confined mainly to editorial contributions to the columns of this journal. His only separate publication was ''The Case of Major André'', a carefully prepared essay read before the [[Historical Society of Pennsylvania]], which vindicated the action of [[George Washington]]. The immediate occasion was a passage in [[Lord Mahon]]'s ''History of England'' that denounced the execution of [[John André|André]] as the greatest blot upon Washington's record. By an authority so high as the ''London Critic'', this essay was subsequently pronounced a fair refutation of Lord Mahon's charge.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1900}}

'''Craig Cohon''' is a London-based, [[Canadians|Canadian]] businessman known for his role in bringing both [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Cirque du Soleil]] to [[Russia]].  A [[University of Western Ontario]] graduate and Advisory Board member, Cohon is also known for his work in the early 2000s in international development and London community building and for the last decade deeply involved in the nighttime entertainment business in Moscow and recently in London.

==Early life==
Cohon was born at [[Michael Reese Hospital]] in the South Side of Chicago, the eldest of two children of Susan Silver Cohon (Born 1938), a philanthropist and [[George Cohon]] (Born 1937), a former lawyer and Founder of McDonald's in Canada and Russia. His grandparents on both sides emigrated from Ukraine, Russia, Lithuania and Latvia.

Cohon moved with his parents and younger brother Mark to [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in 1968 when he was five years old. He attended [[Upper Canada College]] where he excelled in rugby and also took up the saxophone which he plays to this day. Cohon went on to graduate from the economics and music faculty from [[The University of Western Ontario]] where he was heavily involved in student politics, was the Business Editor of the University newspaper, worked at the campus radio station and started a TV station on campus - playing in a band, throughout.  Cohon also created the first Annual Western Charity Ball (1984) with Alan Thicke that continues to this day, raising millions of dollars for local London and Canadian charities.

Cohon got the travel bug in 1985 and has worked and traveled to 97 countries but calls London home and has lived there since 1999. As well as spending 15 years in Canada, Cohon has also spent 12 in the USA, five years in Russia, two years in Sweden, two years in Norway and three months each in India, South Africa, Chile and Venezuela.

Post university, Cohon became one of the first Canadian venturers for the UK charity Operation Raleigh and participated in Operation 5C in 1985 to Southern Chile. He helped to build a school in Puerto Montt and completed a road survey on horseback for the extension of the [[Pan American Highway]] (which has now been built).

==Corporate career==
He came out of the jungle in May 1986, saw a Coca-Cola sign on a hut and went on to work for the company for 14 years. Cohon quickly grew through the ranks within Coca-Cola USA from 1986-1991. He was given the Miami territory and he started selling Coca-Cola to mom and pop restaurants from a banana-coloured station wagon and after two years had become one of the top salesmen in the country. Cohon was soon promoted to the company's headquarters in Atlanta and went on to train hundreds of Coca-Cola salespeople across the United States.

Two months after the opening of the Soviet Union's first McDonald's restaurant in Moscow in early 1991, his future mentor Donald Keough, President and CEO of the Coca-Cola Company worldwide, appointed Cohon as the company's first employee in the Soviet Union. He spent six months living in the communist party hotel Octoberskya 2 in Moscow where he learned to speak fluent Russian, worked at the local Soviet beverage factory, rode trucks, and traveled to every metro station in the city, convincing the leadership of Coca-Cola to invest in Russia. From age 27  to 31 he launched the brand to the Russians and led the construction of Coca-Cola's first factory in the former Soviet Union. Cohon and his friends and family were hosted by President Gorbachev at his 30th birthday party. He was often followed by the KGB and went public on Russian radio with tapes after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Just prior to the first Soviet Coca-Cola plant opening, a rocket-propelled hand grenade was launched at his office early one morning in October 1993, luckily causing little damage.

Cohon was eventually promoted to European Division Marketing Director and moved to Oslo, running the marketing for 15 countries in Northern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He then moved to Atlanta for four years where he was responsible for Brand Coca-Cola worldwide, including its activation at the [[1996 Atlanta Olympic Games]].

After his extended tenure, he chose to jump off the traditional corporate career path and spend three years as Director of Learning Strategy for the Coca-Cola European Group. His personal coach was Peter Senge, famous author of The Fifth Discipline. He helped the senior Coca-Cola European leadership team create shared vision around the changing beverage landscape and started to move the organisation to a more responsible corporate agenda.

Cohon moved to London in 1999 and was promoted to be Deputy Division President of The Northwest Europe Division.

Cohon was nominated to the Class of 1999 Global Leaders for Tomorrow at the World Economic Forum. It was in the midst of the anti-globalisation movement and after attending Davos and hearing former American President Clinton speak about the need to evolve capitalism to make it more equitable for all, he decided to leave The Coca-Cola Company and left a substantial amount of stock options on the table to pursue a more purposeful life and career.

He went on to work for Klaus Schwab, Founder of the World Economic Forum for six months, deeply engaging in the world of international organisations, understanding the world of Global NGOs and pushing the corporate social responsibility agenda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/58c09746-48bd-11d9-9162-00000e2511c8.html#axzz4K2ujM3M1&lt;/ref&gt; Perceiving the challenge of making a personal impact on global issues, in 2001 he founded Globalegacy and focused his efforts on making an impact in London's urban communities.

After teaching at the [[London Business School]] for a summer, he hired 10 students and began to craft a vision for Globalegacy. Cohon focused his efforts on East London and quickly moved into an office container near Bromley-By-Bow. He worked closely with local government authorities the LDA, Bromley-by-Bow Centre and Leaside Regeneration to begin to craft a local development strategy that worked for all prior to the awarding of the [[2012 Olympic Games]].

Cohon then decided to take his expertise back internationally. He teamed up with world-renowned city development expert Jeb Brugmann and global business guru, CK Prahalad, author of ''Fortune at The Bottom of the Pyramid'' to own and lead an international development strategic advisory firm. Together they helped create and support two thriving businesses for people in poverty. One started with BP, now called First Energy, is a leading provider of clean energy stoves for businesses and kitchens throughout India. The other, RML, was an early stage tech company incubated with Reuters that went on to become an award-winning technology company providing Agri Decision Support Solution for farmers throughout India.

==Honours, Awards and Boards==
In 1993, Cohon received an Honorary Doctorate of Economics from Moscow International University. In 2000, the World Economic Forum named him "A Global Leader for Tomorrow." He was awarded the 2003 Young Alumni Award from the University of Western Ontario&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alumni.westernu.ca/connect/alumni/craig-cohon.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; and now sits on their Global Advisory Board. Cohon is an active supporter of London's soon-to-be-built Garden Bridge project. As well, he gives time to many local charities in London. 
Cohon was one of the first sponsors of London's Ethical Fashion Forum's RE Fashion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethicalfashionforum.com/re-fashion-awards&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also Chairman of Worn Again since 2007, a technology innovation company in development of a circular textile to textile recycling technology&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/how-the-fashion-industry-is-helping-the-worlds-rubbish-problem-a7052826.html&lt;/ref&gt; and working closely with H &amp; M.

Cohon decided to combine his international business experience and his love of Russia to delve into another business: entertainment. Partnering with Guy Laliberte, owner of the world's largest live entertainment company, Cohon brought [[Cirque du Soleil]] to Russia, acting as Vice Chairman of Cirque du Soleil Russia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-07-26/russians-get-circus-from-family-that-gave-them-big-macs-cola&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 he has helped transform the live entertainment business across the country, bringing 11 highly acclaimed international shows to 14 Russian cities which have been seen by 2.3 million people. Cohon spearheaded over 120 million USD investment into the sector and has worked with 40 local Russian and International partners. He also led the implementation of Russia's first electronic ticketing system that provides security, best pricing and freedom of choice to millions of Russians. Cohon's Russian partner is currently finalising plans to build a $50 million USD theatre to house future Cirque du Soleil shows in Moscow.

Throughout this time, Cohon has built a close global network of artists, directors, producers, musicians, stage designers and actors. He has been very engaged in the emerging immersive theatre segment in London and Moscow and continues to actively support the development of these new underground concepts to expand entertainment and nightlife.

==Personal life==
Cohon lives on a barge called Ocean on the River Thames with his teenage son and daughter. Cohon was divorced in 2010 from Dr. Jeanette Sundberg-Cohon after an 18-year relationship.

Cohon is an avid international traveller. He does not own a car and travels throughout London by foot, boat, bike and public transport.

A '''development director''' or '''director of development''' is the senior fundraising manager of a [[non-profit organization]], [[company (law)|company]], or [[corporation]]. The position works closely with a [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[treasurer]]. A Director of Development is chiefly responsible for bringing in revenue streams to a non-profit (grants, donations, special events), and a CFO is responsible for the fiscal management of the organization. A CFO is rarely assigned to write grant narratives, but may oversee the budget section of a grant application or a fiscal report for a grant. Some larger organizations (especially those that have large government grants) have a grants manager as well as a grant writer/Director of Development.  A Grants Manager assists the CFO with grant reports and/or grant related accounting. A development director is usually [[Remuneration|remunerated]] for his or her work,&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2008-08-23

|publisher=Non-profit fundraising Resource}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and in best practices for [[nonprofit organization]]s, development directors earn salaries.  Commissions are still considered unethical by professional organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association (GPA) and the [[Association of Fundraising Professionals]] (AFP), but the practice of commission based remuneration is growing, particularly in the current economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grantprofessionals.org/ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of a development director is to develop and implement a strategic plan to raise vital funds for their organization in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.The development director's primary responsibility, however, is to oversee fundraising, rather than to actually raise money. This person may write grants, research foundations and corporations, and oversee or implement other fundraising strategies, but she or he works mostly behind the scenes, establishing a structure for effective fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The development director may also be responsible for additional financial responsibilities, including developing business plans or strategic plans in collaboration with the board for the future of the organization. The development director is usually accountable to the [[Executive Director]], [[Chief Operating Officer]], or CFO. The board often offers suggestions and ideas about how to increase the fundraising, including contacts, and the development director chooses how to implement these ideas to maximize inflow while keeping outflow at a minimum and keeping donors happy. A strong board often has a development/fundraising committee, makes personal donations to the non-profit, and assists with annual campaigns.

The development director has an outreach role in the organization and often fulfills a [[public relations|public affairs]] role in addition to office-based work. Development directors motivate and satisfy donors, board members, staff and even the press. Many Directors of Development assist with communications such a non-profits annual report, development and communications section of website, newsletters, and donor databases.

The structure of a Development Department varies greatly. A Director of Development may or may not have staff reporting to him/her, depending on the size of the organization. Some large non-profits have a development team including a Grant Writer, donor database specialist, Grants Manager, Special Events Coordinator, Communications staff, and Planning Giving staff. In some cases, an Executive Director serves as the lead grant writer of an organization. Some non-profits hire development staff on a part-time or consultant basis, instead of full-time.

Median pay for Development Directors in the U.S. is in the neighborhood of $62,000 annually. Total cash compensation ranges from $40,000 to $100,000; the final number includes potential for approximately $10,000 each from bonuses and profit sharing in exceptional cases. While geography and years of experience impact pay for this group, the organization is the most influential factor. Earnings for this group are mostly affected by the particular organization, followed by the particular city and tenure.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=Payscale Human Resource}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As the title suggests, the development director is concerned with the growth of the organization. This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and maximize the organization's profitability and profile.&lt;ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Diary studies''' is a [[research method]] that collects [[qualitative property|qualitative information]] by having participants record entries about their every day lives in a log, diary or journal about the activity or experience being studied. This collection of data uses a&amp;nbsp;[[longitudinal study|longitudinal technique]], meaning that it is reported by the participants over a period of time ranging from some days to more a few months, meaning that it studies the same [[variable (research)|variables]] over a period of time. This research tool, although not being able to provide results as detailed as a true [[field study]], can still offer a vast amount of contextual information without the costs of a true field study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigdesignevents.com/2012/08/5-methods-to-collect-data-with-diary-studies/|title=5 methods to collect data with diary studies|last=Sullivan|first=Brian K.|date=August 9, 2012|website=Big Design|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nngroup.com/articles/diary-studies/|title=Diary Studies: Understanding Long-Term User Behavior and Experiences|last=Flaherty|first=Kim|date=June 5, 2016|website=Nielsen Norman Group|publisher=|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diary studies are also known as [[Experience sampling method|experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment (EMA)]] methodology.  

Traditionally diary studies involved participants keeping a written diary of events. However the emergence of smartphones now enables participants to diary with photos, videos and text using a variety of online, mobile or offline apps and tools. 

There are two types of diary studies:

# '''Elicitation studies''', where participants capture media that are then used as prompts for discussion in interviews. The method is a way to trigger the participant's memory. This type of diary study is sometimes referred to by Researchers as pre-task or pre-work and typically is carried out before an in-person interview such as a [[Focus group|Focus Group]] or an In-depth interview.
# '''Feedback studies''', where participants answer predefined questions about events. This is a way of getting immediate answers from the participants.&lt;ref name="CarterMankoff"&gt;Carter and Mankoff (2005). When participants do the capturing: the role of media in diary studies. ''CHI '05 Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems''.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
An early example of a diary study was "How Workingmen Spend Their Time" (Bevans, 1913) which went unpublished by George Esdras Bevans.&lt;ref&gt;"Bevans, G.E. (1913). How Workingmen Spend Their Time (Unpublished Doctoral Thesis). Columbia University, New York, NY"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Diary studies originate from the fields of [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]]. In the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), diary studies have been adopted as one method of learning about user needs towards designing more appropriate technologies.&lt;ref name="CarterMankoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PalenSalzman"&gt;Palen, L., &amp; Salzman, M. (2002). Voice-mail diary studies for naturalistic data capture under mobile conditions. In ''Proceedings of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW '02)'', pp. 87–95. New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Advantages of diary studies are numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Lallemand, C. (2012). [http://uxpamagazine.org/dear-diary-using-diaries-to-study-user-experience/ Dear Diary: Using Diaries to Study User Experience][http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/11-3/ UX Magazine 11.3, August 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;
They allow:

* collecting longitudinal and temporal information;
* reporting events and experiences in context and in-the-moment;
* participants to diary their behaviours, thoughts and feelings in-the-moment thereby minimising the potential for post rationalisation;
* determining the antecedents, correlations, and consequences of daily experiences and behaviors.

==Limitations==
Diary studies might generate inaccurate [[recall (memory)|recall]], especially if using the elicitation type of diary studies, because of the use of memory triggers (e.g. taking a photo and writing about it later). There is low control, low participation and there is a risk of disturbing the action. 
In feedback studies, there is also low control, and it can be troubling and disturbing to write everything down.&lt;ref&gt;Kuniavsky, Observing the User Experience, A Practitioner's Guide to User Research September 21, 2012, {{ISBN|0123848695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

==History==
[[Image:The Chinese Garden at Duke Gardens.jpg|thumb|The Chinese Garden, showing serenity bridge over koi stream]]
Duke Gardens were part of the {{convert|2700|acre|sing=on}} [[Duke Farms]] estate built by [[James Buchanan Duke]], founder of the [[American Tobacco Company]] and benefactor of [[Duke University]]. Duke Farms is located on [[U.S. Route 206]], {{convert|1.75|mi|km}} south of the [[Somerville Circle]], in [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey|Hillsborough Township]] in [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]], [[New Jersey]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4 |title=History |publisher=Duke Farms |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111134008/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=4 |archivedate=2008-01-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gardens were designed and installed by [[Doris Duke]] herself, therefore several alternative names are used: The Doris Duke Indoor Display Gardens at Duke Farms, Duke Farms Indoor Display Gardens, The Doris Duke International Display Gardens, The Duke Gardens Foundation. Officially, the Gardens were The Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc, a 501(c)(3) Private Operating Foundation established 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?finId=&amp;npoId=556323|title=Duke Gardens Foundation Inc| publisher=GuideStar|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Duke developed these exotic display gardens in honor of her beloved father [[James Buchanan Duke]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.njskylands.com/atdukgar.htm|title=The Gardens at Duke Farms| publisher=Skylands Visitor Guide|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/173295/Duke-University|title=Duke University| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by DuPont's [[Longwood Gardens]], each of the eleven Duke Display Gardens is a full-scale re-creation of a garden theme, country or period.

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 she donated {{convert|10|acre}} of her estate, including the greenhouses, to the Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc.[http://www.state.nj.us/travel/2003_releases/p2003-0502a.htm]

The Duke Farms website stated that "Doris Duke had long been personally involved in the construction, repair and remodeling of her properties, and she was directly involved in the physical design of the Indoor Display Gardens. Although she lacked specific botanical knowledge, she had a clear vision of the spaces and features she wanted to create. According to the New York Post, she designed all but one of the gardens, incorporating her interests in color, design and fragrance."[https://web.archive.org/web/20040722102235/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282] (Following the closure, this text is no longer present on the website [http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282]).

Doris Duke continued her involvement with her gardens throughout her life, bringing designers with her to modify them during the summer season when they were closed to tourists. In the 1970s she added extensive night-lighting, and introduced public tours of the gardens at night. A rediscovered image of the "stunning nightlighting of the French Gardens" [https://www.flickr.com/photos/femme_makita/2513492712/] was used as one centerpiece of social protest against the closure.

==Description of the gardens==
Duke Gardens formed four sides of a quadrangle, and took at least one hour to view. The entry fell on the side formed by a Conservatory designed by [[Horace Trumbauer]] and constructed 1909-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282 |title=New Greenhouse |publisher=Duke Farms |accessdate=2008-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622073346/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=282 |archivedate=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other three sides were formed by greenhouses in styles that are still manufactured. The greenhouse over the English Garden was installed in the 1990s.

Duke Gardens were visited in the following sequence:

* Central entry into an Italian courtyard - statues amid lush plantings in the Romantic style, including a replica of [[Antonio Canova]]'s sculpture [[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]].
* Colonial Garden - representing gardens of the South Atlantic United States, with [[camellia]]s, [[azalea]]s, [[magnolia]], and [[crepe myrtle]].
* Edwardian Garden (Fern and Orchid House) - [[fern]]s and [[orchid]]s
* French Parterre - flowers planted in a geometric [[parterre]][https://www.flickr.com/photos/femme_makita/2513492712/].
* English Gardens - five miniature gardens, including a [[topiary]]; a [[rock garden]] and herbaceous borders; an Elizabethan [[knot garden]] of the 16th and 17th centuries; and an 18th-century succulent garden.
* American Desert - [[cactus|cacti]] and [[succulent]]s, including [[barrel cactus]], giant [[aloe]], and crown of thorns, with [[Cereus repandus|desert apple]], [[aloe vera]], [[mother-in-law's tongue]], etc.
* Chinese Garden - [[koi]] stream and rock formations, with [[bamboo]], [[camphor laurel|camphor tree]]s, [[Papaveraceae|bleeding heart]], hybrid [[tulip]]s, and [[jasmine]].
* Japanese Garden - tea house with [[bonsai]] trees, red [[maple]]s, etc.
* Indo-Persian Garden - water course, fountains, and carved marble screens, with [[orange tree]]s, Mediterranean [[cyprus]], and a Persian [[rose]] garden.
* Tropical Garden - tropical trees and vines.
* Semi-Tropical Garden - [[papyrus]], fiddlehead [[fern]]s, Bird of Paradise, etc.

==Closure and removal of Duke Gardens==
[[Image:The French Garden at Duke Gardens.jpg|thumb|The French Garden on the day before closure. Contrast with the same garden in Miss Duke's lifetime [https://www.flickr.com/photos/femme_makita/2513492712/] to see effect of garden staff reductions.]]
In March 2008 Duke Farms announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Duke Farms Promotes "Greener" Future |publisher=Duke Farms |date=2008-03-02 |url=http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |format= |language= |accessdate=2008-04-14 |quote=it’s the final months of the gardens being on display in the greenhouses that have enchanted visitors since 1964 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328065214/http://www.dukefarms.org/page.asp?pageId=523 |archivedate=2008-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "an expansive and bold new vision for the {{convert|2740|acre|sing=on}} property, in which it will refocus its programs and operations to become an environmental showcase and learning center.

"The jewel-like gardens will remain open until May 25, after which they will be dismantled.  According to DDCF sources, the day of the display gardens is past. They consume an inordinate share of financial and staff resources, they would require a very expensive modernization, and they no longer reflect the vision of Duke Farm’s future.

&lt;/ref&gt; As for the plants there, [Executive Director Tim] Taylor said some may be used in the new gardens, though the concept will be different. "It will not be replicated in terms of the gardens of the nations. We'll put a different spin on them, and come up with a logical connecting story of native horticulture to exotic horticulture," he said. Leftover plants will be donated to other botanical and display gardens, Taylor said. "We're not destroying anything."

In April 2008, opposition to the closure and dismantling of the Display Gardens started to emerge. Open letters appeared in the local press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Elizabeth H. Berger Plaza''' is a public park formed in the triangular junction of [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Trinity Place]], [[Greenwich Street]] and Edgar Street. It faces the Manhattan approach to the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]]. Formerly known as the Edgar street Greenstreet, this park honors civic advocate Elizabeth H. Berger (1960-2013).&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap David W. “As Plaza Is Named for Champion of Downtown, Talk of a New Park” ''New York Times'' Dec. 18, 2013 https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/nyregion/while-renaming-a-plaza-talk-of-fusing-traffic-islands-to-make-a-park.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; In her role as president of the Downtown Alliance, she advocated for the fusion of two traffic triangles at this location into an expanded park. The park is located in a former neighborhood known as [[Little Syria, Manhattan|Little Syria]], a bustling immigrant community displaced by the construction of the tunnel in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Glassman, Carl “Two Plain Plazas to Be Turned into Single One of Beauty” Tribeca Trib Sept. 16, 2015 http://www.tribecatrib.com/content/two-plain-plazas-be-turned-single-one-beauty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plagianos, Irene "FiDi's Once-Vibrant Arab Neighborhood, Little Syria, Remembered in New Park" ''DNAinfo'' February 2, 2017 {{cite web |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170202/financial-district/little-syria-elizabeth-berger-financial-district |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207112838/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170202/financial-district/little-syria-elizabeth-berger-financial-district |archivedate=2017-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the north side of this park is Edgar Street, reputedly the shortest street in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Kevin "NEW YORK’S SHORTEST STREETS – three of ‘em" ''Forgotten-NY'' March 22, 2009 http://forgotten-ny.com/2009/03/nys-shortest-three-of-em/&lt;/ref&gt; Its gentle downward slope, also visible in the surrounding east/west streets, is the vestige of a ridge or bluff that ran parallel with the shoreline and crested at about Broadway, where Trinity Church is sited.  It was a narrow street in its early days, no more than eighteen feet wide, called ‘Tuyn Paat’ or ‘Garden Alley’ in the Dutch period (1624 -1664).  When the British took control of the colony in 1664, the street name was changed with characteristic indifference to Tin Pot Alley.&lt;ref&gt;Moscow, Henry, and Thomas Tracy. ''The Street Book: An Encyclopedia of Manhattan's Street Names and Their Origins''. New York: Fordham University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; 

The City acquired the street in 1795, at which time its current name was affixed.  Edgar likely refers to the family of William Edgar (1736-1820), a merchant from Detroit who came to New York circa 1780 and established a successful shipping business, with links to India and China.  For a time, the street served as a thoroughfare or driveway leading to the Edgar family household located nearby.  Until the western shoreline was filled in, this street ran to or very near the water’s edge.

The line of Greenwich Street was the approximate original coastline of Manhattan Island.  In 1787, the [[New York City Council|Common Council]], acted on a pre-war proposal to expand the shoreline sixty feet into the [[Hudson River]].  Then began the construction of Greenwich Street, which soon hosted a row of Federal-style townhouses. Washington Street followed in approximately 1808 and West Street by 1830. The drop in grade from Broadway to Greenwich Street abruptly evens out where the landfill begins. In October 2013, members of the Washington Street Historical Society, including Americans of [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese]] and [[Syrian Americans|Syrian]] descent, dedicated bench plaques inscribed with the names and quotes of individuals and groups that represent Arab-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Street Historical Society photo album of [[Arab Americans|Arab-American]] plaques dedication: https://www.flickr.com/photos/106467405@N05/page1&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar Street Plaza was renamed after Berger on December 16, 2013. With sculptural junipers along the benches, a small piazza surrounds a central planting area with oak leaf hydrangeas, viburnums and river birch trees, shielding park goers from traffic in an expanded green space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7348">'''George Eames Barstow''' (1849–1924), described as a "capitalist and irrigation pioneer," was a Texas land developer and a member of both the [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[Providence City Council|common council]] (four years) and the city's [[school board]] (fourteen years), as well as the [[Rhode Island House of Representatives|State Assembly]] from 1894 to 1896.&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt; He was known as "the father of irrigation in the [[Southwest United States|Southwest]]."&lt;ref name=LAT19090202&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/159320608/ "May Go Haying in Automobile," ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 2, 1909, page 14] ''Access to this link requires the use of a library card.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

Barstow began his business career at the age of seventeen and eventually "founded, financed or organized" five [[worsted]] and [[paper industry|paper mills]] in Rhode Island.&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

He then turned his attention to the [[Pecos River|Pecos Valley]] in Texas, where the Pioneer Canal Company was chartered on September 30, 1889, with Barstow as treasurer. He later served as president of a successor company, the Pecos Valley Land and Irrigation Company.&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

In 1891 Barstow and other land developers formed a project to promote a town on the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] in western [[Ward County, Texas]].  By 1895 the town had taken on  the name of [[Barstow, Texas|Barstow]], and Barstow himself moved there from New York City in 1904. He took part  in organizing other irrigation and drainage systems through [[Western United States|the West]].&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

==Volunteer work==

Barstow, a Republican, wrote pamphlets on varied subjects, including immigration, cooperatives, China-Japan relations and [[Culture of the United States|Americanism]].&lt;ref name=TexasObit/&gt;

===Irrigation and immigration===

In 1908–09 Barstow was the president of the [[National Irrigation Congress]], the leading organization interested in water projects in the West, and he was in charge of the annual convention in 1909 in Spokane, Washington. A ''Los Angeles Times'' reporter wrote about the impending congress that Barstow "has been a prime mover in inducing the federal government to build the systems that will make fertile over 3,000,000 acres of land which once was a desert." In an interview, Barstow predicted that isolated farmhouses would become "a thing of the past" and that farmers would commute from their homes to farms via fast horses or automobiles or interurban streetcars.&lt;ref name=LAT19090202/&gt;   He added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The government is laying out towns every five miles. . . . The farms will be small, ten to forty acres, and the farming intensive. Under these circumstances, the farmers will live in  towns of 1500 to 2000 people, enjoying all the benefits of urban life — schools, churches and social life. . . . A tide from the city to the country has already set in. Many college graduates have chosen farming on irrigated tracts for their life work.&lt;ref name=LAT19090202/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his opening speech at the Spokane congress, Barstow urged the government to find work for (overseas) immigrants "[[Western United States|out West]]," to provide them with transportation and to lend them money to establish homes.&lt;ref name=NYT19090814&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/08/14/101037924.pdf "Jobs for Immigrants," ''New York Times,'' August 14, 1909] ''Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He asked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shall I, who have always been broadly conservative, be regarded as preaching paternalism or as socialistic in my purpose when suggesting that the duty of the National  Government may be found in providing under proper safeguard a fund which may be used to make loans of suitable amount to enable this thrifty and frugal class of people to locate their homes . . . ?&lt;ref name=NYT19090814/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barstow was head of the [[National Immigration Commission]] in 1912, and he sent a message to the first convention of the [[American Immigration and Distribution League]] in New York City in April of that year "stating that 65 per cent. of the immigrants who came to the country were farm laborers, and that the United States Government ought to establish an Immigrant Land Loan Fund, which would advance small sums to immigrants who settled on Western lands."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/04/104894635.pdf "Would Send Aliens to Western Farms," ''New York Times,'' April 4, 1912] ''Access to this link requires a subscription to the newspaper or its website.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Godrej family''' is an [[India]]n [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]-speaking [[Zoroastrianism|Zororastrian]] [[Parsi people|Parsi]] family&lt;ref name="Kanwar2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamlendra Kanwar|page=22|quote=Though both are Gujarati speaking, the Godrej family is Zoroastrian (Parsi), a very westernized community, in stark contrast to the earthy Patels. The Godrej family is a part of Mumbai's glamour society|title=Icons of Gujarat industry: stories of rare grit &amp; enterprise|year=2000|publisher=Harmony Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; that manages and largely owns the [[Godrej Group]], a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] founded by [[ Ardeshir Godrej]] and his brother [[Pirojsha Burjorji Godrej]] in 1897, spanning sectors as diverse as real estate, consumer products, industrial engineering, appliances, furniture, security and agricultural products. Headed by [[Adi Godrej]] alongside his brother, [[Nadir Godrej]], and cousin, [[Jamshyd Godrej]], the family is one of the richest in India; with an estimated net worth of $11.6bn as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/family-godrej/|title=Godrej family|author=Erin Carlyle|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The family's presence in business began in [[Bombay]] in 1897, when [[Ardeshir Godrej]], after reading a newspaper article about rising citywide crime rates, began developing and selling locks, with the assistance of his brother Pirojsha.&lt;ref&gt;http://business.outlookindia.com/article_v3.aspx?artid=286346&lt;/ref&gt; Ardeshir Godrej died childless; Pirojsha Godrej's sons Burjor, [[Sohrab Pirojsha Godrej|Sohrab]], and [[Naval Godrej|Naval]] succeeded in the second generation. Today, grandsons Adi, Nadir, and Jamshyd manage the group. The initial venture, Godrej Brothers, has since diversified across sectors and evolved into multiple companies under the umbrella of the Godrej Group, including [[Godrej Industries]], [[Godrej Agrovet]], [[Godrej Consumer Products]], [[Godrej Properties]], [[Godrej Infotech]], and the holding company [[Godrej &amp; Boyce]].

==Estate in Mumbai==

Among the family's most valuable assets is a 3,500-acre estate in [[Vikhroli]], [[Mumbai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/adi-godrej/|title=Adi Godrej &amp; family|author=Erin Carlyle|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the value of which is estimated at $12 billion if developed; in 2011, the family announced plans to develop three million square feet by 2017, through an internal joint venture composed of [[Godrej Industries]] and [[Godrej Properties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessworld.in/news/business/corporate/the-33-billion-dream/315255/page-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213073837/http://www.businessworld.in/news/business/corporate/the-33-billion-dream/315255/page-1.html |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the family has preserved some 1,750 acres of mangrove swamps within the estate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/investigation/godrej-helps-preserve-mumbai-mangroves|title=Godrej helps preserve Mumbai mangroves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the 2012 inclusion of  Adi Godrej and Jamshyd Godrej in [[Forbes magazine]]'s list of the richest green billionaires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2012/04/20/the-richest-green-billionaires-2012/|title=Richest Green Billionaires 2012|author=Kerry A.

The '''Group of Thirty''', often abbreviated to '''G30''', is an international body of leading financiers and academics which aims to deepen understanding of economic and financial issues and to examine consequences of decisions made in the public and private sectors related to these issues.  Topical areas within the interest of the group include: the [[foreign exchange market]], international [[capital markets]], international [[financial institutions]], [[central bank]]s and their supervision of financial services and markets, and [[macroeconomic]] issues such as product and labor markets.

The group is noted for its advocacy of changes in global [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]].

==History==

The Group of Thirty was founded in 1978 by [[Geoffrey Bell]] at the initiative of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afponline.org/pub/res/news/ns_20050325_g30.html |title=G30 Members Discuss Critical Concerns For American Corporations|author=Karen Epper Hoffman|date=March 25, 2005|work=AFP Online |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205401/http://www.afponline.org/pub/res/news/ns_20050325_g30.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also provided initial funding for the body.  Its first chairman was [[Johannes Witteveen]], the former managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The G30's current Chairman is [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/G30%20November%2022%2011%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.pdf | title=G30 November 22 11 Press Release FINAL | publisher=Group of Thirty | format=PDF | accessdate=October 13, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113171606/http://www.group30.org/images/PDF/G30%20November%2022%2011%20Press%20Release%20FINAL.pdf | archivedate=January 13, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current Chairman of the Board of Trustees is [[Jacob Frenkel]], and [[Paul Volcker]] is Chairman Emeritus.

The Bellagio Group, formed by Austrian economist [[Fritz Machlup]], was the immediate predecessor to the Group of Thirty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n1/cj3n1-2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fritz Machlup: In Memoriam|author=[[Gottfried Haberler]]|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|work=[[Cato Journal]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316155055/https://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n1/cj3n1-2.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It first met in 1963, to investigate international currency problems, particularly the [[Bretton Woods Agreement#The U.S. balance of payments crisis (1958–68)|balance of payments crisis]] which America faced throughout the early 1960s.

In June 2011, the group  released a report that examines the most recent developments in the 2008 financial crisis, including the causes, the responses and the future outlook for the United States and other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://group30.org/publications/detail/151 | title=The 2008 Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath: Addressing the Next Debt Challenge | author=Russo, Thomas A. | author2=Katzel, Aaron J. | publisher=Group of Thirty | format=PDF | accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the European Ombudsman [[Emily O'Reilly]] requested that ECB President [[Mario Draghi]] resign from the group because his membership in the organization could be interpreted as undue influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date = January 17, 2018|title = UPDATE 1 - EU ombudsman urges ECB's Draghi to leave G30 club of financiers|first = Francesco|last = Canepa|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-banks-ethics/update-1-eu-ombudsman-urges-ecbs-draghi-to-leave-g30-club-of-financiers-idUSL8N1PC2HX|agency = Reuters|access-date = January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The group consists of thirty members and includes the heads of major private banks and central banks, as well as members from academia and international institutions. Current members of the group include current and former heads of the central banks of Argentina, Brazil, [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]], China, [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], and [[Switzerland]], as well as two chairmen of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], two presidents of the [[European Central Bank]], a chairman of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], two chairmen of the [[Bank for International Settlements]], two chief economists of the [[International Monetary Fund]], a chief economist of the [[World Bank]], and the former President of Mexico. It holds two full meetings each year and also organises seminars, symposia, and study groups. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]]

He would later be supervised by Colonel [[Ken Barnes (soldier)|Ken Barnes]], the father of English international footballer [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. Burrell described Barnes as "a great military leader". It was Barnes who charged Burrell with looking after the JDF football team after Burrell shown Barnes a local newspaper headline "Boy's Town drill soldiers". Burrell took the JDF team to Trinidad where he first met [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], who was impressed with Burrell and kept in touch, offering him an executive position at the [[Caribbean Football Union]].

[[File:Times Square Hotel Astor, New York 1909.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hotel Astor]]

'''Hotel Astor''' was a [[hotel]] located in the [[Times Square]] area of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], in operation from 1904 through 1967. The former site of the hotel, the block bounded by [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], Astor Plaza, [[44th Street (Manhattan)|West 44th Street]], and [[45th Street (Manhattan)|West 45th Street]], is now occupied by the high-rise 54-story office tower [[One Astor Plaza]].

== Construction ==

With its elaborately decorated public rooms and its roof garden, the Astor Hotel was perceived as the successor to the [[Astor family]]'s [[Waldorf–Astoria (1893–1929)|Waldorf-Astoria]] on [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]]. William C. Muschenheim and his brother, Frederick A. Muschenheim conceived plans for the grand hotel in 1900. The area was then known as [[Longacre Square]] and stood beyond the fringe of metropolitan life, the center of New York's carriage-building trade. The Muschenheim brothers became the proprietors for absentee landlord [[William Waldorf Astor]], from whom they leased the land. The hotel opened on September 9, 1904.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQqOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=hotel+astor+new+york+sheraton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wFPNO_FY4x&amp;sig=a9elJ7FEgeDXgSDc5K218NHENsA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hojtVPbwCsfqoASM64DACQ&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=hotel%20astor%20new%20york%20sheraton&amp;f=false|title=Routledge Guide to Broadway|author=Bloom, Ken|pages=14-15|publisher=Routledge|date=2007|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|35000|sqft|m2}} Hotel Astor was built in two stages, in 1905 and 1909–1910, by the same architects in the same style. Upon completion, the structure occupied an entire city block at a reported total cost of $7 million. Architects [[Clinton &amp; Russell]] had designed a number of Astor commissions; here they developed a very Parisian [[Beaux-Arts architecture|"Beaux Arts" style]] completed with green-copper [[mansard roof]]. Its eleven stories contained 1000 guest rooms, with two more levels underground for its extensive "backstage" functions, such as the wine cellar.

The Astor was an important element in the growth of Times Square and its character as an entertainment center. In 1904, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' publisher [[Adolph S. Ochs]] moved his newspaper's operations to a new tower on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] in the middle of Longacre Square, and Ochs persuaded Mayor [[George B. McClellan, Jr.]] to build a subway station there and rename it Times Square. The [[Theater District]] would soon occupy magnificent new auditoriums along Forty-second Street, and electric lighting transformed this strip of Broadway into the "Great White Way".

Hotel Astor's success triggered the construction of the nearby [[Knickerbocker Hotel (New York)|Knickerbocker Hotel]] by other members of the Astor family two years later, although that property became commercial office space within a few years. The Astor set the pattern for "a new species of popular hotels that soon clustered around Times Square, vast amusement palaces that catered to crowds with scenographic interiors that mirrored the theatricality of the [[Great White Way]]."&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite book| title=New York 1900| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icxPAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=hotel+astor| first1=Robert A.M.| last1=Stern| first2=Gregory| last2=Gilmartin| first3=John| last3=Massengale| date=15 January 1992| publisher=Rizzoli| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amenities ==

[[File:HotelAstorBallroom.jpg|left|250px|thumb|southern end of the Grand Ballroom, circa 1910]]

Within its restrained exterior, the Astor featured a long list of elaborately themed ballrooms and exotic restaurants: the Old New York lobby, the American Indian Grill Room decorated with artifacts collected with the help of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], a Flemish smoking room, a Pompeiian billiard room, the Hunt Room decorated in sixteenth century [[German Renaissance]] style, and many other features.&lt;ref name=Rider&gt;{{cite book| title=Rider's New York city and vicinity, including Newark, Yonkers and Jersey| editor-first=Fremont| editor-last=Rider| year=1916| page=171| url=https://archive.org/stream/ridersnewyorkci00hopkgoog/ridersnewyorkci00hopkgoog_djvu.txt| accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hotel Astor NY Ad 1922.jpg|thumb|right|1922 ad for the Hotel Astor]]

The Large Ballroom (or Banquet Hall), on the ninth floor, opened with a dinner that was part of the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]]. Measuring {{convert|50|x|85|ft|m}}, the Banquet Hall was decorated in the [[Rococo Revival|Rococo]] style of Louis XV and featured a high-groined arch ceiling in ivory white and old gold, supported by grouped [[caryatid]]s. A gallery spanned the south and west sides, affording a fine view of the room, which could accommodate 500 diners.

The smaller ballroom, seating 250, was decorated in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] Louis XVI manner and could be joined with the larger ballroom. Still another adjoining room, "The College Hall", could also open to the ballroom so that the combined rooms could seat up 1,100 persons. The Palm Garden, or "L'Orangerie", located in the rear of the first floor lobby, was intended to represent an Italian garden. Its ceiling, painted to represent a Mediterranean sky, was partly concealed by feigned vine-covered pergolas. Blue lighting, hanging lamps draped in vines, swaying fern baskets, and scenic pictures of the out-of-doors further enhanced the perception.

The rooftop garden, with bandstand and observatory, was one of a number constructed in the city between 1880 and [[Prohibition]], among them the American Theater on Eighth Avenue, the garden atop [[Stanford White]]'s 1890 [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]], and the Paradise Roof Garden opened by [[Oscar Hammerstein I]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; In later years, the noted landscape architect [[Takeo Shiota]] redesigned the roof's North Garden on a Japanese theme.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite book| title=The Japanese influence in America| first=Clay| last=Lancaster| date=May 1983| publisher=Abbeville Press| isbn=978-0896593428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artwork in the original lobby included four murals by [[William de Leftwich Dodge]] depicting ''Ancient and Modern New York'', and a statue of the ''Three Graces'' by sculptor [[Isidore Konti]], a likeness of the American model [[Audrey Munson]].

== Social history ==
[[File:Peace-society-dinner-hotel-astor-1909.png|right|thumb|300px|Peace Society dinner at the Hotel Astor, February 1909 with President Taft and Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] in lower right]]

As a popular meeting place and New York City landmark, the Astor had a place in [[popular culture]] for decades, from the extended [[double entendre]] song "She Had to Go and Lose It at the Astor", to its appearance in the 1945 film ''[[The Clock (1945 film)|The Clock]]'', which provides a good view of the wartime-era lobby (although reconstructed in Hollywood). Among many other musicians, the [[swing era]] bandleader [[Tommy Dorsey]] appeared regularly on the rooftop bandstand, and it was there that [[Frank Sinatra]] made early New York appearances with Dorsey's band from 1940 to 1942. Another regular, in the 1950's, was [[Carmen Cavallaro]] and his orchestra, advertised on the marquee under the banner "On the Astor Roof".

In 1947, stuntman [[John Ciampa]] scaled the exterior of the hotel as part of a publicity ploy for the Sunbrock Rodeo and Thrill Circus. A 1947 post card, Hotel Astor claimed "1000 rooms, 1000 baths" and as "The Crossroads of the World"&lt;ref name=Postcard&gt;{{cite web| title=Hotel Astor, Time Square| url=https://www.cardcow.com/131330/hotel-astor-times-square-new-york/| publisher=CardCow| accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1910s, the Astor Bar acquired a reputation as a [[gay]] meeting place.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book| title=Inventing Times Square: Commerce and Culture at the Crossroads of the World| url=https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Times-Square-Commerce-Crossroads/dp/0801853370/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415308571&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Inventing+Times+Square%3A+Commerce+and+Culture+at+the+Crossroads+of+the+World#reader_0801853370| page=xxiv| editor-first=William R.| editor-last=Taylor| publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press| date=22 April 1996| isbn=978-0801853371| accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the Astor Bar was one of three American hotel bars "world famous for their wartime ambience", alongside the [[Top of the Mark]] at the [[Mark Hopkins Hotel]] in San Francisco, and the men's bar at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore]].&lt;ref name=Berube&gt;{{cite book| title=Coming Out Under Fire| first=Allen| last=Berube| page=114| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-Lo5vA6lSYC&amp;q=biltmore+hotel#v=snippet&amp;q=biltmore%20hotel&amp;f=false| date=April 1990| publisher=Free Press| isbn=978-0029031001| accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the flamboyant late-night scenes at the [[automat]]s, gay patrons at the Astor Bar were welcomed, allotted an entire side of the oval bar, and expected to be discreet (by the standards of the time). Thus "the Astor maintained its public reputation as an eminently respectable Times Square rendezvous, while its reputation as a gay rendezvous and pickup bar assumed legendary proportions."&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The bar was further immortalized in [[Cole Porter]]'s song "[[Well, Did You Evah!]]", which includes the line, "Have you heard that Mimsie Starr / Just got pinched in the Astor Bar?"
The ribald tune "[[She Had to Go and Lose It at the Astor]]" explored a similar theme.

== Later years ==

[[File:HotelAstorRooftopGarden.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Rendering of the Astor's rooftop garden]]

The hotel was completely renovated in 1935, and again in 1949.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; It was sold to real estate entrepreneur [[William Zeckendorf]] on September 1, 1954. However he sold it again just two weeks later, on September 15, 1954, to [[Sheraton Hotels]], who renamed it the '''Sheraton-Astor'''. Zeckendorf repurchased the hotel in December 1957, regaining control of it in March 1958 and returning it to its original name.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; During this period, the hotel was managed by Prince [[Serge Obolensky]].&lt;ref name=Hellman&gt;{{cite journal| title=Astor's Obolensky| first=Geoffrey T.| last=Hellman| work=[[The New Yorker]]| date=25 October 1958| page=36| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1958/10/25/astors-obolensky| subscription=yes| accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an indirect result of Zeckendorf's 1965 bankruptcy, the Astor was sold for $10.5 million in 1966.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; It closed and was demolished in 1967 by Sam Minskoff &amp; Sons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TxdQGX7pDsEC&amp;pg=PA353&amp;lpg=PA353&amp;dq=minskoff+building&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_T5KQvhBM-&amp;sig=LOc9_dhC-Haegj2dRzByvcl1kSw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I45mVbafIYmisAXCzoGAAg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=minskoff%20building&amp;f=false ''Broadway: An Encyclopedia'' by Ken Bloom] November 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now occupied by a 54-story skyscraper designed by [[Der Scutt]] of [[Ely Jacques Kahn|Ely J. Kahn &amp; Jacobs]] and completed in 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7457">'''Industry classification''' or '''industry taxonomy''' is a type of [[economic taxonomy]] that organizes companies into industrial groupings based on similar production processes, similar products, or similar behavior in financial markets.

Many are used by [[national statistical agencies|national and international statistical agencies]] to summarize economic conditions. They are also used by [[securities analyst]]s to understand common forces acting on groups of companies, to compare companies' performance to their peers', and to construct either specialized or diversified portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;MSCI Barra, "Frequently Asked Questions about GICS" [https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/5973a128-47f0-4317-b083-716a10207b50]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sectors and industries ==
Industries can be classified in a variety of ways. At the top level, industry is often classified according to the [[three-sector theory]] into [[economic sector|sectors]]: [[primary sector of the economy|primary]] (extractive), [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary]] (manufacturing), and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary]] (services). Some authors add [[quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary]] (knowledge) or even [[quinary sector of the economy|quinary]] (culture and research) sectors. Over time, the fraction of a society's industry within each sector changes.

Below the economic sectors are more detailed classifications. They commonly divide industries according to similar functions and markets and identify businesses producing related products.

Industries can also be identified by product, such as: [[Construction|construction industry]], [[chemical industry]], [[petroleum industry]], [[automotive industry]], [[consumer electronics|electronic industry]], [[power engineering]] and [[Electricity generation|power manufacturing]] (such as gas or wind turbines), [[meatpacking industry]], [[hospitality industry]], [[food industry]], [[fish industry]], [[software industry]], [[paper industry]], [[entertainment industry]], [[semiconductor industry]], [[cultural industry]], and [[poverty industry]].

[[Market (economics)|Market]]-based classification systems such as the [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]] are used in [[finance]] and [[market research]].

== List of classifications ==

A wide variety of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] is in use, sponsored by different organizations and based on different criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Standard &amp; Poor's, "What's an Industry" [http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/products/GCC3Q2004.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Edward Patrick "Jack" Gallagher''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (16 July 1916 – 16 December 1998) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] oilman who from 1950 to 1983 was the head of [[Dome Petroleum]]. Gallagher is best remembered for leading extensive explorations in the [[Beaufort Sea]] in the late 1970s.

==Biography==

=== Early years and university ===

Jack Gallagher was born in [[Winnipeg]] on 16 July 1916. In 1933 he graduated from [[St. John's High School (Winnipeg)|St. John's High School]]. In the fall of 1933 Gallagher entered the [[University of Manitoba]], studying engineering. Fearful about his prospects of getting a job in construction during the [[Great Depression]], he later transferred to studying geology. During the summer of 1936, Gallagher worked for the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] in northern Manitoba. This first encounter with the north would inspire his return there later in his career.

=== Career beginnings ===

Upon graduating in 1937, Gallagher hitched a ride to [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] and got a job selling [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] tractors. After a year, Gallagher moved to California where he got a job as a scout with the [[Shell Oil Company]]. Despite not having experience in oil and gas, the company was interested in his field experience in the North. In January 1939 Shell sent Gallagher to [[Egypt]]. When the [[World War II|Second World War]] began in September of that year, Shell ceased its Egyptian operations and moved to the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Instead of transferring to the new location, Gallagher left Shell and began to work for the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company of New Jersey]], who remained in the region. At one point, Gallagher worked for the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] searching for water wells. During his time in the east Gallagher also lectured on geology at the [[Cairo University]].

In the early 1940s Standard transferred Gallagher to [[South America]], where he spent time in [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and [[Panama]]. His South American stay led to many interesting experiences, including being granted a meeting with president [[Jorge Ubico]] to ask permission to search for oil in the north of the country. On another occasion, while in the passenger seat of a truck on a trip through the [[Andes]], Gallagher's driver fainted from the altitude. Gallagher managed to steer the truck into a rock wall, preventing it from going off the cliff. Suffering from back pain, it was ten days before he was able to see a doctor, who concluded he was only experiencing muscle spasms. A year later in [[New York City]], an X-Ray revealed three fractured vertebrae. Gallagher would have back pain the rest of his life. The pressure from giving a hand shake would often cause him pain, and to help the problem he would often use a two-hand clasp when meeting people.

In 1948 Standard sent Gallagher to [[Harvard University]] for a year to study management. Upon finishing at Harvard, Standard informed Gallagher that they wanted him to work as their head geologist in the [[Far East]]. Wanting to return to Canada, Gallagher instead took a job with Standard's Canadian subsidiary, [[Imperial Oil]], in Calgary.

=== Dome Petroleum ===

In 1950 Gallagher was approached by Jim McCrea of [[Placer Dome|Dome Mines]], an [[Toronto]] company that had been in existence since 1910. Wanting to expand their operations to include oil, the company formed Dome Exploration (Western), wanting Gallagher to head the new operation. Throughout the 1950s Dome remained a relatively small company. Gallagher worked primarily on his own and had an office in the Alberta Block at 805 1st Street South West with his secretary Ethel Cairns. In 1951 Dome became public, selling a half-million shares, and in 1958 it changed its name to Dome Petroleum and moved into the new Dome Building at 706 8th Avenue South West. Having become fascinated with the Canadian North during the summer of 1936, Gallagher remained interested in the potential for northern oil and gas exploration. In 1959 Gallagher first filed for land position in the north, and in September 1961 Dome became the first company to drill in the Canadian Arctic. In 1974 Gallagher was contacted by then Minister of Northern Affairs, [[Jean Chrétien]], to ask if Dome would be interested in exploration in the Beaufort Sea. Dome's first season of exploration in the Beaufort was in 1976. By the early 1980s, Dome had built a fleet of around 40 vessels. Although Dome invested a great deal of money in Arctic exploration, it never made a major discovery.

By the early 1980s Gallagher, although still Chief Executive, had relinquished some power to younger members of the company. In May 1981 Dome set out to acquire the [[Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company]], which at the time was controlled by the American company [[Conoco]]. Gallagher had opposed this move, although he ultimately allowed it to take place. That June, Dome took a U.S.$1.68 billion loan from the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]], [[Royal Bank of Canada]], [[Bank of Montreal]], and the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]]. In the fall Toronto-Dominion requested that part of the loan be repaid, at which time it was revealed that Dome did not have the money. This revelation threw the Canadian banking system into a state of chaos for the next year before a rescue package for Dome was developed in the fall of 1982. On 8 April 1983, Gallagher stepped down as the head of Dome. In his 33 years of running the company, he had turned a one-man operation into the third-largest private company in Canada, at the time.

=== Personal life ===

Gallagher was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1983. After leaving Dome, he dedicated his time largely to political causes, helping to found the [[Reform Party of Canada]]. Gallagher was known for his affable personality and famous smile, being given the nickname "Smilin' Jack." In August 1949 he married Kathleen Stewart, who was originally from [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. They, along with their three sons, lived in a house located at 4315 Britannia Drive in Calgary's mid-century [[Britannia, Calgary|Britannia]] neighbourhood. The house remains largely original today and has been featured in local architectural tours. Gallagher's personal papers are held at the [[Glenbow Museum]] as the ''[http://www.glenbow.org/collections/search/findingAids/archhtm/gallagher.cfm Jack Gallagher fonds]''.

'''James (Jim) Champy''' (born 1942) is an American business consultant, and organizational theorist, known for his work in the field of [[business process reengineering]], business process improvement and organizational change.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Life and work ==
Champy earned his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in 1963 and his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in civil engineering in 1965 from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Boston College Law School]] in 1968.

Champy was chairman and chief executive officer of CSC Index, the management consulting arm of [[Computer Sciences Corporation]]. He had been one of the original founders of Index, a $200 million consulting practice that was acquired by CSC in 1988. Subsequently he was chairman of Dell Perot Systems’ (now Dell Services) consulting practice, where he was responsible for providing direction and guidance to the company’s team of business and management consultants.

Nowadays Champy consults with senior-level executives of multinational companies seeking to improve business performance. His approach centers on helping leaders achieve business results through four distinct, yet overlapping areas: business strategy, management and operations, organizational development and change, and information technology.

He is currently a senior research fellow at [[Harvard University Advanced Leadership Initiative|Harvard's Advanced Leadership Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Champy|title=List of Fellows|url=http://advancedleadership.harvard.edu/2013-fellows/|publisher=Harvard University - Advanced Leadership Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a life member of the [[MIT]] Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Board of Trustees, and serves on the Board of Overseers of the [[Boston College Law School]].

'''Listing and approval use and compliance''' is the activity of adhering to specific testing requirements designed to establish minimum performance for the installation or use of safety-related products and materials in conformance with an ''active'' [[certification listing]] or ''approval'' that has been issued by an organization that is accredited both for testing and [[product certification]], such as those issued by [[Underwriters Laboratories]], [[NTA Inc]], [[FM Global]], American Nuclear Insurers, or the [[Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik]] (DIBt). In concept, if a product, such as a [[fire door]], [[fire extinguisher]], or [[toaster]], is used in the intended manner, the component or system will perform as described in the listing and/or ''approval''. The listing or test is often cited by a regulation, such as a [[building code]] or a fire code, and becomes enforcable through adopted codes or regulations. This concept is known as ''bounding'' in the nuclear industry. Products whose use is not mandated by any [[building code]]s or fire codes often lack a consensus test method. Unless there is a test standard in existence to prove the functionality and reliability of such a product, there can be no certification listing.  Many authorities are charged to review and approve results from qualified testing agencies, when for the purpose intended, the evidence shows compliance for a material, product or construction method that provides equivalent strength, quality, fire resistance, durability and safety when evaluated through general engineering practices.

== Governmental accreditation of laboratories ==
National, governmental accreditors, such as [[Germany]]'s [[Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik]] or [[Canada]]'s [http://www.scc.ca/ SCC (Standards Council of Canada)] can "accredit" laboratories, meaning that such laboratories must conform to national standards and rules of conduct in the discharge of their duties. Compliance is routinely tested by the accreditor through inspections, where random client files are audited to see that the laboratory followed all appropriate procedures. Accreditors can accredit laboratories for testing, as well as for [[product certification]]. In product certification regimes, the laboratory or the accreditor (as in the case of Germany) become involved in witnessing the production of test materials, get copies of process standards, including chemical formulas and all details necessary to manufacture a product. Once the test product is made, it is shipped "under seal" to the laboratory for incorporation in the test. Certification listings or approvals that follow a successful test are subject to the maintenance of continuous factory auditing to make sure that what was tested is identical to that which was made, or documented proof that the products made continue to meet quality control standards set out as a function of the approvals process.

== Testing by laboratories without national accreditation ==
Testing by organizations or laboratories who hold no national accreditation for testing purposes are not subject to mandatory governmental audits of compliance with applicable requirements. Even an organisation that is nationally accredited for testing purposes may not necessarily issue test reports that provide assurance that commercial products tested by it are the same as what is being sold or used by the public.

Safety related products undergo product certification to enable their use by the public. The value of testing by organizations without accreditation for product certification is based on [[faith]] in the organisation or its [[ethics]], or [[culpability]]. In countries in which a national authority is a present (e.g., the United States), the listings provided by large well established third-party testing and certification companies are accepted as the societal standard. In such cases, the link to the building code is through regional standards, such as the Uniform Building Code, or the Standard Building Code.

Manufacturers of products routinely test their own products and competitors' products for their own purposes, as it makes good fiscal sense to test in one's own lab before incurring the costs of a third party facility.

== Testing for the purpose of achieving product certification ==
Product certification involves testing a product to a test standard that is accepted in the region in which the product will be sold. For instance, in the case of a [[firestop]], [http://www.ulc.ca/ Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada] ULC-S115 is the test method that must be used by a laboratory whose tests are to be accepted in [[Canada]]. ULC is nationally accredited in Canada to write standards, test products and to certify products.

Because Canada uses the accreditation model of a national accrediting authority, if an organisation [[Fire test|tests a firestop]] in or for use in Canada, in accordance with the correct standard (ULC-S115), but is not accredited by the [http://www.scc.ca/ SCC], the test results cannot be used to in any approvals of field installations on Canadian construction sites. If, on the other hand, the test laboratory is also accredited for product certification, then before the test takes place, a follow-up or certification agreement is anticipated between the certifier and the submitter of the test who desires a rating or a listing. An [[inspector]] from the certifying organisation witnesses the manufacture of the product or products to be tested, and checks the manufacturing procedures against the process standard that is in place and by then on file with the certifying organisation. The process standard includes all information necessary to manufacture the product or products, including equipment descriptions, tolerances, chemical formulas and purchasing specifications for ingredients or components. The manufactured goods are sealed by the inspector and then shipped to the laboratory, where the contents are used to build the test specimen in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

Cheating in testing may include substitution of materials and components by the manufacturer, or additional measures to assure the product passes the test.

==Documentation==
After testing, the testing laboratory issues a test report to the manufacturer, who is not obliged to share it with anyone.

If the product passes the testing required for certification, the items in the test that passed are given a certification listing, which describes the product(s) that were tested, the application, and maximum and minimum tolerances for all components. Certification listings are short versions and interpretations of the test results.

A certification listing indicates that the test has been properly conducted, the tested systems passed, and that a follow-up agreement is in effect between the manufacturer or submitter and the certifier. This means that in addition to the original inspection where the test materials were produced, the certifier makes inspections of the manufacturing facility to ensure that what is being manufactured and sold is still the same as what was originally tested.

In the event that irregularities are discovered on the part of the manufacturer - substitutions of cheaper ingredients or components, deliberate irregularities, or an ingredient or component of a tested system which is no longer be available has been substituted - the listing can be de-activated and the manufacturer asked to remove all logos of the certifier from product literature, promotional materials, packaging, etc.

== Confidentiality ==
Organisations accredited for testing and certification of safety-related items typically operate in large facilities where many test submitters work to build test specimens and then go to test. Confidentiality is of importance to most submitters as well as the laboratories. Some manufacturers are extremely reluctant to share their proprietary process standards with any third parties.

In Germany's system, formulas and process standards are shared with the governmental accreditor: DIBt [http://www.dibt.de/]. DIBt uses the laboratories to audit the factories, but the audits are restricted to quality control tests of the finished products - not their chemical compositions or exact process standards. In North America, manufacturers are obliged to share their process standards with the laboratories, as there is no national accreditor that issues "approvals". This has resulted in the use of "fingerprinting" procedures, where manufacturers will permit their laboratory inspectors to conduct [[infrared spectroanalysis]] and other QC tests, in place of the process standards.

North American laboratories are usually private sector companies, though some of them are non-profit organisations, such as [[Underwriters Laboratories]]. There have been migrations of private sector laboratory engineers to manufacturers. Concerns over the sharing of confidential proprietary information are mitigated through confidentiality agreements.

==Structural fire protection==
Fire protection products used in the construction of buildings, ships and offshore facilities are required to conform with the certification listings or approvals. The field installation will comply with code requirements if it is configured within the maximum and minimum tolerances in the listings and approvals. For example, if a [[drywall]] assembly has a listing of a 2 hour [[fire-resistance rating]], and all the provisions of the listing were kept in the field, including materials, spacing, workmanship, etc., the 2 hour wall required by the building's designer is likely to withstand a 2 hour fire.

A case of the lack of mandatory bounding in US and Canadian [[nuclear power plant]] [[construction]] was the Thermo-Lag scandal, which was exposed by [[whistleblower]] [[Gerald W. Brown]]. The disclosure of the inadequacy of [[fire test]]ing employed in the [[circuit integrity]] product led to widespread and costly remedial work for licensees of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9277">'''Mahmood Karzai''', also spelled '''Mahmud Karzai''', or '''Mahmoud Karzai''', is an Afghan businessman, CEO and Chairman of the Board for the [[Afghan Investment Company]] who is closely tied to the [[Kabul Bank]] scandal and other controversies.&lt;ref&gt;British Broadcasting Service, BBC, (28 November 2012) "Kabul Bank fraud profited elite, leaked audit says: Afghanistan's failed Kabul Bank was involved in a fraud that funnelled almost US$900m into the pockets of a small number of the political elite, an independent auditors' report says. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-20512713"&lt;/ref&gt; He is the brother of [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]] a figure who was killed by his bodyguard in Afghanistan following various allegations surrounding narcotics, nepotism, corruption and family infighting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afghan-bios.info/index.php?option=com_afghanbios&amp;id=39&amp;task=view&amp;total=2577&amp;start=44&amp;Itemid=2, Whose who in Afghanistan, 2011-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the elder brother of the former president of [[Afghanistan]], [[Hamid Karzai]].

In October 2010, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Karzai could soon be indicted for tax evasion in the U.S., by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] though he is aware of the investigation, telling the newspaper: "I'm giving any charges", and insisting his only interest is "rebuilding Afghanistan." To date, no charges have been brought against Karzai.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJma5WN_riCwDv-7SbQTEOx6AHsA?docId=CNG.f3c56da45464a41c1cd517b13c5de4ac.2a1|title=Afghan government orders all private banks to be audited

In 2011, investigative reporters reported that Karzai was under review by a U.S. grand jury for alleged racketeering, extortion and tax evasion. He reportedly hired a Washington, D.C.-based criminal defense attorney as a result of the grand jury investigation.&lt;ref&gt;"Belluz, Julia, MacCleans (7 March 2011), (Canada) "Mahmoud Karzai being investigated for racketeering, extortion and tax evasion." http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/03/07/band-of-brothers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, (16 February 2011) "Grand Jury Investigates Karzai Brother

In 2013, Karzai, who has resided in Afghanistan since 2002, renounced his American citizenship to assume a bigger role in Afghan politics. The move was perceived as Mahmood expressing interest in running in the 2014 Presidential Election.

Mahmud Karzai is closely connected to the Kabul Bank scandal and former U.S. Congressman [[Donald L. Ritter]], a conservative, Jewish-American, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Pennsylvania]], widely criticized and scrutinized for supporting big business interests allegedly involved with serious environmental degradation, [[toxic waste]], [[pollution]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt; Kistner, Toni, Network World News, (8 July 2002) "Of mysteries and bargaining chips..." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-89008530.html &lt;/ref&gt;  Ritter and Mahumud Karzai, closely associated on various controversial efforts and ventures, have been criticized by many policy experts, including investigative reporter [[Sibel Edmonds]], ''The Boiling Frogs Post'' newspaper, and other national security experts and whistle blowers, including the [[National Security Whistleblowers Coalition]] (NSWBC), for various alleged scandals and controversies.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Sibel, The Boiling Frogs Post "The Assassination of Afghan Kingpin Karzai: A Case of Langley Liabilities Exceeding Its Asset?" http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/tag/ahmed-wali-karzai/#sthash.JcQeNqQF.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahmud Karzai is also the brother of the controversial and assassinated figure [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]] who was allegedly killed by one of his bodyguards.

Democratic and Republican members of the U.S. Congress, who have supported U.S. efforts to assist Afghanistan, including [[Dana Rohrabacher]], have raised serious concerns and issues about Mahood Karzai's role in Afghanistan with Hamid Karzai and others.

== Business activities ==

=== Kabul Bank ===

Mahmood Karzai is a shareholder in [[Kabul Bank]], owning 20,548 shares, which represents 7.41% of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kabulbank.af/html/Financials.html{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Washington Post'' and other investigative newspapers reported about the Kabul Bank scandal and Mahmood Karzai's role including the freezing of the Bank's assets in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Andrew, Washington Post (5 September 2010) "Officials freeze assets of Kabul Bank shareholders, excepting Karzai's brother" https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/05/AR2010090501144.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the September 2010 [[Bank run|run on the bank]] Mahmood Karzai reportedly told the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' that "America should do something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2010/09/03/karzais_brother_calls_on_us_to_help_avert_afghan_bank_run/ | work=The Boston Globe | first1=Andrew | last1=Higgins | first2=Ernesto | last2=Londono | title=Karzai's brother calls on US to help avert Afghan bank run | date=2010-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toyota dealership ===

Karzai previously owned the only [[Toyota]] dealership in Afghanistan, [[Afghan Auto]] Limited.

=== AFCO International and Aynomena ===

Mahmood Karzai is a partner in Afco International company, the developer of Aynomena in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

=== Cement factory and coal mine scandal ===

Karzai allegedly owned, or leased, the only cement factory in Afghanistan, the Ghori Cement Factory, which investigative news reporters have found to have a host of troubling issues involving alleged corruption, cronyism, insider dealings involving the Kabul Bank scandal, unsafe working conditions and very low wages ($3 per day in 2010).&lt;ref name="mcclatchydc.com"&gt;Landay, Jonathan, McClatchy News (14 November 2010), "Factory, coal mine show connections matter most in Afghan business" {{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/11/14/v-print/103393/afghan-business-model-connections.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928102729/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/11/14/v-print/103393/afghan-business-model-connections.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/5991447/Karzai-familys-wealth-fuelling-insurgency.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ben | last=Farmer | title=Karzai family's wealth 'fuelling insurgency' | date=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704103904575337240377163242 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Mahmood Karzai Isn't the Problem | date=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent news reporters have raised serious questions about the link between Mahood Karzai and his elder brother, President Hamid Karzai, especially as they relate to the cement factory scandal and alleged questionable ties between Karzai family, and public, finances.&lt;ref&gt;Spillius, Alex, &amp; Farmer, Ben, The Telegraph, (7 August 2009)"Karzai Inc: Has Afghanistan's leader turned the country into a family business? https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/5990457/Karzai-Inc-Has-Afghanistans-leader-turned-the-country-into-a-family-business.html&lt;/ref&gt;


Reports about Mahmood Karzai, his brother Ahmed Wali Karzai, and increased reports of problems with [[corruption in Afghanistan]] surrounding President Hamid Karzai's government persist.

=== Realty &amp; real estate companies ===

Karzai owns numerous American companies under the name "Helmand", and finances realty companies from Massachusetts to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;http://companies.findthecompany.com/l/22460998/Helmand-Investment-Llc-in-Fairfax-Station-VA&lt;/ref&gt;

An alleged bitter Karzai family business dispute between Mahmoud Karzai and his brother, Shah Wali Karzai, reportedly centered around a large property and housing complex project in [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan.

'''Media Park''' ({{IPA-nl|meːdiə pɑrk}}) is a large [[business park]] in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Hilversum]]. This site is home to a number of Dutch broadcasters and media companies, and is the headquarters of the national public broadcasting system [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|NPO]].

==Notable events==

On 6 May 2002, right-wing politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] was [[assassination of Pim Fortuyn|assassinated]] after a radio interview with [[Ruud de Wild]] at [[3FM]]. 

On 29 January 2015, a 19-year-old man invaded the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] building, carrying a fake pistol and taking a hostage; he claimed to be part of a hackers' collective, and demanded ten minutes of airtime on the 8pm edition of [[NOS Journaal]]; however, he was swiftly overpowered by police and arrested. As a result of this, the building was evacuated, and no 8pm news was broadcast that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31051114|title=Man with fake gun disrupts Dutch broadcaster NOS|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=21 January 2018|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news and sports broadcaster [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] is also located on the site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://over.nos.nl/contact/adres-en-route|title=Over de NOS - Adres &amp;amp; route|publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not technically a broadcasting association (cf. [[television in the Netherlands]]). Other broadcasting associations are located elsewhere in the city of [[Hilversum]]: [[TROS]] for example is located just south of Media Park on the Lage Naarderweg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tros.nl/overdetros/contact/|title=Contact - Over de TROS|publisher=TROS|language=Dutch|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-public broadcasters such as [[RTL Nederland|RTL]] and the production companies [[Endemol]] and [[NEP The Netherlands]] also have studios and offices located on the Media Park site. The [[Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision]] is also situated on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/contact|title=Contact &amp;#124; Beeld en Geluid|publisher=Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid|language=Dutch|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:Traverse Hilversum Noord - Media Park.jpg|thumb|right|Footbridge between the site and [[Hilversum Noord railway station]]]]
Media Park is served well by public transport and by the Dutch road network. The southern corner of the site is close to the [[Ring Hilversum|Hilversum ring road]], and the regional [[N524 road]] runs along the east side of the site, connecting it with the nearby towns of [[Naarden]] and [[Bussum]], and southeast [[Amsterdam]] via the [[N236 road|N236]].

[[Hilversum Noord railway station]] is served by local Sprinter services between [[Hilversum railway station|Hilversum]], Amsterdam and [[Schiphol railway station|Schiphol]]. A [[footbridge]] was constructed across the N524 (''Mies Bouwmanboulevard'') in 2011, directly linking the station and buildings on the Media Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hilversumbeterbereikbaar.nl/index.php?page=1-4-2&amp;id=424|title=Kijkbuis feestelijk geopend|date=2011-09-15|publisher=Gemeente Hilversum|work=Hilversum Beter Bereikbaar|language=Dutch|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local and regional buses run through the Media Park site and [[bus stop]]s are situated outside important offices such as those of the NOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/697977189|title=Node: Mediapark Zuid (697977189)|work=[[OpenStreetMap]]|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moore Capital Management''' LLC is an American [[hedge fund]] sponsor-owned by its employees. It was founded in 1989 by American billionaire [[Louis Bacon|Louis Moore Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-26/winton-replaces-moore-among-top-20-hedge-funds-as-managed-futures-advance.html] Bloomberg, Winton Replaces Moore Among Top 20 Hedge Funds as Managed Futures Advance, Retrieved July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, MCM's largest funds were the $7.4 billion Moore Global Investment Fund, and the $4.6 billion Moore Macro Managers Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-26/winton-replaces-moore-among-top-20-hedge-funds-as-managed-futures-advance.html] Bloomberg, Winton Replaces Moore Among Top 20 Hedge Funds as Managed Futures Advance, Retrieved July 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
MCM was founded and headquartered in [[New York, New York]]. MCM has 429 employees worldwide with satellite offices in New York, [[London]], [[Zurich]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. MCM maintains six offshore funds and domestic equivalents of its largest funds. As of the end 2010, its fund's values were valued at: Moore Global Investments and Remington combined; $8.2 billion, Moore Macro Managers; $4.3 billion; Moore Emerging Markets; $1.5 billion. The remaining three funds each in possession of between $81 million and $324 million.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"&gt;[http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/2855575/Louis-Bacon-Macro-maestro.html?ArticleId=2855575&amp;single=true#/.Vzx8WZMrKRs] Institutional Investor, Louis Bacon: Macro maestro, Retrieved May 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

MCM is characterized as a [[global macro]] investor, utilizing macroeconomic themes, cash, futures and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] in its [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]]. Bacon, its founder, participates in most of the global markets, basing his moves on his evaluation of the future trends of [[inflation]], economic growth, [[central bank]] policy and national politics. He then determines what themes and investments to play based on data from his strategists and researchers.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;

==History==
Moore Capital Management MCM was founded by Bacon  in 1989, who launched Moore Global Investments in 1990 using the  $25,000 he inherited from his mother and named the company using his middle name.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;

MCM's first investor was [[Antoine Bernheim]], president of [[Dome Capital Management]], who in 1990 accounted for $1.5 million of MCM's initial $1.8 million in assets and redeemed his investment in 2009.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;

MCM launched the Moore Macro Managers Fund in 1993 and is led by 14 manager teams. From 1993 until 2009, the Macro Managers fund held the name, Moore Global Fixed Income Fund. Until 2002, Bacon himself was very much involved in the management of the fund but later it became a macro fund and the name was revised accordingly. Between 2002 through 2005, its assets under management grew to $4 billion from $1.8 billion.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt; The fund has not had any down years and has compounded at 15 percent annually through 2010.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt; The firm might cap the fund soon, when it reaches $4.5 billion to $5 billion.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;

In 2008, MCM let nervous investors redeem $5 billion in shares despite decent performance.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;

In 2009 MCM launched two new funds; Moore Emerging Equity Long/Short Fund and Moore Emerging Fixed Income and Currency Fund. The company also offered incentives for new investors in other funds.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;
 
In 2010, British regulators entered MCM's London offices and arrested trader Julian Rifat, for allegedly participating in illegal insider trading in concert with other traders. Rifat was put on leave during the investigation.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/23/moore-capital-bacon-business-wall-street-hedge-funds.html | work=Forbes | first=Liz | last=Moyer | title=Insider Case Snares Moore Capital | date=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-business/article-23844029-city-spy-guardian-directors-get-30-percent-salary-hike.do|title=section - Bacon starts to feel the heat|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=June 14, 2010|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April of that year, MCM paid $25 million to settle the charges brought against it by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]](CFTC) which accused MCM of manipulating settlement prices for Nymex platinum and palladium futures contracts. Charges were also filed by the CFTC, against MCM for failure to "diligently supervise" MCM's commodity interest transactions. The case was settled without much reaction from MCM's investors. According to MCM, the individual responsible for the CFTC infraction left the company in 2008 and members of current management had not been accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;

In September 2010, the firm had $4,118 million in US equity [[assets under management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedgetracker.com/fund/Moore-Capital-Management |title=Moore Capital Management - Investor Profile|publisher=Hedgetracker.com|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nigerian Civil Service''' consists of employees in [[Nigeria]]n government agencies other than the military and police. 
Most employees are career civil servants in the Nigerian ministries, progressing based on qualifications and seniority. Recently the head of the service has been introducing measures to make the ministries more efficient and responsive to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

The word civil is derived from an old french word "civil" which means "relating to law" and directly from Latin word "civilis" which means "relating to citizen". while the word service is derived from an old french word "servise" which means "aids".
The Nigerian Civil Service has its origins in organizations established by the [[British people|British]] in colonial times.
Nigeria gained full independence in October 1960 under a constitution that provided for a parliamentary government and a substantial measure of self-government for the country's three regions.
Since then, various panels have studied and made recommendations for reforming of the Civil Service, including the Margan Commission of 1963, the Adebo Commission of 1971 and the Udoji Commission of 1972-74.
A major change occurred with the adoption in 1979 of a constitution modeled on that of the [[United States]].  
The Dotun Philips Panel of 1985 attempted to reform to the Civil Service. The 1988 Civil Service Reorganization Decree promulgated by General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] had a major impact on the structure and efficiency of the Civil Service.
The later report of the Ayida Panel made recommendations to reverse some of the past innovations and to return to the more efficient Civil Service of earlier years.&lt;ref name=backg&gt;{{cite web

 |title=BACKGROUND TO THE NIGERIAN CIVIL SERVICE

 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Civil Service has been undergoing gradual and systematic reforms and restructuring since May 29, 1999 after decades of military rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the civil service is still considered stagnant and inefficient, and the attempts made in the past by panels have had little effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 the Head of the Civil Service, [[Stephen Osagiede Oronsaye]], proposed reforms where permanent secretaries and directors  would spend a maximum of eight years in office. The reform, approved by President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], would result in massive retirement of Permanent Secretaries and Directors, many of whom are from the North.&lt;ref name=orons&gt;{{cite web

==Organization==

The civil service is mainly organized around the federal ministries, headed by a minister appointed by the [[President of Nigeria]], who must include at least one member of each of the 36 states in his cabinet. The President's appointments are confirmed by the [[Senate of Nigeria]]. There are less than 36 ministries. In some cases a Federal minister is responsible for more than one ministry(e.g. Environment and Housing may be combined)and a minister may be assisted by one or more ministers of State.
Each ministry also has a Permanent Secretary, who is a senior civil servant.
The ministries are responsible for various[parastatals(government-owned corporations) such as universities (Education), [[Nigerian Broadcasting Commission|National Broadcasting Commission]], Information and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
Other parastatals are the responsibility of the Office of the Presidency, such as the [[Independent National Electoral Commission]], the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] and the [[Civil Service Commission of Nigeria|Federal Civil Service Commission]].
The service has six additional units which provide services to all departments on the Civil Service:
*Establishments &amp; Record Office (E&amp;RO)
*Career Management Office (CMO)
*Manpower Development Office (MDO)
*Management Services Office (MSO)
*Common Services Office (CSO)
*Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR)

==Budget==

A sense of the relative expenditure on the different areas is given by the table below, which shows the 2008 budget for Federal ministries, departments and agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7606">The '''Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree''' or '''NEPC''' 1972 as amended in 1977 was meant to effect changes in the ownership structure of businesses in Nigeria and to provide opportunity for indigenous capital to have [[Indigenization|assertive control]] of the economy. The law also restricted economic activities of [[Multinational corporation|foreign firms]] to certain areas and obliged the firms to add Nigerians as partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Corruption a Delicate Subject." Nigeria: Financial Times Survey. Financial Times, 30 Sept. 1980, p. XLII. The Financial Times Historical&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 1,130 companies were affected, some companies transferred equity through private placement while others listed on the stock exchange. A total of 81 companies listed shares on the stock exchange worth a total value of 210 million naira while majority offered the shares through private placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Vincent |first=Ola |date=July 1979 |title=Using local resources to achieve increase in productivity |magazine=Nigerian business digest. (Universal Publications) Lagos |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decree was [[Repeal|repealed]] in 1995 with the promulgation of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/761742714 |title=The international law on foreign investments and host economies in Sub-Saharan Africa : Cameroon, Nigeria, and Kenya |last=Valentine. |first=Nde Fru, |date=2011 |publisher=Lit |isbn=9783643109743 |location=Berlin |pages=145 |oclc=761742714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to the end of colonial rule in 1960, Nigerian businessmen had been agitating for protection of indigenous capital from foreign competition, while a clamour to reduce expatriate quota resulted in [[Nigerianisation]] in many institutions. Following decolonization, aspirations of economic independence and self-determination became pronounced and began to earn broad base support.&lt;ref name="bierk" /&gt; An indigenisation policy championed by bureaucrats and Nigerian businessmen&lt;ref name="adeoye" /&gt; was pursued within the Federal Government's [[Development planning|National Development Plan]] for 1970–74.&lt;ref name="uche"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Uche |first=Chibuike U. |date=2012 |title=British Government, British Businesses, and the Indigenization Exercise in Post-Independence Nigeria |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/british-government-british-businesses-and-the-indigenization-exercise-in-postindependence-nigeria/A272C4D2E5526F03D979AF3A2CE1ECAD |magazine=Business History Review |language=en |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=745–771 |doi=10.1017/S000768051200181X |issn=0007-6805}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1972, the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree was promulgated to be effective in April 1974. The new legislation was planned to give Nigerians more access to surplus income of businesses, shift foreign investment to highly technical areas and promote indigenous businesses.&lt;ref name="remi"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Remi |first=Anifowose, |date=1980 |title=Indigenisation policies in Africa: a comparative view |url=https://www.africabib.org/rec.php?RID=186578806 |journal=Genève-Afrique: acta africana |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=9-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military administration was more amenable to make the changes than their previous democratic counterpart partly because of their increasing distrust of foreign capital, an aftermath of their experience in relying on foreign governments and multinational corporations during the [[Nigerian Civil War]] and the lack of prompt response of oil companies to make payments exclusively to the Federal Government.&lt;ref name="bierk"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8929158 |title=The Political economy of Nigeria |date=1983 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=0030614767 |location=New York, N.Y. |oclc=8929158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NEPC 1972==
NEPC decree of 1972 was a legislation to effect changes in the ownership structure of light industries such as retail and small scale businesses. Industries were divided into two divisions called schedule 1 and schedule 2. Along with the decree was the establishment of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Board to manage the implementation of the new law. Following the spirit of the new law, the government acquired interest in major expatriate led banks within the country including [[First Bank of Nigeria]] and [[Union Bank of Nigeria]] and mandated a compulsory percentage of loans be made to Nigerians. The government also acquired interest in the insurance and oil and gas sectors. A new bank, the Nigerian bank of Commerce and Industry came into existence to facilitate loans to Nigerians for the purpose of investing in foreign owned firms.&lt;ref name="remi" /&gt;

&lt;ref name="remi" /&gt;

==NEPC 1977==
Prior to 1977, criticism of the existing law led to a couple of amendments but the most significant was in 1977. Critics had felt the changes created a new bourgeois that purchased majority of the shares. In addition, while 950 business were affected under the 1972 decree some had requested exemptions and not all were compliant by April 1974. Some affected enterprises were alleged to have conspired with some Nigerians who will come in as a silent partner or front as chairman of the board of directors but the firm will be managed by [[Staff and line|line personnel]] expatriates in the backroom.&lt;ref name="uche" /&gt; The new amendment of 1977 limited the number of companies an individual could gain majority control and empowered the enterprises promotion board with the ability to seal the offices of non compliant firms.&lt;ref name="adeoye"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Akinsanya |first=Adeoye |date=1994 |title=The Power Structure in Nigeria and the Indigenization of the Economy |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41393473 |journal=Pakistan Horizon |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=63–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Businesses where divided into three schedules. Under schedule one, ownership of businesses shall be 100% indigenous. Business activities under this schedule were related to the retail and service sector, advertising, bakeries, commercial transportation and estate agencies. Under schedule two, ownership will be 60% owned by Nigerian.&lt;ref name="correspondent"/&gt; Under the amendment additional sectors were added to schedule 2, this included banking, insurance, food processing, petrochemicals and iron and steel.

Dr. '''Nthato Harrison Motlana''' (16 Feb 1925 – 1 December 2008) was a prominent [[South African]] businessman, physician and anti-apartheid activist.

==Life under Apartheid==
He was tried alongside [[Nelson Mandela]] by the [[Apartheid]] regime during the [[Defiance Campaign]] of 1951–52, and played a prominent role during the [[Soweto uprising]] as one of the members of the [[Soweto Committee of Ten]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/mandela/nthato-motlana.htm ''Mandela mourns Nthato Motlana'' Southafrica.info]&lt;/ref&gt; Motlana was a founding member of the [[Black Community Programme]], a group whose goal was to economically empower black South Africans, and he founded [[Phaphama Africa Commercial Enterprises]], [[Lesedi Clinic]] (the first black owned, private up-market hospital in the country), and [[Sizwe Medical Aid]] (the first black owned medical aid scheme in South Africa). &lt;ref&gt; Coetzee, C &amp; Pienaar, H.

==Life after Apartheid==
Following [[apartheid]], Motlana took a lead role in the formation of the [[New African Investments Limited]], or NAIL, which purchased many previously white run corporations at below market value. These included South Africa's largest newspaper ''[[The Sowetan]]''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Colin|date=2009-05-01|title=South African media in transition|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/jams/2009/00000001/00000002/art00002|journal=Journal of African Media Studies|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=195–220|doi=10.1386/jams.1.2.195_1|issn=2040-199X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his huge success in business Motalana earned the nickname "Father of Black Economic Empowerment." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2960427-X/fulltext, The Lancet, Volume 373, Issue 9665, Page 716, 28 February 2009, Nthato Harrison Motlana]&lt;/ref&gt;

Motlana served on the boards of [[Putco]], [[Rand Water|Rand Water Board]], [[Adcock Ingram Group]] and [[Sasol]], amongst other civic and academic institutions. &lt;ref name=joburg&gt;[http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3255&amp;Itemid=203 "Motlana: the passing of a great man" by, Ndaba Dlamini, Joburg.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">'''Olefin Conversion Technology''', also called the '''Phillips Triolefin Process''', is the industrial process that interconverts [[propylene]] with [[ethylene]] and [[2-butene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Catalysis Reviews Science and Engineering|title=Converting Olefins to Propene: Ethene to Propene and Olefin Cracking|authors=Vincent Blay, Eva Epelde, Rubén Miravalles, Leo Alvarado Perea|volume=60|year=2018|doi=10.1080/01614940.2018.1432017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process is also called the ethylene to propylene (ETP) process. In ETP, ethylene is dimerized to [[1-Butene|1-butene]], which is isomerized to [[2-Butene|2-butene]]s.  The 2-butenes are then subjected to metathesis with ethylene.

Rhenium- and molybdenum-containing [[heterogeneous catalysis]] are used. Nowadays, only the reverse reaction is practiced, i.e., the conversion of ethylene and 2-butene to propylene:&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghashghaee|first1=Mohammad|title=Heterogeneous catalysts for gas-phase conversion of ethylene to higher olefins|journal=Rev.

The technology is founded on an [[olefin metathesis]] reaction discovered at [[Phillips Petroleum Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banks | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = G.

Adams has been appointed both a member and subsequently an officer of the [[Order of Australia]]; and he has received numerous awards including five honorary doctorates from Australian universities; Republican of the Year 2005; the Senior ANZAC Fellowship; the Australian Humanist of the Year, the [[Golden Lion]] at Cannes; the Longford Award; a [[Walkley Award]]; and the Henry Lawson Australian Arts Award. In 1997 the [[International Astronomical Union]] named a minor planet orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter after him.&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; A [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] poll elected him one of Australia's 100 [[Australian Living Treasures|national living treasures]].&lt;ref name=NatTrust&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/nsw/NationalLivingTreasures|title=National Living Treasures|publisher=[[National Trust of Australia]]|date=2012|accessdate=23 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129093613/http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/nsw/NationalLivingTreasures|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Adams was born in [[Maryborough, Victoria|Maryborough]], Victoria, the only child of [[Congregational Church]] minister, the Reverend Charles Adams. His childhood was anything but idyllic and his parents separated when he was young. Interviewed in 2006, Adams said that:&lt;ref name="backyard" &gt;{{cite interview|last=Adams|first=Phillip|interviewer=[[Richard Fidler]]|title=Broadcaster Phillip Adams in conversation with Richard Fidler|type=Radio interview|url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/conversations/stories/s1690728.htm|format=transcript and streaming audio|work=The Backyard|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|location=Australia|date=19 July 2006|page= |pages= |access-date=23 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101095832/http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/conversations/stories/s1690728.htm|archive-date=2007-11-01|dead-url=yes|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My first memories were my mother... absolutely dependent on the begging bowl – that little round dish with a piece of cloth at the bottom where parishioners would put a couple of bob. When dad went off to the war, I was taken up by my grandparents... and lived on a dirt-poor farm... I lived in penury for the first 10, 15 years of my life. ... Mother dumped [my father] in favour of a rather sleazy businessman ... a sociopath who tried to murder me ... I spent my latter part of my childhood trying to protect my mother from this psycho.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Of his education he has said: "I was forced to leave school before completing my secondary education and the only job I could get was working in advertising."&lt;ref name="atheist" /&gt;

Adams joined the [[Australian Communist Party]]&lt;ref name="conversations" &gt;{{cite interview|last=Adams|first=Phillip|interviewer=[[Richard Fidler]]|title=Phillip Adams|type=Radio interview|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2006/09/14/1740844.htm|format=transcript and streaming audio|work=Conversations with Richard Fidler|publisher=[[ABC Local Radio]]|location=Australia|date=14 September 2006|page= |pages= |access-date=23 December 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 16, whilst employed in advertising, but left at age 19. He has often compared dogmatic belief in communism to dogmatic belief in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Career==
Adams began his advertising career with [[Foote Cone &amp; Belding]] and, later, with Brian Monahan and Lyle Dayman, became a partner in the agency Monahan Dayman Adams. They took that company to a successful public listing and Adams became a millionaire in the process.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He developed successful campaigns such as ''[[Life. Be in it.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animation cel of 'Norm' from the 'Life. Be in it' campaign, 1993 – 1994|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=12209&amp;search=alexander&amp;images=&amp;c=1&amp;s=|work=Powerhouse Museum Collection Search 2.53|format=Acetate, paper, cardboard|author1=Stitt, Alexander|author2=Adams, Phillip|location=South Yarra, Victoria, Australia|date=1993–1994|publisher=[[Powerhouse Museum]], Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slip-Slop-Slap|Slip, Slop, Slap]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunsmart.com.au/browse.asp?ContainerID=1808|title=Page Not Found|first=SunSmart|last=Victoria|website=SunSmart}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Break down the Barriers'', ''Guess whose mum's got a Whirlpool'' and ''Watch the big men fly for a Herbert Adams Pie'', working with talent such as [[Fred Schepisi]], Alex Stitt, [[Peter Best (composer)|Peter Best]], [[Robyn Archer]] and Mimmo Cozzolino. Adams left the advertising industry in the 1980s. Monahan Dayman Adams purchased the successful Sydney agency [[Mojo (advertising)|MoJo]] in 1987 and carried on as MojoMDA. Its lineage can today be traced to Publicis Mojo, an Australian subsidiary of the French [[multinational corporation|multinational]] advertising and communications company holding [[Publicis Groupe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

He wrote regular columns for ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Bulletin]]''. He currently writes a weekly column for ''The Australian''.

===Film work===
Adams played a key role in the revival of the [[Cinema of Australia|Australian film industry]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=godfather&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/06/1046826480126.html?oneclick=true|location=Melbourne|work=[[The Age]]|date=7 March 2003|accessdate=23 December 2014|title=Bazza turns 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of a 1969 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusHorror/OzHorrorFilms4.html|title=A Brief History of the Film Industry in Australia and New Zealand|work=Killer Koalas: Australian (and New Zealand) Horror Films|format=Appendix|author=Hood, Robert|date=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to legislation by Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] in 1970 for an Australian Film and Television Development Corporation (later the [[Australian Film Commission]]) and the Experimental Film Fund.

Together with [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]], Adams was a motivating force behind the [[Australian Film Television and Radio School]] which was established under the [[Whitlam|Whitlam government]].&lt;ref name=spa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenforever.org.au/program/phillip-adams-ao/|title=Phillip Adams AO|work=Screen Forever|publisher=Screen Producers Australia|date=November 2014|accessdate=23 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223132555/http://screenforever.org.au/program/phillip-adams-ao/|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams played a key role in the development of the [[South Australian Film Corporation]],&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; which was created in 1972 and became a model for similar bodies in other Australian states; and in the establishment of the [[Australia Council]] and the [[Australian Film Development Corporation]],&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; later known as the Australian Film Commission, the [[Film Finance Corporation Australia]], and [[Screen Australia]]. As head of delegation to the [[Cannes Film Festival]], Adams signed Australia's first co-production agreements with France and the UK. He was Chairman of the [[Australian Film Institute]], the Film and Television Board of the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission, and Film Australia. He helped establish the Australian Caption Service, which provides services for hearing-impaired television viewers – and the Travelling Film Festival to take quality films into rural areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In the 1960s Adams co-wrote, co-produced and co-directed (as well as serving as cinematographer for) his first feature film ''[[Jack and Jill: A Postscript]]'' (1969); the first feature to win the [[Australian Film Institute Award|AFI Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/23/carlton-australian-revival.html|author=Hodson, Bruce|title=The Carlton Ripple and the Australian Film Revival|work=Screening the Past|date=|accessdate=15 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218063047/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/23/carlton-australian-revival.html|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Australian film to win the Grand Prix at an international festival.

Adams produced or co-produced other features including the critically panned but hugely popular film adaptation of Barry Humphries' ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]'', directed by [[Bruce Beresford]], which became the most successful Australian film ever made up to that time. Other films include ''[[The Naked Bunyip]]'', ''[[Don's Party]]'', ''[[The Getting of Wisdom (film)|The Getting of Wisdom]]'', ''Lonely Hearts'', ''[[We of the Never Never]]'', ''[[Grendel Grendel Grendel]]'', ''Fighting Back'', ''Hearts and Minds'' and ''[[Abra Cadabra (1983 film)|Abra Cadabra]]''.

===Broadcasting===
Adams initially presented a late-night program on Sydney commercial radio station [[2UE]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s before succeeding [[Virginia Bell]] in 1991 at ABC Radio National's ''Late Night Live'', a magazine{{endash}}style program that broadcasts analysis of current events to Australian and international politics, science, philosophy and culture. ''Late Night Live'' is broadcast across Australia on ABC Radio National, as well as on [[Radio Australia]] and the Internet. The program is broadcast live from 22:00 [[Australian Time|AEST]]/[[Australian Daylight Saving Time|ADST]] and is repeated the following day at 16:00 AEST/ADST.&lt;ref name="LNLprofile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/|work=ABC Radio National|title=About us: Late Night Live|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A serious discussion of world issues, the program is tempered with Adams' gentle and ironic humour.&lt;ref name="Luker2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luker, Philip|title=Phillip Adams: The Ideas Man – A Life Revealed|page=206|date=20 April 2011|publisher=JoJo Publishing|isbn=978-0-9870734-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular contributors include [[Bruce Shapiro]]&lt;ref name="LNLprofile" /&gt; and [[Beatrix Campbell]].

At times, Adams refers [[tongue-in-cheek]] to his listeners as "the listener" or "Gladys", as though he had only one listener; he also refers to listeners collectively as "Gladdies". In more recent years, Adams has begun introducing the show saying "Good evening Gladdies and Poddies", in reference to the show's growing [[podcast]] listener base.

The current theme music is a short extract from [[Elena Kats-Chernin]]'s ''[[Wild Swans (ballet)|Wild Swans Concert Suite]]'', performed by the [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]] with [[soprano]] [[Jane Sheldon]], chosen in 2010. From 2007 to 2010, the theme music was Kats-Chernin's "Russian Rag", which Adams humorously refers to as "The Waltz of the Wombat". The previous music was [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Keyboard concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach#Concerto in C minor, BWV 1060|Concerto for oboe, violin and orchestra in C minor, BWV 1060]]: III. ''Allegro''.

===Other work===
Adams was the foundation chairman of the Commission for the Future,&lt;ref name=LNLprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; established by the [[Hawke government]] to build bridges between science and the community. In 1988 the Commission won a major United Nations award for educating Australia on the issue of greenhouse and [[climate change]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He chaired the [[National Australia Day Council]];&lt;ref name=LNLprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; whose principal task was to choose the Australian of the Year.

He also chaired the Advisory Board for the Centre of the Mind at the [[University of Sydney]] and the [[Australia National University]] and has been a board member of Greenpeace Australia, CARE Australia, the National Museum of Australia, The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, the [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]] and Brisbane's [[Ideas Festival]]. He was co-founder of the [[Australian Skeptics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityspeakers.com.au/media-speakers/phillip-adams/|title=Phillip Adams AO|work=Speaker Profile|publisher=The Celebrity Speakers Bureau|date=2014|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams is the author or editor of more than 20 books, including ''The Unspeakable Adams'', ''Adams Versus God'', ''The Penguin Book of Australian Jokes'', ''Retreat from Tolerance'', ''Talkback and A Billion Voices'', ''Adams Ark'', and, with Lee Burton, ''Emperors of the Air''.

[[Robert Manne]] has described Adams as "the emblematic figurehead of the pro-[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] left [[intelligentsia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Manne, Robert|authorlink=Robert Manne |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/labor-must-confront-its-identity-crisis/2004/10/17/1097951554223.html|location=Melbourne|work=[[The Age]]|title=Labor must confront its identity crisis|date=18 October 2004|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams had a close relationship with every Labor leader from Gough Whitlam to [[Kevin Rudd]], advising on public relations, advertising and policy issues. However, on 19 July 2006, he was reported as saying of the Labor Party:&lt;ref name=backyard /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They hate me. I think Kim Beazley is a serious error. I think the party's been going downhill federally ever since Keating left ... The Labor Party's hardly worth feeding federally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2010, Adams resigned from the Labor Party after Rudd was defeated as the [[Leader of the Australian Labor Party|Leader of the Labor Party]] at the [[Australian Labor Party leadership election, 2010|2010 Labor leadership spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why I quit the Labor Party|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/why-i-quit-the-labor-party/story-e6frg8h6-1225886243738|author=Adams, Phillip|work=[[The Australian]]|date=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Adams argued against [[Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], saying that a better response to expressions of racial hatred was "public debate, not legal censure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Role of the Media|last=Adams|first=Phillip|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams' life and extracurricular activities have made him a source of interest to fans and foes of all persuasions for many years. Australia's [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|security intelligence organisation]] kept an extensive [[ASIO File]] on Adams. The file began at about the time he turned 16 years of age.&lt;ref name="Adams file 2"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Australian|The Weekend Australian Magazine]]|author=Adams, Phillip|date=16 July 2005|title=Adams file|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:(1) Stoneleigh (Darley Street)-1.jpg|right|thumb|"Stoneleigh", Adams's former home]]
Adams is married to [[Patrice Newell]]. He has four daughters: three with his first wife, Rosemary Fawcett, and one with Newell. He lives on "Elmswood", a large property near [[Gundy]] in the [[Hunter Region]] in mid-northern New South Wales. He and his wife grow garlic, olives and farm organically fed cattle. He has a home in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], an inner suburb of Sydney. Prior to this, Adams lived for some time in "Stoneleigh", a heritage-listed house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2420152|title=House "Stoneleigh" Including Interior, Front Fence and Grounds – NSW Environment &amp; Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]. Adams is a collector of rare antiques, including Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s.

He has written "I'd been an atheist since I was five."&lt;ref name=atheist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/4678.htm|title=I Am Proud That|author1=Adams, Phillip|author2=Croucher, Rowland|publisher=John Mark Ministries|date=October 1998|archive-url=http://www.melbournesynagogue.org.au/news/haatid/q4_1998/q4_98_02.html|archive-date=5 January 2003|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16101">'''Rehabilitation counseling''' is focused on helping people who have [[disabilities]] achieve their personal, career, and independent living goals through a [[counseling]] process.

Rehabilitation Counselors can be found in private practice, in [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] facilities, hospitals, universities, schools, government agencies, insurance companies and other organizations where people are being treated for [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] or acquired disabilities. Over time, with the changes in [[social work]] being more psychotherapy-oriented, rehabilitation counselors take on more and more [[community engagement]] work, especially as it relates to special populations. Some rehabilitation counselors focus solely on community engagement through vocational services, others in various states qualify as both a certified rehabilitation counselor (CRC) and a [[licensed professional counselor]] (LPC), enabling them to focus on [[psychotherapy]].

==History==

=== United States ===
Historically, rehabilitation counselors primarily served working-age adults with disabilities. Today, the need for rehabilitation counseling services extends to persons of all age groups who have disabilities. Rehabilitation counselors also may provide general and specialized counseling to people with disabilities in public human service programs and private practice settings.&lt;ref name="ama-assn.org"&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16070.html AMA (Med Ed Products) Rehabilitation counselor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, rehabilitation professionals were recruited from a variety of human service disciplines, including public health nursing, social work, and school counseling. Although educational programs began to appear in the 1940s, it was not until the availability of federal funding for rehabilitation counseling programs in 1954 that the profession began to grow and establish its own identity.

==== Education and training ====
Though no specific undergraduate degree is required, the majority of rehabilitation counseling graduate students have undergraduate degrees in rehabilitation services, psychology, sociology, or other human services-related fields. As a master's degree is required at a minimum, rehabilitation counselors are trained at the graduate level, with most earning a master's degree, and a few continuing on to the Doctoral level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chhs.niu.edu/rehab_services/graduate/roles_responsibilities.shtml Northern Illinois University Graduate Program]&lt;/ref&gt; The Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.core-rehab.org/ Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE)]&lt;/ref&gt; accredits qualifying institutions, though not all programs meet accreditation requirements, prohibiting some graduates from professional certification/licensure. Rehabilitation counselors are trained in the following areas:
* Individual and group counseling
* Medical and psychosocial information
* Problems and [[community engagement]] of special populations
* Evaluation and assessment
* Research utilization
* Employment and occupational choice
* Case and caseload management
* Job development and placement

Accredited rehabilitation counselor education programs typically provide 60 credit hours of academic and field-based clinical training. Clinical training consists of at least a semester of practicum and a minimum of 600 hours of supervised internship experience. Clinical field experiences are available in a variety of community, state, federal, and private rehabilitation-related programs.

==== Professional certification and licensure ====
The [[Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC)]] grants certification to counselors who meet educational requirements and have passed an examination indicating that they possess the competency and skill to become a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor, (CRC in the United States; CCRC in Canada). A Master's degree is required to obtain certification. Certification as a rehabilitation counselor is not mandated by any state or federal laws, however eligibility to sit for the certification exam is mandated by federal law for those wishing to work for state/federal vocational rehabilitation systems. Some states have Licensed Rehabilitation Counselors (LRC), which places LRCs at the same level as other licensed social service professionals. In other states the CRC qualifies the rehabilitation counselor to obtain the Licensure as a Professional Counselor (LPC). Certification is highly desirable to many employers.

==== Social relevancy ====
Community service to a culturally and ethnically diverse population, professional functions, critical thinking, [[advocacy]], applied research activities, and ethical standards are integrated throughout rehabilitation counselor preparation and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehab.siu.edu/degree/rc_intro.html SIUC Rehabilitation Counseling Dept.]&lt;/ref&gt; Though rehabilitation counselors are adept at understanding medical issues surrounding the disability (as proven by certification/licensure), they are trained in the [[social model of disability]], which identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. Rehabilitation Counselors are often advocates in the community for people with disabilities outside of the workplace, with most doing some form of [[community engagement]]. As a good portion of counselors have disabilities themselves, the counseling process often emphasizes self-advocacy skills. Rehabilitation counselors can be found in the leadership of many prominent organizations that support [[human rights]] and civil rights for people with disabilities such as [[American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities]], [[National Black Deaf Advocates]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/hrlr_journal/42.2/Kanter.pdf Syracuse University Disability Law and Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation counseling careers==

=== Careers in the profession ===
In the United States, many rehabilitation counselors work in a variety of arenas. The predominant placement of rehabilitation counselors are state rehabilitation programs as Vocational Counselors, social service agencies as Administrators, and at the collegiate level as Disability Counselors/Specialists:

==== State rehabilitation programs ====
The predominant need for rehabilitation counselors is within federal/state funded vocational rehabilitation programs. While the Veterans Benefits Administration has its own vocational rehabilitation program, the rest of Federal/State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs are funded and regulated by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), a division of the U.S Department of Education. Although policies vary from state to state, rehabilitation counselors who work in the federal/state systems typically must hold a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling, special education or a related field, and are required to be certified or be eligible to sit for the certification examination. People accepting employment in the federal/state Vocational Rehabilitation programs do so with the agreement they will meet these qualifications by a specified date to maintain employment.

==== Social service agencies and the corporate sector ====
Rehabilitation Counselors can work in the non-profit/corporate sector in various ways. Though the majority start as counselors, specializing in career counseling, most rehabilitation counselors that work in the non-profit arena rise to the administration level, either in supervising staff or directing programs for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crccertification.com/filebin/pdf/careercenter/CRCresources_CRCScope.pdf Scope of Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; Others supervise staff that work in case management programs that serve people with disabilities. Some rehabilitation counselors work with [[Centers for Independent Living|Independent Living Centers]], doing [[community engagement]], advocacy, outside referrals, and social service provision for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysilc.org/council.htm NY State Independent Living Council]&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurial rehabilitation counselors also work as consultants, establishing their own private service agencies. Counselors in working with corporations focus on community relations or corporate service, serving as liaisons between companies and charities or service programs.

==== College disability counselors and specialists ====
By law all [[community college]]s, colleges and universities are required to make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. To satisfy this requirement most collegial settings have a Disability Resources Center, a Special Needs Coordinator or a similar office. Staff are responsible for coordinating services that ''may'' include but are not limited to: advocacy/liaison, computer access, counseling (academic, personal, vocational), equipment loan, information/referral services, in-service awareness programs, notetakers, on campus orientation and mobility training for visually impaired students, priority registration assistance, readers, scribes, shuttle (on-campus), sign language interpreters, test proctoring/testing accommodations, and tutors.

Some adaptive technological accommodations ''may'' include but are not limited to: Adaptive computer technology (including voice activated and speech output), Assistive listening devices, Films/videotapes about disabilities, Kurzweil personal reader, Large print software,Print enlargers (CCTV), Raised-line drawing kit, Tactile map of campus, Talking calculators, Tape recorders/APH Talking Book Machine, TDD for hearing impaired, Wheelchair, Wheelchair access maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foothill.edu/al/drc.php Adaptive Learning Division - Disability Resource Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who have documentation proving their disability status and the staff are trained to access or have knowledge of the necessary services according to the students' unique need. As the college level is different from the primary school system, the same services that a student may have received within a special education program in high school may not be required at the collegiate level. A wide variety of students with disabilities can be served, some examples are individuals with: learning disabilities, sensorial disabilities (hearing loss, vision loss, etc.), physical disabilities (cerebral palsy, etc.) and psychological disabilities.

==== Forensic rehabilitation counselors ====
Forensic rehabilitation counselors can work as consultants, serving as witnesses and advocates in the legal profession. Forensic rehab counselors serve as legal advisors with specialized information on disability in the areas of higher education access, Social Security, marital dissolution, personal injury, and Worker’s Compensation. 

According to a survey of 1,220 Certified Rehabilitation Counselors(CRC) conducted by the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CORE), CRCs working within a forensic/expert witness job function have the highest annual salary ($93,000) of all job functions analyzed. Furthermore, when average salaries were analyzed by primary work setting, CRCs working within business or industry have the highest annual salary ($78,000) of all settings listed, which is $30,000 more than CRCs working in state/federal rehabilitation agencies. High annual salaries in the forensic area may be a key attraction for CRCs seeking to transition from the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Forensic Vocational Rehabilitation Program|url=http://bsch.phhp.ufl.edu/distance-learning/forensic-vocational-rehabilitation/forensic-vocational-rehabilitation-program/|website=University of Florida Forensic Vocational Rehabilitation Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic programs require a graduate degree from an accredited rehabilitation counseling program, and enable the student to: learn about the role that counselors provide within the legal system; gain expertise in the ethical standards expected of expert witnesses; learn about the processes followed within legal cases when testifying on one’s expert opinion; gain an understanding of the business aspects of a forensic counselor’s work that breed success in this area of specialization.

== Growth of the field ==

=== Job outlook ===
As of 2010 there were 129,800 working in the field. Jobs for rehabilitation counselors are expected to grow by 28 percent, which is much faster than the average for all occupations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/rehabilitation-counselors.htm BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional development ===
There are several professional organizations Rehabilitation Counselors and other rehabilitation professionals belong to, including the American Rehabilitation Counseling Association, National Rehabilitation Counseling Association, and American Rehabilitation Action Network. Though there is no nationwide union or lobbying organization supporting rehabilitation counselors (such as is the case with social workers, or psychologists), the [[Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC)]] does a lot of work in organizing rehabilitation counselors that pursue the professional advancement of the young field.

'''''Residual value''''' is one of the constituents of a [[leasing]] calculus or operation. It describes the future value of a good in terms of absolute value in monetary terms and it is sometimes abbreviated into a percentage of the initial price when the item was new.

Example: A car is sold at a list price of $20,000 today. After a usage of 36 months and 50,000 miles its value is contractually defined as $10,000 or 50%. The credited amount, on which the interest is applied, thus is $20,000 present value minus $10,000 future value.

Residual values are contractually dealt with either in terms of [[closed contract]]s or [[open contract]]s.

In accounting, residual value is another name for [[salvage value]], the remaining value of an asset after it has been fully depreciated.

The residual value derives its calculation from a base price, calculated after [[depreciation]].

Residual values are calculated using a number of factors, generally a vehicles market value for the term and mileage required is the start point for the calculation, followed by seasonality, monthly adjustment, lifecycle and disposal performance. The leasing company setting the residual values (RVs) will use their own historical information to insert the adjustment factors within the calculation to set the end value being the residual value.

In accounting, the residual value could be defined as an estimated amount that an entity can obtain when disposing of an asset after its useful life has ended. When doing this the estimated costs of disposing of the asset should be deducted.

The formula to calculate the residual value can be seen with the next example as follows:

A company owns a machine which was bought for €20,000. This machine has a useful life of five years which has just ended. The company knows that if it sells the machine now it will be able to recover 10% of the price of acquisition.

Therefore, the residual value would be:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Residual value} = 10\% \times (20{,}000) = 2{,}000&lt;/math&gt;

After the party's electoral victory, he served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Commerce in [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s government. Following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|coup d'état in 2006]], the junta chose him as an economic envoy, advocating the royally-endorsed "[[self-sufficiency]]" economic agenda.

After another [[2014 Thai coup d'état|military coup in 2014]], he served as the junta's advisor on foreign economic relations. Since September 2014 he has been a full member of the so-called [[National Council for Peace and Order]].

His wife, Anurachanee Jatusripitak, teaches at [[Chulalongkorn University]]. They have three children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Education and academic career==
Somkid went to Triam Udom Suksa School and graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Economics, [[Thammasat University]] in 1972. Later, he completed an MBA in Finance from the Graduate School of Business Administration (NIDA Business School), [[National Institute of Development Administration]] (NIDA) and a Ph.D. in marketing from the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]].

After graduating, he joined a teaching position and became Associate Professor in Marketing at the Graduate School of Business Administration (NIDA Business School). He also served as an Associate Dean at NIDA Business School. Somkid's thinking was greatly influenced by [[Michael Porter]]'s "Competitiveness of Nations". He focused much of his academic research on the development of national and business competitiveness. Along with his mentor [[Philip Kotler]], he was a strong supporter of the concept of [[Nation Branding]]. In 1997, Somkid co-authored "The Marketing of Nations: A Strategic Approach to Building National Wealth" with [[Philip Kotler]]. The book outlined how countries could improve their competitiveness through marketing and appropriate policies to support it.&lt;ref name="Somkid promises he'll do it his way"/&gt; Somkid's book, ''Borisat Prathet Thai'' ("Thailand Inc: Concepts and Strategy"), stressed how Thailand should use marketing to improve its competitiveness.

==Business career==
Somkid was a co-founder of the Manager Media Group, along with [[Sondhi Limthongkul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&amp;id=58371 Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004752/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=6&amp;id=58371 |date=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a role in the establishment of the Phatra Research Institute.&lt;ref name="Somkid promises he'll do it his way"/&gt;  He became a Director of the Saha Pattanapibul Group, a major Thai consumer goods conglomerate.  He was appointed to become Advisor of the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]], Director of PTTEP, and Director of the [[PTT Public Company Limited|Petroleum Authority of Thailand]].

==Political career==

===Advisor to Foreign Minister Thaksin Shinawatra===
Somkid became secretary to Foreign Minister Thaksin Shinawatra under [[Banharn Silpa-Archa]]'s government (1995–96).

===Advisor to Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya===
Somkid became secretary to Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya under [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government (1996–97).

===Founding of the Thai Rak Thai Party===
Somkid was one of the co-founders of the Thai Rak Thai party in 1998, along with party leader Thaksin Shinawatra.  His senior stature in the party was apparent from his no. 3 position in the TRT's 2001 election party list, behind Thaksin Shinawatra and Purachai Piemsomboon.

Somkid has been called "the man behind ''Thaksinomics''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&amp;leaf=07&amp;filename=8901&amp;filetype=html]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the mastermind of the populist policies that helped propel the Thai Rak Thai party to a landslide election victory in 2001. The TRT "won by embracing
populism on a grand scale," said the Far Eastern Economic Review. Somkid's chief policy innovations included the universal healthcare program, 1 million THB development funds for each of Thailand's 70,000 villages, a 3-year loan freeze for farmers, fast-track privatization of state enterprises, and a national asset management corporation (AMC) to buy up the $20 billion in bad debt carried by Thai banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,100225,00.html Asiaweek.com | On The Hot Seat | 2/3/2001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221125834/http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,100225,00.html |date=December 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=[[Duncan McCargo]] |author2=Ukrist Pathmanand |title=The Thaksinization of Thailand |place=Copenhagen |publisher=NIAS Press |year=2005 |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somkid also pioneered the TRT party's rural small and medium enterprise (SME) policy. Noting that agriculture remains the most important economic sector, employing 60-70% of the Thai population, the economic challenge was to develop the agricultural sector and link it with the modern sector.&lt;ref name="thanong.tripod.com"/&gt;  This became one of the founding principles of the Thaksin government's popular [[One Tambon One Product]] (OTOP) program.

At the time, ''The Nation'' newspaper exclaimed that these policies "amount to a revolution in Thai public policy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thanong.tripod.com/01112001.htm Somkid - who else could it be?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061420/http://thanong.tripod.com/01112001.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister in Thaksin's government===
From the TRT's landslide election win of 2001, Somkid was a core member of Thakin's economic inner cabinet - starting off as Finance Minister and then becoming Commerce Minister.

====Finance Minister====
{{prose|section|date=May 2014}}
In his term as Finance Minister (February 2001 to February 2003), Somkid
*oversaw a management reshuffle at state-owned [[Thai Airways International]]
*led the establishment of the national asset management corporation (AMC)
*supported the controversial restructuring of [[Prachai Leophai-ratana]]'s [[TPI_Polene|Thai Petrochemical Industry]] (TPI)&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://sanpaworn.vissaventure.com/log/149/tpi-update Chinese conglomerate said to seek majority stake in TPI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529165038/http://sanpaworn.vissaventure.com/log/149/tpi-update |date=May 29, 2014 }}, 27 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2002, Somkid established the ''village fund program''. This program gave each of Thailand's 70,000 villages a self-managed fund of 1 million THB (approx. 25,000 USD), to be used for grassroots social and economic investments.

====Commerce Minister====
{{prose|section|date=May 2014}}
In his term as Commerce Minister (August 2005 to September 2006), Somkid
* oversaw the recovery of tourism industry in the Andaman coast after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami of 2004]]
* agreed to draw up a comprehensive road map for increasing trade, investment and cooperation with the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/09/pda/business_30006098.html Bangkok's Independent Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203830/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/09/pda/business_30006098.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* boosted Board of Investment incentives in three target sectors - electronics, petrochemicals and vehicle tyres&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/23/business/business_30004653.php BoI okays additional incentives for investors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170953/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/23/business/business_30004653.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2005–06 Thai political crisis|anti-Thaksin demonstrations of 2005-2006]], Thaksin noted that Somkid was one of four individuals who might succeed him as Prime Minister if he stepped down.

In March 2006, during the height of the anti-Thaksin protests, Somkid underwent [[balloon angioplasty]] surgery to relieve a blood clot in an artery near his heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manager.co.th/IHT/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000039755 IHT ThaiDay - Manager Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165315/http://www.manager.co.th/IHT/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9490000039755 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]'s announcement that he would not accept the Premiership from Parliament after the April 2006 elections, Somkid was widely seen as a potential replacement. In a poll of businessmen, 57% said Somkid was the most suitable candidate for new premier. The next highest TRT politician was Bhokin Bhalakula, who received only 12%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/politics/politics_30001181.php Businessmen put Somkid in box seat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202734/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/politics/politics_30001181.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon later, a broad coalition of TRT factions, including Wang Nam Yom (130 MPs), Rim Nam (15 MPs), Lamtakong (7 MPs), Wang Phya Nag (10 MPs), Chon Buri (7 MPs) and the Central provinces (10 MPs) decided to push for Somkid Jatusripitak as the next prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/headlines/headlines_30001187.php Somkid takes an early lead in race to become prime minister&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214239/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/07/headlines/headlines_30001187.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of the 2006 coup===
The Thai military staged a successful [[2006 Thailand coup|coup]] against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006.  At the time, Somkid was in [[Paris]], attending the Thai-France Cultural Exhibition with Princess [[Sirindhorn]] and Foreign Minister [[Kantathi Supamongkhon]]. On 21 September 2006 arrived back to Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation. {{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid%3D30014251 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224235209/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30014251 |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }}, Somkid arrives at Don Muang&lt;/ref&gt;   Unlike several other senior members of Thaksin's Cabinet, he was not arrested by the [[CDRM|junta]].  Somkid kept a low profile, until on 2 October 2006 he resigned from the  Thai Rak Thai Party, along with Thaksin Shinawatra.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, Oct. 2, 2006 [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php Thaksin resigns from Thai Rak Thai] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183911/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, Oct. 2, 2006 [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 Somkid resigns from Thai Rak Thai Party] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012000000/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |date=October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to lead a low profile, until in February 2007, he was appointed head of a government committee charged with "preaching" King [[Bhumibol]]'s [[self-sufficient economy]] policy. The appointment provoked great controversy, as critics claimed that the populist economics czar had no role promoting self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/18/national/national_30027159.php More flak over role for Somkid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195305/http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/02/18/national/national_30027159.php |date=March 3, 2016 }}, 18 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30027069 Banharn criticises Surayud for appointing Somkid as economic envoy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207095348/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30027069 |date=December 7, 2008 }}, 18 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Somkid appointment was supported by General [[Saprang Kalyanamitr]], a powerful member of the junta, and [[Sondhi Limthongkul]] of the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]], a long-time colleague of Somkid's. Somkid later decided to resign from the committee, which was then dissolved. Somkid's long-time rival, Finance Minister [[Pridiyathorn Devakula]] volunteered to help perform the committee's role, and denied any role in Somkid's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://pages.citebite.com/o1b1p3x7t7sax Pridiyathorn: No need to replace Somkid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230845/http://pages.citebite.com/o1b1p3x7t7sax |date=March 3, 2016 }}, 21 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In early May 2007, a group of former elected senators said they were ready to support Somkid in forming a new political party, the so-called Dharma Thippatai group. Among those included Suraporn Danaitangtrakoon, Anek Laothamatas (former leader of the [[Mahachon Party]]), and former Thai Rak Thai members [[Suranand Vejjajiva]] and [[Pimol Srivikorn]].&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/10/politics/politics_30033826.php Former senators-elect back Somkid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314112113/http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/10/politics/politics_30033826.php |date=March 14, 2012 }}, 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 2007, they founded [[Ruam Jai Thai]]. However, on 30 May 2007 the Constitutional Tribunal had produced a [[2006 Thai political party dissolution charges|verdict]], barring all 111 former executive members of Thai Rak Thai Party, including Somkid, from holding political office for five years.&lt;ref name="TFSI"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Jon Fernquest |title=Institute, not politics, now Somkid's focus |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-from-news/305036/somkid-jatusripitak-research-institute-not-politics |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Somkid founded the ''Thailand Future Study Institute'', a [[think tank]] which is sponsored by major Thai business corporations and seeks to provide research and consulting to public bodies and private sector.&lt;ref name="TFSI"/&gt;

After the [[2014 Thai coup d'état|22 May 2014 coup d'état]], the junta—which calls itself [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO)—appointed Somkid member of its "advisory board" in charge of foreign economic relations, especially with Asian countries China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Prawit, Somkid, Pridiyathorn named advisers |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://bangkokpost.com/news/local/412074/prawit-somkid-pridiyathorn-named-advisers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/412579/ncpo-lays-out-stages-to-next-poll |title=NCPO lays out stages to next poll |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September Somkid—as one of two civilians— was appointed as a member of the NCPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/432553/somkid-meechai-sit-on-ncpo |title=Somkid, Meechai sit on NCPO |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aerodrome opened in 1928 and during the [[Second World War]] the aerodrome as RAF Sywell, was used as a training facility ([[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]]s) and later an important centre for the repair of [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bombers]] and extensive sheds from this time still remain on the site. Among World War II pilots who underwent training at Sywell were [[Pierre Clostermann]]&lt;ref&gt;Clostermann, Pierre. The Big Show. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004. {{ISBN|0-297-84619-1}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paddy Finucane]], who soloed here.

Many aerial shots for the film [[Battle of Britain (film)|''Battle of Britain'']] were taken over the airport and nearby area.

==Expansion==
Since 1999, the aerodrome sought planning permission for a hard runway, which was intended to allow operations to continue over the winter, when the grass runways often become waterlogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Plans to improve aerodrome site | work = [[BBC News]] |date = 26 April 2006 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4937822.stm |accessdate = 24 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisations STARE (Stop The Aerodrome Runway Expansion) and CPRE ([[Campaign to Protect Rural England]]) campaigned against this change, arguing that it would lead to more and larger aircraft flying over the area and disturb its "rural tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = £1m to sort out runway debate |work = Evening Telegraph |date = 14 August 2006 |url = http://www.ketteringtoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=661&amp;ArticleID=1695015 |accessdate = 24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Permission was granted for the runway on 22 November 2007 by the [[Department for Transport]], and though campaigners vowed to fight the decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Campaigners-fight-on-despite-Sywell39s.3513780.jp | date= 22 November 2007 | work= Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo | title= Campaigners fight on despite Sywell's runway approval | accessdate= 22 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071125071429/http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/Campaigners-fight-on-despite-Sywell39s.3513780.jp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were unsuccessful and construction of the runway began in 2008. It opened during summer 2009 and enabled safe operations during the winter of 2009/2010 and onwards. In February 2010, the final inspection of the newly completed all-weather hard runway was carried out by the CAA who confirmed that it could be licensed for use.
 
== Operations ==
Sywell has three all-grass operational runways and a fourth all-weather concrete runway. The aerodrome's operational hours are 0900-1700 during winter and 0800-1700 during summer. The aerodrome offers an [[Flight Information Service|Aerodrome Flight Information Service]] to pilots.

===Sywell Aviation Museum===
The aerodrome also houses the [[Sywell Aviation Museum]] dedicated to telling the wartime history of the site and the airmen that used it.

===Brooklands Flying Club===
Brooklands Flying Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklandsflyingclub.co.uk|title=HOME|website=HOME}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based at Sywell, with a fleet of four [[Aero AT-3]] aircraft and a [[Cessna 172]]. The club offered training for a [[Private Pilot's Licence]] (PPL), night rating and IMC rating.

The club opened in 2005 under the same name of the previous company that had been located on the airfield.
The flying school closed down at the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club has since reopened as 2Excel Training, operated in partnership with [[2Excel Aviation]], owners of [[The Blades (aerobatic team)|The Blades]] aerobatics team, who are also based at the airfield.

===Training===
Other flight training organisations on the airfield include:
*Sloane Helicopters
*Flylight Airsports

===The Blades===
[[The Blades (aerobatic team)|The Blades]] aerobatic display team are based at Sywell, where their five [[Extra EA-300]] aircraft are hangared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblades.com/Blades-corporate-homepage/Blades-corporate-site/Contact.aspx|title={title}|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204154/http://www.theblades.com/Blades-corporate-homepage/Blades-corporate-site/Contact.aspx|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They perform aerobatic displays at major events around the country, in Europe, and in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{url=http://www.theblades.com/Blades-public-homepage/Blades-public-site/About/The-Display.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is the only one fully licensed by the CAA to carry paying 'passengers' in aerobatic displays, out of Sywell, or at many other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblades.com/Blades-public-homepage/Blades-public-site/Fly-with-The-Blades.aspx|title={title}|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707002828/http://www.theblades.com/Blades-public-homepage/Blades-public-site/Fly-with-The-Blades.aspx|archive-date=7 July 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sywell Airshow===
The aerodrome now hosts a bi-annual charity airshow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sywellairshow.co.uk|title=Sywell Airshow|first=Handmade by Machine|last=Ltd|website=www.sywellairshow.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in aid of the local [[Air Ambulance]] where there are many classic aircraft flying and on display such as the [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]], Mustang, [[T-6 Texan|North American Harvards]].

===Light Aircraft Association Rally===
The [[Light Aircraft Association]] (LAA - formerly the Popular Flying Association), is the UK's body for amateur aircraft construction, and recreational and sport flying. It used to hold its annual rally at [[Cranfield Airport]], and then at [[Kemble Airport]]. In 2006, the LAA lost so much money through poor attendances resulting from poor weather that in 2007 and 2008, much smaller (and cheaper)  "regional rallies" were held. These were unpopular and in September 2009 a revived (if cut-down) LAA Rally was held at Sywell. This proved successful, and as further well-attended rallies took place at Sywell since&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aviatoruk.ga/sywell-aerodrome/|title=Sywell Aerodrome EGBK/ORM - AviatorUK|publisher=|date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the long-term future of the LAA Rally seems secure.

===Music in Flight===
[[Music in Flight]] is an airshow held at Sywell, in which an orchestra plays [[classical music]] to accompany flying aircraft, [[hot air balloon]]s, the [[Red Devils (Parachute Regiment)|Red Devils]] parachute display team and a fireworks display.

==Business park==
An industrial area in the complex accommodates firms, agencies and other commercial businesses.
