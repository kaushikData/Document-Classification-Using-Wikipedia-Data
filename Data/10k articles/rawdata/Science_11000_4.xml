The '''AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme''' is a five-year strategic research initiative funded by two UK research councils: the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. running 2007-2012. It has funded 75 projects across UK universities investigating various aspects of the complex relationships between religion and society, both historical and contemporary.

Research supported includes the website "British Religion in Numbers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brin.ac.uk/ British Religion in Numbers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029143012/http://www.brin.ac.uk/ |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a one-stop shop for statistics on religion in Britain led by Professor [[David Voas]] at [[Manchester University]], Professor Kim Knott at [[Leeds University]]'s restudy of British media coverage of religion and spirituality, and an investigation of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh shrine practices across the Punjab led by Dr Tej Purewal, also at Manchester. Phase 2 of the Programme has focused on Youth and Religion specifically, supporting projects like Dr Basia Spalek at [[Birmingham University]]'s research into police partnerships with young Muslims.

The Religion and Society Programme is hosted at [[Lancaster University]], and directed by Professor [[Linda Woodhead]] helped by Dr Rebecca Catto (Research Associate) and Peta Ainsworth (Administrator). The Programme also helps to organize various relevant and topical events such as a day at the British Library asking ‘where next for religion in the public sphere’ in July 2010 and a closed seminar asking ‘Child abuse in the Catholic Church – what can be learned?’ at [[Heythrop College]] London in November 2010.

== Sociology of Religion ==
Sociologist have studied religion right from the beginning of the discipline, in the 19th century. It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Durkheim]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's ''[[the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can’t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002).

== Religion in America ==
Religion in America has had a relationship since the very beginning of the nation. This relationship has changed over time and has shaped the culture. It started with the Native Americans and their worship of the Great Spirits. They believed that their ancestors watched over them and that the spirits in nature blessed them. When colonist came to America, they brought Christianity along with them. They tried to integrate the religion into the lives of the Native people. Christianity branched out and separated into Protestant and Catholic (Trundle, 2012). There were many forms of Protestant like [[Methodist]], Lutheran, and Quakers. There are other forms of Catholic as well, including the [[Roman Catholic]] and eastern Orthodox. Later other religions were introduced to America through immigration. Religions like [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]], and many others. These began to influence the culture. America was known as the melting pot of different cultures and religions. It was seen as a safe haven for those seeking religious freedom. Religion has effected America in many ways over the years. It was the reason the colonist came to America, and was used as an excuse for dominating over the Native Americans (Trundle, 2012). It was also used as a foundation for the civil rights movement as Martin Luther King Jr. presented his speech through his own personal belief system. More recent was September 11 when the twin towers were destroyed through religious beliefs. The bombers claimed that it was for religious purposes on why they did what they did. In effect, all religions joined together in America to rebuild and grow stronger. Religion has brought people together in times of need, throughout history. It has also caused negative effects in society as explained with 9/11.

== What happens after Religion ==
Fewer and fewer people believe nowadays. It's possible that in a generation, there simply won’t be religion across [[Europe]] and large sections of [[North America]], [[Australia]], and [[Asia]]. That's not necessarily a problem. However, it is worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place, and what we’re doing with the needs and longings that led them to do so. At one level, religions are about asking us to believe in something. When people say, they can’t believe, they tend to stop right there with the whole religion business. They often then point out all the horrid things that religions have undoubtly done and continue to do. In this sense, belief is almost the least important and defiantly the least interesting side of religion. What's fascinating is all the other stuff religions get up to. For example, the way they regularly gather people around, and tell them to be nice to one another. Also, the way they create a sense of community, teaching others to see everyone else as human beings (Gruber, 2008). Religions use rituals to point stuff out to us and lodge it in our fickle minds. For example, that the seasons are changing or that it's the time to remember our ancestors. Religions know were not just intellectual creatures, so they carefully appeal to us via art and beauty. We think of beauty in one category, a frivolous and superficial thing, and truth and depth in another. Religions join them together. They build temples, cathedrals, and mosques that use beauty to lend depth to important ideas. They use the resources of art to remind us of what matters. Its directed at making us feel things, calm, pity, awe.

We may no longer believe, but the needs and longings that make up these stories go on. We long for beauty, wisdom, and purpose. We want to live for something more than just ourselves. Society tells us to direct our hopes in two areas. These are romantic love, and professional success, and it distracts us with news, movies, and consumption. It's not enough, as we know. We need reminders to be good, places to reawaken awe, and something to awaken our kinder, less selfish impulses. Universal things which need tending like delicate flowers and rituals that bring us together. The choice isn’t between religion and a secular world as it is now. The challenge is to learn from religions, so we can fill the secular world with replacements for the things we long ago made up religion to provide (Giovanni, 2003).

The '''ARGUS-IS''', or the '''Autonomous Real-Time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance Imaging System''', is a [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) project contracted to [[BAE Systems]].

ARGUS is an advanced camera system that uses hundreds of cellphone cameras in a mosaic to video and auto-track every moving object within a 36 square mile area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-free-speech-national-security/drone-nightmare-scenario-now-has-physical|title=Drone 'Nightmare Scenario' Now Has A Name: ARGUS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARGUS is a form of wide-area persistent [[Surveillance|surveillance system]] that allows for one camera to provide such detailed video that users can collect "pattern-of-life" data and track individual people inside the footage anywhere within the field of regard. This is accomplished by utilizing air assets (manned aircraft, drones, blimps, aerostats) to persistently loiter and record video of a 36 square mile area with enough detail to track individual pedestrians, vehicles or other objects of interest as long as the air asset remains circling above.  Automatic object-tracking software called Persistics &lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=eb5dd436ac371ce79d91c84ec4e91341&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1&lt;/ref&gt; from the Lawrence Livermore labs allows users to auto-track every moving object within the field of regard (36 sq miles) and generate geolocation chronographs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcNURB1PWT0|title=Using 3D Scene Structure to Improve Tracking|first=|last=|date=21 February 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; of each individual vehicle and pedestrian's movements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iris.usc.edu/Outlines/papers/2012/prokaj-zhao-medioni-wasa-2012.pdf|title=Disclaimer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them searchable via geolocation query.

As ARGUS floats overhead for months at a time, it dragnet tracks every moving person and vehicle and chronographs their movements, allowing forensic investigators to rewind the footage and watch the activities of anyone they select within the footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://missions.llnl.gov/defense/persistics|title=Persistics Data Processing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARGUS is only one form of Wide Area Persistent Surveillance.  Other WAPS systems are already being used for domestic law enforcement&lt;ref&gt;http://persistentsurveillance.com/lawenforcement.html&lt;/ref&gt; across the USA including Persistent Surveillance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://persistentsurveillance.com/|title=Persistent Surveillance Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Dayton, Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/program-city-surveillance-dayton-412/|title=Ohio town wants to implement massive aerial surveillance program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vigilant Stare &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sncorp.com/pdfs/isr/vigilant_stare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328190151/http://sncorp.com/pdfs/isr/vigilant_stare.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Pixia's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-271748578.html|title=Pixia and PV Labs Join Forces on Commercially Operated Persistent Surveillance Solution.|date=5 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiper Stare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixia.com/solutions/stare.php|title=Hiper Stare - PIXIA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the government has not admitted to deploying ARGUS over the US, it has shown video in which ARGUS was used within the United States.  A variety of privacy advocacy groups including the ACLU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty-free-speech-national-security/report-details-governments-ability-analyze|title=Report Details Government's Ability to Analyze Massive Aerial Surveillance Video Streams|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/teamezazzu|title=Teame Zazzu - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teame Zazzu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP7XHOb8t7o|title=Wide Area Persistent Surveillance by Teame Zazzu|first=|last=|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; have worked to bring the domestic deployments of ARGUS and other WAPS systems into the public debate.

Traffic cameras, which were meant to help enforce traffic laws at intersections, have also sparked some controversy, due to their use by law enforcement agencies for purposes unrelated to traffic violations. These cameras also work as transit choke-points that allow individuals inside the vehicle to be positively identified and license plate data to be collected and time stamped for cross reference with airborne Wide Area Persistent Surveillance Systems used by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/teamezazzu/media_set?set=a.348706695241151.1073741830.100003054700769&amp;type=3|title=Teame Zazzu - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barnes–Hut simulation''' (Josh Barnes and [[Piet Hut]]) is an [[approximation algorithm]] for performing an [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]]. It is notable for having [[Big O notation|order]] O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Susanne Pfalzner ; Paul|title=Many-body tree methods in physics|date=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ.

The simulation volume is usually divided up into cubic cells via an [[octree]] (in a three-dimensional space), so that only [[Point particle|particles]] from nearby cells need to be treated individually, and particles in distant cells can be treated as a single large particle centered at the cell's [[center of mass]] (or as a low-order [[multipole expansion]]). This can dramatically reduce the number of particle pair interactions that must be computed.

== Algorithm ==

=== The Barnes–Hut tree ===
In a three-dimensional [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]], the Barnes–Hut algorithm [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] divides the ''n'' bodies into groups by storing them in an [[octree]] (or a [[quadtree|quad-tree]] in a 2D simulation). Each [[Node (graph theory)|node]] in this tree represents a region of the three-dimensional space. 
The topmost node represents the whole space, and its eight children represent the eight [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|octants]] of the space. The space is recursively subdivided into octants until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their octants). 
There are two types of nodes in the octree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the [[center of mass]] and the total mass of all its children bodies.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Calculating the force acting on a body ===
To calculate the [[net force]] on a particular body, the nodes of the tree are traversed, starting from the root. If the center of mass of an internal node is sufficiently far from the body, the bodies contained in that part of the tree are treated as a single particle whose position and mass is respectively the center of mass and total mass of the internal node. If the internal node is sufficiently close to the body, the process is repeated for each of its children.

Whether a node is or isn't sufficiently far away from a body, depends on the quotient &lt;math&gt;s/d&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the width of the region represented by the internal node, and ''d'' is the distance between the body and the node’s center of mass. The node is sufficiently far away when this ratio is smaller than a threshold value ''θ''. The parameter ''θ'' determines the accuracy of the simulation; larger values of ''θ'' increase the speed of the simulation but decreases its accuracy. If ''θ'' = 0, no internal node is treated as a single body and the algorithm degenerates to a direct-sum algorithm.

'''Bruce Maccabee''' (May 6, 1942) is an [[United States|American]] optical [[physicist]] formerly employed by the [[U.S. Navy]], and a leading [[ufologist]].&lt;ref&gt;Broad, William J - Urge To Investigate And Believe' Sparks New Interest In U.F.O.'S - The New York Times June 16, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

== Biography ==
Maccabee received a B.S. in [[physics]] at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in Worcester, Mass., and then at [[American University]], [[Washington, DC]], (M.S. and Ph.D. in physics).  In 1972 he began his career at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, White Oak, Silver Spring, Maryland; which later became the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division]].  Dr. Maccabee retired from government service in 2008.  He has worked on [[optical data processing]], generation of underwater sound with [[lasers]] and various aspects of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) and [[Ballistic Missile Defense]] (BMD) using high power lasers.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Richard - UFO Baffles Experts - NZ Northern News August 29, 2007 [https://archive.is/20130223105026/http://www.stuff.co.nz/northland/4181344a22378.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times - System to Produce Hydrogen From Waste Invented - NYT June 26, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ufology research ==
Maccabee has been an active ufologist since the late 1960s when he joined the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP) and was active in research and investigation for NICAP until its demise in 1980. He became a member of the [[Mutual UFO Network]] (MUFON) in 1975 and was subsequently appointed to the position of state Director for [[Maryland]], a position he still holds. In 1979 he was instrumental in establishing the [[Fund for UFO Research]] (FUFOR) and was the chairman for about 13 years. He presently serves on the National Board of the Fund.

His UFO research and investigations (which, he often stresses, are completely unrelated to his Navy work) have included the [[Kenneth Arnold unidentified flying object sighting|Kenneth Arnold sighting]] (June 24, 1947), the [[McMinnville, Oregon]] (Trent) photos of 1950, the [[Gemini 11]] astronaut photos of September, 1966, the [[Tehran UFO incident]] of September 1976, the New Zealand sightings of December 1978, the Japan Airlines (JAL1628) sighting of November 1986, the numerous sightings of [[Gulf Breeze UFO incident]], 1987–1988, the "red bubba" sightings, 1990-1992 (including his own sighting in September, 1991), the [[Mexico City]] video of August, 1997 (which he deemed a [[hoax]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://brumac.8k.com/MexCityAug697/MexCtySmearAnalysis.html Differential motion in the Mexico City video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801212857/http://brumac.8k.com/MexCityAug697/MexCtySmearAnalysis.html |date=2011-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Phoenix lights]] sightings of March 13, 1997, [[2004 Mexican UFO incident]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times -  Science Watch; Report on U.F.O.'s - NYT March 27, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times - .U.F.O. Files: The Untold Story - NYT October 14, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Los Angeles Times - UFO Believers Gather and Reveal That-Surprise-Aliens Are Here - NYT May 16, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also done historical research and was the first to obtain the secret "flying disc file" of the FBI (what he calls "the REAL [[X-Files]]"). In addition, he has collected documents from the [[CIA]], the [[U.S. Air Force]], the [[U.S. Army]], and other government agencies.

Maccabee is the author or coauthor of about three dozen technical articles and more than a hundred [[#Recent articles|UFO articles]] over the last 30 years, including many which appeared in the ''MUFON UFO Journal'' and MUFON Symposium proceedings. Among his papers was a reanalysis of the statistics and results of the famed [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] [[Project Blue Book]] Special Report No. 14, a massive analysis of 3200 Air Force cases through the mid-1950s. (See [[Identified Flying Objects (IFOs)]]).  Another was a reanalysis of the results of the [[Condon Committee]] UFO study from 1969. (Like many others, Maccabee concluded that [[Edward Condon]] lied about the results.)

In addition, he has also written or contributed to half a dozen [[#Books|books]] on the subject of UFOs and appeared on numerous radio and TV shows and documentaries ([[#Some media appearances|some given below]]) as an authority on the subject.

Maccabee is also an accomplished pianist who performed at the 1997 and 1999 MUFON symposia. He lives in [[Allen County, Ohio]] and married to Jan Maccabee.

{{merge|Copernican_Revolution#Nicolaus_Copernicus|date=June 2018}}
'''Copernican heliocentrism''' is the name given to the astronomical [[scientific modeling|model]] developed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and published in 1543. It positioned the [[Sun]] near the center of the [[Universe]], motionless, with [[Earth]] and the other [[planet]]s [[orbit]]ing around it in circular [[trajectory|paths]] modified by [[epicycle]]s and at uniform speeds. The Copernican model displaced the [[geocentric model]] of the [[Ptolemy]] that had prevailed for centuries, placing Earth at the center of the Universe. It is often regarded as the launching point to modern [[astronomy]] and the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus was aware that the ancient Greek [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] had already proposed a heliocentric theory, and cited him as a proponent of it in a reference that was deleted before publication, but there is no evidence that Copernicus had knowledge of, or access to, the specific details of Aristarchus' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, O. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1985JHA....16...37G "Did Copernicus Owe a Debt to Aristarchus?"] Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol.16, NO.1/FEB, pp.37, 39, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he had circulated an outline of his own heliocentric theory to colleagues sometime before 1514, he did not decide to publish it until he was urged to do so late in his life by his pupil [[Rheticus]]. Copernicus's challenge was to present a practical alternative to the Ptolemaic model by more elegantly and accurately determining the length of a solar year while preserving the [[Pythagoreanism|metaphysical]] implications of a mathematically ordered cosmos. Thus, his heliocentric model retained several of the Ptolemaic elements causing the inaccuracies, such as the planets' [[circular orbit]]s, epicycles, and uniform speeds,&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt; while at the same time re-introducing such innovations as:
::*Earth is one of several planets revolving around a stationary Sun in a determined order
::*Earth has three motions: daily rotation, annual revolution, and annual tilting of its axis
::*Retrograde motion of the planets is explained by Earth's motion
::*Distance from Earth to the Sun is small compared to the distance from the Sun to the stars.

===Antiquity===
[[Philolaus]] (4th century BCE) was one of the first to hypothesize movement of the Earth, probably inspired by [[Pythagoras]]' theories about a spherical, moving globe. [[Aristarchus of Samos]] in the 3rd century BCE had developed some theories of [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (speaking of a revolution by Earth on its axis) to propose what was, so far as is known, the first serious model of a heliocentric solar system. Though his original text has been lost, a reference in [[Archimedes]]' book ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' (''Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius &amp; Dimensio Circuli'') describes a work by Aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model.  Archimedes wrote:

{{quote|You (King Gelon) are aware the 'universe' is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the 'universe' just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the Floor, and that the sphere of the fixed [[star]]s, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Heath-1913|Heath (1913)]], [https://archive.org/stream/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft#page/302/mode/2up p. 302].&lt;/ref&gt;|''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''}}

It is a common idea that the heliocentric view was rejected by the contemporaries of Aristarchus. This is due to [[Gilles Ménage]]'s translation of a passage from [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon''. Plutarch reported that [[Cleanthes]] (a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics) as a worshipper of the Sun and opponent to the heliocentric model, was jokingly told by Aristarchus that he should be charged with impiety. Gilles Ménage, shortly after the trials of [[Galileo]] and [[Giordano Bruno]], amended an accusative (identifying the object of the verb) with a nominative (the subject of the sentence), and vice versa, so that the impiety accusation fell over the heliocentric sustainer. The resulting misconception of an isolated and persecuted Aristarchus is still transmitted today.&lt;ref&gt;Lucio Russo, Silvio M.

Copernicus cited Aristarchus and Philolaus in an early manuscript of his book which survives, stating: "Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, O. "Did Copernicus Owe a Debt to Aristarchus?" Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol.16, NO.1/FEB, P. 37, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons unknown (although possibly out of reluctance to quote pre-Christian sources), he did not include this passage in the publication of his book. Inspiration came to Copernicus not from observation of the planets, but from reading two authors. In [[Cicero]] he found an account of the theory of [[Hicetas]]. [[Plutarch]] provided an account of the [[Pythagoreans]] [[Heraclides Ponticus]], [[Philolaus]], and Ecphantes. These authors had proposed a moving Earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun. When Copernicus' book was published, it contained an unauthorized preface by the Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]]. This cleric stated that Copernicus wrote his heliocentric account of the Earth's movement as a mere mathematical hypothesis, not as an account that contained truth or even probability. Since Copernicus' hypothesis was believed to contradict the [[Old Testament]] account of the Sun's movement around the Earth ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12-13), this was apparently written to soften any religious backlash against the book. However, there is no evidence that Copernicus himself considered the heliocentric model as merely mathematically convenient, separate from reality.

Mathematical techniques developed in the 13th to 14th centuries by the Arab and Persian astronomers [[Mo'ayyeduddin al-Urdi]], [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], and [[Ibn al-Shatir]] for geocentric models of planetary motions closely resemble some of those used later by Copernicus in his heliocentric models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esposito|1999|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copernicus used what is now known as the [[Urdi lemma]] and the [[Tusi couple]] in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources.&lt;ref name=Saliba95&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = NYU Press| isbn = 9780814780237| last = Saliba| first = George| title = A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam| date = 1995-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the exact replacement of the [[equant]] by two [[epicycles]] used by Copernicus in the ''[[Commentariolus]]'' was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus.&lt;ref name=Swerdlow&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0003-049X| volume = 117| issue = 6| page = 424| last = Swerdlow| first = Noel M.| title = The Derivation and First Draft of Copernicus's Planetary Theory: A Translation of the Commentariolus with Commentary| journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society| date = 1973-12-31| jstor = 986461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Shatir's lunar and Mercury models are also identical to those of Copernicus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = Thomas Hockey | display-editors = etal | last = King | first = David A. | title=Ibn al‐Shāṭir: ʿAlāʾ al‐Dīn ʿAlī ibn Ibrāhīm | encyclopedia = The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers | publisher = Springer | date = 2007 | location = New York | pages = 569–70 | url=http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ibn_al-Shatir_BEA.htm | isbn=978-0-387-31022-0}} ([http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ibn_al-Shatir_BEA.pdf PDF version])&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some scholars to argue that Copernicus must have had access to some yet to be identified work on the ideas of those earlier astronomers.&lt;ref name="google42"&gt;Linton [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(2004]], pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 124],[https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 137–38)], Saliba [[#CITEREFSaliba2009|(2009, pp.160–65)]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, no likely candidate for this conjectured work has yet come to light, and other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name="google43"&gt;Goddu [[#CITEREFGoddu2010|(2010, pp.261–69, 476–86)]], Huff [[#CITEREFHuff2010|(2010]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=xNSPo_Xda_0C&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.263–64)], di Bono [[#CITEREFdi Bono1995|(1995)]], Veselovsky [[#CITEREFVeselovsky1973|(1973)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Copernicus cited some of the Islamic astronomers whose theories and observations he used in ''De Revolutionibus'', namely [[al-Battani]], [[Thabit ibn Qurra]], [[al-Zarqali]], [[Averroes]], and [[al-Bitruji]].&lt;ref name=freely&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 9781784531386| last = Freely| first = John| title = Light from the East: How the Science of Medieval Islam Helped to Shape the Western World| date = 2015-03-30| page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European scholars were well aware of the problems with Ptolemaic astronomy since the 13th century. The debate was precipitated by the [[Averroism|reception]] by [[Averroes]]' criticism of Ptolemy, and it was again revived by the recovery of Ptolemy's text and its translation into Latin in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref name="Osler Averoes"&gt;"Averroes' criticism of Ptolemaic astronomy precipitated this debate in Europe. [...] The recovery of Ptolemy's texts and their translation from Greek into Latin in the middle of the fifteenth century stimulated further consideration of these issues." Osler (2010), p.42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto E. Neugebauer]] in 1957 argued that the debate in 15th-century Latin scholarship must also have been informed by the criticism of Ptolemy produced after Averroes, by the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]]-era (13th to 14th centuries) Persian school of astronomy associated with the 
[[Maragheh observatory]] (especially the works of [[Al-Urdi]], [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Al-Tusi]] and [[Ibn al-Shatir]]).&lt;ref&gt;George Saliba (1979). "The First Non-Ptolemaic Astronomy at the Maraghah School", Isis 70 (4), p. 571-576.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of the question as received by Copernicus is summarized in the  ''Theoricae novae planetarum'' by  [[Georg von Peuerbach]], compiled from lecture notes by Peuerbach's student [[Regiomontanus]] in 1454 but printed only in 1472.
Peuerbach attempts to give a new, mathematically more elegant presentation of Ptolemy's system, but he does not arrive at heliocentrism. 
Regiomontanus himself was the teacher of [[Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara]], who was in turn the teacher of Copernicus.

There is a possibility that Regiomontanus already arrived at a theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, as he paid particular attention to the heliocentric theory of   [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] in a late work, and mentions the "motion of the Earth" in a letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler]], ''The Sleepwalkers'', Penguin Books, 1959, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ptolemaic system===
[[File:Ptolemaic system 2 (PSF).png|thumb|left|140px|Line art drawing of Ptolemaic system]]
{{Main|Geocentric model}}
The prevailing astronomical model of the cosmos in Europe in the 1,400 years leading up to the 16th century was that created by the Roman citizen [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'', dating from about 150 A.D. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] it was spoken of as the authoritative text on astronomy, although its author remained a little understood figure frequently mistaken as one of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic rulers]] of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-McCluskey-1998|McCluskey (1998), pp. 27]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ptolemaic system]] drew on many previous theories that viewed Earth as a stationary center of the universe. Stars were embedded in a large outer sphere which rotated relatively rapidly, while the planets dwelt in smaller spheres between—a separate one for each planet. To account for apparent anomalies in this view, such as the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets, a system of [[Deferent and epicycle|deferents and epicycles]] was used. The planet was said to revolve in a small circle (the epicycle) about a center, which itself revolved in a larger circle (the deferent) about a center on or near the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Koestler-1989|Koestler (1989), pp. 69-72]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A complementary theory to Ptolemy's employed homocentric spheres: the spheres within which the planets rotated could themselves rotate somewhat. This theory predated Ptolemy (it was first devised by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]; by the time of Copernicus it was associated with [[Averroes]]). Also popular with astronomers were variations such as [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentrics]]—by which the rotational axis was offset and not completely at the center.

Ptolemy's unique contribution to this theory was the [[equant]]—a point about which the center of a planet's epicycle moved with uniform angular velocity, but which was offset from the center of its deferent. This violated one of the fundamental principles of Aristotelian cosmology—namely, that the motions of the planets should be explained in terms of uniform circular motion, and was considered a serious defect by many medieval astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Gingerich-2004|Gingerich (2004), p. 53]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Copernicus's day, the most up-to-date version of the Ptolemaic system was that of [[Peurbach]] (1423–1461) and [[Regiomontanus]] (1436–1476).

==Copernican theory==
{{Further|Nicolaus Copernicus}}
[[File:De revolutionibus orbium coeleftium.jpg|250px|thumb|''Nicolai Copernicito Torinensis De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, Libri VI'' (''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, in six books'')  (title page of 2nd edition, Basel, 1566)]]
Copernicus' major work, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' - ''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'' (first edition 1543 in Nuremberg, second edition 1566 in [[Basel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Koestler-1989|Koestler (1989), p.194]]&lt;/ref&gt;), was published during the year of his death, though he had arrived at his theory several decades earlier. The book marks the beginning of the shift away from a [[geocentric universe|geocentric]] (and [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]) universe with the Earth at its center. Copernicus held that the Earth is another [[planet]] revolving around the fixed sun once a year, and turning on its [[Axis of rotation|axis]] once a day. But while Copernicus put the Sun at the center of the celestial spheres, he did not put it at the exact center of the universe, but near it. Copernicus' system used only uniform circular motions, correcting what was seen by many as the chief inelegance in Ptolemy's system.

The Copernican model replaced [[Ptolemy]]'s [[equant]] circles with more [[epicycles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Koestler-1989|Koestler (1989), pp. 579-80]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main reason that Copernicus' system had even more epicycles than Ptolemy's. The Copernican system can be summarized in several propositions, as Copernicus himself did in his early ''[[Commentariolus]]'' that he handed only to friends probably in the 1510s. The "little commentary" was never printed. Its existence was only known indirectly until a copy was discovered in Stockholm around 1880, and another in [[Vienna]] a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Gingerich-2004|Gingerich (2004), pp.31–32]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- &lt;/ref&gt; Gingerich (2004), pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; ---&gt;
The major features of Copernican theory are:
# Heavenly motions are uniform, eternal, and circular or compounded of several circles (epicycles).
# The center of the universe is near the Sun.
# Around the Sun, in order, are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars.
# The Earth has three motions: daily rotation, annual revolution, and annual tilting of its axis.
# Retrograde motion of the planets is explained by the Earth's motion.
# The distance from the Earth to the Sun is small compared to the distance to the stars.

===''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium''===

{{Main|De revolutionibus orbium coelestium}}
It opened with an originally anonymous preface by [[Andreas Osiander]], a theologian friend of Copernicus, who urged that the theory, which was considered a tool that allows simpler and more accurate calculations, did not necessarily have implications outside the limited realm of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Gingerich-2004|Gingerich (2004), p.139]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus' actual book began with a letter from his (by then deceased) friend [[Nikolaus von Schönberg]], Cardinal Archbishop of [[Capua]], urging Copernicus to publish his theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Koestler-1989|Koestler (1989), p.196]]&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in a lengthy introduction, Copernicus [[Dedication to Pope Paul III|dedicated the book]] to [[Pope Paul III]], explaining his ostensible motive in writing the book as relating to the inability of earlier astronomers to agree on an adequate theory of the planets, and noting that if his system increased the accuracy of astronomical predictions it would allow the Church to develop a more accurate calendar. At that time, a reform of the [[Julian calendar#From Julian to Gregorian|Julian Calendar]] was considered necessary and was one of the major reasons for the Church's interest in astronomy.

The work itself was then divided into six books:&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

# General vision of the heliocentric theory, and a summarized exposition of his idea of the World.
# Mainly theoretical, presents the principles of spherical astronomy and a list of stars (as a basis for the arguments developed in the subsequent books).
# Mainly dedicated to the apparent motions of the Sun and to related phenomena.
# Description of the Moon and its orbital motions.
# Concrete exposition of the new system including planetary longitude.
# Further concrete exposition of the new system including planetary latitude.

==Copernican Revolution==

[[File:Kraków - Pomnik Mikołaja Kopernika 02.JPG|thumb|left|230px|Statue of Copernicus next to [[Jagiellonian University|Cracow University]]'s ''Collegium Novum'']]
From publication until about 1700, few astronomers were convinced by the Copernican system, though the book was relatively widely circulated (around 500 copies of the first and second editions have survived,&lt;ref name=census&gt;[[#Reference-Gingerich-2004|Gingerich (2004), p.248]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a large number by the scientific standards of the time). Few of Copernicus' contemporaries were ready to concede that the Earth actually moved, although [[Erasmus Reinhold]] used Copernicus' parameters to produce the [[Prutenic Tables]]. However, these tables translated Copernicus' mathematical methods back into a geocentric system, rejecting [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] on physical and theological grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hanne Andersen, Peter Barker, and Xiang Chen. ''The Cognitive Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. pp 138-148&lt;/ref&gt; The Prutenic tables came to be preferred by Prussian and German astronomers. The degree of improved accuracy of these tables remains an open question, but their usage of Copernican ideas led to more serious consideration of a heliocentric model. However, even forty-five years after the publication of ''De Revolutionibus'', the astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] went so far as to construct a cosmology precisely equivalent to that of Copernicus, but with the Earth held fixed in the center of the celestial sphere instead of the Sun.&lt;ref name="tychonic system"&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1985|pages=200–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was another generation before a community of practicing astronomers appeared who accepted heliocentric cosmology.

From a modern point of view, the Copernican model has a number of advantages. It accurately predicts the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, although this meant abandoning the cherished Aristotelian idea that there is no empty space between the planetary spheres. Copernicus also gave a clear account of the cause of the seasons: that the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. In addition, Copernicus's theory provided a strikingly simple explanation for the apparent retrograde motions of the planets—namely as [[parallax|parallactic]] displacements resulting from the Earth's motion around the Sun—an important consideration in [[Johannes Kepler]]'s conviction that the theory was substantially correct.&lt;ref&gt;[[Copernican heliocentrism#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton]] (2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA138 pp.138], [https://books.google.com/books?id=aJuwFLGWKF8C&amp;pg=PA169 169]), [[Copernican heliocentrism#Reference-Crowe-2001|Crowe]] (2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IGlhN0MI87oC&amp;pg=PA90 pp.90–92])&lt;!--- pp.92-94 in the 1990 edition --&gt;, {{harvnb|Kuhn|1985|pages=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the heliocentric model the planets' apparent retrograde motions' occurring at opposition to the Sun are a natural consequence of their heliocentric orbits.  In the geocentic model, however, these are explained by the [[ad hoc]] use of [[epicycles]], whose revolutions are mysteriously tied to that of the Sun's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gingerich|2011|pages= 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for his contemporaries, the ideas presented by Copernicus were not markedly easier to use than the geocentric theory and did not produce more accurate predictions of planetary positions. Copernicus was aware of this and could not present any observational "proof", relying instead on arguments about what would be a more complete and elegant system. The Copernican model appeared to be contrary to common sense and to contradict the Bible. Tycho Brahe's arguments against Copernicus are illustrative of the physical, theological, and even astronomical grounds on which heliocentric cosmology was rejected.  Tycho, arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, appreciated the elegance of the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The [[Aristotelian physics]] of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, but could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort of substance called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that moved naturally.  So Tycho said that the Copernican system “... expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.”&lt;ref&gt;Owen Gingerich, ''The eye of heaven: Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler'', New York: American Institute of Physics, 1993, 181, {{ISBN|0-88318-863-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Copernicus had assumed in order to explain why the Earth's motion produced no visible changes in the appearance of the fixed stars (known as annual [[stellar parallax]]). Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory&amp;nbsp;– see stellar [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (the size of Earth's orbit or larger, and thus much larger than the sun). Regarding this Tycho wrote, “Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=Ann |title=Tycho Brahe's critique of Copernicus and the Copernican system |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=51 |issue=3 |year=1990 |pages=355–377 [p. 364] |jstor=2709620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said his [[Tychonic system]], which incorporated Copernican features into a geocentric system, “offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture”.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, O. &amp; Voelkel, J. R., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JHA....29....1G# ''J. Hist. Astron.'', Vol. 29, 1998], page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus many astronomers accepted some aspects of Copernicus's theory at the expense of others.  His model did have a large influence on later scientists such as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], who adopted, championed and (especially in Kepler's case) sought to improve it. However, in the years following publication of ''de Revolutionibus'', for leading astronomers such as Erasmus Reinhold, the key attraction of Copernicus's ideas was that they reinstated the idea of uniform circular motion for the planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Gingerich-2004|Gingerich (2004), pp.23, 55]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, 2004, p. 23 and p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

During the 17th century, several further discoveries eventually led to the wider acceptance of heliocentrism:
* Using the newly invented [[telescope]], [[Galileo]] discovered the four large moons of Jupiter (evidence that the solar system contained bodies that did not orbit Earth), the phases of Venus (the first observational evidence not properly explained by the Ptolemaic theory) and the rotation of the Sun about a fixed axis&lt;ref name="fixed axis"&gt;Fixed, that is, in the Copernican system. In a geostatic system the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots could only be explained as the result of an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(Linton, 2004, p.212;]] [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt, 1994, p.166;]] [[#Reference-Drake-1970|Drake, 1970, pp.191–196)]]&lt;/ref&gt; as indicated by the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots;
* With a telescope, [[Giovanni Zupi]] saw the phases of Mercury in 1639;
* Kepler in 1609 introduced the idea that the orbits of the planets were elliptical rather than circular, while retaining the heliocentric concept.
* [[Isaac Newton]] in 1687 proposed [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravity]] and the [[inverse-square law]] of gravitational attraction to explain Kepler's elliptical planetary orbits.

In 1725, [[James Bradley]] discovered [[aberration of light|stellar aberration]], an apparent annual motion of stars around small ellipses, and attributed it to the finite [[speed of light]] and the motion of Earth in its orbit around the Sun.&lt;ref name="Hirshfeld"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirschfeld |first=Alan |title=Parallax:The Race to Measure the Cosmos |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-7133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, [[Friedrich Bessel]] made the first successful measurements of annual parallax for the star 61 Cygni, of 0.314 arcseconds; which indicated that the star was 10.3 ly away, close to the currently accepted value of 11.4 ly. He narrowly beat Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson, who measured the parallaxes of Vega and Alpha Centauri in the same year.

==Modern historiography==
Whether Copernicus' propositions were "revolutionary" or "conservative" has been a topic of debate in  the [[historiography of science]].
In his book ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe]]'' (1959), [[Arthur Koestler]] attempted to deconstruct the Copernican "revolution" by portraying Copernicus  as a coward who was reluctant to publish his work due to a crippling fear of ridicule.
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that Copernicus only transferred "some properties to the Sun's &lt;!-- ?? --&gt; many astronomical functions previously attributed to the earth."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Other historians{{who|date=April 2017}} have since argued that Kuhn underestimated what was "revolutionary" about Copernicus' work, and emphasized the difficulty Copernicus would have had in putting forward a new astronomical theory relying alone on simplicity in geometry, given that he had no experimental evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3665">The '''DGP model''' is a model of [[gravity]] proposed by [[Gia Dvali]], [[Gregory Gabadadze]], and [[Massimo Porrati]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gia Dvali |author2=Gregory Gabadadze |author3=Massimo Porrati | title=4D gravity on a brane in 5D Minkowski space | year = 2000 | journal = Physics Letters | volume=B485 | issue=1–3 | pages=208–214 | arxiv=hep-th/0005016 | doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(00)00669-9|bibcode = 2000PhLB..485..208D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model is popular among some [[model building (particle physics)|model builders]], but has resisted being embedded into [[string theory]].

==Overview==
The DGP model assumes the existence of a 4+1-dimensional [[Minkowski space]], within which ordinary 3+1-dimensional Minkowski space is embedded.  The model assumes an [[action (physics)|action]] consisting of two terms: One term is the usual [[Einstein–Hilbert action]], which involves only the 4-D [[spacetime]] dimensions.  The other term is the equivalent of the Einstein–Hilbert action, as extended to all 5 dimensions.  The 4-D term dominates at short distances, and the 5-D term dominates at long distances.

The model was proposed in part in order to reproduce the [[cosmic acceleration]] of [[dark energy]] without any need for a small but non-zero [[vacuum energy]] density. But critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dimitry | last = Gorbunov |author2=Koyama, Kazuya |author3=Sibiryakov, Sergei | year = 2006 | title = More on ghosts in the Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati model | bibcode = 2006PhRvD..73d4016G | journal = Physical Review | volume =D73 | issue = 4 | pages = 044016 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.73.044016|arxiv = hep-th/0512097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that this branch of the theory is unstable. However, the theory remains interesting because of Dvali's claim that the unusual structure of the graviton [[propagator]] makes non-perturbative effects important in a seemingly linear regime, such as the solar system. Because there is no four-dimensional, linearized [[effective field theory|effective theory]] that reproduces the DGP model for weak-field gravity, the theory avoids the [[vDVZ discontinuity]] that otherwise plagues attempts to write down a theory of massive gravity.

In 2008, Fang ''et al.'' argued that recent cosmological observations (including measurements of [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], and measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] and [[type 1a supernovae]]) is in direct conflict with the DGP cosmology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wenjuan Fang |author2=Sheng Wang |author3=Wayne Hu |author4=Zoltán Haiman |author5=Lam Hui |author6=Morgan May | title=Challenges to the DGP model from horizon-scale growth and geometry | year = 2008 | journal = Physical Review | volume=D78 | issue=10 | pages=103509 | arxiv=0808.2208 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.103509|bibcode = 2008PhRvD..78j3509F }}&lt;/ref&gt; unless a [[cosmological constant]] or some other form of dark energy is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lucas Lombriser |author2=Wayne Hu |author3=Wenjuan Fang |author4=Uroš Seljak | title=Cosmological constraints on DGP braneworld gravity with brane tension | year = 2009 | journal = Physical Review | volume=D80 | issue=6 | pages=063536 | arxiv=0905.1112 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.80.063536|bibcode = 2009PhRvD..80f3536L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this negates the appeal of the DGP cosmology, which accelerates without needing to add dark energy.

'''Dale Alan Russell''' (born 27 December 1937) is an American-Canadian geologist and palaeontologist. He is currently Research Professor at the Department of Marine Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (MEAS) at [[North Carolina State University]]. Dinosaurs he has described include ''[[Daspletosaurus]]'', and he was amongst the first paleontologists to consider an extraterrestrial cause (supernova, comet, asteroid) for the [[extinction of the dinosaurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dale &amp; Tucker, Wallace (19 February 1971). "Supernovae and the Extinction of the Dinosaurs." ''Nature'' 229:553-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Russell created the "[[dinosauroid]]" [[thought experiment]], which speculated an evolutionary path for ''[[Troodon]]'' if it had not gone extinct in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 65 million years ago, and had instead evolved into an intelligent being. Russell commissioned a model of his dinosauroid by artist Ron Sequin, and the concept became popular. Various later anthropologists have continued Russell's speculations about intelligent ''Troodon''-like dinosaurs, though they often find his original idea too anthropomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Hecht (9 July 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10778">The '''defensible space theory''' of architect and city planner '''Oscar Newman''' encompasses ideas about crime prevention and neighborhood safety.  The theory developed in the early 1970s, and he wrote his first book on the topic, ''Defensible Space'' in 1972.  The book contains a study from New York that pointed out that higher crime rate existed in high-rise apartment buildings than in lower [[Public housing|housing projects]].  This, he concluded, was because residents felt no control or personal responsibility for an area occupied by so many people.  Throughout his study, Newman focused on explaining his ideas on [[social control]], [[crime prevention]], and public health in relation to community design.

== Theory ==
As defined in Newman's book ''Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space'', defensible space is "a residential environment whose physical characteristics—building layout and site plan—function to allow inhabitants themselves to become key agents in ensuring their security."&lt;ref name="Ph.D2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sridevi Rao, Ph.D|title=A Measure of Community: Public Open Space and Sustainable Development Goal 11.7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCKeDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176|date=4 July 2016|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-945497-88-9|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to explain that a [[Subdivision (land)|housing development]] is only defensible if residents intend to adopt this role, which is defined by good design: "Defensible space therefore is a sociophysical phenomenon," says Newman.&lt;ref name="Palidda2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Palidda|title=Governance of Security and Ignored Insecurities in Contemporary Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz77CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=14 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-12589-1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both society and physical elements are parts of a successful defensible space.&lt;ref name="Palidda2016" /&gt;

The theory argues that an area is safer when people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for that piece of a community.  Newman asserts that "the criminal is isolated because his turf is removed" when each space in an area is owned and cared for by a responsible party.&lt;ref name="Newman1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Newman|title=Creating Defensible Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80w0GEh4ffEC&amp;pg=PA2|year=1966|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-4528-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an intruder can sense a watchful community, he feels less secure committing his crime.  The idea is that crime and delinquency can be controlled and mitigated through [[environmental design]].&lt;ref name="Ross2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Ian Ross|title=Encyclopedia of Street Crime in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6GVECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131|date=1 March 2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-5063-2028-1|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassidy2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Cassidy|title=Environmental Psychology: Behaviour and Experience In Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0b3eAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-47209-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five factors that make a defensible space:&lt;ref name="Marshall2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Molly Marshall|title=OCR Psychology Student Guide 3: Component 3 Applied psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TjEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48|date=22 August 2016|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=978-1-4718-5948-9|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Territoriality – the idea that one's home is sacred
#Natural surveillance – the link between an area's physical characteristics and the residents' ability to see what is happening
#Image – the capacity of the physical design to impart a sense of security
#Milieu – other features that may affect security, such as proximity to a police substation or busy commercial area
#Safe Adjoining Areas - for better security, residents obtain higher ability of surveillance of adjoining area through designing the adjoining area 

The concept of defensible space is controversial. A [[United States Department of Justice]] experiment in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] closed streets and assigned police teams to certain neighborhoods. New public housing projects were designed around ideas of limited access to the city, but Hartford did not show any dramatic drop in crime.&lt;ref name="Benson1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce L. Benson|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyATCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=August 1998|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the [[private place]]s of St. Louis do have much lower crime than public streets. The reason appears to be that in St. Louis, people had the capacity and incentives to defend their defensible spaces. Residents had the right to ask an unwelcome individual (i.e. not a resident or guest) to leave their street, because they jointly owned it. On public streets, one cannot legally act against someone until they have committed a crime.

== Intention ==

The intention of physical features is to create a sense of [[Land ownership|territorialism]] in community members which will ensure a safe living environment for those that care for it.  Defensible space works with a hierarchy of living and community spaces.  According to the theory, housing developments that evoke territorialism are “the strongest deterrents to criminal and vandal activity.”  Housing should be grouped in such a way that members feel a mutual benefit.  Also to deter crime, areas should be defined for function, paths should be defined for movement, outdoor areas should be juxtaposed with homes, and indoor spaces should visually provide for close watch of outside areas.  

Newman holds that through good design, people should not only feel comfortable questioning what is happening in their surroundings, but they should feel obligated to do so.  Any intruder should be able to sense the existence of a watchful community and avoid the situation altogether.  Criminals fear the likelihood that a resident, upon viewing the intrusion, would then question their actions.  This is highly effective in neighborhoods that cannot afford a professional [[Neighborhood watch|crime watch]]. 

The defensible space theory is applicable to any type of planned space.  From low density housing to high rises, the key is the development of a communal area in which residents can “extend the realm of their homes and the zone of felt responsibility.”  Circulation paths and common entry are important aspects of defensible design as well.  Residents must also feel a need to extend their protective attitudes to locations where property and urban streets and surroundings connect.  The interfacing between private property and community space should be protected similarly.
    
Newman’s intent in creating the principles of defensible space is to give the residents of a community control of [[public space]]s that they formerly felt were out of reach.  In effect, residents care enough for their area to protect it from crime as they would protect their own private property.

=== Principles ===

Oscar Newman’s basic five principles of designing defensible space as quoted in Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space are as follows:

#The assignment to different resident groups the specific environments they are best able to utilize and control, as determined by their ages, life-styles, socializing proclivities, backgrounds, incomes, and family structures.
#The territorial definition of space in residential developments to reflect the zone of influence of specific inhabitants.  Residential environments should be subdivided into zones toward which adjacent residents can easily adopt proprietary attitudes.
#The juxtaposition of dwelling interiors with exterior spaces and the placement of windows to allow residents to naturally survey the exterior and interior public areas of their living environments and the areas assigned for their use.
#The juxtaposition of dwellings—their entries and amenities—with city streets so as to incorporate the streets within the sphere of influence of the residential environment.
#The adoption of building forms and idioms that avoids the stigma of peculiarity that allows others to perceive the vulnerability and isolation of a particular group of inhabitants.

To create a defensible space community, residential areas should be subdivided into smaller entities of similar families because control is enhanced.  Responsibility for the area is more easily assumed in a smaller group of families as opposed to a larger [[community]].  Smaller groups more frequently use an area geared toward them.  The number of activities in the space is increased; thus, a feeling of ownership and a need to protect the property follows.  On the other hand, when larger groups use a community space, no one has control over the area, and an agreement over its acceptable uses is often in dispute.

== Today ==
The defensible space theory was largely popular in city design from its emergence until the 1980s.{{cn|date=September 2015}} Some of his basic ideas are still taken into consideration presently, and all contemporary approaches and discussions of the relationship between crime and house design use Newman's theory as a critical point of reference.&lt;ref name="Reynald et al"&gt;Reynald, D.M. and Elffers, H., 2009. The future of Newman's Defensible Space Theory: Linking Defensible Space and the routine activities of place. ''European Journal of Criminology, 6''(1), pp.25-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Although modifications were made to the original theory in the 1980s,&lt;ref name="Reynald et al" /&gt; Newman's basic principles still exist in design, and have been used by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] as "both a criminological concept and a proven strategy for enhancing our Nation's quality of life".&lt;ref name="Newman1966" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==

In the [[HBO]] miniseries [[Show Me a Hero]], Newman, a recurring character, articulates his theory of defensible space to Judge Sand as they are trying to plan where to place two hundred new units of desegregated public housing in the city of [[Yonkers, New York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">'''ELODIE''' was an [[echelle grating|echelle]] type [[spectrograph]] installed at the [[Observatoire de Haute-Provence]] 1.93m [[reflector telescope|reflector]] in south-eastern [[France]] for the [http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/planet/elodie.html Northern Extrasolar Planet Search]. Its optical instrumentation was developed by André Baranne from the [[Marseille Observatory]]. The purpose of this instrument was [[extrasolar planet]] detection by the [[radial velocity method]]. This instrument was also used for the [http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/planet/Mdwarf.html M-Dwarf Programmes].

ELODIE [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] was achieved in 1993. ELODIE was decommissioned in August 2006 and replaced in September 2006 by [[SOPHIE échelle spectrograph|SOPHIE]], a new instrument of the same type but with improved features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00159126/en/ The ELODIE-SOPHIE Archive in the Virtual Observatory],  S. Ilovaisky, Ph. Prugniel, C. Soubiran, M. Koleva, and H.

Accessed on line June 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The [[electromagnetic spectrum]] [[wavelength]] range is 389.5&amp;nbsp;nm to 681.5&amp;nbsp;nm in a single exposure, split into 67 [[spectral orders]]. The instrument, which was located in a temperature-controlled room, was fed with [[optical fibers]] from the [[Cassegrain focus]]. One of the unique features of ELODIE was an integrated data reduction pipeline which fully reduces the [[spectrum|spectra]] immediately after acquisition and allows the user to measure highly accurate [[radial velocity|radial velocities]] through cross-correlation with a numerical mask. This accuracy can reach ±7&amp;nbsp;m/s.

Over 34,000 spectra have been taken with this instrument so far, over 20,000 of which are publicly available through a dedicated on-line archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.obs-hp.fr/elodie/ The ELODIE archive].  Accessed on line June 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  ELODIE was the result of a collaboration between the observatories of Haute-Provence, [[Observatory of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Marseilles Observatory|Marseille]].  A publication describing the instrument appeared in ''[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Supplements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;ELODIE: A spectrograph for accurate radial velocity measurements, A. Baranne et al., ''Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement'' '''119''' (October 1996), pp.373&amp;ndash;390.  {{Bibcode|1996A&amp;AS..119..373B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovered planets ==

The  first [[extrasolar planet]] to be discovered orbiting a Sun-like star, [[51 Pegasi b]], was discovered in 1995 using this instrument.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal | url= | author=Mayor | title=A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=378 |issue=6555 |year=1995 | pages=355–359| doi=10.1038/378355a0| format= | last2= Queloz | first2= Didier | bibcode=1995Natur.378..355M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over twenty such planets have been found with ELODIE. This instrument was also used to find a planet by the [[transit method]].&lt;ref name="transit"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1968">The '''Ekman number''' ('''Ek''') is a [[dimensionless number]] used in fluid dynamics to describe the ratio of [[viscosity|viscous]] forces to [[Coriolis force]]s. It is frequently used in describing [[geophysics|geophysical]] phenomena in the [[oceans]] and [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] in order to characterise the ratio of viscous forces to the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis forces]] arising from [[planet]]ary [[rotation]]. It is named after the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[oceanographer]] [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]].

When the Ekman number is small, disturbances are able to propagate before decaying owing to low frictional effects. The Ekman number also describes the order of magnitude for the thickness of an [[Ekman layer]], a [[boundary layer]] in which viscous diffusion is balanced by Coriolis effects, rather than the usual convective [[inertia]].

==Definitions==
It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ek}=\frac{\nu}{2D^2\Omega\sin\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;

- where ''D'' is a characteristic (usually vertical) length scale of a phenomenon; ''&amp;nu;'', the kinematic [[eddy viscosity]]; &amp;Omega;, the [[angular velocity]] of [[planet]]ary [[rotation]]; and &amp;phi;, the [[latitude]]. The term 2 &amp;Omega; sin &amp;phi; is the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis frequency]].
It is given in terms of the kinematic viscosity, ''&amp;nu;''; the angular velocity, &amp;Omega;; and a characteristic length scale, ''L''.

There do appear to be some differing conventions in the literature.

[[David Tritton|Tritton]] gives:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Ek} = \frac{\nu}{\Omega L^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, the NRL Plasma Formulary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipp.mpg.de/~dpc/nrl/23.html&lt;/ref&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Ek} = \sqrt{\frac{\nu}{2\Omega L^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{Ro}}{\mathrm{Re}}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

where Ro is the [[Rossby number]] and Re is the [[Reynolds number]].

'''Exogamous group''' is a section of society within which marriages are prohibited. A marriage within an exogamous group is regarded as incestuous.

Examples of exogamous groups are: 

* [[Gotra]]s and [[Clan]]s  in the castes in India.
* "Fis" among the [[Albanians]]
* The [[Oroqen people]], one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]]
* Individuals with the same last name in China, or [[Chinese surname]], [[Chinese clan]]

--&gt;
Polynesians reached nearly all the Pacific islands by about 1200 AD, followed by Asian navigation in Southeast Asia and West Pacific. Around the Middle Ages Muslim traders linked the Middle East and East Africa to the Asian Pacific coasts (to southern China and much of the Malay Archipelago). The direct contact of European fleets with the Pacific began in 1512, with the Portuguese, on its western edges, followed by the Spanish discovery of the Pacific from the American coast.

In 1521 a Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] was the first known crossing of the [[Pacific Ocean]], who then named it the "peaceful sea". Starting in 1565 with the voyage of [[Andres de Urdaneta]] and for the next 250 years, the Spanish controlled the transpacific trade with the [[Manila galleons]] that crossed from [[Mexico]] to the [[Philippines]] and vice versa, until 1815. Other expeditions from Mexico and Peru discovered various archipelagos in the [[North Pacific|North]] and [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. In the 17th and 18th centuries, other European powers sent expeditions to the Pacific, namely the [[Dutch Republic]], [[England]], [[France]], and [[Russia]].

==Pre-European exploration==
{{see also|Models of migration to the New World}}
[[File:Polynesian Migration.svg|right|thumb|300px|Polynesian expansion]]

Humans reached Australia by at least 40,000 BC which implies some degree of water crossing. People were in the Americas before 10,000 BC. One theory holds that they travelled along the coast by canoe.

===Polynesians===
About 3000 BC speakers of the [[Austronesian languages]], probably on the island of Taiwan, mastered the art of long-distance canoe travel and spread themselves, or their languages, south to the Philippines and Indonesia and east to the islands of [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]]. The Polynesians branched off and occupied [[Polynesia]] to the east. Dates and routes are uncertain, but they seem to have started from the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], went west past [[Fiji]] to [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]] about 1500 BC. By 100 AD they were in the [[Marquesas Islands]] and 300-800 AD in [[Tahiti]] (Tahiti is west of the Marquesas.) 300-800 AD is also given for their arrival at [[Easter Island]], their easternmost point and the same date range for [[Hawaii]], which is far to the north and distant from other islands. Far to the southwest, New Zealand was reached about 1250 AD. The [[Chatham Islands]], about 500 miles east of New Zealand were reached about 1500. The fact that some Polynesians possessed the South American [[Sweet potato]] implies that they may have reached the Americas or, conversely, that people from the Americas may have reached Polynesia.  [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s ''[[Kon-Tiki]]'' expedition successfully demonstrated that the trip from the Americas to Polynesia using only materials and technology available at the time was at least possible.

===Others===
On the Asian side long-distance trade developed all along the coast from Mozambique to Japan. Trade, and therefore knowledge, extended to the Indonesian Islands but apparently not Australia. By at the latest 878 when there was a significant Islamic settlement in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] much of this trade was controlled by Arabs or Muslims. In 219 BC [[Xu Fu]] sailed out into the Pacific searching for the elixir of immortality. From 1404-33 [[Zheng He]] led [[Treasure voyages|expeditions into the Indian Ocean]].

An interesting issue is Japanese fishing boats. If one was blown out to sea and lacked proper equipment it could be carried by the current all the way to North America. Japanese boats reached Acapulco in 1617, the Aleutians in 1782, Alaska in 1805, the mouth of the Columbia River in 1820, and Cape Flattery in 1833. Such trips may have taken place before Europeans were present in those areas to make detailed records of them.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Derek. ''Historical Atlas of the North Pacific'', page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==European exploration==
===Iberian pioneers===
The first contact of European navigators with the western edge of the Pacific Ocean was made by the Portuguese expeditions of [[António de Abreu]] and [[Francisco Serrão]], via the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], to the [[Maluku Islands]], in 1512,&lt;ref&gt;Hannard (1991), page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milton|first=Giles|authorlink=Giles Milton|title=Nathaniel's Nutmeg|publisher=Sceptre|date=1999|location=London|pages=5, 7|isbn=978-0-340-69676-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Jorge Álvares]]'s expedition to southern China in 1513,&lt;ref name="Porter, Jonathan 1996"&gt;Porter, Jonathan.

Westview Press.  {{ISBN|0-8133-3749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; both ordered by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] from [[Malacca]].

Spanish explorer [[Vasco Nuñez de Balboa|Balboa]] was the first European to sight the Pacific from America in 1513 after his expedition crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached a new ocean.&lt;ref name="Ober"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ober|first=Frederick Albion|title=Vasco Nuñez de Balboa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98zUIbdvAYgC&amp;pg=PT129|accessdate=12 June 2013|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=978-1-4655-7034-5|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named it ''Mar del Sur'' (literally, "Sea of the South" or "South Sea") because the ocean was to the south of the coast of the isthmus where he first observed the Pacific. Later, Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] sailed the Pacific East to West on a Castilian (''Spanish'') expedition of world [[circumnavigation]] starting in 1519. Magellan called the ocean ''Pacífico'' (or "Pacific" meaning, "peaceful") because, after sailing through the stormy seas off [[Cape Horn]], the expedition found calm waters. The ocean was often called the ''Sea of Magellan'' in his honor until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Camino, Mercedes Maroto. ''Producing the Pacific: Maps and Narratives of Spanish Exploration (1567–1606)'', p.76. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1565 to 1815, a Spanish transpacific route known as the [[Manila galleons]] regularly crossed from Mexico to the [[Philippines]] and back. On the Asian side the Portuguese and later the Dutch built a regular trade from the East Indies to Japan. On the American side Spanish power stretched thousands of miles from Mexico to Chile. The vast central Pacific was visited only by the Manila galleons and an occasional explorer. The south Pacific was first crossed by Spanish expeditions in the 16th century who discovered many islands including [[Tuvalu]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and the [[Admiralty Islands]], and later the [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]] and [[Vanuatu]] archipelagos.&lt;ref name="Fernandez-Armesto 2006 305–307"&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |date= 2006 |publisher= W.W.

[[File:SpanishPacific.svg|thumb|350px|Spanish explorations and routes across the Pacific Ocean.]]

'''The Pacific recognized:''' Europeans knew that there was a vast ocean to the west, and the Chinese knew that there was one to the east. Learned Europeans thought that the world was round and that the two oceans were one. In 1492 Columbus sailed west to what he thought was Asia. When [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], en route to Asia via the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, reached Brazil, in 1500, the true extent of the Americas began to become known. The [[Martin Waldseemüller]] map of 1507 was the first to show the Americas separating two distinct oceans. This guess was confirmed in 1513 when Balboa crossed Panama and found salt water. The Magellan expedition of 1519-22 proved that there was one continuous ocean from the Americas to Asia. The [[Diogo Ribeiro]] map of 1529 was the first to show the Pacific at about its proper size.

'''The coast of Asia:''' The first European to see the Pacific Ocean was probably [[Marco Polo]] about 1292. The Portuguese [[Vasco da Gama|reached India]] in 1498, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquered Malacca]] in 1511 and in 1512 [[António de Abreu]] and [[Francisco Serrão]] reached the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]] reached southern China and in the same year Balboa crossed Panama. In 1525 [[Diogo da Rocha]] and [[Gomes de Sequeira]] reached the [[Caroline Islands]], and [[Jorge de Menezes]] in 1526-27 landed on the ''Islands of Don Jorge de Menezes'', in the northwest coast of [[New Guinea]] (now part of [[Indonesia]]), and named the region ''Ilhas dos Papuas'' and is thus credited with the European ''discovery'' of [[New Guinea|Papua]]. In 1542 [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]] reached Japan. From about 1543 until 1614, the Portuguese monopolize the trade between China and Japan, through the [[nanban trade]]. In 1589, [[João da Gama]] reached [[Hokkaido]] and possibly sighted the [[Kuril islands]], crossing the Pacific further north of the routes usually taken until then. The land that he eventually discovered northeast of Japan, has since become a matter of legend and controversy.  

One hundred years after the Spanish and Portuguese the Dutch Republic began its remarkable expansion. The Dutch reached the East Indies in 1596, the Spice Islands in 1602 and in 1619 founded [[Jakarta Old Town|Batavia]]. In 1600 [[William Adams (sailor)|a Dutch fleet]] reached Japan from the Strait of Magellan. The Dutch had little success in China but established themselves at [[Hirado, Nagasaki]] in 1609 and monopolized the Japan trade from 1639. In 1639 [[Matthijs Quast]] and [[Abel Tasman]] searched the empty ocean east of Japan looking for two islands called 'Rica de Oro' and 'Rica de Plata'. In 1643 [[Maarten Gerritsz Vries]] reached and charted [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]]. In 1653 [[Hendrick Hamel]] was shipwrecked in Korea. At about this time the Russians reached the Pacific overland via Siberia (see below). It is significant that the Russian and Dutch trades were never linked since Siberian furs might easily have been exported to China at great profit.

[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|250px|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and Spanish trade routes (white)]]
'''Magellan and the Manila Galleons:''' In 1519 [[Ferdinand Magellan]] sailed down the east coast of South America, found and sailed through the [[Strait of Magellan|strait that bears his name]] and on 28 November 1520 entered the Pacific. He then sailed north and caught the [[trade winds]] which carried him across the Pacific to the Philippines where he was killed. [[Juan Sebastián Elcano|One surviving ship]] returned west across the Indian Ocean and [[Trinidad (ship)|the other]] went north in the hope of finding the [[westerlies]] and reaching Mexico. Unable to find the right winds, it was forced to return to the East Indies. In 1565 (44 years later) [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] found a wind system that would reliably blow a ship eastward back to the Americas. From then until 1815 the annual [[Manila Galleons]] crossed the Pacific from Mexico to the Philippines and back, exchanging Mexican silver for spices and porcelain. Until the time of Captain Cook these were the only large ships to regularly cross the  Pacific. The route was purely commercial and there was no exploration of the areas to the north and south. In 1668 the Spanish founded a colony on [[Guam]] as a resting place for west-bound galleons. For a long time this was the only non-coastal European settlement in the Pacific.

'''South America:''' In 1513, six years before Magellan, Spanish explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the Isthmus of Panama and saw the Pacific Ocean. In 1517-18 two ships were built on the Pacific coast. In 1522 [[Pascual de Andagoya]] sailed the coast as far as Ecuador. In 1532 [[Francisco Pizarro]] conquered Peru. A regular trade developed that carried Peruvian silver up the coast to Panama where it was carried overland to the Caribbean and part to Spain. Spanish settlement extended as far south as central Chile. In 1557-8 [[Juan Fernández Ladrillero]] discovered the [[Juan Fernandez islands]] and explored the Chilean coast down to the Strait of Magellan.

Western North America north of Mexico a guess; A Strait of Anian at Bering Strait; Japan and other Pacific Islands distorted; Only the north coast of New Guinea; No Australia; Huge 'Southern Unknowne Land' in the south.]]

'''The South Pacific:''' Several Spanish expeditions were sent from South America across the Pacific Ocean in the 16th and early 17th centuries. They all used the southern [[trade winds]]. In 1567/68 [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]] sailed from Peru to the [[Solomon Islands]]. In 1595 he tried again and reached the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] (eastern Solomons toward Fiji). He died there and the survivors reached the Philippines. In 1606 [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] reached [[Vanuatu]] south of the Solomons. He continued exploring and eventually sailed back to Mexico. One of his separated ships under [[Luis Vaz de Torres]] sailed west and discovered the [[Torres Strait|strait that bears his name]] sighting the northern tip of [[Australia]]. Other Spanish expeditions discovered [[Tuvalu]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Admiralty Islands]] and the [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]]. In 1722 the Dutchman [[Jacob Roggeveen]] sailed from Cape Horn to Batavia and discovered Easter Island and Samoa.

'''Cape Horn:''' Six years after Magellan, in 1526, one of the ships of the [[Loaísa Expedition]] sailed through the Strait of Magellan and followed the coast north to Mexico. In 1578 [[Francis Drake]] passed through the Strait, sailed north raiding Spanish ships and put in somewhere on the coast of California. In 1580 [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]], who was hunting for Drake, was the first to sail from the Strait to Europe. In 1587 [[Thomas Cavendish]] followed Drake, captured a Manila galleon and returned via the Indian Ocean. In 1599 the first Dutch ships passed through the Strait of Magellan ([[William Adams (sailor)|Will Adams]], the first Englishman to reach Japan, was on board). [[Olivier van Noort]] followed and became the first Dutch circumnavigator.

In 1525 [[Francisco de Hoces]], while trying to enter the Strait as part of the Loaisa Expedition, was blown south by a storm and saw what he thought was land's end. In 1578 Drake was blown south on the west side and saw what he thought was open water. In 1616 [[Willem Schouten]] sought a more southerly passage and rounded [[Cape Horn]]. In 1619 the [[Garcia de Nodal expedition]] followed the Dutch and proved that Tierra del Fuego was an island by circumnavigating it. Since the Strait of Magellan is narrow and hard to navigate Cape Horn became the standard route until the opening of the Panama Canal. It is a measure of the difficulty of these seas that it was not until 1820 that anyone went as far south as Antarctica.

'''North America:''' When the Spanish conquered Mexico in 1521 they gained a stretch of Pacific coast. In 1533, [[Fortún Ximénez]] reached [[Baja California]] and in 1539 [[Francisco de Ulloa]] showed that it was a peninsula, but the myth of an [[Island of California]] continued for many years. In 1542 [[Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo]] reached a point north of San Francisco. In 1578 Drake landed somewhere on the coast. In 1587 Pedro de Unamuno, coming from the Philippines, stopped at [[Morro Bay, California]]. In 1592, [[Juan de Fuca]] may have reached [[Puget Sound]].

In 1595, [[Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño|Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño (Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho)]], commander of the Manila galleon ''San Agustín'', attempted an exploration of the California coast. He reached the continent between Point St. George and [[Trinidad, California|Trinidad Head]] in California, but the galleon was later wrecked in a storm off [[Drake's Bay]] and the survivors had to sail the rest of the way back to Mexico in a small launch. The smaller vessel, however, allowed Cermeño to sail closer to the coast and to make useful observations of coastal features. In 1602, [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] re-explored the California coast, one of his ships reaching Oregon. His was the last northward exploration for the next 150 years.

The [[Portolà expedition]] of 1769 began the land exploration of [[Alta California]], following the coast as far north as [[San Francisco Bay]] and using the reports of Cermeño and Vizcaíno for guidance.

After conquering Mexico the Spanish occupied the southern two thirds of Mexico, all of Central America and the South American coast down to Chile. North of this the land was too dry to support a dense population that could be ruled and taxed. The only exception was the [[Pueblo]] peoples far to the north in New Mexico. People like [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] penetrated far into the interior and found nothing that the Spanish valued. The [[Chichimeca]] country of northern Mexico was slowly absorbed and Baja California began to be settled in 1687. The returning Manila galleons followed the [[westerlies]] to the coast of California, but immediately turned south, making only a few attempts to explore the coast. For more see [[History of the West Coast of North America]] and [[Early knowledge of the Pacific Northwest]].

===Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery===
[[File:Thevenot - Hollandia Nova detecta 1644.png|thumb|200px|A typical map from the [[Golden Age of Dutch cartography|Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography]]. [[Australasia]] during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (ca. 1590s–1720s): including [[New Guinea#History|Nova Guinea]] ([[New Guinea]]), [[New Holland (Australia)|Nova Hollandia]] ([[mainland Australia]]), [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and [[Nova Zeelandia]] (New Zealand). The Dutch were the first non-natives to undisputedly explore and chart coastlines of [[History of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Tasmania|Tasmania]], [[History of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[History of Tonga|Tonga]], [[History of Fiji|Fiji]], [[History of Samoa|Samoa]], and [[History of Easter Island|Easter Island]].]]

'''Australia and the southwest:''' Australia is remarkable for the number of explorers who missed it. There seems to be no record of Indonesian sailors reaching Australia. Some think that the Portuguese reached Australia before 1600 but [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|these theories]] are difficult to prove. The 1567–1606 Spanish voyages from South America stopped at islands to the east before reaching Australia. The first European to definitely see Australia was [[Willem Janszoon]] who in February 1606 reached the Cape York Peninsula and thought it was part of New Guinea.  Also in 1606 (June to October) [[Luis Váez de Torres]] of the Quiros expedition from South America followed the south coast of New Guinea and passed through the [[Torres Strait]] without recognizing Australia. His voyage, and therefore the separation between Australia and New Guinea, was not generally known until 1765. From about 1611 [[Brouwer Route|the standard Dutch route]] to the East Indies was to follow the [[roaring forties]] as far east as possible and then turn sharply north to [[Jakarta Old Town|Batavia]]. Since it was difficult to know longitude some ships would reach the west coast [[Brouwer Route|or be wrecked on it]]. 1616 [[Dirk Hartog]] bumped into the west coast and did some exploring. [[Frederick de Houtman]] did the same in 1619. In 1623 [[Jan Carstenszoon]] followed the south coast of New Guinea, missed Torres Strait and went along the north coast of Australia. In 1643 [[Abel Tasman]] left [[Mauritius]], missed Australia, found [[Tasmania]], continued east and found New Zealand, missed the strait between the north and south islands, turned northwest, missed Australia again and sailed along the north coast of New Guinea. In 1644 he followed the south coast of New Guinea, missed the Torres Strait, turned south and mapped the north coast of Australia. In 1688 the English buccaneer [[William Dampier]] beached a ship on the northwest coast. In 1696 [[Willem de Vlamingh]] explored the southwest coast. In 1699 Dampier was sent to find the east coast of Australia. He sailed along the west coast, went north to Timor, followed the north coast of New Guinea to the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and abandoned his search because his ship had become rotten. Until Captain Cook the east coast was completely unknown and New Zealand had only been seen once.

'''Mythical Lands:''' Europeans had long believed in a [[Strait of Anian]] somewhere near Bering Strait. A large and distorted [[Hokkaido]] was called '[[Ezo]]', 'Jesso' and many other spellings. One of the [[Kuril Islands]] named "Companies Landt" by Vries grew into a large mass attached to North America. Joao-da-Gama-Land was thought to be east of Japan. There was an overgrown Puget Sound called "Grande Mer de l'Ouest" possibly connected to [[Hudson Bay]].  In the far south was a [[Terra Australis]]. The map published in [[Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' in 1755 is [[Early knowledge of the Pacific Northwest|filled with nonsense]]. In 1875 no less than 123 [[phantom island|mythical islands]] were removed from the [[Admiralty chart|Royal Navy chart]] of the North Pacific.

===Further expeditions===
[[File:Sea-otter-map.jpg|thumb|Russian posts closely followed the natural distribution of the fur-bearing Sea Otter]]
'''Alaska and the Russians:''' The modern period begins with Russian expeditions. They [[Siberian River Routes|crossed Siberia]] and reached the Pacific in 1639 ([[Ivan Moskvitin]]). In 1644 [[Vassili Poyarkov]] found the [[Amur River]]. In 1648 [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] (probably) entered the Pacific from the Arctic Ocean. In 1652 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] followed the coast of the [[Sea of Okhotsk]]. In 1697 [[Vladimir Atlasov]] entered the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] overland from the north. In 1716 the first seagoing boats were built to reach Kamchatka from the mainland.  In 1728 [[Vitus Bering]] sailed from Kamchatka through [[Bering Strait|the strait that bears his name]] without seeing America. In 1732 [[Mikhail Gvozdev]] and [[Ivan Fedorov (navigator)]] saw the tip of Alaska from the Bering Strait. In 1741 [[Vitus Bering]] and [[Alexei Chirikov]] sailed just south of the Aleutian Islands and reached the Alaska panhandle. [[Peter Kuzmich Krenitzin]] mapped the Aleutians before 1769. The myth of a land mass north of the Aleutians took a long time to dispel. Russians fur hunters island-hopped along the Aleutians and then along the south coast of Alaska looking mainly for [[sea otter]] ([[Attu Island|Attu]] at the west end of the Aleutians in 1745, [[Unalaska Island]] at the east end in 1759, [[Kodiak Island]] 1784, [[Kenai Peninsula]] 1785, [[Yakutat Bay|Yakutat]], 1795, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] 1799, [[Fort Ross]] 1812). North of the Aleutians posts appeared on the west coast after 1819. Spaniards from Mexico met the Russians in 1788. (see below). [[Russian America]] was sold to the United States in 1867.

The route of Cook's crew following his death is shown as a dashed blue line.]]
'''Captain Cook:''' On his first voyage (1768–71) [[James Cook]] went to Tahiti from Cape Horn, circumnavigated New Zealand, followed the east coast of Australia for the first time and returned via the Torres Strait and the Cape of Good Hope. On his second voyage (1772–75) he sailed from west to east keeping as far south as possible and showed that there was probably no [[Terra Australis]]. On his third voyage (1776–80) he found the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and followed the North American coast from Oregon to the Bering Strait, mapping this coast for the first time and showing that there was probably no [[Northwest passage]]. Cook was killed in Hawaii in 1779. The expedition made a second attempt at the Bering Strait, stopped at Kamchatka and China and reached England in 1780. Cook set a high standard of scientific exploration, showed that there was no large land mass in the southern ocean, mapped the two largest island groups in the Pacific and by following the east coast of Australia and the west coast of North America closed the last gaps in European knowledge of the Pacific coasts. After Cook everything was detail.

'''Cook's rivals and successors:''' Several governments sponsored Pacific expeditions, often in rivalry or emulation of Captain Cook. At the time of Cook's first voyage, in 1766-69 [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] crossed the Pacific and publicized Tahiti and in 1767 [[Samuel Wallis]] and [[Philip Carteret]] separately crossed the Pacific. In 1785-88 [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse]] followed the American coast from Chile to Alaska, crossed to China, explored northern Japan and Kamchatka, went south to Australia and lost his life in the [[Santa Cruz Islands]].  The [[Malaspina Expedition]] (1789–1794) visited the American coast, Manila, New Zealand and Australia. In 1792-93 [[George Vancouver]] more thoroughly mapped the west coast of Canada. In 1803/6 [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] led the first Russian circumnavigation and investigated both sides of the North Pacific. In 1820 [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] saw [[Antarctica]]. A number of other voyages are listed in "[[European and American voyages of scientific exploration]]."

'''Spain on the west coast of North America:''' For Europeans in the [[Age of Exploration]] western North America was one of the most distant places on earth (9 to 12 months of sailing). Spain had long claimed the entire west coast of the Americas. The area north of Mexico however was given little attention in the early years. This changed when the Russians appeared in Alaska. The Spanish moved north to California and built a [[Spanish missions in California|series of missions]] along the Pacific coast including: [[San Diego]] in 1767, [[Monterey, California]] in 1770 and San Francisco in 1776. San Francisco Bay was discovered in 1769 by [[Gaspar de Portolà]] from the landward side because its mouth is not obvious from the sea. The Spanish settlement of San Francisco remained the northern limit of land occupation. By sea, from 1774 to 1793 the [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] tried to assert Spanish claims against the Russians and British. In 1774 [[Juan José Pérez Hernández]] reached what is now the south end of the Alaska panhandle. In 1778 Captain Cook sailed the west coast and spent a month at [[Nootka Sound]] on Vancouver Island. An expedition led by [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] sailed north to [[Nootka Sound|Nootka]] and reached [[Prince William Sound]]. In 1788 [[Esteban José Martínez Fernández y Martínez de la Sierra|Esteban José Martínez]] went north and met the Russians for the first time (Unalaska and Kodiak Island) and heard that the Russians were planning to occupy Nootka Sound. In 1789 Martinez went north to build a fort at Nootka and found British and American merchant ships already there. He seized a British ship which led to the [[Nootka Crisis]] and Spanish recognition of non-Spanish trade on the northwest coast. In 1791 the [[Malaspina expedition]] mapped the Alaska coast. In 1792 [[Dionisio Alcalá Galiano]] circumnavigated Vancouver Island. In 1792-93 [[George Vancouver]] also mapped the complex coast of British Columbia. [[Vancouver Island]] was originally named Quadra's and Vancouver's Island in commemoration of the friendly negotiations held by the Spanish commander of the [[Fort San Miguel|Nootka Sound settlement]], [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] and British naval captain [[George Vancouver]] in Nootka Sound in 1792. In 1793 [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] reached the Pacific overland from Canada. By this time Spain was becoming involved in the French wars and increasingly unable to assert its claims on the Pacific coast. In 1804 the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]] reached the Pacific overland from the Mississippi River. By the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] of 1819 Spain gave up its claims north of California. Canadian fur traders, and later a smaller number of Americans, crossed the mountains and built posts on the coast. In 1846 the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the [[Oregon country]] between Britain and the United States. The United States conquered California in 1848 and purchased Alaska in 1867.

'''Northeast:''' The Russians moved south and the Japanese moved north and explored the [[Kuril Islands]] and [[Sakhalin]]. About 1805 [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] was apparently the first Russian to reach eastern Siberia by sea from European Russia. In 1808 [[Mamiya Rinzo]] explored the coast of Sakhalin. During the Crimean War a British fleet failed to capture [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]]. In 1860 Russia [[Amur Annexation|annexed the southeast corner of Siberia]] from China.

'''The Pacific opened to trade and imperialism:''' After Captain Cook large numbers of European merchant vessels began to enter the Pacific. The reasons for this are not completely clear. On Cook's third voyage furs bought at Nootka were sold in China at a 1,800 percent profit - enough to pay for a trading voyage. The first to do this was [[James Hanna (trader)|James Hanna]] from Macao in 1785. [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] in 1787 was the first American. This [[Maritime fur trade]] reached its peak about 1810, drew many ships into the Pacific and drew Canadians and Americans to the coast. The first Pacific [[whaling]] ship left London in 1788  and by the nineteenth century there were hundreds of whaleships in the Pacific each year. [[Clipper ships]] cut the sailing time from Europe to the Pacific. England founded a colony in Australia in 1788 and New Zealand in 1840. After about 1800 England began to replace the Dutch Republic along the Asian coast. [[Hong Kong]] became a colony in 1839 during the [[First Opium War]], which was also the first time that a large European military and naval force appeared in the Pacific. European ships and sailors disrupted life on the Pacific islands. Most of the Pacific islands were soon claimed by one European power or another.

The generative approach to [[second-language acquisition|second language (L2) acquisition]] applies theoretical insights developed from within [[generative linguistics]] to investigate how second languages are learned by adults and children.  Research is conducted in [[syntax]], [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonetics]] and [[semantics]].

The main questions in generative second language acquisition include whether [[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]] is available to the adult second language learner to guide acquisition, as it is to the first language learner; whether second language learners can reset [[Principles and parameters|linguistic parameters]]; whether second-language learners experience difficulties [[Interface hypothesis|interfacing between different modules]] of the grammar; and whether child second language acquisition differs from that of adults. As generative second language research endeavors to explain the totality of L2 acquisition phenomena, it is also concerned with investigating the extent of [[Language transfer|linguistic transfer]], [[Critical period hypothesis|maturational effects]] on acquisition, and why some learners [[Interlanguage fossilization|fail to acquire]] a target-like L2 grammar even with abundant input.

Research in generative second-language acquisition is presented at a range of conferences, including:  GASLA ([[Generative Approaches to Second Language Acquisition]]), GALANA ([[Generative Approaches to Language Acquisition]] - North America), and BUCLD ([[Boston University Conference on Language Development]]).

Prominent researchers of the topic include [[Suzanne Flynn]] of [[MIT]], [[Bonnie Schwartz]] of [[University of Hawaii]], [[Antonella Sorace]] of [[University of Edinburgh]], and [[Lydia White]] of [[McGill University]].

'''''Gossip from the Forest: the Tangled Roots of our Forests and Fairytales''''' is a 2012 book by [[Sara Maitland]] about the connections between [[forest]]s and [[fairy tale|fairytales]] in [[Northern Europe]]. It is structured around accounts of walks through 12 forests in Scotland and England, one per month of the year, and 12 associated retellings of traditional fairytales, and was published by [[Granta]] ({{ISBN|9781847084293}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/28/sara-maitland-gossip-forest-review|title=Gossip from the Forest by Sara Maitland – review|last=Lang|first=Olivia|date=28 October 2012|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/paperback-review-gossip-from-the-forest-by-sarah-maitland-8640735.html|title=Paperback review: Gossip from the Forest, By Sarah Maitland|last=McDowell|first=Leslie|date=1 June 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/21/gossip-from-forest-maitland-review|title=Gossip from the Forest by Sara Maitland – review|last=Segal|first=Victoria|date=21 June 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maitland has described the book as "a hybrid book  ... history and photographs and nature and politics and science and anthropology and fiction (my own retellings of 12 Grimm stories) and, indeed, gossip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/14/sara-maitland-top-10-books-forests?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=Sara Maitland's top 10 books of the forest|date=14 November 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibrahim Ibn Saîd al-Sahlì''' ([[11th century]]) was an [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] globe-maker, active from 1050 to 1090.

Ibrahim Ibn Saîd al-Sahlì worked in [[Valencia]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in what is now Spain, and was mentioned in a list of mathematics students in [[Andalusia]] in a book written in 1068. Ibrahim Ibn Saîd al-Sahlì created the "[[astrolabe]] of Al-Sahli", an instrument to determine the positions of the stars on the sky, in the city of Tulaytulah (now Toledo, Spain) in the year 1066. He built four more astrolabes between 1067 and 1086. His first astrolabe was characterized by the peculiarity of its operation, as other astrolabes made in his time were not similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17543">Originally, the word '''''computing''''' was synonymous with counting and calculating, and the science and [[technology]] of mathematical [[calculation]]s. Today, "computing" means using [[computer]]s and other computing machines. It includes their '''operation''' and usage, the [[electronics|electrical]] [[Process (science)|processes]] carried out within the computing [[computer|hardware]] itself, and the theoretical concepts governing them ([[computer science]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3916">'''Information panspermia''' is a concept on the possibility of life travel in the universe by means of transmission of a compressed information on the bases of life e.g. genome coding, which then can enable the recovery of an intelligent life.

== Name ==
The concept is invented and coined by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurzadyan | first1 = V.G.| year = 2005 | title = Kolmogorov Complexity, String Information, Panspermia and the Fermi Paradox | url = | journal = Observatory | volume = 125 | pages = 352 |arxiv = physics/0508010 |bibcode = 2005Obs...125..352G }}&lt;/ref&gt; which then is attributed by Stephen Webb as Solution 23 to [[Fermi paradox]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Webb | first1 = S. | year = 2015 | title = If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens. . . Where Is Everybody?: Seventy-Five Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life  | url = | journal = Springer, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [[Armenia]]n mathematical physicist Vahe Gurzadyan has posited an interesting hypothesis: we might inhabit a Galaxy “full of traveling life streams”{{snd}} strings of bits beamed throughout space."

== Background ==
[[Kolmogorov complexity]] is defined as the length of the computer program which enables the complete recovery of an object. Gurzadyan showed that the complexity of the human [[genome]] is relatively low due to non-random parts in the genomic sequences. Moreover, he noticed that since the genomic information on the terrestrial life, starting from bacteria up to humans, contains essential common parts, the entire terrestrial life information can be compressed and transmitted, as he estimated,  to over Galactic distances via [[Arecibo Observatory |Arecibo]]-type antenna.

Within this concept one can even assume that the terrestrial life itself might be a result of such an information package.

The '''International Standard Classification of Occupations''' ('''ISCO''') is an [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) classification structure for organizing information on [[Labour economics|labour and jobs]]. It is part of the international family of economic and social classifications of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/family/family1.asp United Nations Statistics Division. ''List of international family of economic and social classifications''], retrieved 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The current version, known as '''ISCO-08''', was published in 2008 and is the fourth iteration, following ISCO-58, ISCO-68 and ISCO-88.

The ILO describes the purpose of the ISCO classification as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/index.htm International Labour Organization. ''International Standard Classification of Occupations''], retrieved 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;a tool for organizing jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the [[Task (project management)|tasks]] and duties undertaken in the job. It is intended for use in statistical applications and in a variety of client oriented applications. Client oriented applications include the matching of job seekers with job vacancies, the management of short or long term migration of workers between countries and the development of vocational training programmes and guidance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ISCO is the basis for many national occupation classifications as well as applications in specific domains such as reporting of teaching, agricultural and [[Health Human Resources|healthcare workforce]] information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/Health_workers_classification.pdf World Health Organization. ''Classifying health workers: Mapping occupations to the international standard classification''], retrieved 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ISCO-08 revision is expected to be the standard for labour information worldwide in the coming decade, for instance as applied to incoming data from the 2010 Global Round of National Population [[Census]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter D et al. 2009. "Boundaries of the health workforce: definition and classifications of health workers." In: ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health''. Geneva, World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/2010_PHC/default.htm United Nations Statistics Division. ''2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme''], retrieved 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ISCO-08 structure==
The ISCO-08 divides jobs into 10 major groups: 
# [[Management|Managers]]
# [[Professional]]
# [[Technician]]s and associate professionals
# Clerical support workers
# Service and sales workers
# Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers
# Craft and related trades workers
# Plant and machine operators, and assemblers
# Elementary occupations
# Armed forces occupations

Each major group is further organized into sub-major, minor and unit (not shown) groups. The basic criteria used to define the system are the [[skill]] level and specialization required to competently perform the tasks and duties of the occupations.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization. ''Resolution Concerning Updating the International Standard Classification of Occupations''. Adopted at the Tripartite Meeting of Experts on Labour Statistics, 6 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katrin Linse''' is a German [[Antarctic]] marine biologist, best known for her work on discovering new Antarctic and deep sea species.

==Early life and education==
Linse was born in Germany.&lt;ref name="Classroom@Sea » Meet the Team"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classroomatsea.net/JC042/JC042team|title=Meet the Team|website=www.classroomatsea.net|publisher=Classroom@Sea|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discovered marine biology at the age of six, thanks to undergraduates she encountered while on holiday with her family. She developed the goal of working in polar science at the age of twelve, when a national polar research vessel was being built in a shipyard near to her family home: forbidden from visiting the shipyard during its open day, a were all women and children, Linse announced that one day she would sail aboard the ship to study marine life in the Antarctic. At the age of twenty-six, she did so for the first time.&lt;ref name="cambridge-news.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/biologist-katrin-linse-went-dissecting-starfish/story-29056103-detail/story.html|title=How biologist Katrin Linse went from dissecting starfish on the beach to sailing to Antarctica|date=2016-04-06|website=Cambridge News|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linse received her undergraduate degree with ''magna cum laude'' honors from [[University of Kiel|Kiel University]], where she also completed her master's degree. She completed her PhD at the [[University of Hamburg]] and the Zoology Museum, where she compared molluscs collected from the tip of South America with those found in Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Classroom@Sea » Meet the Team"/&gt;

==Career and impact==
Linse is a Senior Biodiversity Biologist at the [[British Antarctic Survey]], where she began her career in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She is a distinguished marine benthic biologist with over fifteen years’ research experience in the biodiversity, phylogeography and evolution of Antarctic marine invertebrates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/kl/#publications|title=Katrin Linse|website=www.bas.ac.uk|publisher=British Antarctic Survey|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has participated in over 13 ship-based expeditions, including several that studied hydrothermal habitats in the [[Southern Ocean]] and numerous that have impacted global knowledge of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. She has led or contributed to the discovery of dozens of new species, as she works toward what she has referred to as a “census of marine life in the Southern Ocean.”&lt;ref name="cambridge-news.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Among Linse’s contributions to Antarctic science is her work leading the team that designed the first georeferenced Antarctic benthos database, which resulted in new Antarctic provinces and an updated biogeography for the Southern Ocean. Her research on phylogenetic relationships of current Antarctic species and their evolutionary histories contributed to the discovery of high biodiversity in the bathyal and abyssal Antarctic deep sea,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/interviews/interview/1928/|title=New Species At Hydrothermal Vents - Planet Earth Online - Katrin Linse And Ali Graham, British Antarctic Survey - The Naked Scientists|website=www.thenakedscientists.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qualitymarine.com/Weird-New-Animals-From-Antarctica's-Deep-Seas-(05/21/07)|title=Weird New Animals From Antarctica's Deep Seas (05/21/07) / Industry News - Quality Marine|website=www.qualitymarine.com|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced the discovery of the first hydrothermal vents in the Southern Ocean.  She also has led or contributed to numerous teams that discovered new species, including a new family of deep-sea starfish living in the warm waters around a hydrothermal vent in the [[East Scotia Ridge]] in the Southern Ocean; a new species of bug (''[[Jaera tyleri]])'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/new-critter-discovered-on-whale-carcass/|title=NEWS STORY: New critter discovered on whale carcass - News - British Antarctic Survey|website=www.bas.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar in appearance to the common woodlouse, which was found plastered all over a whale carcass on the floor of the deep Southern Ocean; and more than thirty new species of marine life discovered during an expedition to the [[Amundsen Sea]] off Pine Island Bay in Antarctica. She also  was part of the BAS team that made the first comprehensive “inventory” of sea and land animals around a group of Antarctic islands, [[South Orkney Islands]], near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/first-comprehensive-inventory-of-life-in-antarctica/|title=PRESS RELEASE: Continent’s diversity revealed - News - British Antarctic Survey|website=www.bas.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50065">The following list gives a detailed record of the launches taken place in '''[[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]]'''. It is the main satellite launch centre for the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO). It is located in [[Sriharikota]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Chennai]]. Originally called Sriharikota Range&lt;ref name="FFH2RP_Ch_4.1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.isro.gov.in/pslv-c25-mars-orbiter-mission/fishing-hamlet-to-red-planet-download-e-book|title=From Fishing Hamlet to Red Planet: India's Space Journey|last=|first=Indian Space Research Organization|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2015|isbn=9789351776901|location=India|pages=328|language=English|chapter=4.1 The Spaceport of ISRO - K.

SHAR in Sanskrit also means arrow, symbolic of the nature of activity and that seems to be the significance of the acronym.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SHAR), an acronym that ISRO has retained to the present day. The centre was renamed in 2002 after the death of ISRO's former chairman [[Satish Dhawan]].

== Launch statistics ==
&lt;!--- Do not forget to update both, the launch history table as well as the stats/information and the date given in this section. Thanks. ---&gt;
As of 14 November 2018, there have been a total of 67 launches,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Manually counting from the below given list of launches. All the stats given in this section have been found out using the same way. No launches by sounding rockets have been included either here or in the launch log.&lt;/ref&gt; including 53 successful launches, 4 partial successes,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;A partial success occurs when the payload is placed into an orbit where it was still usable even though the intended height or orbit was not reached, or which could be corrected with the spacecraft's own propulsion.&lt;/ref&gt; and 9 failed launches.

=== By rocket===
*'''SLV''': '''4''' (1 failure, 1 partial success &amp; 2 successful)

This '''list of oil and gas field of the Barents Sea''' contains links to the major [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] [[hydrocarbon reservoir|fields]] beneath the [[Barents Sea]].  The Barents Sea is bordered by the north [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Russia]]n coasts, the [[Novaya Zemlya]], [[Franz Josef Land]] and [[Svalbard]] archipelagos, and the eastern margin of the Norwegian Sea.&lt;ref name=Dore1995&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[hydrocarbon exploration]], the area is divided into the Russian side on the East and the Norwegian side on the West, with the two also showing quite different [[petroleum geology]].  The Russian side contains a number of very large gas fields contained in Upper Jurassic [[sandstone]] [[petroleum reservoir|reservoirs]], bounded by [[Structural trap#Anticlinal trap|anticline]] structures, whereas the Norwegian side contains much smaller Middle-Lower Jurassic sandstone reservoirs bounded by [[Structural trap#Fault trap|fault blocks]].  Some of the largest discoveries were made in the 1980s but have still not been brought into production because of a combination of the extreme conditions, political instability and the historical low price of gas.

==List of fields==

===Norway===
*[[Snøhvit|Snøhvit field]] - The first offshore field to be brought into production in the Barents Sea, includes Snøhvit, Askeladd and Albatross discoveries.
*[[Johan Castberg field]] - Formerly Skrugard-Havis field.&lt;ref name=Barents1&gt;

''This article is about one specific instrument. For generic information about the spectroscopic method, see [[Time of flight]]. For time-of-flight instruments in neutron scattering, see [[Neutron time-of-flight scattering]].''

The '''Neutron Time Of Flight''' ('''n-TOF''') facility is a [[neutron]] [[spectrometer]] at [[CERN]]. It consists of a pulsed source, a flight path of 200&amp;nbsp;m length, and a detector systems. Neutron energies are deduced from the [[time of flight]] between source and detector; hence the name of the facility. The neutrons are produced by [[Spallation#Production of neutrons at a spallation neutron source|neutron spallation]]; by directing a pulsed beam of protons from the [[Proton Synchrotron]] (PS) towards a lead target about 300 neutrons expelled for each impact of a proton. The neutrons are slowed down after being emitted, first by the lead target and afterwards by a slab containing water. This results in a wide range of neutron energies since some neutrons will slow down more than others when passing through the targets. Finally, the neutrons are ejected through the 200m long flight path before they arrive at an experimental area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/about/experiments/ntof|title=nTOF {{!}} CERN|website=home.cern|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''Obligatory passage point''' ('''OPP''') was developed by sociologist [[Michel Callon]] in a seminal contribution to [[actor–network theory]]: Callon, Michel (1986), "Elements of a sociology of translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay". ''In'' [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]] (Ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge?'' London, Routledge: 196-233.

Obligatory passage points are a feature of actor-networks, usually associated with the initial ([[problematization]]) phase of a translation process. An OPP can be thought of as the narrow end of a funnel, that forces the actors to converge on a certain topic, purpose or question. The OPP thereby becomes a necessary element for the formation of a network and an [[action program]]. The OPP thereby mediates all interactions between actors in a network and defines the action program. Obligatory passage points allow for local networks to set up negotiation spaces that allow them a degree of autonomy from the global network of involved actors. 

If a project is unable to impose itself as a strong OPP between the global and local networks, it has no control over global resources such as financial and political support, which can be misused or withdrawn.  Additionally, a weak OPP is unable to take credit for the successes achieved within the local network, as outside actors are able to bypass its control and influence the local network directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shaping technology/building society:  Studies in sociotechnical change|author=John Law and Michel Callon|year=1994|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn= 9780262023382|pages=42-46|editor=Wiebe E. Bijker and John Law|chapter=The life and death of an aircraft:  A network analysis of technical change}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

An action program can comprise a number of different OPP's. An OPP can also be redefined as the problematization phase is revisited.

In Callon and [[John Law (sociologist)|Law's]] '"Engineering and Sociology in a Military Aircraft Project" &lt;ref&gt;In [[Susan Leigh Star|Star, S. L.]] (1995). ''Ecologies of knowledge: Work and politics in science and technology.'' State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the project management of a project to design a new strategic jet fighter for the British Military became an obligatory passage point between representatives of government and aerospace engineers.

In recent years, the notion of the Obligatory Passage Point has taken hold in the Information Systems Security and Information Privacy disciplines and journals. Backhouse et al. (2006) &lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, J., Hsu, C. W., &amp; Silva, L. (2006). Circuits of power in creating de jure standards: Shaping an international information systems security standard. ''Management Information Systems Quarterly, 30''(3), 413–438. doi:10.2307/25148767&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated how practices and policies are standardized and institutionalized through OPP.

'''Operation Sandstone''' was a series of [[nuclear weapon]] tests in 1948. It was the third series of American tests, following [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]] in 1945 and [[Operation Crossroads|Crossroads]] in 1946, and preceding [[Operation Ranger|Ranger]]. Like the Crossroads tests, the Sandstone tests were carried out at the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]], although at [[Enewetak Atoll]] rather than [[Bikini Atoll]]. They differed from ''Crossroads'' in that they were conducted by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.

The successful testing of the new [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]] in the ''Operation Sandstone'' tests rendered every component of the old weapons obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, production of the old cores was halted, and all effort concentrated on the new [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]], which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. More efficient use of fissionable material as a result of Operation Sandstone would increase the U.S. nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949.

==Origins==
[[File:Eniwetak Atoll.gif|thumb|right|Enewetak Atoll|alt=Map of Enewetak Atoll. The coral reef gives the atoll a circular shape. Most of the islands are at the northern end, including the three used as test sits. The main island of Enewetak is in the south.]]

[[Nuclear weapon]]s were developed during [[World War II]] by the [[Manhattan Project]], which created a network of production facilities, and the weapons research and design laboratory at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].{{sfn|Brahmstedt|2002|pp=2–8}} Two types of bombs were developed: the Mark 1 ''[[Little Boy]]'', a [[gun-type fission weapon]] using [[uranium-235]], and the Mark 3 ''[[Fat Man]]'', an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] using [[plutonium]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=82–83}}

These weapons were not far removed from their laboratory origins. A great deal of work remained to improve ease of assembly, safety, reliability and storage before they were ready for production. There were also many improvements to their performance that had been suggested or recommended during the war that had not been possible under the pressure of wartime development. [[Norris Bradbury]], who replaced [[Robert Oppenheimer]] as director at Los Alamos, felt that "we had, to put it bluntly, lousy bombs."{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=212–213}}

Plutonium was produced by irradiating [[uranium-238]] in three 250 MW [[nuclear reactors]] at the [[Hanford site]]. In theory they could produce {{convert|0.91|g}} of plutonium per megawatt-day, or about {{convert|20|kg}} per month. In practice, production never approached such a level in 1945, when only between {{convert|4|and|6|kg}} was produced per month. A ''Fat Man'' [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|core]] required about {{convert|6.2|kg}} of plutonium, of which 21% fissioned. Plutonium production fell off during 1946 due to swelling of the reactors' graphite [[neutron moderator]]s. This is known as the [[Wigner effect]], after its discoverer, the Manhattan Project scientist [[Eugene Wigner]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=83, 208–213}}

These reactors were also required for the production (by irradiation of [[bismuth-209]]) of [[polonium-210]], which was used in the [[modulated neutron initiator|initiators]], a critical component of the nuclear weapons. Some {{convert|62|kg}} of bismuth-209 had to be irradiated for 100 days to produce 600 [[curies]] of polonium-210, a little over {{convert|132|mg}}. Because polonium-210 has a half-life of only 138 days, at least one reactor had to be kept running. The oldest unit, B pile, was therefore closed down so that it would be available in the future. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=213–215}}

[[Uranium-235]] was derived from [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] of natural uranium at the [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12 plant]] and [[K-25|K-25 site]] in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Improvements in the processes and procedures of the [[calutron|electromagnetic]] and [[gaseous diffusion|gaseous]] isotope separation between October 1945 and June 1946 led to an increase in production to around {{convert|69|kg}} of uranium-235 per month, which was only enough for one of the very wasteful ''Little Boy''s. A ''Fat Man'' was 17.5 times as efficient as a ''Little Boy'', but a ton of uranium ore could yield eight times as much uranium-235 as plutonium, and on a per-gram basis, plutonium cost somewhere between four and eight times as much to produce as uranium-235,{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=83, 212}} which at this time cost around $26 per gram.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=264}}

==Weapon development 1945–48==
{{see also|nuclear weapon design}}

The objectives of the Sandstone series of tests were to:
# test nuclear cores and initiators;
# improve the theory and knowledge of implosion type weapons;
# test levitated cores;
# test composite cores; and
# determine the most economic designs in terms of efficient use of fissionable material.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=205}}

Levitation meant that instead of being immediately inside the tamper, there would be an air gap between the tamper and the core, which would be suspended inside on wires. This would allow the tamper to gain more momentum before striking the core. The principle was similar to swinging a hammer at a nail. In order for this to work outside the laboratory, the wires had to be strong enough to withstand being dropped from an aircraft, but thin enough to not disturb the spherical symmetry of the implosion.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=188–189}} The Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, known as T Division, had run computer calculations on the levitated core as early March 1945.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1999|p=94}} The use of the levitated core had been proposed during the planning for Operation Crossroads, but it had been decided instead to use the existing solid core "Christy" design.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=203}} This was named after its designer, [[Robert Christy]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=126}} For Sandstone, however, it was decided that at least two of the three tests would use levitated cores.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=205}}

The motivation behind the composite core was to make better use of the available fissionable material. The use of uranium-235 in an implosion weapon instead of the inefficient gun type Little Boy was an obvious development. However, while plutonium was more expensive and harder to produce than uranium-235, it fissions faster, because it makes better use of the neutrons its fission produces. On the other hand, the slower reaction of uranium-235 permits the assembly of super-critical masses, making it theoretically possible to produce weapons with high yields.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=207}} By July 1945, Oppenheimer and Groves were considering  using both materials in a composite core containing {{convert|3.25|kg}} of plutonium and {{convert|6.5|kg}} of uranium-235. The composite cores became available in 1946. Los Alamos' priority then became the development of an all-uranium-235 core.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=224–227}} By January 1948 the national stockpile contained 50 cores, of which 36 were composite Christy cores, nine were plutonium Christy cores, and five were composite levitated cores.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=240}} Testing the new levitated, composite and uranium-235 cores would require at least three test firings.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=224–227}}

More efficient weapons would require less efficient initiators. This meant that less polonium would be required. At the time of Sandstone, the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 [[curies]] of polonium, and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=216, 240, 245}}

Denebrink, and Brigadier General Claude B. Ferenbaugh.|alt=Nine men sit around a large table. Another is standing, leaning over the table.

The tests were authorized by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] on June 27, 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's Director of Military Applications, Brigadier General [[James McCormack]] and his deputy, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[James S. Russell]], met with Bradbury and [[John Manley]] at Los Alamos on July 9 to make arrangements for the tests. They readily agreed that they would be scientific in nature, with Los Alamos supplying the technical direction and the armed forces providing supplies and logistical support. The cost of the tests, around $20 million, was divided between the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission. [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[John E. Hull]] was designated as test commander.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|pp=139–141}} Rear Admiral [[William S. Parsons]] and Major General [[William Ellsworth Kepner|William E. Kepner]] reprised their Operation Crossroads roles as deputy commanders.{{sfn|Christman|1998|pp=234–239}} Joint Task Force 7 was formally activated on October 18, 1947. As its commander, Hull was answerable to both the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and the Atomic Energy Commission.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=30}}

Joint Task Force 7 consisted of 10,366 personnel, 9,890 of them military.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=1}} Its headquarters consisted of about 175 men, of whom 96 were on board the  {{USS|Mount McKinley|AGC-7|6}}. The rest were accommodated on the {{USS|Albemarle|AV-5|6}}, {{USS|Curtiss|AV-4|2}} and {{USS|Bairoko|CVE-115|2}}.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|pp=30–35}}  A special division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, known as J Division, was created specifically to manage nuclear testing. An Atomic Energy Commission group (Task Group 7.1) was responsible for preparing and detonating the nuclear weapons, and conducting the experiments. It consisted of some 283 scientists and technicians  responsible for nuclear tests from J Division, the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]], the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]], [[Argonne National Laboratory]],  the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], the Atomic Energy Commission, [[EG&amp;G|Edgerton, Germeshausen &amp; Grier]], and other agencies. {{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|pp=30–35}}

Each dealt with a different aspect of the tests. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did [[gamma ray]] measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|pp=30–35}} Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to [[San Pedro, California]], and loaded on the weapon assembly ship [[USS Curtiss (AV-4)|USS ''Curtiss'']], in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=240–241}}

[[File:Sandstone HO3S.jpg|thumb|right|A Sikorsky HO3S helicopter picks up water sample from balsa raft attached to a water sample cable|alt=Banana shaped helicopter hovers over water]]
In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was designated test director on October 14, and Joint Task Force 7's scientific director, [[Darol Froman|Darol K. Froman]] from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set out with a group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in the Pacific.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|pp=139–141}} Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on October 11.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=18}} The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had happened at [[Bikini Atoll]] during Operation Crossroads.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|pp=139–141}}

As the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] was a [[United Nations trust territory]] administered by the United States, the [[United Nations Security Council]] was notified of the upcoming tests on December 2. The atoll was inhabited by the dri-Enewetak, who lived on Aomon, and the  dri-Enjebi, who lived on Bijire. Their original homes had been on Enewetak and Enjebi, but they had been moved during the war to make way for military bases. The population, about 140 in number, had been temporarily relocated to [[Meck Island]] during Operation Crossroads. This time, [[Ujelang Atoll]], an uninhabited atoll {{convert|124|nmi}} southwest of Enewetak, was selected as a relocation site. A [[Naval Construction Battalion]] group arrived there on November 22 to build accommodation and amenities. The military authorities met with the local chiefs on December 3, and they agreed to the relocation, which was carried out by {{USS|King County|LST-857|6}} by December 20.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|pp=18–21}} An [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]] and four [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] aircraft were placed on standby to evacuate Ujelan in case it was affected by fallout, but were not required.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=103}}

Unlike the Crossroads tests, which were conducted in the media spotlight, the ''Sandstone'' tests were carried out with minimal publicity. On April 15, there was still discussion in Washington about whether or not there should be any public announcement of the tests at all. Hull opposed making any announcement until after the series was completed, but the AEC commissioners felt that the news would leak out, and the United States would look secretive. It was therefore  decided to make a last minute announcement. There was no announcement of the purpose of the tests, and only cursory press releases. On 18 May, after the series was over, Hull held a press conference in Hawaii, but only permitted the media to quote from written statements.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|pp=163–164}}

===Construction===
Enjebi, Aomon, and Runit Islands were cleared of vegetation and graded level to make it easier to install the required instrumentation, and a causeway was built between Aomon and Bijire so the instrument cables could be run from the test tower on Aomon to the control station on Bijire. The detonations were ordered so that later test areas would suffer minimal fallout from the earlier shots.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=102}} The Army component, Task Group 7.2, was responsible for construction work. It consisted of the 1220th Provisional Engineer Battalion, with the 1217th and 1218th Composite Service Platoons, the 18th Engineer Construction Company and 1219th Signal Service Platoon; Companies D and E of the [[2nd Engineer Special Brigade]]'s [[532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment]]; the 461st Transportation Amphibious Truck Company; 854th Transportation Port Company; 401st CIC Detachment; and the Naval Shore Base Detachment.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=38}}

==Operations==
[[File:Enewetak atomic detonations.ogg|thumb|right|Video of the tests]]
As in ''Operation Crossroads'', each detonation was given its own code name, taken from the [[Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet]]. All used modified Mark III assemblies, and were detonated from {{convert|200|ft|adj=on}} towers.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=242–245}} The timing of the detonations was a matter of compromise. The [[gamma ray]] measurement experiments required darkness, but the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] drones that would sample the clouds needed daylight to control them. As a compromise, the Sandstone detonations all took place shortly before dawn.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=104}}

The detonations in the United States' ''Sandstone'' series are listed below:

===X-Ray===

The ''X-Ray'' nuclear device used a levitated composite core.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=242–245}} It was detonated on Enjebi just before sunrise at 06:17 on April 15, 1948,{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=105}} with a yield of 37 kilotons.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|p=672}} The efficiency of utilization of the plutonium was about 35%; that of the uranium-235 was 25% or more. This was somewhat higher than Los Alamos' prediction.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=242–245}} Observers watching from ships in the lagoon saw a brilliant flash and felt the radiant heat. A condensation cloud {{convert|5|nmi}} in diameter quickly enveloped the fireball, which glowed within the cloud. It took 45 to 50 seconds for the thunderous roar of the explosion to reach the observers.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=105}}

About 20 minutes later, ''Bariko'' launched a helicopter to check on the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 [[pilotless drone]] aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|pp=105–109}}

[[File:Sandstone Yoke 001.jpg|thumb|left|Yoke explosion|alt=Fireball cloud lights up the clouds in red and yellow, like a sunrise.]]

===Yoke===

The ''Yoke'' nuclear device used a levitated all-uranium-235 core.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=242–245}} It was detonated on Aomon just before sunrise on May 1, 1948 at 06:09, a day late due to unfavorable winds.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=110}} The observers saw a similar flash and felt the same heat as the X-Ray blast, but the {{convert|6|nmi|adj=on}} wide condensation cloud was larger, and the sound of the explosion more forceful. One observer likened it to the sound of "a paper bag which is forcefully burst in a small room".{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=110}} They were correct: its yield of 49 kilotons made it the largest nuclear detonation up to that time,{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|p=672}} but it was considered inefficient and wasteful of the fissile material.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=242–245}}

===Zebra===

''Zebra'', the third test, and the last of the Sandstone series, was detonated on Runit just before sunrise at 06:04 on May 15, 1948.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=114}}  This test was characterized by AEC Chairman [[David Lilienthal]] as the "hardest and most important" test of the three. By using one of the B-class initiators, it demonstrated that these could still be used with confidence.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=245}} The observers perceived the flash and blast as similar to the previous two tests, but this time the base of the condensation cloud was at {{convert|2000|ft}}, which gave the observers an unobstructed view of the fireball, which therefore appeared to be brighter and last longer than the other two.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|p=114}} Looks were deceiving: its levitated uranium-235 core produced a yield of 18 kilotons.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|p=672}}

[[File:Boeing B-17 drone at Eniwetok 1948.jpg|thumb|right|Filters are being removed from a US Air Force [[Boeing B-17]] drone after a flight through the radioactive cloud|alt=A propeller aircraft sits on a runway. A tracked vehicle with a crane lifts something above it. In the background are a jeep, three Quonset huts and palm trees.]]

The procedures used in the previous tests were repeated, but this time the winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on ''X-Ray'' and ''Yoke'' without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need [[skin grafting]]. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.{{sfn|Berkhouse|Davis|Gladeck|Hallowell|1983|pp=114–116}}

==Outcome==
The successful testing of the new cores in the Sandstone tests had a profound effect. Practically every component of the old weapons was rendered obsolete.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=205}} Even before the third test had been carried out, Bradbury had halted production of the old cores, and ordered that all effort was to be concentrated on the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]], which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1962|pp=175–176}} The more efficient use of fissionable material would increase the nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=149}} The Mark III bombs were withdrawn from service in 1950.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=229}} At the same time, new production plants were coming online and the [[Wigner effect]] problem had been solved. By May 1951, plutonium production was twelve times that of 1947, while uranium-235 production had increased eight-fold.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=255}} The Chief of the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]], Major General [[Kenneth D. Nichols]], saw clearly that the era of scarcity was over. He now "recommended that we should be thinking in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds."{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=269}}

[[Image:WaterScrewPerpetualMotion.png|thumb|right|[[Robert Fludd]]'s 1618 "water screw" perpetual motion machine from a 1660 wood engraving. This device is widely credited as the first recorded attempt to describe such a device in order to produce useful work, that of driving millstones.&lt;ref name="sciam" /&gt; Although the machine would not work, the idea was that water from the top tank turns a [[water wheel]] (bottom-left), which drives a complicated series of gears and shafts that ultimately rotate the [[Archimedes' screw]] (bottom-center to top-right) to pump water to refill the tank.  The rotary motion of the water wheel also drives two grinding wheels (bottom-right) and is shown as providing sufficient excess water to lubricate them.]]

'''Perpetual motion''' is motion of bodies that continues indefinitely.  A '''perpetual motion machine''' is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source. This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate the [[first law of thermodynamics|first]] or [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Derry"&gt;{{cite book

These [[laws of thermodynamics]] apply regardless of the size of the system. For example, the motions and rotations of celestial bodies such as planets may appear perpetual, but are actually subject to many processes that slowly dissipate their kinetic energy, such as [[solar wind]], [[interstellar medium]] resistance, [[gravitational radiation]] and [[thermal radiation]], so they will not keep moving forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=J.

Thus, machines that extract energy from finite sources will not operate indefinitely, because they are driven by the energy stored in the source, which will eventually be exhausted. A common example is devices powered by ocean currents, whose energy is ultimately derived from the Sun, which itself will eventually [[Sun#After core hydrogen exhaustion|burn out]]. Machines powered by more obscure sources have been proposed, but are subject to the same inescapable laws, and will eventually wind down.

In 2017 new states of matter, [[time crystal]]s, were discovered in which on a microscopic scale the component atoms are in continual repetitive motion, thus satisfying the literal definition of "perpetual motion".&lt;ref name="Grossman 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Lisa|title=Death-defying time crystal could outlast the universe|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328484-000-death-defying-time-crystal-could-outlast-the-universe/|website=newscientist.com|publisher=New Scientist|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170202104619/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328484-000-death-defying-time-crystal-could-outlast-the-universe/|archivedate=2017-02-02|date=18 January 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowen 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cowen|first1=Ron|title="Time Crystals" Could Be a Legitimate Form of Perpetual Motion|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|website=scientificamerican.com|publisher=Scientific American|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170202101455/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|archivedate=2017-02-02|date=27 February 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Devin|title=Can matter cycle through shapes eternally?|journal=Nature|year=2013|issn=1476-4687|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13657|url=http://www.nature.com/news/can-matter-cycle-through-shapes-eternally-1.13657|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170203080014/http://www.nature.com/news/can-matter-cycle-through-shapes-eternally-1.13657|archivedate=2017-02-03|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibney 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibney|first1=Elizabeth|title=The quest to crystallize time|journal=Nature|volume=543|issue=7644|year=2017|pages=164–166|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/543164a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-quest-to-crystallize-time-1.21595|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170313115721/http://www.nature.com/news/the-quest-to-crystallize-time-1.21595|archivedate=2017-03-13|ref=harv|bibcode=2017Natur.543..164G|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these do not constitute perpetual motion machines in the traditional sense or violate thermodynamic laws because they are in their quantum [[ground state]], so no energy can be extracted from them; they have "motion without energy".

==History==
{{Main|History of perpetual motion machines}}
The history of perpetual motion machines dates back to the Middle Ages. For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but the development of modern theories of thermodynamics has shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents often use other terms, such as "over unity", to describe their inventions.

There is a [[scientific consensus]] that perpetual motion in an [[isolated system]] violates either the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the [[second law of thermodynamics]], or both. The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of [[conservation of energy]]. The second law can be phrased in several different ways, the most intuitive of which is that [[heat]] flows spontaneously from hotter to colder places; relevant here is that the law observes that in every macroscopic process, there is friction or something close to it; another statement is that no [[heat engine]] (an engine which produces work while moving heat from a high temperature to a low temperature) can be more efficient than a [[Carnot heat engine]].

In other words:

# In any isolated system, one cannot create new energy (law of conservation of energy). As a result, the [[thermal efficiency]]—the produced work power divided by the input heating power—cannot be greater than one. 
# The output work power of heat engines is always smaller than the input heating power. The rest of the heat energy supplied is wasted as heat to the ambient surroundings. The thermal efficiency therefore has a maximum, given by the Carnot efficiency, which is always less than one.
# The efficiency of real heat engines is even lower than the Carnot efficiency due to [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversibility]] arising from the speed of processes, including friction.

Statements 2 and 3 apply to heat engines. Other types of engines which convert e.g. mechanical into electromagnetic energy, cannot operate with 100% efficiency, because it is impossible to design any system that is free of energy dissipation.

Machines which comply with both laws of thermodynamics by accessing energy from unconventional sources are sometimes referred to as perpetual motion machines, although they do not meet the standard criteria for the name.  By way of example, clocks and other low-power machines, such as [[Cox's timepiece]], have been designed to run on the differences in barometric pressure or temperature between night and day. These machines have a source of energy, albeit one which is not readily apparent so that they only seem to violate the laws of thermodynamics.

Even machines which extract energy from long-lived sources - such as ocean currents - will run down when their energy sources inevitably do.  They are not perpetual motion machines because they are consuming energy from an external source and are not isolated systems.

=== Classification ===
One classification of perpetual motion machines refers to the particular law of thermodynamics the machines purport to violate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* A '''perpetual motion machine of the first kind''' produces [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] without the input of [[energy]]. It thus violates the first law of thermodynamics: the [[law of conservation of energy]].
* A '''perpetual motion machine of the second kind''' is a machine which spontaneously converts thermal energy into mechanical work. When the thermal energy is equivalent to the work done, this does not violate the law of conservation of energy. However, it does violate the more subtle [[second law of thermodynamics]] (see also [[entropy]]). The signature of a perpetual motion machine of the second kind is that there is only one heat reservoir involved, which is being spontaneously cooled without involving a transfer of heat to a cooler reservoir. This conversion of heat into useful work, without any side effect, is impossible, according to the second law of thermodynamics.
*A '''perpetual motion machine of the third kind''' is usually (but not always)&lt;ref&gt;An alternative definition is given, for example, by Schadewald, who defines a "perpetual motion machine of the third kind" as a machine that violates the [[third law of thermodynamics]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as dissipation can never be completely eliminated in a mechanical system, no matter how close a system gets to this ideal (see examples in the [[#Low friction|Low Friction]] section).

=== Impossibility ===
[[Image:Perpetual Motion by Norman Rockwell.jpg|thumb|October 1920 issue of ''Popular Science'' magazine, on perpetual motion. Although scientists have established them to be impossible under the laws of physics, perpetual motion continues to capture the imagination of inventors. The device shown is a "mass leverage" device, where the spherical weights on the right have more leverage than those on the left, supposedly creating a perpetual rotation. However, there are a greater number of weights on the left, balancing the device.]]

"[[Epistemic possibility|Epistemic impossibility]]" describes things which absolutely cannot occur within our ''current'' formulation of the physical laws.  This interpretation of the word "impossible" is what is intended in discussions of the impossibility of perpetual motion in a closed system.&lt;ref name=barrow&gt;{{cite book |last= Barrow |first= John D. |title= Impossibility: The Limits of Science and the Science of Limits |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 1998 |isbn=978-0-19-851890-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation laws are particularly robust from a mathematical perspective. [[Noether's theorem]], which was [[Mathematical proof|proven mathematically]] in 1915, states that any conservation law can be derived from a corresponding continuous symmetry of the [[Action (physics)|action]] of a physical system.&lt;ref name="goldstein"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Goldstein	| first1 = Herbert

Scientific investigations as to whether the laws of physics are invariant over time use telescopes to examine the universe in the distant past to discover, to the limits of our measurements, whether ancient stars were identical to stars today. Combining different measurements such as [[spectroscopy]], direct measurement of the [[SN1987A|speed of light in the past]] and similar measurements demonstrates that physics has remained substantially the same, if not identical, for all of observable time spanning billions of years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE410.html "CE410: Are constants constant?"], talkorigins&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of thermodynamics are so well established, both theoretically and experimentally, that proposals for perpetual motion machines are universally met with disbelief on the part of physicists. Any proposed perpetual motion design offers a potentially instructive challenge to physicists: one is certain that it cannot work, so one must explain ''how'' it fails to work. The difficulty (and the value) of such an exercise depends on the subtlety of the proposal; the best ones tend to arise from physicists' own [[thought experiment]]s and often shed light upon certain aspects of physics.  So, for example, the thought experiment of a [[Brownian ratchet]] as a perpetual motion machine was first discussed by [[Gabriel Lippmann]] in 1900 but it was not until 1912 that [[Marian Smoluchowski]] gave an adequate explanation for why it cannot work.&lt;ref name="Harmor"&gt;

Some common ideas recur repeatedly in perpetual motion machine designs. Many ideas that continue to appear today were stated as early as 1670 by [[John Wilkins]], [[Bishop of Chester]] and an official of the [[Royal Society]]. He outlined three potential sources of power for a perpetual motion machine, "{{sic|Chy|mical}} Extractions", "Magnetical Virtues" and "the Natural Affection of Gravity".&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{cite journal

The seemingly mysterious ability of [[magnet]]s to influence motion at a distance without any apparent energy source has long appealed to inventors. One of the earliest examples of a magnetic motor was proposed by Wilkins and has been widely copied since: it consists of a ramp with a magnet at the top, which pulled a metal ball up the ramp. Near the magnet was a small hole that was supposed to allow the ball to drop under the ramp and return to the bottom, where a flap allowed it to return to the top again. The device simply could not work. Faced with this problem, more modern versions typically use a series of ramps and magnets, positioned so the ball is to be handed off from one magnet to another as it moves. The problem remains the same.

[[Image:Perpetuum1.png|thumb|The "Overbalanced Wheel".]]

[[Gravity]] also acts at a distance, without an apparent energy source, but to get energy out of a gravitational field (for instance, by dropping a heavy object, producing kinetic energy as it falls) one has to put energy in (for instance, by lifting the object up), and some energy is always dissipated in the process. A typical application of gravity in a perpetual motion machine is [[Bhaskara II|Bhaskara]]'s wheel in the 12th century, whose key idea is itself a recurring theme, often called the overbalanced wheel: moving weights are attached to a wheel in such a way that they fall to a position further from the wheel's center for one half of the wheel's rotation, and closer to the center for the other half. Since weights further from the center apply a greater [[torque]], it was thought that the wheel would rotate for ever. However, since the side with weights further from the center has fewer weights than the other side, at that moment, the torque is balanced and perpetual movement is not achieved.&lt;ref name="self-oscillation"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = Alejandro| authorlink1=Alejandro Jenkins | title = Self-oscillation | doi = 10.1016/j.physrep.2012.10.007 | journal = Physics Reports | volume = 525 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–222 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1109.6640| bibcode= 2013PhR...525..167J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moving weights may be hammers on pivoted arms, or rolling balls, or mercury in tubes; the principle is the same.

[[File:Perpetual motion wheels Vinci.jpg|thumbnail|left|Perpetual motion wheels from a drawing of [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]
Another theoretical machine involves a frictionless environment for motion. This involves the use of [[diamagnetic]] or [[magnetic levitation|electromagnetic levitation]] to float an object. This is done in a [[vacuum]] to eliminate air friction and friction from an axle. The levitated object is then free to rotate around its center of gravity without interference. However, this machine has no practical purpose because the rotated object cannot do any work as work requires the levitated object to cause motion in other objects, bringing friction into the problem.  Furthermore, a ''perfect'' vacuum is an unattainable goal since both the container and the object itself would slowly [[vaporize]], thereby degrading the vacuum.

To extract work from heat, thus producing a perpetual motion machine of the second kind, the most common approach (dating back at least to [[Maxwell's demon]]) is ''unidirectionality''. Only molecules moving fast enough and in the right direction are allowed through the demon's trap door. In a [[Brownian ratchet]], forces tending to turn the ratchet one way are able to do so while forces in the other direction are not. A diode in a heat bath allows through currents in one direction and not the other. These schemes typically fail in two ways: either maintaining the unidirectionality costs energy (requiring Maxwell's demon to perform more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules than the amount of energy gained by the difference of temperature caused) or the unidirectionality is an illusion and occasional big violations make up for the frequent small non-violations (the Brownian ratchet will be subject to internal Brownian forces and therefore will sometimes turn the wrong way).

[[Image:Prepex2.svg|thumb|The "Float Belt". The yellow blocks indicate floaters. It was thought that the floaters would rise through the liquid and turn the belt. However, pushing the floaters into the water at the bottom takes as much energy as the floating generates, and some energy is dissipated.]]
[[Buoyancy]] is another frequently misunderstood phenomenon. Some proposed perpetual-motion machines miss the fact that to push a volume of air down in a fluid takes the same work as to raise a corresponding volume of fluid up against gravity. These types of machines may involve two chambers with pistons, and a mechanism to squeeze the air out of the top chamber into the bottom one, which then becomes buoyant and floats to the top. The squeezing mechanism in these designs would not be able to do enough work to move the air down, or would leave no excess work available to be extracted.

== Patents ==
Proposals for such inoperable machines have become so common that the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) has made an official policy of refusing to grant [[patent]]s for perpetual motion machines without a working model. The USPTO Manual of Patent Examining Practice states:
{{quote|With the exception of cases involving perpetual motion, a model is not ordinarily required by the Office to demonstrate the operability of a device. If operability of a device is questioned, the applicant must establish it to the satisfaction of the [[patent examiner|examiner]], but he or she may choose his or her own way of so doing.&lt;ref name="mpep_608.03"&gt;{{Cite book

The filing of a patent application is a clerical task, and the USPTO will not refuse filings for perpetual motion machines; the application will be filed and then most probably rejected by the patent examiner, after he has done a formal examination.&lt;ref name="pressman"/&gt; Even if a patent is granted, it does not mean that the invention actually works, it just means that the examiner believes that it works, or was unable to figure out why it would not work.&lt;ref name="pressman"&gt;{{cite book| title=Patent It Yourself | first=David |last=Pressman | edition=13, illustrated, revised | editor=[[Nolo.com|Nolo]] | year=2008 | isbn=1-4133-0854-6 | page=99 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5KGN1yPzPa8C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=U.S.+Patent+4,151,431| publisher=Nolo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apparent perpetual motion machines ==
As "perpetual motion" can exist only in isolated systems, and true isolated systems do not exist, there are not any real "perpetual motion" devices. However, there are concepts and technical drafts that propose "perpetual motion", but on closer analysis it is revealed that they actually "consume" some sort of natural resource or latent energy, such as the phase changes of [[water]] or other fluids or small natural temperature gradients, or simply cannot sustain indefinite operation. In general, extracting work from these devices is impossible.

=== Resource consuming ===
[[Image:Boyle'sSelfFlowingFlask.png|thumb|The "Capillary Bowl"]]

Some examples of such devices include:
* The [[drinking bird]] toy functions using small ambient temperature gradients and evaporation. It runs until all water is evaporated.
* A [[capillary action]]-based water pump functions using small ambient temperature gradients and [[vapour pressure]] differences. With the "Capillary Bowl", it was thought that the capillary action would keep the water flowing in the tube, but since the cohesion force that draws the liquid up the tube in the first place holds the droplet from releasing into the bowl, the flow is not perpetual.
* A [[Crookes radiometer]] consists of a partial vacuum glass container with a lightweight propeller moved by (light-induced) temperature gradients.
* Any device picking up minimal amounts of energy from the natural [[electromagnetic radiation]] around it, such as a solar powered motor.
* Any device powered by changes in air pressure, such as some clocks ([[Cox's timepiece]],  [[Beverly Clock]]). The motion leeches energy from moving air which in turn gained its energy from being acted on.
* The [[Atmos clock]] uses changes in the vapor pressure of ethyl chloride with temperature to wind the clock spring.
* A device powered by [[radioactive decay]] from an isotope with a relatively long [[half-life]]; such a device could plausibly operate for hundreds or thousands of years.
* The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] and [[Karpen Pile]] driven by [[Voltaic pile|dry pile]] batteries.

=== Low friction ===
* In [[flywheel energy storage]], "modern flywheels can have a zero-load rundown time measurable in years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country=WO

* Once spun up, objects in the vacuum of space—stars, black holes, planets, moons, [[spin-stabilized satellite]]s, etc.—dissipate energy very slowly, allowing them to spin for long periods. [[Tide]]s on Earth are dissipating the gravitational energy of the Moon/Earth system at an [[average]] rate of about 3.75 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Munk1998&gt;{{Cite journal

* In certain quantum-mechanical systems (such as [[superfluidity]] and [[superconductivity]]), very low friction movement is possible. However, the motion stops when the system reaches an equilibrium state (e.g. all the [[Rollin film|liquid helium]] arrives at the same level.) Similarly, seemingly entropy-reversing effects like superfluids climbing the walls of containers operate by ordinary [[capillary action]].

=== Thought experiments ===
In some cases a [[Thought experiment|thought]] (or ''gedanken'') experiment appears to suggest that perpetual motion may be possible through accepted and understood physical processes.  However, in all cases, a flaw has been found when all of the relevant physics is considered.  Examples include:
* [[Maxwell's demon]]:  This was originally proposed to show that the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] applied in the statistical sense only, by postulating a "demon" that could select energetic molecules and extract their energy. Subsequent analysis (and experiment) have shown there is no way to physically implement such a system that does not result in an overall increase in [[entropy]].
* [[Brownian ratchet]]: In this thought experiment, one imagines a paddle wheel connected to a ratchet. [[Brownian motion]] would cause surrounding gas molecules to strike the paddles, but the ratchet would only allow it to turn in one direction. A more thorough analysis showed that when a physical ratchet was considered at this molecular scale, Brownian motion would also affect the ratchet and cause it to randomly fail resulting in no net gain. Thus, the device would not violate the [[Laws of thermodynamics]].
* [[Vacuum energy]] and [[zero-point energy]]: In order to explain effects such as [[virtual particles]] and the [[Casimir effect]], many formulations of [[quantum physics]] include a background energy which pervades empty space, known as vacuum or zero-point energy. The ability to harness zero-point energy for useful work is considered [[pseudoscience]] by the scientific community at large.&lt;ref name=army&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[U.S. Army]] [[National Ground Intelligence Center]]|url=http://info.publicintelligence.net/USArmy-ZeroPointEnergy.pdf|title=Zero-Point Energy: Can We Get Something From Nothing?|author=Amber M.

In [[physics]], the '''Planck mass''', denoted by ''m''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, is the unit of [[mass]] in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. It is approximately [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#microgram|0.02 milligrams]]. Unlike some other Planck units, such as [[Planck length]], Planck mass is not a fundamental lower or upper bound; instead, Planck mass is a unit of mass defined using only what [[Max Planck]] considered fundamental and universal units. One Planck mass is roughly the mass of a [[flea egg]]&lt;ref&gt;"average weight of a flea egg ({{val|3.42|e=-2|u=mg}})" M. W. Dryden, ''Blood consumption and feeding behavior of the cat flea'' (1990) p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;.
For comparison, this value is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; (a quadrillion) times  larger than the highest energy available to contemporary [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maximum energy of the [[Large Hadron Collider]]: 13 TeV (as of 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], and ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

Substituting values for the various components in this definition gives the approximate equivalent value of this unit in terms of other units of mass:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 \ m_\mathrm{P} &lt;/math&gt; ≈ {{val|1.220910|e=19|ul=GeV/c2}} = {{physconst|mP}} = {{val|21.76470|ul=mcg}} = {{val|1.3107|e=19|ul=u}}.&lt;ref&gt;CODATA 2016: [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?plkmc2gev value in GeV], [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?plkm value in kg]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Planck mass]] &lt;math&gt;m_{\rm P} = \sqrt{\hbar c/G}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Schwarzschild radius]] (&lt;math&gt;r_{\rm S} = 2 l_{\rm P}&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[Compton wavelength]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\rm C} = 2 \pi l_{\rm P}&lt;/math&gt;) are of the same order as the [[Planck length]] &lt;math&gt;l_{\rm P} = \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}&lt;/math&gt;.


[[Particle physics|Particle physicists]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmologists]] often use an [[Planck units#Gravity|alternative normalization]] with the '''reduced Planck mass''', which is
:&lt;math&gt;M_\text{P} = \sqrt\frac{\hbar c}{8\pi G}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ {{val|4.341|e=-9|u=kg}} = {{val|2.435|e=18|ul=GeV/c2}}.
The factor of  &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{8\pi}&lt;/math&gt;  simplifies a number of equations in [[general relativity]].

==History ==

{{see also|Planck Units#History}}

The Planck mass was first suggested by [[Max Planck]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Planck. Naturlische Masseinheiten. Der Koniglich Preussischen Akademie Der Wissenschaften, p. 479, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; in 1899. He suggested that there existed some fundamental natural units for length, mass, time and energy. He derived these units using only dimensional analysis of what he considered the most fundamental universal constants: the speed of light, the Newton gravitational constant, and the Planck constant.

==Derivations==

===Dimensional analysis===
The formula for the Planck mass can be derived by [[dimensional analysis]]. In this approach, one starts with the three [[physical constant]]s ''ħ'', ''c'', and ''G'', and attempts to combine them to get a quantity whose dimension is mass. The formula sought is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{P} = c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \hbar^{n_3},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2,n_3&lt;/math&gt; are constants to be determined by equating the dimensions of both sides. Using the symbols &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{M}&lt;/math&gt; for mass, &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}&lt;/math&gt; for length and &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt; for time, and writing [{{mvar|x}}] to denote the dimension of some physical quantity {{mvar|x}}, we have the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\,[c]\,=\mathsf{L}\mathsf{T}^{-1} \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[G]=\mathsf{M}^{-1}\mathsf{L}^3\mathsf{T}^{-2} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\,[\hbar]\,=\mathsf{M}\mathsf{L}^2\mathsf{T}^{-1} \ &lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;[c^{n_1} G^{n_2} \hbar^{n_3}] = \mathsf{M}^{-n_2+n_3} \mathsf{L}^{n_1+3n_2+2n_3} \mathsf{T}^{-n_1-2n_2-n_3}.&lt;/math&gt;
If one wants this to equal &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{M}&lt;/math&gt;, the dimension of mass, using &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{M} = \mathsf{M}^1\mathsf{L}^0\mathsf{T}^0&lt;/math&gt;, the following equations need to hold:
:&lt;math&gt;~~~~~~~~~-n_2 + ~~n_3 = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;~~~n_1 + 3n_2 + 2n_3 = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-n_1 - 2n_2 - ~~n_3 = 0 \ &lt;/math&gt;.
The solution of this system is:
:&lt;math&gt;n_1 = 1/2, n_2 = -1/2, n_3 = 1/2. \ &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the Planck mass is:
:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{P} = c^{1/2}G^{-1/2}\hbar^{1/2} = \sqrt{\frac{c\hbar}{G}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Dimensional analysis can only determine a formula [[up to]] a [[dimensionless]] multiplicative factor. There is no ''a priori'' reason for starting with the reduced Planck constant ''ħ'' instead of the original Planck constant ''h'', which differs from it by a factor of 2π.

===Elimination of a coupling constant===
Equivalently, the Planck mass is defined such that the [[gravitational potential energy]] between two masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; of separation ''r'' is equal to the energy of a photon (or the mass-energy of a [[graviton]], if such a particle exists) of angular wavelength ''r'' (see the [[Planck relation]]), or that their ratio equals one.
:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{G m_\text{P}^2}{r}=\frac{\hbar c}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;
Isolating ''m''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, we get that
:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{P}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that if, instead of Planck masses, the electron mass were used, the equation would require a [[gravitational coupling constant]], analogous to how the equation of the [[fine-structure constant]] relates the [[elementary charge]] and the [[Planck charge]]. Thus, the Planck mass can be viewed as resulting from absorbing the gravitational coupling constant into the unit of mass (and those of distance/time as well), like the Planck charge does for the fine-structure constant.

In [[physical anthropology]], '''post-orbital constriction,''' often referred to as the post-orbital constriction index, is a narrowing of the cranium (skull) just behind the eye sockets (the orbits, hence the name), in [[primates]] &amp;mdash; including primitive [[hominids]]. This constriction is very noticeable in non-human primates, slightly less so in [[Australopithecines]], even less in [[Homo erectus]] and the most primitive [[Homo sapiens]].&lt;ref name="Cameron-304" /&gt; The post-orbital constriction index of archaic ''[[Homo]]'' species begins to fall within the range of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' during the Mid-[[Pleistocene|Pleistocene era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rightmire|first=G.

In species such as [[Baboon|baboons]] and African [[Hominidae|great apes]], an increase in the available capacity of the [[infratemporal fossa]] is simultaneously accompanied by a constriction in the [[sagittal plane]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KUBO|first=DAISUKE|last2=KONO|first2=REIKO T.|last3=SUWA|first3=GEN|date=2012|title=Endocranial proportions and postorbital morphology of the Minatogawa I and IV Late Pleistocene Homo sapiens crania from Okinawa Island, Japan|url=https://doi.org/10.1537/ase.110804|journal=Anthropological Science|language=en|volume=120|issue=2|pages=179–194|doi=10.1537/ase.110804|issn=0918-7960}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the anterior and posterior portions of the anterior temporalis muscle are inversely correlated in size, with the anterior being larger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the [[Temporal muscle|temporalis]] muscle is used for chewing, there is no evidence that the supraorbital structure of primates is dependent upon their respective chewing habits or dietary preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picq|first=Pascal|date=1994|title=Craniofacial size and proportions and the functional significance of the supraorbital region in primates|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25757416|journal=Zeitschrift für Morphologie und Anthropologie|volume=80|issue=1|pages=51–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-orbital constriction is defined by either a ratio of minimum frontal breadth (MFB) behind the [[supraorbital torus]] divided by maximum upper facial breadth (bifrontomalare temporale, BFM) or as the maximum width behind the orbit of the skull.&lt;ref name="Cameron-304" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimbel|first=William H.|last2=White|first2=Tim D.|last3=Johanson|first3=Donald C.|date=1984-08|title=Cranial morphology ofAustralopithecus afarensis: A comparative study based on a composite reconstruction of the adult skull|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ajpa.1330640403|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=fr|volume=64|issue=4|pages=337–388|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330640403|issn=0002-9483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monson|first=Tesla|last2=F.

'''Relative hour''' ([[Hebrew]] singular: {{transl|he|shaʿah zǝmanit}} / {{lang|he|שעה זמנית}}; plural: {{transl|he|shaʿot - zǝmaniyot}} / {{lang|he|שעות זמניות}}), sometimes called '''halachic hour''', '''seasonal hour''' and '''variable hour''', is a term used in [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic Jewish]] law that assigns 12 hours to each day and 12 hours to each night, all throughout the year. A relative hour has no fixed radical, but changes with the length of each day - depending on summer (when the days are long and the nights are short), and on winter (when the days are short and the nights are long). Even so, in all seasons a day is always divided into 12 hours, and a night is always divided into 12 hours, which inevitably makes for a longer hour or a shorter hour.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33); ''Questions and Responsa of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Joshua Blau), vol. 1, Rubin Mass publishers: Jerusalem 1989, ''responsum'' # 134 (pp. 251–255);  [[Yaakov de Castro]], ''`Erekh Leḥem'' (''Orach Chaim'' §233:2)&lt;/ref&gt; All of the hours mentioned by the [[Sages of Israel|Sages]] in either the [[Mishnah]] or [[Talmud]], or in other rabbinic writings, refer strictly to relative hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33), who wrote: "Be apprised that all of the hours that are mentioned throughout all the Mishnah are none other than relative hours, and the word ''relative'' has the connotation of those hours wherein there are twelve in the daytime, as also at night."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Questions and Responsa of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. Joshua Blau), vol. 1, Rubin Mass publishers: Jerusalem 1989, ''responsum'' # 134 (p. 252)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of this ancient practice is that, unlike the standard modern [[12-hour clock]] that assigns 12 o'clock pm for [[noon]] time, in the ancient Jewish tradition noon time was always the ''sixth hour'' of the day, whereas the ''first hour'' began with the break of [[dawn]], by most exponents of Jewish law,&lt;ref&gt;''Magen Avraham'' §58:1, §433:3 of R. [[Avraham Gombiner]]; [[Maimonides]]' commentary on Mishnah ''Megillah'' 2:4; the Responsa ''Terumat HaDeshen'', ''responsum'' # 1 of R. [[Israel Isserlein]]; the ''Levush'' §267 of R. [[Mordecai Yoffe]]; ''Minchat Kohen'' (Mevoh Shemesh 2:6) of R. [[Abraham Cohen Pimentel]], in the name of Tosefot Ha-Ramban ([[Nachmanides]]) and R. [[Shlomo ben Aderet]] (Rashba); ''Bayit Chadash'' §431 of R. [[Joel Sirkis]]; ''Turei Zahav'' §433 of R. [[David HaLevi Segal]]; ''Pri Chadash'' §433 of R. [[Hezekiah da Silva]]; ''Eliyahu Rabbah'' 58:2 of R. [[Elijah Spira]]; ''Mizbe’ach Adamah'' 4a of R. Mordechai Chaim Meyuchas; ''Mikra'ei Kodesh'' 158b by R. Baruch Gigi; ''Mateh Yehuda'' §433 of R. Yehudah Ayash; the Responsa ''Hayim Sha'al'' 2:38 (70) of R. [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]]; ''Tov Ayin'' 18:38 of R. Alter Yechiel Naiman; ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' 21:3, 27:1 of R.

[[Eliezer Papo]]; ''Shiltei ha-Gibborim'' 58:3 of [[Joshua Boaz ben Simon Baruch]]; ''Rav Poalim'' (Orach Chaim 2:2); ''Shalmei Tzibbur'' 93c of R. Yisrael Ya'akov Algazi, among others. Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tukachinsky in ''Sefer Eretz Yisrael'' (p. 18:3) has written that the custom of the Land of Israel is to follow the ''Magen Avraham'' and only under extenuating circumstances may one rely on the Vilna Gaon.&lt;/ref&gt; and with sunrise by the [[Vilna Gaon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bi'urei ha-Gra'' ("Elucidations of the Gra") §459:2&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]. 12:o'clock am (midnight) was also the ''sixth hour'' of the night, whereas the ''first hour'' of the night began when the first three stars appeared in the night sky.

==Jewish tradition==
In old times, the hour was detected by observation of the position of the sun,&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Ravid ha-Zahav of Rabbi David Mishreqi (Mizrachi)'', ed. Shimon Giat, Betar-Ilit 2002, Responsa ''Ravid Ha-Zahav'', ''responsum'' # 13, s.v. ונהירנא (p. 182)&lt;/ref&gt; or when the first three stars appeared in the night sky. During the first six hours of the day, the sun is seen in the eastern sky. At the ''sixth hour'', the sun is always at its [[zenith]] in the sky, meaning, it is either directly overhead, or parallel (depending on the [[Hemispheres of the Earth|hemisphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Pesahim'' 12b; 11b&lt;/ref&gt; Those persons living in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the south, whereas for those living in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the north. From the 6th and a half hour to the 12th hour, the sun inclines towards the west, until it sets. The conclusion of a day at the end of twilight may slightly vary in minutes from place to place, depending on the elevation and the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Meir Kagan]], ''[[Mishnah Berura]]'' on ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Orah Hayyim'' 261:2:23), otherwise known as the time it takes to walk "three quarters of a biblical mile."&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, nightfall ushers in more quickly in the low-lying valleys, than it does on a high mountaintop.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Shabbat'' 118b) we read: Rabbi Jose has said: “Let my portion be with those who usher in the Sabbath day [at its outset] in [[Tiberias]], and with those who dismiss the Sabbath day [at its recess] in [[Sepphoris]].” This has been explained by Aaron Mordechai Freedman (editor of the 1987 Soncino edition of ''Tractate Shabbath''): "In Tiberias, which was situated in a valley, the Sabbath commenced rather earlier, whilst in Sepphoris, which was on a mountain, it terminated rather later than elsewhere." (v. ''Hebrew-English Edition of the Babylonian Talmud'', Tractate Shabbath, Soncino edition, London 1987, s.v. ''Shabbath'' 118b, note (b)3).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freedman's description of twilight being, literally, an oscillating physical reality dependent upon one's location is supported by Rabbi [[Joseph ibn Migash]] (1077–1141) [''Responsa of R. Joseph ibn Migash'', ''responsum'' # 45] and by Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]] (c. 1479–1573) [''Responsa of Rabbi David ben Zimra'', book I, ''responsum'' # 76], as also by Rabbi Hayyim Eliezer, the son of [[Isaac ben Moses of Vienna]] (13th century), who also compiled a book called "Or Zarua" (''responsum'' # 186). Apparently, there is a local phenomenon relating to light emanating from fixed stars in the sky, and their becoming visible once a certain level of darkness has enveloped the land. [[Rashi]], however, differs in view, whose opinion is supported also by Rabbi [[Menachem Meiri]] (1249–1306) Langa's Edition, p. 460, and Rabbi [[Nissim ben Jacob]] (990–1062), and who all thought that twilight was a fixed time for all, but that the people of Tiberias and Sepphoris were merely stringent in their religious practices, the one group welcoming the Sabbath early, while the other departing from it as late as possible.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The conventional Jewish way of calibrating the time of day is to reckon the "first hour" of the day with the rise of [[dawn]] ({{Lang-he-n|עמוד השחר}}), that is to say, approximately 72 minutes before sunrise,&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33); ''Megillah'' 2:4 (p. 232)&lt;/ref&gt; and the end of the day commencing shortly after sunset when the first three medium-size stars have appeared in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;''Responsa of Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]]'', Book 4, Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), s.v. ''responsum'' # 1353 (282)&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment of sunset when the sun is no longer visible until the appearance of the first three medium-size stars is a unit of time called evening [[twilight]] ({{Lang-he-n|בין השמשות}}). In the Talmud, twilight is estimated at being the time that it takes a person to walk three quarters of a [[biblical mile]] (i.e. 1,500 cubits, insofar that a biblical mile is equal to 2,000 cubits).&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Shabbat'' 34b&amp;ndash;35a; [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]], ''Birkei Yosef'' (Orah Hayyim, § 261:1), Levorno 1774, citing the author of ''Ginat Weradim'', who wrote: "The world has it as a practice in all the Diaspora communities of Israel [to follow the opinion of] the ''[[Geonim]]''" (i.e. with respect to the time of ''bayn ha-shemashot'' (twilight; nightfall), so that immediately following sunset begins the time known as ''bayn ha-shemashot'', which is the time it takes to walk three quarters of a biblical mile). The opinion of Rabbi Chaim Azulai comes to counter a variant opinion that is also found in the Talmud (''Pesahim'' 94a), where it states that a man is able to walk four ''mil'' between sunset and nightfall, an opinion rejected by most exponents of Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Yosef Karo|Maran]]'s ''Shulhan Arukh'', a man traverses a biblical mile in 18 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Karo, ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''[[Orah Hayyim]]'' § 459:2)&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, one is able to walk three quarters of a mile in 13½ minutes. According to [[Maimonides]], a man walks a biblical mile in 24 minutes, meaning, three quarters of a mile is done in 18 minutes. In Jewish law, the short period of dusk or twilight (from the moment the sun has disappeared over the horizon until the appearance of the first three stars) is a space of time whose designation is doubtful, partly considered day and partly considered night. When the first medium-size star appears in the night sky, it is still considered day; when the second star appears, it is an ambiguous case. When the third star appears, it is the beginning of the ''first hour'' of the night. Between the break of dawn and the first three medium-size stars that appear in the night sky there are always 12 hours.

In the [[Modern Age]] of astral science and of precise astronomical calculations, it is now possible to determine the length of the ever-changing hour by simple mathematics. To determine the length of each relative hour, one needs but simply know two variables: (a) the precise time of sunrise, and (b) the precise time of sunset. Since the actual day begins approximately 72 minutes before sunrise, and ends 13½ minutes after the sun has already set and can no longer be seen over the horizon (according to Maran),&lt;ref&gt;Shulhan Arukh (''Orah Hayyim'' § 261:2)&lt;/ref&gt; or 18 minutes (according to Maimonides), by collecting the total number of minutes in any given day and dividing the total number of minutes by 12, the dividend that one is left with is the number of minutes to each hour. In summer months, when the days are long, the length of each hour during daytime can be as much as 77 minutes or more, whereas the length of each hour during nighttime can be less than 42 minutes.

==Practical bearing==
In Jewish [[Halacha]], the practical bearing of this teaching is reflected in many ''[[halachic]]'' practices. For example, whenever observant Jews refer to the appointed time for reciting the verses of ''[[Kriyat Shema]]'', ideally, this recital must be made from the time of sunrise until the end of the ''third hour'' of the day, a time that actually fluctuates on the standard 12-hour clock, depending on summer and winter.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 1:5 (p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt; Its application is also used in determining the time of the [[Shacharit|Morning Prayer]], traditionally said, as a first resort, from sunrise until the end of the ''fourth hour'',&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Karo, ''Shulhan Arukh'' (''[[Orah Hayyim]]''  § 89:1)&lt;/ref&gt; but as a last resort can be said until noon time,&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Berakhot'' 4:1 (Maimonides, [[Mishne Torah]], ''Hil. Tefillah'' 3:1) &lt;/ref&gt; and which times will vary if one were to rely solely on the dials of the standard [[12-hour clock]], depending on the Summer months and Winter months.

On the [[eve of Passover]], Jews are only permitted to eat leavened bread-stuffs until the ''fourth-hour'' of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah ([https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Pesachim.1.4?lang=bi ''Pesahim'' 1:4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish tradition, prayers were usually offered at the time of the [[Whole-burnt offering|daily whole-burnt offerings]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rabbeinu Hananel's Commentary on Tractate Berakhot'' (ed. David Metzger),Jerusalem 1990, s.v. ''Berakhot'' 26a (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian, [[Josephus]], writing about the daily whole-burnt offering, says that it was offered twice each day, in the morning and about the ''ninth hour''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (xiv.iv.§ 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]], a compendium of Jewish oral laws compiled in the late 2nd-century CE, says of the morning daily offering that it was offered in the ''fourth hour'',&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Eduyot'' 6:1&lt;/ref&gt; but says of the late afternoon offering: "The daily whole-burnt offering was slaughtered at a half after the ''eighth hour'', and offered up at a half after the ''ninth hour''."&lt;ref name=MishnahPesahim&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. ''Pesahim'' 5:1, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, when describing the slaughter of the [[Passover offering]]s on the eve of Passover (the 14th day of the lunar month [[Nisan]]), Josephus writes: "...their feast which is called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ''ninth hour'' to the ''eleventh'', etc." (roughly corresponding to 3 o'clock pm to 5 o'clock pm).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Wars of the Jews|Wars]]'' (vi.ix.§ 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Mishnah states that on the eve of Passover the daily whole-burnt offering was slaughtered at a half past the ''seventh hour'', and offered up at a half past the ''eighth hour''.&lt;ref name=MishnahPesahim/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20338">The '''Research Excellence Framework''' is the successor to the [[Research Assessment Exercise]]. It is an [[impact evaluation]] which assesses the research of British higher education institutions. It was first used in 2014 to assess the period 2008–2013.&lt;ref name="ref2014results"&gt;{{cite web | title=Results &amp; submissions : REF 2014 | url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/ | accessdate=22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atkinson2014"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | title=Assess the real cost of research assessment | author=Atkinson, Peter M. | department=World View | page=145 | date=11 December 2014 | type=paper | volume=516 | issue=7530 | doi=10.1038/516145a}}&lt;/ref&gt; REF is undertaken by the four UK higher education funding bodies: [[Research England]], the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC), the [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]] (HEFCW), and the Department for the Economy, [[Northern Ireland]] (DfE). 

Its stated aims are to provide accountability for public investment in research, establish "reputational yardsticks",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the REF? |url=http://www.ref.ac.uk/about/whatref/ |website=REF2021 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. Critics argue, inter alia, that there is too much focus on the impact of research outside of the university system, and that impact has no real relevance to the quality of research. It is suggested that REF actually encourages mediocrity in published research, and discourages research which might have value in the long term. 

The next iteration of the REF will be in 2021, continuing the previous assessment model of focusing on research outputs, research impact and research environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ref.ac.uk/news/2017/decisionsonstaffandoutputs.html|title=2017 : Funding bodies confirm shape of REF 2021 - REF 2021|last=England|first=Higher Funding Council of|website=www.ref.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In June 2007 the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) issued a circular letter announcing that a new framework for assessing research quality in UK universities would replace the [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE), following the 2008 RAE.&lt;ref name="eastwood2007"&gt;{{cite web | title=Future framework for research assessment and funding | date=6 March 2007 | author=Eastwood, David | author-link=David Eastwood | url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/circlets/2007/cl06_07/ | publisher=[[HEFCE]] | id=circular letter number 06/2007 | deadurl=yes | archivedate=2 February 2010 | archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100202100434/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/circlets/2007/cl06_07/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following quote from the letter indicates some of the original motivation:

{{quote|Our key aims for the new framework will be:
*to produce robust UK-wide indicators of research excellence for all disciplines which can be used to benchmark quality against international standards and to drive the Council's funding for research
*to provide a basis for distributing funding primarily by reference to research excellence, and to fund excellent research in all its forms wherever it is found
*to reduce significantly the administrative burden on institutions in comparison to the RAE
*to avoid creating any undesirable behavioural incentives
*to promote equality and diversity
*to provide a stable framework for our continuing support of a world-leading research base within HE.}}

The letter also set out a timetable for the development of the REF.  HEFCE undertook a consultation exercise during September–December 2009, soliciting responses from stakeholders on the proposals.&lt;ref name="2009-38letter"&gt;{{cite web | title=Research Excellence Framework: Second consultation on the assessment and funding of research |date=September 2009  | url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2009/200938/ | publisher=[[HEFCE]] | id=2009/38 | accessdate=10 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include for example the response from [[Universities UK]],&lt;ref name="uukdoc2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/PolicyAndResearch/PolicyAreas/Documents/REFUUKFinal13Dec2009.doc | format=[[Doc (computing)|.doc]] | title=Universities UK response to HEFCE consultation on the Research Excellence Framework (REF) | date=13 December 2009 | publisher=[[UUK|Universities UK]] | deadurl=yes | archivedate=16 July 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233249/http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/PolicyAndResearch/PolicyAreas/Documents/REFUUKFinal13Dec2009.doc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the response from the [[University and College Union]].&lt;ref name="ucupdf2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/pdf/1/h/ucu_REFresponse_dec09.pdf | format=PDF | title=Response to the Research Excellence Framework: Second consultation on the assessment and funding of research |date=December 2009 | publisher=[[University and College Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 (following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 general election]]), the Universities and Science minister [[David Willetts]] announced that the REF will be delayed by a year in order to assess the efficacy of the impact measure.&lt;ref name="baker2010"&gt;{{cite news | last=Baker | first=Simon | title=REF postponed while Willetts waits for impact 'consensus' | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/412384.article | work=[[Times High. Educ.]] | date=8 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, [[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Lord Nicholas Stern's]] review was published, drafting general guidelines for the next REF in 2021.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/541338/ind-16-9-ref-stern-review.pdf|title=Building on Success and Learning from Experience|last=Stern et al|first=Lord Nicholas|date=July 2016|website=gov.uk|publisher=UK Government|access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the review was supportive with the methodology used in 2014 to evaluate universities' research, however it emphasised the need for more engagement with the general public and the increase of number of case studies that undertook [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Research-impact.org team at [http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/sbe/ Loughborough University Business and Economic School] have been experimenting with [[crowdfunding]] for research in order to increase the university's researchers' public engagement.&lt;ref name=tzarubin&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aesisnet.com/newsletter-november-rubin/|title=Is it possible to get the crowd to fund research, isn’t it the government’s role?|last=Rubin|first=Tzameret|date=2017|work=|newspaper=AESIS|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Impact ==
REF's impact was defined as "an effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/rsrch/REFimpact/|title=REF impact - Higher Education Funding Council for England|last=England|first=Higher Education Funding Council for|website=www.hefce.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grading criteria==

Submissions are assessed according to the following criteria:&lt;ref name="ref02.2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ref.ac.uk/media/ref/content/pub/assessmentframeworkandguidanceonsubmissions/GOS%20including%20addendum.pdf | format=PDF | title=Assessment framework and guidance on submission |date=July 2011 | page=43 | id=REF 02.2011 | publisher=Research Excellence Framework }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Four star: Quality that is world-leading in originality, significance and rigour.
*Three star: Quality that is internationally excellent in originality, significance and rigour but which falls short of the highest standards of excellence.
*Two star: Quality that is recognised internationally in originality, significance and rigour.
*One star: Quality that is recognised nationally in originality, significance and rigour.
*Unclassified Quality: that falls below the standard of nationally recognised work. Or work which does not meet the published definition of research for the purposes of this assessment.

==Performance rankings==
Two publishers, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/dec/18/university-research-excellence-framework-2014-full-rankings&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Times Higher Education]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/research-excellence-framework-ref-2014&lt;/ref&gt; produce overall rankings of '''multidisciplinary''' universities based on power and quality(GPA).

Power rankings aim to show universities with a breadth of quality, while Quality rankings aim to show the depth of quality.

''The Guardian'' Power rankings only consider rankings graded at Four and Three star, while ''Times Higher Education'' Power rankings consider rankings across all gradings.

An additional Quality ranking is the one ranking institutions according to the proportion of their research graded as "Four star". That is, submitted researches graded as "Quality that is world-leading in originality, significance and rigour".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30521423&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticism==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
A particular source of criticism has been the element of the REF that addresses the "impact" of research. The articles below raise two objections. The main one is that "impact" has been defined to mean impact outside the academy. If researchers were required to pursue this form of impact, it would undermine [[academic freedom]]. The other is that impact—as currently construed—is hard to measure in any way that would be regarded as fair and impartial.&lt;ref name="shepherd2009"&gt;{{cite news | title=Humanities research threatened by demands for 'economic impact' | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/oct/13/research-funding-economic-impact-humanities | work=[[Guard.|The Guardian]] | department=Education | location=London | first=Jessica | last=Shepherd | date=13 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oswald2009"&gt;{{cite news | author=Oswald, Andrew | author-link=Andrew Oswald | title=REF should stay out of the game | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/andrew-oswald-ref-should-stay-out-of-the-game-1827306.html | work=[[Indep.|The Independent]] | location=London | date=26 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farmesto2009"&gt;{{cite news | title=Poisonous Impact | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/409403.article | author=Fernández-Armesto, Felipe | author-link=Felipe Fernández-Armesto | date=3 December 2009 | work=[[Times High. Educ.|Times Higher Education]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] argue that their measure of "impact" is a broad one which will encompass impact upon the "economy, society, public policy, culture and the quality of life".&lt;ref name="shepherd2009" /&gt;. However, the assessment structure does make what impact practically can be claimed rather narrow (4 page limit, no method section, 10 impact references, 10 research references and only 1 page to summarize the research and the impact respectively). These strict discursive guidelines alongside the REF's dated notion of how research impact functions (teaching research impact excluded, linear model, etc.) does restrict what impact is suited practically more for the assessment. 

Another area of criticism, which the REF inherited from the structure of the RAE, is that for most full-time staff members submission normally consists of four published 'research output items'. There is no recognition of the difference between a book and an article in terms of research value. Therefore, the REF system discourages long term projects that strive for excellence. This problem is particularly evident in the humanities, where most of the ground-breaking research is traditionally not published in articles. Therefore, many researchers are pushed towards a relatively mediocre activity, which will allow them to produce one or two books during the assessment period, but not the kind of monograph that normally would need four or five years of research and writing.

Moreover, the system of the four published items discourages long-term projects with relatively high research risk in the sciences as well, since researchers are reluctant to engage in projects or experiments that may not be successful and may not lead to a publication. Since most of the ground-breaking research in the sciences takes place with precisely such risky and imaginative projects, the type of research activity that is encouraged by the REF structure is quite conservative. Also, in terms of the impact of the examined research, in the history of the sciences and the humanities it is not unusual to take some time until the full impact of a discovery is made. The present system has a vista of only four or five years.

The Times Higher Education also revealed that some universities appeared to be "gaming" the REF system. This included "REF Poaching", in which staff with established research records were headhunted from their universities immediately before the REF, giving the poaching institution full credit for their publications without having taken the risk of supporting the researcher. It also included employing large numbers of staff on 0.2 FTE contracts, the lowest level of employment that qualifies them for REF submission.&lt;ref name="jump2013"&gt;{{cite news | date=26 September 2013 | author=Jump, Paul | title=Twenty per cent contracts rise in run-up to REF | work=[[Times High. Educ.|Times Higher Education]] | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/twenty-per-cent-contracts-rise-in-run-up-to-ref/2007670.article }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such concerns about what really can be measured by four research output items, and how impact may be measured, the whole system is often criticized as unnecessarily complex and expensive, whereas quality evaluation in the digital age could be much simpler and effective.&lt;ref name="dunleavy2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2011/06/10/ref-alternative-harzing-google-scholar/ | author=Dunleavy, Patrick | author-link=Patrick Dunleavy | title=The Research Excellence Framework is lumbering and expensive. For a fraction of the cost, a digital census of academic research would create unrivalled and genuine information about UK universities’ research performance | date=10 June 2011 | publisher=[[London School of Economics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system, with its associated financial implications, has also been criticised for diverting resources from teaching. As such, increases in student fees may often not have resulted in more staff time being spent on teaching.

In July 2016, [[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Lord Nicholas Stern's]] review was published, drafting general guidelines for the next REF in 2021. &lt;ref&gt;Stern, L. (2016). Building on Success and Learning from Experience: An Independent Review of the Research Excellence Framework.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the recommendation was to increase research public engagement. Research engagement means enhancing delivery of the benefits from research. It also means making the public more aware of the research findings and their implications. One mechanism for public engagement is [[crowdfunding]] for research, where dedicated platforms host crowdfunding campaigns for university research, in a range of topics. Crowdfunding for research has two advantages: one, it is a source for a relatively high guaranteed funding, with a rate of around 50%, second, it is a very effective tool to engage with the general public.&lt;ref name=tzarubin/&gt;

One problem that the Stern review did not address in relation to the research impact assessment, is that the structure of case study design template on which impact is assessed, does not contain a method section, and thereby making the assessment of what type of impact was claimed a rhetoric game of who can claim the most (cf. Brauer, 2018).&lt;ref&gt; Brauer, R. (2018): What research impact? Tourism and the changing UK research ecosystem. Guildford: University of Surrey (PhD thesis). available at: http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/id/eprint/846043  &lt;/ref&gt; Thereby, grand claims are incentivized by the assessment structure. The problem occurs, because qualitative judgments of the significance and reach of the impact (without an account of the underlying method) cement contemporary values into the assessment, as such; "[…] ''call it socially constructed, mutual learning, social practice whatever, the key is that we can’t separate characteristics of Impact from the process imposed on value and recognise it as such.''" (Derrick, 2018:160)&lt;ref&gt;Derrick, G. (2018). The evaluators’ eye: Impact assessment and academic peer review. Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; When checking the reference of current claims, these where either not accessible (e.g. the relevant websites were taken down), referenced in such a way that it didn't reflect self-authorship or testimonials of individuals connected to the researcher (Brauer, 2018:142-147). Similarly, Sayer (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Sayer, D. (2014). Rank hypocrisies: The insult of the REF. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes the overall peer review of the REF process, describing it as poor simulacrum of standard academic quality and that the assessment process is further complicated by the sheer workload of the assessment (p. 35). On a similar note, a RAND study found that the majority of the references were never consulted, certain assessment panels were discouraged from using the internet and the reference help structure of the REF took sometimes two weeks to produce associated references &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/hefce-ref2014-impact.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Thereby, the external impact focus disciplines the assessment into focusing on external values&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/evaluating-impact-component-ref2014.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This ossifyies contemporary societal values into academic culture, due to the missing method section where rigor in impact claim that challenge current social values potentially could have been shown. In an assessment of current impact submissions none of the reported impacts include such claims.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

'''Restoring force''', in a [[physics]] context, is a [[force]]  that gives rise to an [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] in a physical system. If the system is perturbed away from the equilibrium, the restoring force will tend to bring the system back toward equilibrium.  The restoring force is a function only of position of the mass or particle.  It is always directed back toward the [[equilibrium point|equilibrium position]] of the system. The restoring force is often referred to in simple harmonic motion. The force which is responsible to restore original size and shape is called restoring force.&lt;ref name="giord"&gt;

An example is the action of a [[Spring (device)|spring]].  An idealized spring exerts a force that is proportional to the amount of deformation of the spring from its equilibrium length, exerted in a direction to oppose the deformation. Pulling the spring to a greater length causes it to exert a force that brings the spring back toward its equilibrium length.   The amount of force can be determined by multiplying the [[Hooke's law|spring constant]] of the spring by the amount of stretch.

Another example is of a pendulum. When the pendulum is not swinging all the forces acting on the pendulum are in equilibrium. The force due to gravity and the mass of the object at the end of the pendulum is equal to the tension in the string holding that object up. When a pendulum is put in motion the place of equilibrium is at the bottom of the swing, the place where the pendulum rests. When the pendulum is at the top of its swing the force bringing the pendulum back down to this midpoint is gravity. As a result gravity can be seen as the restoring force in this.

A '''slapper detonator''', also called '''exploding foil initiator''' ('''EFI'''), is a relatively recent kind of a [[detonator]] developed by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], US Patent No. 4,788,913. It is an improvement of the earlier [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]; instead of directly coupling the shock wave from the exploding wire, the expanding plasma from an explosion of a metal foil drives another thin plastic or metal foil called a "flyer" or a "slapper" across a gap, and its high-velocity impact on the [[explosive]] (for example, [[PETN]] or [[hexanitrostilbene]]) then delivers the energy and shock needed to initiate a [[detonation]]. Normally all the slapper's kinetic energy is supplied only by the heating (and hence expansion) of the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (the former foil) by the current passing through it, though constructions with a "back strap" to further drive the plasma forward by [[magnetic field]] exist too. This assembly is quite efficient; up to 30% of the electrical energy can be converted to the slapper's kinetic energy.

The initial explosion is usually caused by explosive vaporization of a thin metal wire or strip, by driving several thousand amperes of electric current through it, usually from a [[capacitor]] charged to several thousand volts. The switching may be done by a [[spark gap]] or a [[krytron]].

Usually the construction consists of an [[explosive booster]] pellet, against which a disk with a hole in the center is set. Over the other side of the disk, there is a layer of an insulating film, for example, [[Kapton]] or [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]], with a thin strip of metal (typically aluminum or gold) foil deposited on its outer side. A narrowed section of the metal then explosively vaporizes when a current pulse passes through it, which shears the mylar foil and the plasma ball pushes it through the hole, accelerating it to very high speed. The impact then detonates the explosive pellet.

[[Image:SlapperDetArea.png|thumb|right|250px|Diagram of slapper and EBW detonators initiating detonation.  '''(A)''' Slapper detonator's pellet or flyer impacts a wider area of surface on the explosive output charge, and even though energy is lost to the sides of the area impacted, a cone of explosive is efficiently compressed.  '''(B)''' EBW detonators only initiate a single point, and energy is lost in all directions, making the energy transfer less efficient.]]
Advantages over explosive-bridgewire detonators include:
* The foil does not come in contact with the explosive, which reduces the risk of corrosion of the foil or chemical reactions between the foil and explosive producing unstable compounds, and secondarily further reduces the risk of accidental electrical ignition of the explosive.
* The energy to fire the detonator is quite low
* The slapper pellet impacting an area of explosives rather than a single point as in an EBW is more reliable and efficient at initiating detonation.
* The explosive can be pressed to higher density
* Very insensitive explosives can be initiated directly.

In a variant called '''laser detonator''' the vaporization can be caused by a high-power [[laser]] pulse delivered over-the-air or coupled by an [[optical fiber]]; this is reportedly used as a safety detonator in some [[mining]] operations and [[quarry|quarries]]. Typically a 1-watt [[List of laser types#Solid-state lasers|solid-state laser]] is used.

The slapper detonators are frequently used in modern weapon designs and aerospace technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">The metaphor of a '''trading zone''' is being applied to collaborations in [[science]] and [[technology]].  The basis of the metaphor is anthropological studies of how different cultures are able to exchange goods, despite differences in language and culture.  

==Overview==
[[Peter Galison]] produced the "trading zone" metaphor in order to explain how physicists from different paradigms went about collaborating with each other and with engineers to develop [[particle detector]]s and [[radar]].

According to Galison, "Two groups can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly different significance to the objects being exchanged; they may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process itself.  Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a local coordination, despite vast global differences.  In an even more sophisticated way, cultures in interaction frequently establish contact languages, systems of discourse that can vary from the most function-specific jargons, through semispecific pidgins, to full-fledged creoles rich enough to support activities as complex as poetry and metalinguistic reflection" (Galison 1997, p. 783)

In the case of radar, for example, the physicists and engineers had to gradually develop what was effectively a [[pidgin]] or [[creole language]] involving shared concepts like ‘equivalent circuits’ that the physicists represented symbolically in terms of field theory and the engineers saw as extensions of their radio toolkit. 

Exchanges across disciplinary boundaries can also be carried out with the help of an agent: a person who is familiar enough with the language of two or more cultures to facilitate trade.

At one point in the development of [[MRI]], surgeons saw a lesion where an engineer familiar with the device would have recognized an artifact produced by the way the device was being used.  It took someone with expertise in both physics and surgery to see how each of the different disciplines viewed the device, and develop procedures for correcting the problem (Baird &amp; Cohen, 1999).  The ability to converse expertly in more than one discipline is called [[interactional expertise]] ([[Harry Collins|Collins]] &amp; Evans, 2002).

==Areas of Application==
*The U.S. [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]] calls for a “broadly inclusive interdisciplinary dialogue on nanotechnology” that would incorporate a wide range of stakeholders (http://www.nano.gov/html/society/Responsible_Development.htm).  This kind of a dialogue will require developing [[creole language|creoles]] that allow  different stakeholders to communicate, and also [[interactional expertise]] (Gorman, Groves, &amp; Catalano, 2004). 
*The [[Converging technologies|convergence]] between nano, bio, information and cognitive technologies will set an even greater premium on the development of trading zones and [[interactional expertise]] (Gorman, 2004).
*[[Computer science]] education requires development of trading zones between experts  in the social and learning sciences and computer scientists (Fincher &amp; Petre, 2004).  Each of these communities uses different methods and speaks a different language, hence the need for a creole and also for [[interactional expertise|interactional experts]].
*Managing [[Natural environment|environmental systems]] like the [[Everglades]] also requires the development of  trading zones (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bwfuller/Trading_Zone_Paper--Boyd_Fuller--Distribution--Jan_1-05.pdf). Brad Allenby suggests the development of a new kind of expertise in [[Earth Systems Engineering and Management]], which will include an interactional component (Allenby, 2005).

A workshop at Arizona State University on Trading Zones, [[Interactional expertise|Interactional Expertise]] and [[Interdisciplinary Collaboration]] raised the possibility of applying these concepts to other applications like global health and service science, and also identified avenues for future research (https://archive.is/20121215123346/http://bart.tcc.virginia.edu/Tradzoneworkshop/index.htm).

{{essay|date=June 2018}}
The '''triangular theory of love''' is a theory of [[love]] developed by [[Robert Sternberg]], a member of the Psychology Department at [[Yale University]].  During his time as a professor, Sternberg emphasized his research in the fields of intelligence, creativity, wisdom, leadership, thinking styles, ethical reasoning, love, and hate.  In the context of [[interpersonal relationship]]s, "the three components of love, according to the triangular theory, are an intimacy component, a passion component, and a decision/commitment component."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Sternberg |chapter=Triangulating Love |editor-first=T. J. |editor-last=Oord |title=The Altruism Reader: Selections from Writings on Love, Religion, and Science |year=2007 |location=West Conshohocken, PA |publisher=Templeton Foundation |page=332 |isbn=9781599471273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternberg says that intimacy refers to "feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness in loving relationships", passion refers to "the drives that lead to romance, physical attraction, sexual consummation, and related phenomena in loving relationships" and decision/commitment means different things in the short and long term. In the short-term, it refers to "the decision that one loves a certain other", and in the long-term, it refers to "one's commitment to maintain that love."&lt;ref name="Sternberg, Robert 1997"/&gt;

==Dictionary definitions==
The three components of love are as follows

[[Passion (emotion)|Passion]]: Passion can be associated with either physical arousal or emotional stimulation. Passion is defined in three ways:

# A strong feeling of enthusiasm or excitement for something or about doing something&lt;ref name="Webster, Noah 1953"&gt;Webster, Noah. New Collegiate Dictionary. A Merriam-Webster. Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam, 1953. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A strong feeling (such as anger) that causes people  to act in a dangerous way
# strong sexual or romantic feeling for someone

[[Intimacy]]: Intimacy is described as the feelings of closeness and attachment to one another. This tends to strengthen the tight bond that is shared between those two individuals. Additionally, having a sense of intimacy helps create the feeling of being at ease with one another, in the sense that the two parties are mutual in their feelings.

Intimacy is primarily defined as something of a personal or private nature; familiarity.&lt;ref name="Webster, Noah 1953"/&gt;

[[Promise|Commitment]]: Unlike the other two blocks, commitment involves a conscious decision to stick with one another. The decision to remain committed is mainly determined by the level of satisfaction that a partner derives from the relationship. There are three ways to define commitment:

# A promise to do or give something
# A promise to be loyal to someone or something
# the attitude of someone who works very hard to do or support something&lt;ref name="Webster, Noah 1953"/&gt;

"The amount of love one experiences depends on the absolute strength of these three components, and the type of love one experiences depends on their strengths relative to each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Sternberg |chapter=A Triangular Theory of Love |editor1-first=H. T. |editor1-last=Reis |editor2-first=C. E. |editor2-last=Rusbult |title=Close Relationships |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |page=258 |isbn=0863775950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different stages and types of love can be explained as different combinations of these three elements; for example, the relative emphasis of each component changes over time as an adult romantic relationship develops. A relationship based on a single element is less likely to survive than one based on two or three elements.

==Early theories of love==

One of the first theories of love was developed by [[Sigmund Freud]].  As Freud so frequently attributed human nature to unconscious desires, his theory of love centered around the need for an "ego ideal".&lt;ref&gt;3.0.CO;2-4&lt;/ref&gt;  His definition of an [[ego ideal]] is this: the image of the person that one wants to become, which is patterned after those whom one holds with great respect.

Another theory was introduced by Maslow.  Maslow's hierarchy of needs places self-actualization at the peak.  He maintains that those who have reached self-actualization are capable of love.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, Robert 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sternberg |first=Robert J. |title=Construct validation of a triangular love scale |year=1997 |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=313–335 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199705)27:3&lt;313::AID-EJSP824&gt;3.0.CO;2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another theory, one about being in love, was developed by Reik.  Being in love was said to be attainable for those who could love for the sake of loving people, not just fixing one's own problem.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, Robert 1997"/&gt;

When theories about love moved from being clinically based to being socially and personality based, they became focused on types of love, as opposed to becoming able to love.

Of the multiple different early and later theories of love, there are two specific early theories that contribute to and influence Sternberg's theory.

The first is a theory presented by Zick Rubin named The Theory of Liking vs. Loving.  In his theory, to define romantic love, Rubin concludes that attachment, caring, and intimacy are the three main principles that are key to the difference of liking one person and loving them.  Rubin states that if a person simply enjoys another's presence and spending time with them, that person only likes the other.  However, if a person shares a strong desire for intimacy and contact, as well as cares equally about the other's needs and their own, the person loves the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Zick|title=Measurement of Romantic Love|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=16|doi=10.1037/h0029841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sternberg's theory, one of his main principles is intimacy.  It is clear that intimacy is an important aspect of love, ultimately using it to help define the difference between compassionate and passionate love.

The second is a theory—The Color Wheel Model of Love—presented by John Lee.  In his theory, using the analogy of primary colors to love, Lee defines the three different styles of love.  These include Eros, Ludos, and Storge.  Most importantly within his theory, he concludes that these three primary styles, like the making of complementary colors, can be combined to make secondary forms of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colors of Love|last=Lee|first=John A.|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1976|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sternberg's theory, he presents, like Lee, that through the combination of his three main principles, different forms of love are created.

Sternberg also described three models of love, including the Spearmanian, Thomsonian, and Thurstonian models. According to the Spearmanian model, love is a single bundle of positive feelings. In the Thomsonian model, love is a mixture of multiple feeling that, when brought together, produce the feeling. The Spearmanian model is the closest to the triangular theory of love, and dictates that love is made up of equal parts that are more easily understood on their own than as a whole. In this model, the various factors are equal in their contribution to the feeling, and could be disconnected from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.. "A Triangular Theory of Love." ''Psychological Review.'' American Psychological Association, Inc., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elaboration==

Sternberg's triangular theory of love was developed after the identification of passionate love and companionate love.  Passionate love and companionate love are different kinds of love but are connected in relationships.

Passionate love is associated with strong feelings of love and desire for a specific person.  This love is full of excitement and newness.  Passionate love is important in the beginning of the relationship and typically lasts for about a year.  There is a chemical component to passionate love.  Those experiencing passionate love are also experiencing increased neurotransmitters, specifically [[phenylethylamine]].&lt;ref name="Levy, P. E. 2013 pp. 316-317" /&gt; These feelings are most commonly found in the most early stages of love.

Companionate love follows passionate love.  Companionate love is also known as affectionate love.  When a couple reaches this level of love, they feel mutual understanding and care for each other.  This love is important for the survival of the relationship.&lt;ref name="Levy, P. E. 2013 pp. 316-317"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=P. E. |year=2013 |title=Industrial Organizational Psychology |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Worth |pages=316–317 |isbn=9781429242295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of love comes later on in the relationship and requires a certain level of knowledge for each person in the relationship.

Sternberg created his triangle next. The triangle's points are intimacy, passion, and commitment.

Intimate love is the corner of the triangle that encompasses the close bonds of loving relationships.  Intimate love felt between two people means that they each feel a sense of high regard for each other.  They wish to make each other happy, share with each other, be in communication with each other, help when one is in need.  A couple with intimate love deeply values each other.&lt;ref name="Levy, P. E. 2013 pp. 316-317"/&gt; Intimate love has been called the "warm" love because of the way it brings two people close together.  Sternberg's prediction of this love was that it would diminish as the relationship became less interrupted, thus increasing predictability.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acker |first=M. |last2=Davis |first2=M. |title=Intimacy, passion, and commitment in adult romantic relationships: a test of the triangular theory of love |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships |volume=9 |year=1992 |issue=1 |pages=21–50 |doi=10.1177/0265407592091002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passionate love is based on drive.  Couples in passionate love feel physically attracted to each other.  Sexual desire is typically a component of passionate love.  Passionate love is not limited to sexual attraction, however.  It is a way for couples to express feelings of nurture, dominance, submission, self-actualization, etc.&lt;ref name="Levy, P. E. 2013 pp. 316-317"/&gt;  Passionate love is considered the "hot" component of love because of the strong presence of arousal between two people. Sternberg believed that passionate love will diminish as the positive force of the relationship is taken over by opposite forces. This idea comes from Solomon's opponent-force theory.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt;

Commitment, or committed love, is for lovers who are committed to being together for a long period of time.  Something to note about commitment, however, is that one can be committed to someone without feeling love for him or her, and one can feel love for someone without being committed to him or her.&lt;ref name="Levy, P. E. 2013 pp. 316-317"/&gt; Commitment is considered to be the "cold" love because it does not require either intimacy or passion. Sternberg believed that committed love increases in intensity as the relationship grows.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt; Commitment can be considered for friends as well.

Sternberg believed love to progress and evolve in predictable ways; that all couples in love will experience intimate, passionate, and committed love in the same patterns.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt;

Although these types of love may contain qualities that exist in non-loving relationships, they are specific to loving relationships.  A description of non-love is listed below, along with the other kinds of love.  These kinds of love are combinations of one or two of the three corners of Sternberg's triangle of love.

The three components, pictorially labeled on the vertices of a triangle, interact with each other and with the actions they produce so as to form seven different kinds of love experiences (nonlove is not represented). The size of the triangle functions to represent the "amount" of love—the bigger the triangle, the greater the love. Each corner has its own type of love and provides different combinations to create different types of love and labels for them. The shape of the triangle functions to represent the "style" of love, which may vary over the course of the relationship:

*'''Non love''' The absence of any of the three types of love. No connection. Indifferent to relationship. 
*'''Liking/friendship''' This type of love is intimacy without passion or commitment. This includes friendships and acquaintances.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Company of Others|last=Rothwell|first=J. Dan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=224|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Infatuated love''': Infatuated love is passion without intimacy or commitment. This is considered "[[puppy love]]" or relationships that have not become serious yet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Romantic relationships often start out as infatuated love and become romantic love as intimacy develops over time. Without developing intimacy or commitment, infatuated love may disappear suddenly.
*'''Empty love''' is characterized by commitment without intimacy or passion. A stronger love may deteriorate into empty love. In an [[arranged marriage]], the spouses' relationship may begin as empty love and develop into another form, indicating "how empty love need not be the terminal state of a long-term relationship...[but] the beginning rather than the end".&lt;ref name="Sternberg268"&gt;Sternberg, in ''Close Relationships'' p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Romantic love''' This love is passionate and intimate but has no commitment. This could be considered a romantic affair or could be a one-night stand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Companionate love''' is an intimate, non-passionate type of love that is stronger than friendship because of the element of long-term commitment. "This type of love is observed in long-term marriages where passion is no longer present"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. B. |last=Ashford |title=Human Behavior in the Social Environment |publisher=Gardners Books |year=2009 |page=498 |isbn=9780495604662 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but where a deep affection and commitment remain. The love ideally shared between family members is a form of companionate love, as is the love between close friends who have a [[Platonic love|platonic]] but strong friendship.
*'''Fatuous love''' can be exemplified by a whirlwind courtship and marriage—it has points of passion and commitment but no intimacy. An example of this is "love at first sight".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Consummate love''' is the complete form of love, representing an ideal relationship which people strive towards. Of the seven varieties of love, consummate love is theorized to be that love associated with the "perfect couple". According to Sternberg, these couples will continue to have great sex fifteen years or more into the relationship, they cannot imagine themselves happier over the long-term with anyone else, they overcome their few difficulties gracefully, and each delight in the relationship with one other.&lt;ref name=sternberg3&gt;"Cupid's Arrow - the Course of Love through Time" by Robert Sternberg. Publisher: Cambridge University Press (1998) {{ISBN|0-521-47893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sternberg cautions that maintaining a consummate love may be even harder than achieving it. He stresses the importance of translating the components of love into action. "Without expression," he warns, "even the greatest of loves can die."&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Sternberg, "Liking versus Loving" ''Psychological Bulletin'' (1987) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, consummate love may not be permanent.{{Citation needed|reason=Is this Sternberg's conclusion?|date=July 2014}} If passion is lost over time, it may change into companionate love. Consummate love is the most satisfying kind of adult relation because it combines all pieces of the triangle into this one type of love. It is the ideal kind of relationship. These kinds of relationships can be found over long periods of time or idealistic relationships found in movies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Sternberg's triangular theory of love provides a strong foundation for his later theory of love, entitled Love as a Story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=What's Your Love Story?|journal=Psychology Today}}[https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200007/whats-your-love-story What's Your Love Story]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this theory, he explains that the large numbers of unique and different love stories convey different ways of how love is understood.  He believes, over time, this exposure helps a person determine what love is or what it should be to them.  These two theories create Sternberg's duplex theory of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Love as a Story|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=12|doi=10.1177/0265407595124007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Personal relationships that have the greatest longevity and satisfaction are those in which partners are constantly working on sustaining intimacy and reinforcing commitment to each other."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mixed support==

In a study done by Michele Acker and Mark Davis in 1992, Sternberg's triangular theory of love was tested for validity.  By studying a population that extended outside the typically studied group of 18 to 20-year-old college students, Acker and Davis were able to study more accurately the stages of love in people.  Some criticism of Sternberg's theory of love is that although he predicted the stages of a person's love for another person, he did not specify a time or point in the relationship when the stages would evolve.  He does not specify whether the different parts of love are dependent on duration of relationship or on the particular stage that relationship has reached.  Acker and Davis point out that the stage and duration of the relationship are potentially important to the love component and explore them.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt;

They find that there are no exact answers because not only each couple, but each individual in the couple experiences love in a different way.  There are three perceptions of the triangular theory of love, or "the possibility of multiple triangles".  Multiple triangles can exist because individuals can experience each component of love (or point of the triangle) more intensely than another.  These separate triangles, according to Acker and Davis and many others, are 'real' triangles, 'ideal' triangles, and 'perceived' triangles.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt;

These 'real' triangles are indicative of how each individual views the progress and depth of his or her relationship.  The 'ideal' triangles are indicative of each individual's ideal qualities of his or her partner/relationship.  The 'perceived' triangles are indicative of each individual's ideas of how his or her partner is viewing the relationship.  If any of these three separate triangles do not look the same as a person's partner's triangles, dissatisfaction is likely to increase.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt;

Sternberg's triangular theory of love, may not be as simple as he initially laid it out to be.  Sternberg measured his theory on couples who were roughly the same age (mean age of 28) and whose relationship duration was roughly the same (4 to 5 years).  His sample size was limited in characteristic variety.  Acker and Davis announced this issue as being one of three major problems with Sternberg's theory.  Romantic love, in particular, is not often the same in undergraduate level couples as couples who are not undergrads.  Acker and Davis studied a sample that was older than Sternberg's sample of undergraduates.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt; Sternberg himself did this in 1997.&lt;ref name="Sternberg, Robert 1997"/&gt;

The two other most obvious problems with Sternberg's theory of love are as follows.  The first is a question of the separate nature of the levels of love.  The second is a question of the measures that have previously been used to assess the three levels of love.&lt;ref name="Acker, M. 1992"/&gt; These problems with Sternberg's theory continued to be studied, for example Lomas (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|

'''Vantablack''' is a material developed by Surrey NanoSystems in the [[United Kingdom]] and is one of the [[dark]]est substances known, [[Optical properties of carbon nanotubes|absorbing up to 99.6% of radiation in the visible spectrum]].&lt;ref name="NBCNews"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/vantablack-u-k-firm-shows-worlds-darkest-material-n155581 |title=Vantablack: U.K. Firm Shows Off 'World's Darkest Material'| date=15 July 2014| website=NBCNews.com| accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness World Records]]: [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/darkest-manmade-substance/ ''Darkest manmade substance''], 19 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name is a compound of the acronym (''VANTAs'') ''[[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]]'' &lt;ref name="PubsAcsOrg"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nano |url= http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn102029y |doi= 10.1021/nn102029y |title= Pulsed Growth of Vertically Aligned Nanotube Arrays with Variable Density |first1= Jeremy J. |last1= Jackson |first2= Alex A. |last2= Puretzky |first3= Karren L. |last3= More |first4= Christopher M. |last4= Rouleau |first5= Gyula |last5= Eres |first6= David B. |last6= Geohegan  |date= 3 Dec 2010 |publisher= [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) |accessdate = 9 Oct 2016 |pages= 7573&amp;ndash;7581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the shade ''black''.

==Properties==
[[File:Vantablack 02.JPG|thumb|Vantablack grown on metal foil]]
Vantablack is composed of a forest of vertical tubes "grown" on a substrate using a modified [[chemical vapor deposition]] process (CVD). When light strikes Vantablack, instead of bouncing off from it, it becomes trapped and is continually deflected amongst the tubes, eventually becoming absorbed and dissipating into heat.&lt;ref name="SCFP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1554903/vantablack-worlds-darkest-material-unveiled-uk-firm|title=Vantablack, the world's darkest material, is unveiled by UK|date=15 July 2014|website=South China Morning Post - World|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vantablack was an improvement over similar substances developed at the time. Vantablack absorbs 99.965% of visible light and can be created at {{convert|400|C}}. [[NASA]] had previously developed a similar substance that was grown at {{convert|750|C}}, so it required materials to be more heat resistant than Vantablack.&lt;ref name="SCFP" /&gt;

The [[outgassing]] and [[particulates|particle fallout]] levels of Vantablack are low. The high levels in similar substances in the past had limited their commercial utility. Vantablack also has greater resistance to [[mechanical vibration]], and has greater thermal stability.&lt;ref name="YahooCa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/scientists-developed-black-deep-makes-3d-objects-look-233004466.html?pt=Array|title=Scientists have developed a black so deep it makes 3D objects look flat| author= Kuittinen, Tero  | date= 14 July 2014|website=Yahoo!

==Applications==
Being the blackest material, this substance has many [[Potential applications of carbon nanotubes|potential applications]], including preventing [[stray light]] from entering telescopes, and improving the performance of [[infrared camera]]s both on Earth and in space.&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt; Ben Jensen, Chief Technology Officer, Surrey NanoSystems, has explained: "For example, it reduces stray light, improving the ability of sensitive telescopes to see the faintest stars... Its ultra-low reflectance improves the sensitivity of terrestrial, space and air-borne instrumentation."&lt;ref name="HuffPost"/&gt;

Vantablack may also increase the absorption of heat in materials used in [[concentrated solar power]] technology, as well as military applications such as [[thermal camouflage]]. Its [[emissivity]] and [[scalability]] support a wide range of applications.

In addition to directly growing aligned carbon nanotubes, Vantablack is made into two sprayable paints with randomly-oriented nanotubes, Vantablack S-VIS and Vantablack S-IR with better infrared absorption than the former. These paints require a special license, a temperature of 100&amp;ndash;280&amp;nbsp;°C, and vacuum post-processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vantablack S-IR|url=https://www.surreynanosystems.com/super-black-coatings/vantablack-s-ir|website=Surrey NanoSystems|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrey NanoSystems also markets a line of non-nanotube sprayable paints known as Vantablack VBx that are even easier to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vantablack VBx Coatings|url=https://www.surreynanosystems.com/super-black-coatings/vbx-coatings|website=Surrey NanoSystems|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanolab, a [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]-based carbon nanotube manufacturer, partnered with [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] artist Jason Chase to release a nanotube-based black paint called Singularity Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/395360/meet-singularity-black-the-blackest-paint-on-the-market/|title=Meet Singularity Black, the Blackest Paint on the Market|date=2017-08-11|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first showing of the colour, Chase, alluding to Vantablack, stated that "its possibilities have been stunted by not being available to experiment with," and Singularity Black's release was important to create access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/08/16/nanolab-releases-singularity-black-paint-rival-anish-kapoor-vantablack-design-news/|title=Nanolab releases own extremely black paint to rival Anish Kapoor's Vantablack|date=2017-08-16|work=Dezeen|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artreport.com contributor Jazia Hammoudi opined that the controversy had been manufactured by the media,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://artreport.com/anish-kapoor-vantablack-manufactured-moral-outrage/|title=Anish Kapoor, Vantablack And Manufactured Moral Outrage - Art Report|date=2016-03-10|work=Art Report|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the author of an article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine suggested that the controversy between the artists and its online response was a spontaneous piece of collective performance art in itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The manufacturer claims that Vantablack is subject to [[export control]]s by the UK, and due to its physical requirements and thermal characteristics, the original Vantablack is not practical for use in many types of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreynanosystems.com/vantablack/faqs|title=FAQs|website=Surrey NanoSystems|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vantablack VBx2, a variant of the non-nanotube Vantablack VBx that is optimized for large area spraying, was used in a "Vantablack pavilion" at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asif Khan reveals super-dark Vantablack pavilion for Winter Olympics 2018|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2018/02/07/asif-khan-coats-pavilion-super-dark-vantablack-vbx2-pyeongchang-winter-olympics-2018-worlds-darkest-material/|website=Dezeen|date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
