'''Aanerud Industries''' is a Norwegian design company with its offices based in [[Oslo]], Norway and its workshop in [[Skogbygda, Akershus|Skogbygda]], Norway. [[Simen Aanerud]] is the founder and [[Managing director|Managing Director]] of the company.

==History==
A relatively young company, Aanerud Industries has made a sizeable impact in the design world. In 2013 the company created much of the exhibition items for the [[BikBok]] flagship store in Oslo, Norway. They also made contribution to the then newly created [[Mathallen]]. The company was started by Simen Aanerud and firstly created custom racks for food storage. From there it has grown to make interiors for restaurants, shops, and private residences. The idea behind all of its design and processes is "turning creativity into joy". Founder Simen Aanerud gave a [[Pecha Kucha]] talk in Oslo on how he works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/webtv/serier-og-programmer/pecha-kucha/--Dette-gjor-hjernen-min-nar-jeg-gar-pa-gaten-7401262.html#.U9PawBY47jR "- Dette gjør hjernen min når jeg går på gaten"], ''[[Aftenposten]]'', Oslo, 10 December 2013.

The '''Academy of Music''', also known as '''American Academy of Music''', is a concert hall and opera house located at 240 S. [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Its location is between Locust and Manning Streets in the [[Avenue of the Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Avenue of the Arts]] area of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]].

The hall was built in 1855–57 and is the oldest opera house in the [[United States]] that is still used for its original purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Di Nardo, "Happy birthday: Academy of Music to celebrate 150 lavish years." ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' (January 24, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the "Grand Old Lady of Locust Street," the venue is the home of the [[Pennsylvania Ballet]] and [[Opera Philadelphia]]. It was also home to the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] from its inception in 1900 until 2001, when the orchestra moved to the new [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts]]. The Philadelphia Orchestra still retains ownership of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/2007-01-26/news/25221486_1_opera-house-philadelphia-orchestra-concert-hall |title=A stalwart hall that does it all |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |author=Peter Dobrin |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;Charles E. Shedd, Jr., et al. (December 1979) {{NHLS url|id=66000674|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: American Academy of Music; Academy of Music}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000674|title=''Accompanying one photo, exterior, undated''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:American Academy of Music 1856.jpg|left|thumb|Share of the American Academy of Music, issued 15. October 1856]]
The Academy of Music held an inaugural [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] on January 26, 1857. At the time ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the theater as "magnificently gorgeous, brilliantly lighted, solidly constructed, finely located, beautifully ornamented" but went on to lament "all that lacks is a few singers to render it 'the thing'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1857/01/30/77069900.html?pageNumber=4|title=Article 8 -- No Title|page=4|date=January 30, 1857|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre had its first opera production, and what was billed as its formal opening, a month later on February 25, 1857, with a performance by the [[Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company]] of Verdi's ''[[Il trovatore]]'' starring [[Marietta Gazzaniga]] as Leonora, [[Alessandro Amodio]] as Count di Luna, [[Zoë Aldini]] as Azucena, [[Pasquale Brignoli]] as Manrico, and [[Max Maretzek]] conducting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1857/02/26/archives/the-philadelphia-academy-of-music.html|title=The Philadelphia Academy of Music.|date=March 26, 1857|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maretzek, who was already presenting operas at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music in New York City]] and at the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]] in Philadelphia since 1850, brought his company back annually to the Academy of Music in Philadelphia through 1873. Due to his association with both the Philadelphia and New York City Academy of Music venues, his company was sometimes referred to as the Academy of Music Opera Company.

The Academy has been in continuous use since 1857, hosting many world-famous performers, conductors and composers, and a significant number of American premieres of works in the standard operatic and classical repertoire. Noted operas that had their American premieres there include Strauss's ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', [[Charles Gounod|Gounod's]] ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]''. In 1916, [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the American premiere of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]] (the ''Symphony of a Thousand'').

The list of artists who have performed at the Academy of Music, from the 20th century, includes such figures as [[Marian Anderson]],  [[Maria Callas]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Edith Piaf]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Tony Bennett]] (in 1962), [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Artur Rubinstein]], [[Isaac Stern]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Joan Sutherland]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], among many others. After the Philadelphia Orchestra moved to the Kimmel Center, the 21st century brought more non-classical artists to the Academy, among them [[Noel Gallagher]] who appeared there in 2011.

Outside of arts events, it hosted various public meetings including the 1872 [[Republican National Convention]].  Possibly America's first indoor football game took place here in 1889 between the University of Pennsylvania and a club from Princeton resulting in a 0-0 tie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.kimmelcenter.org/post/153432702159/its-football-sunday-once-again-did-you-know-the Kimmel Center website]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, parts of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'' were filmed in the Academy.  Despite its name, the Academy has never contained a music school.  Various voice and instrumental competitions have taken place there, including the Pavarotti competition.

==Design==
[[File:Interior-Philadelphia Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|left|200 px| Interior, Philadelphia Academy of Music]]
An architectural competition for the Academy's design was announced in October 1854 and was won by the Philadelphia firm of [[Napoleon LeBrun]] and Gustavus Runge. A style of architecture that originated in Runge's native Germany now known as [[Rundbogenstil]] ("round arch style") was used for the exterior here and in a number of American buildings of the Civil War Era. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 18, 1855, with President [[Franklin Pierce]] in attendance and the venue opened with a grand ball on January 26, 1857.  The first opera performed there was the [[Western Hemisphere]] premiere of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Il Trovatore]]'', on February 25 of the same year.

In order to reserve as much of the budget for the interior as possible, the architects designed a relatively plain brick and brownstone exterior that could be clad in marble if funds became available later. The ornate auditorium has an "open horseshoe" shape and proscenium columns with elliptical cross-sections in order to provide more direct sight lines from the seats in the side balconies. The auditorium is enclosed by a solid three-foot brick wall with studding and pine boards lining the inner sides to prevent echoes and absorb sound. The upper balconies are recessed in a tiered fashion and supported by 14 Corinthian columns. An unusual feature was that the boxes were originally placed against the rear wall on the second and third levels (Balcony and Family Circle). They were divided from each other by walls that curved down from the ceilings. These have since been removed and boxes created elsewhere. The front of the first balcony is highly ornamented. The hall currently has a seating capacity of 2,389 which can be expanded to 2,509 when seats are placed in the orchestra pit and proscenium boxes. An 1860 account by Runge mentioned that the full auditorium, then nearly 3,000 persons, could be emptied in four minutes in "great calmness and order" owing to the wide corridors and stairways.

===Interior===
[[File:Philadelpia Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|Chandelier and murals]]
[[File:Academy of Music Proscenium (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Proscenium wall and boxes. Architectural ornament by Charles Bushor and [[Joseph A. Bailly]]]]
[[File:Mozart-Philadeplhia Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|Bust of Mozart with figures of Poetry and Music]]
The auditorium is graced by a large crystal chandelier, which measures {{convert|16|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter,   and weighs {{convert|5000|lb|abbr=on}}. When installed, the chandelier contained 240 gas jets, which were converted to electricity in 1900, and rewired in 1957.  That same year, it was fitted with an electric-powered winch.  It previously required 12 people working four-hours to lower it by hand.  The fixture was restored to its original form and missing crystals replaced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.philorch.org/pdfs/AOMchandeliertimeline.pdf Philadelphia Orchestra, "Crystal Chandelier"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The heat produced by the original gas fixtures helped to ventilate the hall by causing air to rise to various vents along the back walls and in the center of the ceiling.

Atop the proscenium is a [[bas-relief]] bust of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].  Seated on the [[cornice]] above are the figures of Poetry, on the left, and Music, on the right. The elaborate carvings and gilded wood sculpture decorations throughout the auditorium are the work of Charles Bushor and [[Joseph A. Bailly]] and the ceiling murals of allegorical figures were completed by Karl Hermann Schmolze.

The original stage curtain was of crimson fabric with heavy golden fringe, ropes, tassels, etc. by J. R. Martin of Berlin.  A secondary curtain had a scene of Lake Como, Italy, painted by Russell Smith of Philadelphia.

The original seating on the Parquet and first balcony had arms and upholstery with springs and a covering of dark red plush fabric.  The second balcony had "sofas without arms" and the third, pew-like seating. These were mostly replaced with more typical theater seating. The installation of more spacious seating began in 2018.

A 2007 donation of [[United States dollar|$]]5.3 million by Leonore Annenberg was designated for restoration of the Academy's ballroom.&lt;ref name="pledge"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Dobrin|title=Academy ballroom gets major pledge|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/peter_dobrin/20070123_Academy_ballroom_gets_major_pledge_.html|date=23 January 2007|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was part of the almost $12 million (USD) in donations raised at the 150th anniversary concert for the Academy of Music.&lt;ref name="treasure"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Dobrin|title=Ways to show we treasure our Academy |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/peter_dobrin/20070201_Ways_to_show_we_treasure_our_Academy_.html|date=1 February 2007|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustics===
For many decades, Philadelphia regarded the Academy as having excellent acoustics that were wrongly attributed to a circular brick chamber under the floor of the auditorium.&lt;ref name="Christopher N. Brooks 2002 p. 60"&gt;Christopher N. Brooks, ''Architectural Acoustics'' (2002), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=vimSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=acoustics+myths+academy+of+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8NVosW2f5Z&amp;sig=d4JhbCl03N_Pfq4iXCWWGs40ZTM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFy5fsg4XXAhUm94MKHccPDRsQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=acoustics%20myths%20academy%20of%20music&amp;f=false] It was intended by the architects that sound penetrating the "elastic floor" would reverberate in this chamber and emerge into the auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;G. Runge, Das neue Opernhaus „Academy of music" in Philadelphia, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; [https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/image/15239363_1860_03/4/]  Unfortunately, this device was ineffective as little sound could pass through the floor in either direction.  The ceiling of the auditorium was deliberately designed not to be a sound reflector for fear of echoes.

Some have found the Academy's sound problematic for orchestra:

"The Academy of Music in Philadelphia is a beautiful, historic, charming building with wholly unsuitable acoustics for orchestra...The dry, unreverberant acoustics results from the roughly 2,900 audience members, who completely surround the volume of the auditorium, soaking up sound as they sit."&lt;ref name="Christopher N. Brooks 2002 p. 60"/&gt;

The Academy was built as an opera house which typically has a lower reverberation than a concert hall, the venue's primary use for many years. The reverberation time has been measured at 1.4 seconds compared to 1.2 at La Scala, Milan, and 1.75 at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', "Acoustics still playing it by ear" (Nov. 22, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the "Philadelphia Sound" of the Philadelphia Orchestra was, at least in part, the result of long-term efforts by Stokowski, later sustained by [[Eugene Ormandy]], to compensate for this weakness.&lt;ref name="cutting"&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Dobrin|title=When the music was cutting-edge|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher=philly.com|date=26 January 2007|url=http://articles.philly.com/2007-01-26/news/25221392_1_philadelphia-orchestra-academy-leaders-henri-vieuxtemps |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some remodeling in the mid-1950s, Ormandy refused to make recordings with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] in the Academy.  [[Riccardo Muti]], Ormandy's successor, also made his commercial recordings with the orchestra elsewhere.

Various conductors have commented on the quality of the orchestral sound in the hall, as collected by [[Leo Beranek|Leo L. Beranek]] in his book ''Music, Acoustics &amp; Architecture'':
* [[Fritz Reiner]] commented: "The Academy has very good acoustics although somewhat dry. It is like an Italian opera house."
* [[Pierre Monteux]]: "This hall is too dry; the tone stops instantly. The sound should have a more flattering carry-over."
* [[Herbert von Karajan]]: "There is good orchestral balance, but the sound is too small. One doesn't get full power from the climaxes."'&lt;ref name="cutting"/&gt;

Extensive renovations beginning in 1994 have maintained the building's architecture and made acoustic improvements. Although many programs at the hall are amplified and the Academy is no longer home to the Philadelphia Orchestra, the opera, ballet and other classical concerts still rely on the hall's native acoustics.

The '''''Aix Annunciation''''' is a painting attributed to the [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]] or the so-called Master of the Annunciation of Aix-en-Provence. Executed in 1443-1445, it was originally placed in the [[Cathédrale Saint-Sauveur (Aix-en-Provence)|Cathédrale Saint-Sauveur]], [[Aix-en-Provence]], southern [[France]]. Now it is divided between the [[Église de la Madeleine (Aix-en-Provence)|Église de la Madeleine]] in the same city (central panel with the ''Annunciation''), the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] (part of the left panel with the prophet Isaiah) at [[Rotterdam]], the [[Rijksmuseum]] of [[Amsterdam]] (upper part of the left panel), while the right panel is in the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]]. Side panels are painted on both sides, showing Christ on the right and [[Mary Magdalene]] on the left (the upper part, on reverse of the Amsterdam panel, does not survive); together they used to form a ''[[Noli me tangere]]'' scene when the triptych was folded shut.

==History==
The work was commissioned by Pierre Corpici, a cloth-merchant who knew Barthélemy's stepfather&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=James|title=Northern Renaissance Art|date=1985|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. and Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and combines influences from the Early Netherlandish art of [[Robert Campin]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] with those of [[Claus Sluter]] who worked at Dijon, and [[Colantonio]] from Naples (although some see this last influence as flowing in the other direction). Many of the iconographic details follow those from Annunciations by Jan van Eyck and his circle, such as the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Washington ''Annunciation'']]. Together with a fine portrait dated 1456 (Lichtenstein Collection, Vienna), and a fragment with a small crucified Christ in the [[Louvre]], this is the only surviving [[panel painting]] associated with Barthélemy d'Eyck; most of his later works are [[illuminated manuscript]]s commissioned by René of Anjou.

==Description==
The central panel depicts the [[Annunciation]] inside a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church, the angel appearing under a vault. 
Above him, from a holed [[rose window]], God and two angels are coming in, while the Madonna is kneeling at the right, with two perspectically painted naves in the background.

When used as an altarpiece, side panels of the triptych would be kept closed most of the time, displaying a ''Noli me tangere'' scene with kneeling Mary Magdalene on the left and Christ walking away from her on the right. The two panels do not form a continuous scene, however; Mary Magdalene is placed among lush green hills, while Christ is surrounded by a more desolate, desert-like landscape. Both Brussels and Rotterdam panels are painted on both sides, the reverse of the Amsterdam fragment does not survive.

The characters' sizes, like in other contemporary [[Flemish painting]]s, are not realistic if compared with the background, but are larger. The wide clothes show the inspiration by the Burgundian school. The light is of clearly Flemish derivation (Robert Campin), such as (although with some Provençal elements) the minute details, including the winged devil and the bat in the left arch.

'''''All About Love''''' (得閒炒飯 ''De xian chao fan'') is a 2010 Hong Kong film directed and produced by [[Ann Hui]]. Based on a true story, the plot concerns two [[lesbian]]s who had been lovers in the past and meet again years later in a counseling session for expectant mothers.&lt;ref name=movieweb&gt;{{Cite web|last=Philbrick|first=Jami|title=Exclusive: Director Ann Hui Talks All About Love|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-director-ann-hui-talks-all-about-love|website=[[MovieWeb]]|date=22 October 2010|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui said in an interview that initially "There were no investors" for the film because the subject of same-sex relationships was banned in China, and the Hong Kong film industry relied on the Chinese market.&lt;ref name=movieweb /&gt;

Ms. Hui, a graduate of the [[London Film School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hui, Ann|url=https://hkwomenfilmmakers.wordpress.com/hui-ann-2/|website=Hong Kong Women Filmmakers|date=2017|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the film as "serious...but it is also very commercial," adding that "Sometimes it is better to make serious issues more acceptable to audiences, by making it a comedy and having big stars so that people will come watch the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seno|first1=Alexandra A.|title=Hong Kong: A Love Story|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704206804575466811054922440|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=3 September 2010|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Empire of Their Own:  How the Jews Invented Hollywood''''' is a 1988 non-fiction book whose topic is the careers of several prominent Jewish [[film producer]]s in the early years of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]].  Author [[Neal Gabler]] focuses on the psychological motivations of these film [[Business magnate|moguls]], arguing that their background as [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] shaped their careers and influenced the movies they made.

==Themes==
Gabler's main thesis is that these producers (whom Gabler terms "Hollywood Jews") generally came from poor, fatherless backgrounds, and felt like outsiders in America because of their Jewishness.  In [[Hollywood]], these producers were able to run their own industry, assimilate into the American mainstream, and produce movies that fulfilled their vision of the [[American Dream]].  Gabler asserts that the nature of their business and their movies can often be traced back to their feelings of alienation as immigrants.

The book also explains that the business background of the Hollywood Jews in theatre-ownership, retail distribution, and the garment industry shaped the approach these studio owners took to crafting movies for a popular audience, one similar to the marketing of films as commodities as well as works of art.

The title of the book is a reference to [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s unfinished novel ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'', in which Fitzgerald describes his protagonist, Monroe Stahr (a character inspired by the producer [[Irving Thalberg]]) as "coming home to an empire of his own—an empire he has made."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-25/books/bk-4083_1_jews-invented-hollywood "The Founding Fathers of Hollywood"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted into a documentary film in 1998,  a decade after the book was published. The movie has two titles: ''Hollywoodism: Jews, Movies and the American Dream'' (original title for A&amp;E) and ''Hollywood: An Empire of Their Own'' (title for video/DVD).  The documentary won an award for Best Jewish Experience Documentary at the 1998 [[Jerusalem Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/161693/Hollywood-An-Empire-of-Their-Own/overview Review summary for ''Hollywood: An Empire of Their Own (1998)''], ''[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]]'' entry reprinted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (accessed March 31, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''''aula regia''''' ([[Latin|lat.]] for "royal hall"), also referred to as a ''[[palas]] hall'', is a name given to the great hall in an imperial or royal palace (German ''[[Königspfalz|Pfalz]]''). In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was also used as a synonym for the ''Pfalz'' itself.

An example of a surviving, former [[Visigothic]] ''aula regia'' is the church of [[Santa María del Naranco]] near [[Oviedo]], built around 850 as an ''aula regia'' for [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiros I]].&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner/Fleming/Honour, ''Lexikon der Weltarchitektur'', Reinbek 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an ''aula regia'' in the [[Palace of Aachen]]ː it later became a part of the medieval [[Aachen Rathaus|Town Hall of Aachen]]. The royal hall of the ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' at Ingelheim has been digitally reconstructed. The architectural prototype for all of them was the [[Aula Palatina|Basilica of Constantine]] in [[Trier]].

The reception room in the [[Domus Flavia]], the palace of [[Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]] in [[Rome]], is also called the ''Aula Regia''.

The '''''Cardinal and Theological Virtues''''' is a [[lunette]] fresco by [[Raphael]] found on the south wall of the [[Stanza della Segnatura]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Three of the [[cardinal virtues]] are personified as statuesque women seated in a bucolic landscape and the [[theological virtues]] are depicted by [[putto|putti]]. The fresco was a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the private apartments of [[Pope Julius II]]. These rooms are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]]. After completing his three monumental frescoes ''[[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament]]'', ''[[The Parnassus]]'', and ''[[The School of Athens]]'' in the Stanza della Segnatura, Raphael painted the ''Cardinal and Theological Virtues'' in 1511.{{sfn|Knight|1847|p=358}}

==Description==
[[File:Raffael 053.jpg|thumb|left|Justice displayed in a medallion on the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura]]
The walls containing frescoes in the ''Stanza della Segnatura'' depict four branches of human knowledge: Philosophy (''School of Athens''), Religion (''Disputation''), Poetry (''Parnassus''), and Law (''Virtues'').{{sfn|Paoletti|Radke|2005|p=409}} The fourth wall containing the ''Virtues'' addresses both the civil law of the secular state and the canon law of the Church.{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=109}} Accordingly, three classical cardinal virtues ([[courage|Fortitude]], [[Prudence]] and [[temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]) are  attended by five putti, three of whom depict the theological virtues of [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Faith in Christianity#Roman Catholicism|Faith]].{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

On the left, Raphael painted Fortitude. Armor-clad, she caresses a lion with her left hand while grasping a sapling of black oak with her right.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=72}} The oak tree symbolizes strength and alludes to the [[Della Rovere]] family to which Pope Julius II belonged.{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=110}} A putto representing Charity harvests acorns from the oak branch.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}} Fortitude's seated posture and the folds of her clothing are copied directly from a [[modello]] Raphael had seen of [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].{{sfn|Joannides|1983|p=20}}

Prominently seated in the center is Prudence. On her breast is an effigy of a winged [[Gorgon]] to ward off deceit and fraud. [[Janus]]-like, her head has two faces shown in profile. Her youthful feminine face looks forward into a mirror. This is an allegory of wisdom and knowledge of the present. The backward-facing visage of the old man peers into a past for sound judgment predicated on experience.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=72}} His view is enhanced by the flaming torch held by a putto depicting Hope.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

Temperance sits on the right. She holds the bridle of restraint{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=110}} and is accompanied by a putto portraying Faith who points upward to heaven with his right hand.{{sfn|Hersey|1993|pp=140-141}}

The fourth cardinal virtue, [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], isn't included in the scene. Instead, she is depicted holding scales and a sword in a [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] on the ceiling directly above the fresco.{{sfn|Massi|1885|p=71}} The more prominent position of Justice is explained by the emphasis [[Plato]] placed on this fourth virtue. He introduced it to ensure the other three cardinal virtues existed in harmony.{{sfn|Jacorzynski|2009|p=193}}

The other two frescoes found lower on the wall also portray scenes concerning the law. To the left of the window is a fresco designed by Raphael but executed by his studio. It depicts the [[Emperor Justinian]] receiving the civil code known as the [[Digest (Roman law)|Pandects]] of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' from [[Tribonian]]. To the right of the window, [[Pope Gregory IX]] (as portrayed by Julius II) receives the code of canon law known as the ''[[Decretales Gregorii IX|Decretals]]'' from [[Raymond of Penyafort]].{{sfn|Rowland|2005|p=109}}

The '''''Chair of Reniseneb''''' is an Egyptian wooden [[chair]] dated to the [[15th century BC|15th century B.C]]. The chair, currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], belonged to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[scribe]] [[Renyseneb|Reniseneb]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/547687|title=Chair of Reniseneb|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Ayman Mohamed|date=2014-01-28|title=Furniture industry through the real models and scenes in the ancient Egyptian art: Chairs, stools models |url=https://www.unioviedo.es/reunido/index.php/RM/article/view/10128|journal=Res Mobilis|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=146–166|doi=10.17811/rm.3.2014.146-166|issn=2255-2057}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
The '''''Chair of Reniseneb''''' was crafted circa [[1450s BC|1450 B.C]] during the reign of [[Thutmose III]], sixth [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]. Inscriptions on the chair indicate it belonged to the scribe Reniseneb (also referred to as Reni-seneb or Renyseneb). The chair is made from ebony and carved ivory. It is believed that the chair was originally less detailed then it currently is, and that additional inscriptions were added to the chair when Reniseneb died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The chair is notably the oldest (excluding royal chairs) surviving chair of its style from Egypt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The seat of the chair is a reproduction made from [[Caning (furniture)|woven reeds]], as the original seat has long since decayed. An image of Reniseneb seated in a similar chair is carved into the backrest of the chair, and its feet take the form of carved [[Lion|lion claws]]. [[Lotus flowers]] are also depicted on the chair's carved ivory, possibly due to Egyptian's association of lotus flowers with rebirth and healing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

'''Cretan School''' describes an important school of [[icon]] painting, under the umbrella of '''post-Byzantine art''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spratt|first=Emily L.|date=2012|title=Toward a Definition of "Post-Byzantine" Art: The Angleton Collection at the Princeton University Art Museum|jstor=24416383|journal=Record of the Art Museum, Princeton University|volume=71/72|pages=2–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which flourished while [[Crete]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule during the late [[Middle Ages]], reaching its climax after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, [[El Greco]], was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.

== 15th century ==
[[File:Desprestaur.jpg|thumb|left|260px|''[[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]]'', probably an early Cretan work of 13th or 14th century.]]
[[File:Zafouris Triptych of Deposition.jpg|thumb|left|260px|''Deposition, Lamentation and Resurrection'' triptych by [[Nikolaos Zafouris]], c. 1490s ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]).]]

There was a substantial demand for Byzantine icons in Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and, as a Venetian possession since 1204, [[Crete]] had a natural advantage and soon came to dominate the supply. A probable early example is the famous icon of the Virgin in [[Rome]] known as [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]], which was certainly well known in Rome by 1499. At this date there is little to distinguish Cretan work from other Byzantine icons stylistically, and the quality of work is lower than that associated with [[Constantinople]].

This period also saw considerable numbers of wall-paintings in local churches and monasteries - altogether some 850 from the 14th and 15th centuries survive in Crete, far more than from earlier or later periods.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis, in ''From Byzantium to El Greco'',p.42, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 15th century, Cretan artists had established a distinct icon-painting style, distinguished by "the precise outlines, the modelling of the flesh with dark brown underpaint and dense tiny highlights on the cheeks of the faces, the bright colours in the garments, the geometrical treatment of the drapery, and, finally the balanced articulation of the composition",&lt;ref&gt;Nano Chatzidakis, in ''From Byzantium to El Greco'',p.49, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt; or "sharp contours, slim silhouettes, linear draperies and restrained movements".&lt;ref&gt;Anne Met-Graavgard in ''Post-Byzantine art'', Grove Art Online, accessed January 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous artist of the period was [[Andreas Ritzos]]
(c. 1421–1492), whose son Nicholas was also well known.  Angelos Akotantos, until recently thought to be a conservative painter of the 17th century, is now, after the discovery of a will dated 1436, seen to have been an innovative artist in fusing Byzantine and Western styles, who survived until about 1457, when the will was actually registered.  The will was made in anticipation of a voyage to Constantinople; several icons were bequeathed to church institutions, some Catholic but mainly Orthodox, and the disposition of his stock of pattern drawings was carefully specified.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack; Painting the Soul; pp. 182-191; 1997; Reaktion Books, London; {{ISBN|1-86189-001-X}}.

Talbot-Rice, Byzantine Art&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Pavias]] (d. after 1504) and his pupil [[Angelo Bizamanos|Angelos Bizamanos]], and Nicholas Tzafuris (d. before 1501) were other leading artists.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis in The Icon, 1982, Evans Brothers Ltd, London, p. 311-12, {{ISBN|0-237-45645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the fall of [[Constantinople]] there is evidence that leading [[Byzantine art]]ists were leaving the capital in order to settle in Crete. The migration of Byzantine artists to Crete continued increasingly the next years and reached its peak after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when Crete became "the most important centre of art in the Greek world", influencing artistic developments in the rest of the Greek world.  Cretan icons were commissioned for monasteries on [[Mount Athos]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Nano Chatzidakis, op cit, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cretan school had a smaller rival; until it fell to the Turks in 1522, [[Rhodes]] also had a community of artists, but not so large or significant.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack in Byzantium to El Greco'',p.27, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Venetian archives preserve considerable documentation on the trade of artistic icons between Venice and Crete, which by the end of the 15th century had become one of mass production. There is documentation of a specific order in 1499, of 700 icons of the [[Virgin]], 500 in a Western style, and 200 in [[Byzantine]] style. The order was placed with three artists by two dealers, one Venetian and one from mainland [[Greece]], and the time between contract date and delivery was set at only forty-five days.  Probably the quality of many such commissioned icons was fairly low, and the dismissive term '''Madonneri''' was devised to describe such bulk painters, who later practised in Italy also, often using a quasi-Byzantine style, and apparently often Greek or Dalmatian individuals.  Production of icons at these levels seems to have led to a glut in the market, and in the following two decades there is much evidence that the Cretan trade declined significantly, as the European demand had been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Constantoudaki-Kitromilides in ''From Byzantium to El Greco'',p.51-2, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt;  But at the top end of the market Cretan icons were now the finest in the [[Byzantine]] world.

About 120 artists can be documented working in Candia (the Venetian name of [[Chandax]], present day [[Herakleion]]), in the period 1453–1526, and they had organized a ''Schuola di San Luca'' [[painter's guild]], based on the Italian model.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis in The Icon, 1982, Evans Brothers Ltd, London, p. 310, {{ISBN|0-237-45645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blending of the Eastern and the Western traditions, and a relaxed interchange between [[Greek Orthodoxy|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] rites led to the "'''Cretan Renaissance'''", a golden period for the arts on the island, where both literature and painting flourished. Some of these painters chose to continue the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of Constantinople, while others were influenced by the masters of the Venetian Renaissance, such as [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]].&lt;ref name="Tazartes23-24"&gt;M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] was to be a particular influence.  Works by these masters or copies were in monasteries and churches of the island, while examples of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] decorated the Catholic churches of [[Heraklion|Candia]] or were to be found in the private collections of rich Venetians and Greeks.&lt;ref name="Plaka41" /&gt; In particular, Candia contained a large Franciscan church and a large Orthodox monastery, a daughter-house of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], both of which had strong collections from their respective traditions.

Contemporary documents refer to two styles in painting: the ''maniera greca'' (''alla greca'', in line with the Byzantine idiom) and the ''maniera Latina'' (''alla Latina'', in accordance with Western techniques), which artists knew and utilized according to the circumstances; as a result some kind of "[[eclecticism]]" appeared.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 40-41&lt;br /&gt;* M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, sometimes both styles could be found in the same icon, the one right next to the other.&lt;ref name="Plaka41"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, El Greco—The Greek&lt;/ref&gt; The fame of the most prominent Cretan painters spread throughout [[Greece]], the [[Mediterranean]] and Europe. After the beginning of the 16th century, the Cretan artists once again had more commissions and their works were avidly sought, since they had started to use new motives and to adjust their iconography to the new trends of their era.  To an extent quantity was probably replaced by quality compared with the previous century.

=== 16th-century artists ===
[[File:Georgios Klontzas - Scenes of Christ's Passion - Walters 37628 - Open.jpg|thumb|240px|''Scenes of Christ's passion'' triptych by [[Georgios Klontzas]] (the right wing is lost)]]

Apart from El Greco, the most famous Cretan artists during the century were Theophanis Strelitzas (Θεοφάνης Στρελίτζας), known as [[Theophanes of Crete|Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Michael Damaskenos]] (Μιχαήλ Δαμασκηνός), and [[Georgios Klontzas]] (Γεώργιος Κλόντζας).&lt;ref name="Tazartes23-24" /&gt;  Various members of the Lambardos family were also significant artists.  Fortunately for art historians, many Cretan painters adopted the practice, perhaps as early as Western painters, of signing their work, which was not a traditional Byzantine practice.&lt;ref&gt;David Talbot-Rice, Byzantine Art, 3rd edn 1968, Penguin Books Ltd, p. 384. See also Cormack, 1997, op cit., pp.172-4 &amp; passim&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophanes the Cretan]] was a relatively conservative Cretan artist, whose first dated work is from 1527, and all of whose known works were done on the mainland or smaller islands. He was the most important Greek wall painter of his day, incorporating some Western iconographic and stylistic elements, but remaining essentially Byzantine in spirit.

The intellectual and artistic personality of the young [[El Greco]] was formed in this artistic environment. In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a "master" ("maestro Domenigo"), meaning he was already an enrolled master of the local guild, presumably in charge of his own workshop.&lt;ref name="Panayotakis29"&gt;N.M. Panayotakis, ''The Cretan Period of Doménicos'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;  He left for Venice a few years later, and never returned to Crete. His ''[[Dormition of the Virgin (El Greco)|Dormition of the Virgin]]'', of before 1567 in [[tempera]] and gold on panel (61,4 x 45&amp;nbsp;cm, Holy Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin, [[Hermoupolis]], [[Syros]]) was probably created near the end of [[El Greco]]'s Cretan period. The painting combines post-Byzantine and Italian [[Mannerist]] stylistic and iconographic elements, and incorporates stylistic elements of the Cretan School.

During the second half of the 16th century, many Cretan artists went to [[Venice]], in the hope of gaining commissions and recognition. Unlike El Greco, the other Cretan painters who moved there did not substantially alter their styles or working methods. They simply incorporated more Italian motifs into a consistent Byzantine framework. [[Jonathan Brown (author)|Jonathan Brown]] provides a perceptive analysis of the ways that El Greco distinguished himself from other Cretan artists active in Venice, while [[Richard G. Mann|Richard Mann]] argues that "none of these painters accepted Renaissance ideas about the relevance of change to the creation of art works".&lt;ref name="MannB"&gt;J. Brown, ''El Greco and Toledo'', 76-78&lt;br /&gt;* R.G. Mann, ''Tradition and Originality in El Greco's Work'', 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Damaskenos returned to Crete after three years, and remained there for the rest of his life.

[[File:TzanesIcon.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Icon by [[Emmanuel Tzanes]] (Paul and Alexandra Kanellopoulos Museum, [[Athens]]).]]

Prominent representatives of the Cretan School during the 17th century were Father [[Emmanuel Tzanes]] (Εμμανουήλ Τζάνες, 1610–1690), [[Emmanuel Lambardos]] and [[Theodoros Poulakis]] (Θεόδωρος Πουλάκης, 1622–1692). The Cretan icon painters continued to flourish, until the mid-century, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] occupied all the island except for Candia, which finally fell after twenty years of siege in 1669.&lt;ref&gt;X. Papaefthimiou, [http://www.i-m-patron.gr/keimena/xionadites.html Popular Aspects of the Greek Iconography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524124904/http://www.i-m-patron.gr/keimena/xionadites.html |date=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Ottoman occupation of Crete, the centre of Greek painting moved to the [[Ionian Islands]], which remained under Venetian rule until the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. A new artistic movement was created called the [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]] which was mostly influenced by [[Western European]] artistic trends. Many Cretan artists migrated to the Heptanese or [[Western Europe]] to enjoy the artistic freedom. A successive occupation of the Ionian islands by the [[France|French]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] allowed the [[Heptanese]] to remain the centre of [[Greek Art]] until the independence of Greece in 1830.

==Plot==
A group of high school-aged girls in a small town in rural Michigan come under the influence of a charismatic new teacher named Irene Stark. Mrs. Stark preaches on issues regarding [[women's liberation]], and convinces each of the girls to take revenge on their fathers for having oppressed their mothers in their lives.

==Controversy==
Due to its thematic concerns with rape, abortion, domestic violence, feminism and [[antifeminism]], the novel was [[Book censorship in the United States|banned]] from libraries in several states upon its 1997 republication, namely from Jackson County School libraries in West Virginia in 1997, as well as school libraries in Virginia, Indiana, and New Mexico from 2000 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bannedlibrary.com/podcast/2016/5/20/banned-57-daughters-of-eve-by-lois-duncan|work=Banned Library|title=Daughters of Eve|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Finding Dawn''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] by [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] filmmaker [[Christine Welsh]] looking into the fate of an estimated 500 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] women who have been [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women|murdered or have gone missing]] over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="CSWS"/&gt;

==Subject==
The film begins with the story of Dawn Crey: one of 60 women, a third of them Aboriginal, who have disappeared from [[Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]] over a 20-year period. Crey's remains were among those found on the property of British Columbia serial killer [[Robert Pickton]].&lt;ref name="Herizons"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'CONNOR |first=JENNIFER|date=Winter 2009 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Herizons|publisher=Bnet|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7554/is_200901/ai_n32313401/?tag=content;col1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgia Straight"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article/metis-filmmaker-christine-welsh-can-be-proud-of-her-showing-at-the-amnesty-international-film-festival|title=Métis filmmaker Christine Welsh can be proud of her showing at the Amnesty International Film Festival|date=November 9, 2006|work=[[Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not enough of Dawn's DNA was found to list her as one of the murder victims at the trial. The film introduces viewers to Dawn sister and brother, and their involvement in the annual [[Women’s Memorial March]] in Vancouver.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vos|first=Gail |date=January 11, 2008 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Canadian Materials|publisher=Manitoba Library Association|volume= XIV |issue= 10|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/outreach/cm/vol14/no10/findingdawn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film then focuses on BC's Highway 16, known as the [[Highway of Tears murders|Highway of Tears]], which runs between [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia]], looking at the fate of Ramona Wilson.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt; Wilson was one of nine women&amp;nbsp;– all but one of them Native&amp;nbsp;– who have gone missing or been murdered on that stretch of road since the 1990s.

Welsh also filmed in [[Saskatoon]], where a woman named Daleen Kay Bosse disappeared in 2004. She went missing in May but a criminal investigation didn't begin until the following January.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt; In the film, Daleen’s parents and friends talk about their difficulty in getting Saskatoon police to take Daleen’s disappearance seriously.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt;

Native rights activists [[Janice Acoose]] and [[Fay Blaney]] are interviewed in the film.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt;

Christine Welsh has produced, written and directed films for more than 30 years. She is an associate professor at the [[University of Victoria]], where she teaches courses in indigenous women’s studies and [[indigenous cinema]].&lt;ref name="CSWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |title=Acclaimed Feminist Filmmaker To Screen "Finding Dawn" |last= |first= |date= |publisher=[[University of Oregon]] |work=[[Center for the Study of Women in Society]] |accessdate=26 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508140428/http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hanazuki: Full of Treasures''''' is an American [[Animated series|animated]] children's [[web show]] produced by [[Titmouse, Inc.]] for [[Hasbro Studios]], with Stephen Davis of Hasbro Studios and [[Chris Prynoski]] of Titmouse serving as executive producers. Made in conjunction with a line of ''Hanazuki'' toys, it is based on characters and concepts which were developed by Hanneke Metselaar and Niko Stumpo before [[Hasbro]] purchased them in 2010. Set in a fictional galaxy comprising countless moons, the series follows Hanazuki, a childlike being called a Moonflower who uses her emotion-based powers to protect her home from being obliterated by a dark force known as the "Big Bad".

The series debuted on [[YouTube]] on January 12, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/01/hasbro-studios-launches-first-animated-digital-series-hanazuki-full-of-treasures|title=Hasbro Studios launches first animated digital series Hanazuki Full of Treasures|first=Gary|last=Collinson|work=Flickering Myth|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was produced in conjunction with a line of merchandise to be released later the same year, including a toyline and digital app.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite press release|date=January 12, 2017|title=Hasbro Invites You to Discover a New World Full of Treasures with HANAZUKI|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170112005150/en/Hasbro-Invites-Discover-World-Full-Treasures-HANAZUKI|location=Pawtucket, Rhode Island|publisher=Hasbro|agency=Business Wire|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web series received praise from critics, drawing favorable comparisons to other animated series such as ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' and ''[[Steven Universe]]'' for its storytelling, visual aesthetic, and darker undertones.&lt;ref name="mlp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bsckids"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idt"/&gt; As of May 2017, the series has amassed over 120 million views.&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt; It has been renewed for a second season, which will premiere in 2018.&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt; A third season and a feature-length film are also in development.&lt;ref name="movie"/&gt;

''Hanazuki'' began airing on [[Discovery Family]] on December 1, 2018, marking its American televised debut.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kemo5791/status/1061490964819206144|title=Kamal Walker on Twitter|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The series is set in a fictional galaxy of moons that is beset by the "Big Bad", a black, inky miasma that drains the life and color of anything it touches. Each moon is protected by a Moonflower, a plantlike child who uses his or her emotional states to activate magical "treasures" that are supplied by an infantile being named Little Dreamer, which can then be planted to grow trees that ward off the Big Bad. The series opens with Hanazuki, a newly born Moonflower, arriving on a moon populated by numerous denizens, including colorful rabbit-like creatures called Hemka. Several episodes focus on Hanazuki and her friends' escapades as she learns about her responsibilities and emotions, ending with her growing a colored Treasure Tree that corresponds with her mood in that episode. As the series progresses, Hanazuki encounters other Moonflowers that have failed at saving their own moons and seek to learn from Hanazuki in order to properly harness their powers against the Big Bad.&lt;ref name="animag"/&gt;

==Characters==
===Moonflowers===
Moonflowers are childlike beings who are guardians of the galaxy's moons. Created by Little Dreamer, they have white flowers on their heads and highlights that change color depending on their moods, enabling them to grow Treasure Trees that protect their moons from the Big Bad.

* '''Hanazuki''' ([[Jessica DiCicco]]) – The main character of the series. A newly born Moonflower, Hanazuki is a kind, friendly, and optimistic girl who always offers help to those who need it. She is quick to adapt to her role as her moon's guardian, allowing her to understand and control her own emotions more successfully than most other Moonflowers. 
* '''Kiazuki''' ([[Cassandra Lee Morris]]) – An older, cynical Moonflower who lives on a moon ravaged by the Big Bad. Although claiming to be more experienced than Hanazuki, Kiazuki has failed to ever grow a colored Treasure Tree of her own, and envies Hanazuki's success. She thus manipulates Hanazuki, who admires her as her "Moonflower sister", into helping her acquire treasures to restore her moon. She is later revealed to be the founder of the Garlandians, a failed emergency response team devised to combat the Big Bad.
* '''Kiyoshi''' (Vargus Mason) – A male Moonflower who protects a moon inhabited by unicorns. Because of his pessimistic nature, he is only able to grow black Treasure Trees, which are ineffective in warding off the Big Bad. Deposed and exiled for his failures, Kiyoshi receives guidance from Hanazuki to properly harness his emotional powers, eventually regaining authority of his moon.
* '''Maroshi''' ([[Marcus Toji]]) – A Moonflower from an ocean-covered world that is frozen and shattered by the Big Bad. Despite losing his home, he maintains a positive, laid-back attitude at all times, which makes him easy for others to get along with, but also appearing somewhat irresponsible. He is talented at flying through space on a [[surfboard]]-like device.&lt;!--
* '''Miyumi''' (Elise Dubois) --&gt;

===Hemka===
The Hemka (or Hemkas) are small, rabbit-like creatures that inhabit Hanazuki's moon. They speak in gibberish that others except Hanazuki can fully understand, and they have malleable bodies that allow them to merge and change into different objects. Each Hemka is of a different color and represents a specific personality trait that Hanazuki reflects.

* '''Red Hemka''' ([[Colleen Villard]]) – A feisty Hemka prone to picking fights and pulling pranks on others.
* '''Orange Hemka''' ([[Michael Sinterniklaas]]) – A wacky Hemka who often jumps around and makes silly faces.
* '''Yellow Hemka''' (Colleen Villard) – A happy Hemka who enjoys playing and remains optimistic in dangerous situations.
* '''Lime Green Hemka''' (Jessica DiCicco) – A scared Hemka who is easily startled by anything.
* '''Dark Green Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – A mellow Hemka who speaks with a laid-back tone.
* '''Teal Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas in season 1, Cassandra Lee Morris in the shorts) – A glamorous Hemka.
* '''Blue Hemka''' (Jessica DiCicco) – A sad Hemka who is constantly crying or on the verge of tears.
* '''Lavender Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – An inspired Hemka who has creative ideas but is too shy to act on them.
* '''Purple Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – A courageous Hemka who performs feats of derring-do.
* '''Pink Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – A loving Hemka who shows affection for everything.
* '''Raspberry Hemka''' (Cassandra Lee Morris)
* '''Emerald Hemka''' ([[Avery Waddell]])

===Unicorns===
[[Unicorn|Unicorns]] in the series are native to Kiyoshi's moon. They possess the same colors and personality traits as the Hemka, with the additional ability to perform [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] using their horns. Most unicorns in the series are voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]].

* '''Sleepy Unicorn''' (Avery Waddell) – A unicorn who lives on Hanazuki's moon and, as his name suggests, spends most of his time sleeping. Despite his relaxed and lazy nature, he harbors a troubled past; originally named Noble Unicorn, he lives in exile from his home moon after failing to stop his brother Twisted Unicorn's revolt against Kiyoshi. Convinced that he is unfit to wield magic because of his failure, Sleepy regains his confidence to use his powers again to help Hanazuki.
* '''Twisted Unicorn''' (Avery Waddell) – Sleepy Unicorn's brother and the leader of the unicorns. Twisted is a tyrant responsible for overthrowing Kiyoshi, forcing his fellow unicorns to maintain a force field he professes will protect their moon from the Big Bad. He is eventually deposed by the combined efforts of Hanazuki, Kiyoshi, and their allies, leading Twisted to hunt them across the galaxy for revenge.

===Others===
* '''Little Dreamer''' (Colleen Villard) – Hanazuki's infant-like creator who delivers treasures to the Moonflowers. He is shown sleeping at all times and wearing different-patterned pajamas almost every time he appears.
* '''Dazzlessence Jones''' (Avery Waddell) – The self-appointed [[sheriff]] of Hanazuki's moon who resembles a [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamond]]. He helps Hanazuki maintain order, and speaks verbose words through song.
* '''Zikoro''' (Avery Waddell) – Kiazuki's sole companion on her moon, a black creature who behaves like a restless dog. He is regularly mistreated by Kiazuki, but remains loyal to her and enjoys tormenting the Hemka. After Kiazuki abandons him on Hanazuki's moon, he takes more of a liking to Hanazuki and her friends.
* '''Chicken Plant''' (Alison Martin) – A grouchy plant with the resemblance of a chicken that constantly tries eating the Hemka. She is prone to laying eggs that hatch into destructive monsters.
* '''Mirror Plant''' (Shondalia White) – A plant that translates an individual's thoughts and repeats what the subject says.
* '''Mazzadril''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – One-eyed, four-legged beasts with horns on their heads and tentacles for mouths. Their natural habitat is the dark side of both Hanazuki's moon and Kiazuki's moon.
* '''Doughy Bunington''' ([[Pat Fraley]]) – A friendly [[gourmand]] hotdog who lives on the dark side of the moon, exiled there after thoughtlessly devouring Chicken Plant's wings.
* '''Basil Ganglia''' ([[Trevor Devall]]) – An egocentric, megalomaniacal brain who inhabits a cave on the moon's dark side. He has designs to take over Hanazuki's moon, but is helpless to carry them out due to his lack of other body parts.
* '''Flochi''' ([[Nika Futterman]]) – The creatures that inhabit Maroshi's moon, resembling fish with catlike faces. They glide across any surface in unison, with the exception of a lavender Flochi aptly named Wanderer for her more independent nature.&lt;!--

Hanazuki agrees to assist Red, but her anger erupts when he and the other Hemkas continue fighting over the treasure, causing her to turn red. After the Hemkas put their fight aside fight to help her, the treasure reacts to Hanazuki's change in mood and sprouts into a red Treasure Tree, which keeps an encroaching black miasma away from the moon.

Inspired by Hanazuki's resolve to fix her mistake, Sleepy musters the courage to save Blue and return him to normal. Blue celebrates his restoration by planting a blue Treasure Tree for Hanazuki.

==Reception==
''Hanazuki: Full of Treasures'' was met with critical praise and online popularity upon release, with several favorably comparing it to the television series ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' (another Hasbro property) and ''[[Steven Universe]]'' for its light-hearted tone, visual aesthetic, and methodical storytelling.&lt;ref name="mlp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bsckids"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idt"/&gt; As of May 2017, the series has accumulated over 120 million views on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt;

In her review of the web series, Lauren Orsini of ''[[Forbes]]'' commented on the involvement of ''Friendship Is Magic'' writer [[Dave Polsky]] as a story editor, considering ''Friendship Is Magic'' to be lucrative to Hasbro's success, and concluding that the series was an attempt by the company to incite similar success with ''Hanazuki''.&lt;ref name="mlp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orsini|first1=Lauren|title=Hasbro's 'Hanazuki': An Intergalactic Love Letter To 'My Little Pony' Fans|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/01/13/hasbros-hanazuki-an-intergalactic-love-letter-to-my-little-pony-fans/#32b130e522a8|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, Orsini attributed the series' popularity on YouTube to its "spunky characters and high production values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orsini|first1=Lauren|title=Take A First Look At The Next Wave Of 'Hanazuki: Full Of Treasures'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/03/09/an-exclusive-first-look-at-the-next-wave-of-hanazuki-full-of-treasures/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercedes Milligan of ''[[Animation Magazine]]'' said of the series, "''Hanazuki'' puts a modern, cross-platform spin on a premise that will be familiar to '80s kids who grew up with Rainbow Brite, et al."&lt;ref name="animag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/hasbros-hanazuki-is-a-new-digital-treasure/|title=Hasbro’s ‘Hanazuki’ Is a New Digital Treasure|first=Mercedes|last=Milligan|work=Animation Magazine|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ella Anders of BSC Kids praised the opening episodes for its setting, lore, characters, and overarching storytelling. She additionally interpreted the series as a Western [[magical girl]] series that "doesn't play off the traditional magical girl path or tropes".&lt;ref name="bsckids"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anders|first1=Ella|title=First Look and Review of Hasbro’s Newest Series "Hanazuki Full of Treasures"|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2017/01/first-look-and-review-of-hasbros-newest-series-hanazuki-full-of-treasures/|website=BSC Kids|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathalie Medina of ''[[IBT Media|iDigitalTimes]]'' gave the series a score of 4 out of 5, complimenting the characters and hints of a more complex underlying story, and comparing its visual style to "a Lisa Frank folder with a 2000s aesthetic".&lt;ref name="idt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medina|first1=Nathalie|title='Hanazuki Full of Treasures' Review: Hasbro's Newest Addition To 'My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic' Stable Of Girl Toons|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/hanazuki-full-treasures-review-hasbros-newest-addition-my-little-pony-friendship-577902|publisher=iDigitalTimes|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Holy Allegory''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Giovanni Bellini]], dating from c. 1490 to 1500. It is in the [[Uffizi]] gallery in [[Florence]], Italy.

==History==
There is no documentation about the commission and the original location of the work, which is known to have been part of the Austrian Imperial collections in [[Vienna]] in the 18th century. In 1793 the director of the Uffizi, Luigi Lanzi, exchanged it with another work in order to improve the Venetian Renaissance presence in the museum. At the time, it was attributed to [[Giorgione]]. 

The Italian art historian [[Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle]] was the first to identify it as a Bellini. Today his attribution is widely recognized, although another name sometimes mentioned is that of [[Marco Basaiti]].

==Description==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2015}}
The scene is set on a wide terrace with a [[polychrome]] marble pavement, in [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], separated from a lake shore by a parapet. On the left Mary is enthroned, under a [[baldachin]] whose support is in [[cornucopia]] shape, a symbol of her fertility. The baldachin has four steps, and on its side is a frieze with scenes of the myth of [[Marsyas]], interpreted as a parallel with Jesus' [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. Near to Mary are two unidentified female figures, which could represent two saints or two virtues. One of them looks to be floating in the air, although the effect could stem from a loss of color near her legs and feet. 

In the middle of the scene are four children playing with a small tree and its silver fruits, perhaps a symbol of the [[knowledge tree]], a symbol of life and wisdom.  On the right are [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]] and [[St. Sebastian]]. Outside the parapet, are [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] (or St. Peter) and St. Paul, the latter with his [[Emblem|attribute]] of a sword.  He is advancing to the left, where a man with a turban perhaps symbolizes an [[infidel]].

In the background, beyond a large lake, is a landscape with rocky spurs with men and animals. On the shores are a shepherd in a grotto, and a [[centaur]].
[[File:Allegoria sacra 02.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Detail.]]

==Interpretations==
The exact meaning of the painting had not been yet completely understood, although several hypotheses have been made by art historians. What is sure is that the painting was made for a refined élite, whose education allowed them to understand any subtle detail included in it.
[[File:Allegoria sacra 03.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail.]]
In the early 20th century, Ludwig interpreted it as a pictoral transcription of the early 14th French poem ''[[Le Pèlerinage de l'Âme]]'' ("Pilgrimage of the Soul"), by [[Guillaume de Deguileville]]. According to him, the painting represents the ideal path of purification of the soul. The hermit shepherd would be [[St. Anthony the Abbot]], descending from his hermitage in the spiritual path inspired to the first hermit, St. Paul, and overcoming several obstacles including the centaur which waits for him at the end of the staircase. The terrace would represent the Paradise Garden, where the souls in [[Purgatory]], symbolized by the children, wait before they are admitted to heaven. Mary, advocate of the men before God, judges the souls with the help of the crowned Justice coronata. Amongst the children, who are playing with the mystic fruits, the one at the tree would be a soul called to the eternal beatitude.  The two saints standing on the left would be the patrons, perhaps connected to the works' commissioners, while the two behind the parapet would be Peter and Paul, who guard the gate of Paradise. The river in the background would be [[Lethe]], which surrounds Paradise. The animals would represent the hermits' virtue: the mule for the patience, and the sheep for humility.

According to other scholars, the painting would represent a common [[holy conversation]] or a vision of the Paradise. Some see [[Jesus]] in the children on the cushion, giving to the work the meaning of a meditation about [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].

[[File:Kalamkari Painting.JPG|thumb|''Kalamkari'' textile depicting scenes from Lord Krishna's life displayed at [[National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum, New Delhi]]]]

'''''Kalamkari''''' is a type of hand-painted or block-printed [[cotton]] [[textile]], produced in Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telengana]]. Only [[natural dye]]s are used in ''Kalamkari'' and it involves twenty three steps. 

There are two distinctive styles of kalamkari art in India - [[Srikalahasti Kalamkari|Srikalahasti style]] and the [[Pedana Kalamkari|Machilipatnam style]]. The Srikalahasti style of ''Kalamkari''(Kalankari), wherein the "''kalam''" or pen is used for freehand drawing of the subject and filling in the colors, is entirely hand worked. This style flowered around temples and their patronage and so had an almost religious identity - scrolls, temple hangings, [[Temple car|chariot]] banners and the like, depicted deities and scenes taken from the Hindu epics - [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Puranas]] and the mythological classics. This style owes its present status to Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay who popularized the art as the first Chairperson of the All India Handicrafts Board. 

==Entomology== 
Historically, Kalamkai use to be known as ''Pattachitra'', an art form still found in neighboring Odisha and other parts of India and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Niranjan (1973), The Patas and Patuas of Bengal. Indian Publications Calcutta, Page number 54-55 (Annexure C,V)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "''Pattachitra''" in ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]:पट्टचित्र) translates to "Patta" meaning "cloth" and "Chitra" means "picture".&lt;ref&gt;SenGupta, pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings made on fabric and fabric scrolls finds mentioned in ancient Hindu, Buddhist and Jain literature.&lt;ref&gt;Textiles in Indian Ocean Societies - Ruth Barnes, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Hermann Kulke, page 185&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under medieval [[Islam|Islamic]] rule, the term Kalamkari [[Persian language|Persian]],{{lang|fa|قلمکار}} which is derived from the words k''alam'' ([[pen]]) and ''kari'' ([[Handicraft|craftmanship]]), meaning drawing with a pen came to be in popular use under the patronage of Golconda sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIOS- Indian Culture and Heritage|website=http://www.nios.ac.in/media/documents/SecICHCour/English/CH.11.pdf|publisher=NIOS|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Kalamkari painting.jpg|thumb|left|A ''kalamkari'' artist at work.]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Wall Hanging (Kalamkari) - overall.jpg|thumb|''Kalamkari'' wall hanging, early 17th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
In ancient times, groups of singers, musicians and painters, called ''chitrakars'', moved from village to village to tell the village dwellers, the great stories of [[Hindu mythology]]. They illustrated their accounts using large bolts of canvas painted on the spot with simple means and dyes extracted from plants. In the same way, one found in the Hindu temples large panels of ''kalamkari'' depicting the episodes of Indian mythology, similar to Buddhist [[Thangka]] paintings.

As an art form it found its peak in the wealthy [[Golkonda|Golconda sultanate]], [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], in the Middle Ages. The Mughals who patronized this craft in the Coromandel and Golconda province called the practitioners of this craft "''qualamkars''", from which the term "''kalamkari''" evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Bhatnagar| first=Parul| title=Kalamkari| url=https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/65619463?access_key=key-1i4e4emilphei76vaxgl| work=Traditional Indian Costumes and Textiles| accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pedana Kalamkari]] craft made at [[Pedana]] nearby [[Machilipatnam]] in [[Krishna district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], evolved with the patronage of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the [[Golkonda|Golconda sultanate]]. Owing to the said patronage, this school was influenced by Persian art under [[Islam|Islamic]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIOS- Indian Culture and Heritage|website=http://www.nios.ac.in/media/documents/SecICHCour/English/CH.11.pdf|publisher=NIOS|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kalamkari'' art has been practiced by many families in Andhra Pradesh, some villages in Tamilnadu (Sickinaickanpettai) by migrants from Telugu speaking families and over the generations has constituted their livelihood. ''Kalamkari'' had a certain decline, then it was revived in India and abroad for its craftsmanship. Since the 18th century the British have enjoyed the decorative element for clothing.

== Middle forms ==
In middle ages the term is also used to refer, incorrectly, to the making of any cotton fabric patterned through the medium of vegetable dyes by free-hand painting and block-printing, produced in many different regions of India. In places where the fabric is block printed the ''kalam'' (pen) is used to draw finer details and for application of some colours.First it was introduce 
in blue colour.

== In this Century (Digital era) ==
In modern times it's replaced by digital. The art took a turn-over and updated digitally to fit in the glove of time. In this era new types and new techniques are introduced and the ''digital files'' of kalamkari (pen work) is totally introduced widely all over the regions of India and Iran (Persia).'''

Seeping it in [[astringent]]s and [[bubalus|buffalo]] milk and then drying it under the sun.&lt;ref name=MM1&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/intx/hd_intx.htm metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the red, black, brown, and violet portions of the designs are outlined with a mordant and cloth is then placed in a bath of [[alizarin]].&lt;ref name=MM1 /&gt; The next step is to cover the cloth, except for the parts to be dyed blue, in wax, and immerse the cloth in indigo dye. The wax is then scraped off and remaining areas are painted by hand,&lt;ref name=MM1 /&gt; similar to Indonesian ''[[batik]]''.

To create design contours, artists use a [[bamboo]] or [[date palm]] [[Branch|stick]] pointed at one end with a bundle of fine hair attached to this pointed end to serve as the brush or pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Heritage - Painting - Kalamkari|url=http://www.indian-heritage.org/painting/kalamkri.html|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pen is soaked in a mixture of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] [[jaggery]] and water; one by one these are applied, then the vegetable dyes.

In Iran, the fabric is printed using patterned wooden stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Held, Colbert C. |title=Middle East patterns: places, peoples, and politics |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, Colo |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-8133-4170-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color fixing ==
Dyes for the cloth are obtained by extracting colors from various roots, leaves, and mineral salts of iron, tin, copper, and [[alum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indian-heritage.org/painting/kalamkri.html indian-heritage.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Various effects are obtained by using [[cow dung]], [[seeds]], plants and crushed flowers to obtain [[natural dye]]. Along with buffalo milk, [[myrobalan]] is used in ''kalamkari''. ''Myrobalan'' is also able to remove the odd smell of buffalo milk. The fixing agents available in the ''myrobolan'' can easily fix the dye or color of the textile while treating the fabric. Alum is used in making natural dyes and also while treating the fabric. Alum ensures the stability of the color in ''kalamkari'' fabric.

==Themes==
''Kalamkari'' specifically depicts epics such as the Ramayana or Mahabharata. However, there are recent applications of the ''kalamkari'' technique to depict Buddha and Buddhist art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Naidu|first=T. Appala|title=Techie's Twist to Kalamkari| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p-varun-kumar-comes-up-with-a-buddha-series-in-kalamkari/article7444368.ece| work=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karabel1.jpg|thumb|300px|Hittite rock relief of King Tarkasnawa, Turkey]]
The [[Hittites|Hittite]] / [[Luwian]] '''Karabel relief''' is a [[rock relief]] in the pass of the same name, between [[Torbalı]] und [[Kemalpaşa]], about 20&amp;nbsp;km from [[Izmir]] in [[Turkey]].  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Description ==

The monument originally consisted of four parts: two ruler figures carved into the cliff (Karabel A and B) and two inscriptions on boulders (Karabel C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittitemonuments.com/karabel/ Description on Hittitemonuments.com with images of the reliefs]&lt;/ref&gt; During the construction of a road through the pass between 1977 and 1982, all the reliefs except for Karabel A were destroyed. Karabel A shows a warrior marching to the right with a bow in his right hand and a spear in his left. There are [[Luwian hieroglyphs]] inscribed above his left arm. The relief is 1.5 m wide and 2.5 m high

== Research history ==
[[Herodotus]] interpreted the figure as the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodotus/hist13.html Livius.org on "The relief of Sesostris" in Herodotos' ''Histories'' 2.102-103, 106]&lt;/ref&gt; The relief was visited by the French traveller [[Charles Texier]] in 1839 - he published a description in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Texier. ''Asie mineure: description géographique, historique et archéologique des provinces et des villes de la Chersonnèse d'Asie''. Didot frères, 1862&lt;/ref&gt; After him, [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] visited it in 1840. Both accepted it as Egyptian. [[Heinrich Kiepert]] disproved this in 1843 by comparing it with the reliefs of [[Yazılıkaya]].  Subsequently, when the relief was accepted as Hittite, the place was visited and described by several scholars, including [[Kurt Bittel]], [[Helmuth Theodor Bossert]], [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]], [[Ekrem Akurgal]], [[Heinrich Otten]] and [[Annelies Kammenhuber]].&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften - Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Großreichszeit in der Türkei'', von Zabern 2005 S. 90 {{ISBN|3-8053-3469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KarabelTexier.jpg|thumb|vertical=0.8|left|Illustration by [[Charles Texier]]]]

==Interpretation ==
According to the latest research, the relief depicts [[Tarkasnawa]], the king of the Hittite vassal state of [[Mira, Anatolia|Mira]] under the [[Hitites|Hittite empire]] (13th century BC). In 1998 [[John David Hawkins]] was able to read the inscription as follows: 
{{Quotation|Tarkasnawa, King [of the land] of Mira&lt;br /&gt;
[son] of Alantallis, King of the land of Mira&lt;br /&gt;
grandson of ...., King of the land of Mira}} 
No traces of the name of the grandfather survive, but other evidence indicates that it was Kubantaruntija.&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"/&gt;

The relief has wider historical significance as evidence that the kingdom of Mira was south of the [[Seha river land]] (probably the [[Gediz River]]). From Hittite diplomatic letters, chiefly the [[Milawata letter]], it is known that the Seha river land was bordered on one side by the kingdom of Mira and on the other side by [[Wilusa]]. The relief proves that Wilusa cannot have been south of the Gediz river, but must have been to the north of the river, in the [[Troad]]. This aids in the identification of Wilusa with the city of ''Ilion'', another name for [[Troy]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Easton, J. D. Hawkins, A. G. Sherratt, E. S.

The '''Laren School''' is the name of an [[art colony]] located in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] village, [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], in [[Het Gooi]] near [[Hilversum]]. The artists of this offshoot of the [[Hague School]] chose the inhabitants of Laren and the surrounding landscape as the subject of their art.

Discovered by painter, [[Jozef Israëls]], the area around Laren School was distinguished by its unspoiled beauty and diversity of landscape, and was considered ideally situated by many members of the Hague School. After 1898, it was rediscovered by young artists known as the second generation of the Laren School, their work extending far into the 20th century. This colony of artists is significant in [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Impressionism]], being seen as part of this international movement. The ideas fostered in the area found their way to the [[Modernism|Modernist]] art movement.

==The first generation of the Laren School==
[[File:Max Liebermann - Flachsscheuer in Laren - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]] (1887): ''Flax Barn at Laren ''.]]

The industrialisation of Rotterdam, Amsterdam and other regions of the [[Netherlands]] affected landscapes that had remained untouched for centuries. Many of these landscapes disappeared, and with them, the inspiration for earlier landscape and genre painting.

After 15 years of fame, from 1855 to 1870, the artists of the [[Oosterbeek#Oosterbeek School|Oosterbeek School]] were looking for a new place to paint. Around 1870, the painter, Jozef Israëls, discovered the village of Laren. He visited often with his son, [[Isaac Israëls|Isaac]], whom he instructed in outdoor painting. His enthusiasm for Laren, and the surrounding landscape and agricultural activity, was infectious, and other artists from the [[Pulchri Studio]] began to join him. [[Albert Neuhuys]] and [[Anton Mauve]] were the first to follow Israëls  in 1877 and in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Lübbren: ''Rural artists colonies in Europe, 1870 to 1910'', Manchester University Press, 2001. p 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/aria/aria_artists/00017202?page=1&amp;lang=en&amp;context_space=&amp;context_id= '' Anton Mauve - Rijksmuseum Amsterdam '']&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Hein Kever]], [[Willem Steelink, Jr.|Willem Steelink]], Hendrik Valkenburg, [[Wally Moes]], Etha Fles, [[Arina Hugenholtz]] and Tony Offermans [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]], [[Willem Roelofs]], and [[Max Liebermann]] (the first foreign painter at the Laren School and an old friend of Israël) came to work in Laren. Thus, the Laren School as an [[artist colony]] was born. Some of these painters settled in the region; their Laren-inspired works were shown to the public at the Pulchri Studio and affiliated galleries.

[[File:Anton Mauve - The Return of the Flock, Laren - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anton Mauve]] (1886-87): ''The Return of the Flock, Laren'' - Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.]]

Neuhuys concentrated on farm life as a [[genre]] subject, but the others turned to the [[landscape]]. Art historians describe this as the Laren Style, which is regarded as part of the [[Hague School]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Around 1885, the first colony ceased to produce new work based on Laren and its environs.

==The second generation of the Laren School==
[[File:Mondriaan De Molen.jpg|thumb|[[Piet Mondriaan]] (1917): ''The Windmill'' - Steddijk Museum, Amsterdam.]]
Around 1898, Laren was rediscovered by a group of young painters who gave new life to the Laren Style school of painting for the next 40 years, including [[:nl:Otto van Tussenbroek]], [[Evert Pieters]], [[Bernard de Hoog]], Hendrik Theodorus de Court Onderwater, [[:nl:Andre Broedelet]], [[Salomon Garf]], [[Franz Deutmann]], Lammert van der Tonge, [[:nl:Jaap Dooijewaard]] and Bernard Pothast. Most of these were genre painters in the agricultural tradition, like Neuhuys. However some were landscape painters, notably [[:nl:Cornelis Vreedenburgh]], [[:nl:Gerrit van Blaaderen]] and [[:nl:Frans Langeveld]].

The second generation of the Laren School diverged, one group following the traditions of the Hague School while the rest painted in the new style of [[Impressionism]], embracing modernity with an enthusiasm now considered typical of the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1903, under the initiative of August Johannes le Gras (1864–1915), the [[Gooi]]sche Painters Association, "De Tien" (The Ten), was founded. This group organized exhibitions across the country to create new opportunities for the work of its members. The Ten included [[:nl:Derk Meeles]], [[:nl:Toon de Jong]], [[:nl:David Schulman]] and [[:nl:Emanuel van Beever]].

[[File:Singer museum laren.jpg|thumb|The Singer Museum of Laren.]]
[[William Singer|William Henry Singer]], an American painter and art collector, came to Laren in 1901. In 1911, he built a villa called ''De Wilde Zwanen'' (The Wild Swans) which, after World War II, was converted into the [[Singer Laren|Singer Museum]] and concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollandtheaterweb.de/theater/2/nord-holland/173/laren/269/singer-theater ''Holland Theaterweb''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930172356/http://www.hollandtheaterweb.de/theater/2/nord-holland/173/laren/269/singer-theater |date=2015-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At De Wilde Zwanen, painters such as [[Co Breman]] and [[Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig]] differed from the mainstream of Impressionism, painting in the style of [[Pointillism]] and [[Luminism (Impressionism)|Luminism]]. [[:nl:Johan Coenraad Heyen Brock]] specialized in the representation of factories. For modernists, like [[Piet Mondriaan]], [[Jan Sluyters]] and [[Leo Gestel]], this studio and its location were significant in the direction they took in their art.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1921, the Association of Visual Artists, Laren, [[Blaricum]], was founded by Co Breman. In 1935, the Gooische Painters Association fractured, and the members formed several distinct groups. August Johannes le Gras specialised in African landscapes and animals, [[Jan Pieter Veth]] in [[Portraiture|portraits]], [[:nl:Douwe Komter]] in [[still life]].

Today, the Singer Museum exhibits works of the Laren School.

==About the name==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}

From art collectors and authors, the term is often used for all painters active in Laren, and as shorthand for the continuation of the [[Hague School]] and the [[Oosterbeek School]]. Several founders of this artist colony — Jozef Israëls and his son, Isaac, along with Albert Neuhuys and Anton Mauve — were already known as Hague painters.

This artists of the Laren School are linked together by the relationship between their ideas of art, style and techniques. In Laren, the countryside was the main theme of the landscape painters. Therefore, the term 'Laren' applies primarily as a place of landscape painting. The lightening of color, by adding gold yellow, red and blue, is essential to the Laren School. Another striking feature of Laren School paintings is the romantic view of social life in this tough region of Gooiland.

Mystery Hole, immediately adjacent to the [[Midland Trail]] ([[U.S. Route 60 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 60]]) in [[Fayette County, West Virginia|Fayette County]] advertises itself as a [[gravity]]-defying wonder. It is reminiscent of [[tourist trap]]s of days gone by. It includes side show-esque attractions such as balls that roll up hill. There is also a [[Volkswagen Beetle]], chopped in half, seemingly crashed into the side of the building.

The Mystery Hole is an underground series of rooms where the walls and floors are built at angles to give the impression that there is something wrong with the gravity in the area. There is one section where water seemingly flows upwards and the tour guide sits on the chair with two legs floating in the air and other two legs supported by the wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A629967 BBC - h2g2 - The Mystery Hole Revealed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">'''Mythos''' is the term used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) for the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of an [[Tragedy#Performance_of_Greek_tragedies|Athenian tragedy]]. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.

== Variations on plot ==
“In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Poetics'' 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear.  According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in ''Poetics'' 13 and a different set in ''Poetics'' 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of ''Poetics'' as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”.  A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune.  The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”.  Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four.  Aristotle contends in ''Poetics'' 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to [[hamartia]], “error.”  Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’  ''Poetics'' 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, ''Poetics'' 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent.  “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of [[pathos]]:

1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.

2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.

3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.

4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.&lt;ref name="Rizzoli 11"&gt;Rizzoli 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aristotle's mythos vs. the modern interpretation of plot ==
Aristotle’s notion of mythos in ''Poetics'' differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s ''Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion'', Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore, Elizabeth. "Narratological Plots and Aristotle's Mythos." Arethusa 33 (2000): 37-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 40&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to [[Meir Sternberg]], Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg|Sternberg, Meir]]. "Universals of Narrative and Their Cognitivist Fortunes (II)." ''[[Poetics Today]]'' 24 (2003): 517-638.&lt;/ref&gt;). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events.  Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 64&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;1450.a:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.

[[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Mark W. "Introduction to Hegel's Theory of Tragedy." PhaenEx 1 (2006): 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 519&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 524&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as [[Vladimir Propp]], who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 45&lt;/ref&gt; Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 46&lt;/ref&gt; Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in ''Poetics'' because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15287">A '''re-edited film''' is a [[film]] that has been [[film editing|modified]] from its original [[theatrical release]]. These films are typically preceded by the disclaimer, "''This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content''." Reasons for this type of editing may range from the distributor's demands to accommodating different audience groups. Fan-made movie edits are often met with controversy, as they bring up issues of copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120601/03533819162/fan-made-movie-edits-another-cultural-loss-hands-copyright.shtml|title=Fan-Made Movie Edits: Another Cultural Loss At The Hands Of Copyright|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of re-editing ==
There are three main types of film editing: format, length, and content.
* '''Format''': Feature films are commonly produced in a [[widescreen]] 1.85:1 aspect ratio or 2.40:1 aspect ratio. which is different from the screen formats television currently has – A standard 1.33:1 (or 4:3) aspect ratio of [[analog television]] and the growing standard of 1.77:1 (or 16:9) aspect ratio for [[digital television]]. Prior to the beginning of a film presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio on [[VHS]] tapes or [[DVD]]s, a disclaimer appears (mainly a black background), reading, ''This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.'' Since the adoption of [[High-definition television|HD]] television, some theatrical films intended for 2.39 or 2.40 aspect ratios have been reframed for 1.78 (16x9) for television and home video, and also require the modification warning as per [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] rules.
* '''Length''': Films may be shortened for [[television]] [[broadcasting]] or for use on [[airline]]s.  DVD releases of films may also contain longer cuts.  In a growing trend, more and more films are being released in an ''Unrated'' cut of the film. Prior to when TV airings of the film begins, a format screen appears reading, "''The following film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen, to run in the time allotted and edited for content''" (see below).  The end credits on TV airings of films sometimes speed up to make time for the next show or film to start, or to free up more airtime for advertisements, which has become an increasingly-common practice.
* '''Content''': Some films have content deemed "objectionable" to "family audiences": [[sexual content]], [[obscene language]], [[graphic violence]], and perceived racial insensitivity.  To make these films suitable for younger or more typical audiences, or to appeal to [[advertisers]] when a film is shown on [[basic cable]] or [[broadcast]] TV, alternative versions are created with such content removed or replaced. Often, [[profanities]] are replaced with [[minced oath]]s.  The editing of these versions is performed by a censor and not the producer or director of the work. In addition, a film is often times edited if it receives the NC-17 (No one 17 and under admitted) rating from the MPAA, as NC-17 rated films are not screened at mainstream cinemas or advertised on television. Therefore, studios will often re-edit the film to achieve an R rating instead.  

== Re-editing techniques ==
There are two main techniques for re-editing films:

=== Manual re-editing ===
Purchased film content is downloaded onto an editing work station hard drive and third-party editors manually re-edit the video and audio tracks, removing objectionable content.  The re-edited version is then copied onto media (VHS or DVD) and made available for rental or purchase provided an original version has been purchased in correlation with the re-edited copy. Some manual re-edits are done by fans (see ''[[The Phantom Edit]]'') to cut a film to their own – or their peers – specifications.

Although the recent court ruling prohibits business from manually re-editing commercial films, the law still allows for individuals to self censor and edit their own films for personal use.

=== Programmed re-editing ===
Programmed re-editing occurs when software (such as that employed in a DVD player) is used to skip portions of the video and/or audio content on-the-fly according to pre-programmed instruction sets which are knowingly used by the consumer.

==Opening disclaimers==
In any case, theatrical films that aired on television in the 1970s and most of the 1980s would simply have an "Edited For Television" disclaimer superimposed right after the opening credits, or, in a few cases, superimposed over the movie title card itself, just below the title. However, today, when a theatrical film or television special is aired on network or syndicated television or is re-issued on video in a form different from its original version, variations of the following disclaimers appear:
* ''"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.''"
* ''"The following film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen."''
* ''"This film has been modified as follows from its original version: It has been formatted to fit your screen."''
* Depending on content and time, the disclaimer will add: ''"...to run in the time allotted and for content."'' or ''"...and to run in the time allotted."'' or ''"...and edited for content."''
* Disney films prepared for television by [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] and other select TV stations will have: ''"This film has been edited for television"'', or ''"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been edited for television and formatted to fit this screen."''
* Many DVD releases that contain versions of films different from the theatrical releases, such as [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment|Universal Studios Home Video]]'s ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' director's cut DVD will have: ''"This film has been modified from its original version to include additional material not in the original release."''
* In the instance of black-and-white films that have been [[film colorization|colorized]], there will often be a disclaimer such as the following: ''"This is a colorized version of a film originally marketed and distributed to the public in black and white. It has been altered without the participation of the principal director, screenwriter, and other creators of the original film."''

== History of manual re-editing ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Early cases of this practice go back to the [[Nazism|Nazis]], who regularly stole prints of American movies from European countries during their [[Blitzkrieg]] raids. They would then either cheaply reanimate the movie (see ''[[Hochzeit im Korallenmeer]]''), or they would change the names in the credits (as with [[Max and David Fleischer]]'s cartoons).

As theatrical movies began to air on television, networks successfully sought permission to air shortened versions of movies. These TV version of theatrical films had scenes or sections of movies cut out, in order to provide a length short enough to fit in fixed number normal television half-hour-based time slots (often four half-hour slots). This also allowed scenes unsuitable for television to be cut or trimmed such as those with sex or graphic violence. On the other hand, networks would also often add footage deleted from a film's theatrical release to pad out a certain running time (3 to 4 hours).

In response to consumer demand, families began to re-edit purchased VHS tapes literally by making cuts and splices to the tape. A hotbed for this activity has been Utah with its conservative and entrepreneurial population. When [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']] was released on VHS, a video store owner in Utah began offering to re-edit purchased copies of the film for a $5 service fee. The service became very popular. Before long, several video rental businesses purchased VHS tapes and had them re-edited for their rental club/co-op members to watch.

At the end of the 1990s, some small companies began selling copies of movies, without the violent, indecent or foul language parts, to appeal to the family audience. By 2003, [[Hollywood]] reacted against these unauthorized modifications, as it considered them to be a destruction of the filmmakers work, and a violation of the controls an author has over his or her works. Famous directors and producers, such as [[Steven Spielberg]], have publicly criticized this practice in magazines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

When DVD technology emerged, the re-editing industry began offering for sale or rental a disabled DVD accompanied by a re-edited version of the film on a coupled DVD-R  Several companies attempted this business. First, some tried to do it via physical brick and mortar stores, the most successful being the deal model and proprietary stores owned by [[CleanFlicks]], Inc. of Utah. [[Clean Films]] later became the largest and most successful company in the business by employing an online rental model (similar to [[Netflix]]) and avoiding any physical stores. CleanFlicks and CleanFilms were sued with several others and a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the companies were violating copyright. Those named in the lawsuit ceased renting and selling edited films. The legal argument was that the editing resulted in a derivation on a fixed media. At all times, for instance, CleanFilms sold edited films with a legitimately purchased original copy.  Furthermore, every rented unit in edited format had a corresponding original copy that was purchased at retail.  The judge ruled that the fixed media caused the violation. [[ClearPlay]] was not affected by this ruling, as they did not sell fixed media, and editing took place as the unaltered streamed media was altered by the consumer's control of ClearPlay's software.

The lawsuit started because a CleanFlicks franchisee in Colorado pre-emptively sued major directors. The franchisee feared the directors were going to sue because the DGA's website said as much. The [[Directors Guild of America]] and the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] counter-sued and also included several edited film companies for [[copyright infringement]] and claims regarding derivative works. In 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch of the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]] ruled that it was a copyright violation to distribute re-edited films without the consent from the film studios (key was the fixed media aspect of the businesses).

In an odd twist, despite Judge Matsch's decision and order to the re-editing companies to destroy all their re-edited inventory, shortly after the studios' victory in the Denver court, the lawyers for the studios negotiated with lawyers for the re-editing companies allowing for the sale of existing inventory. One of the companies in the first three days of a "going out of business sale" generated more than a quarter of a million dollars in revenue and eventually sold enough re-edited movies to provide original investors a five times or better return on investment. This is an unexpected investor outcome given the loss of a major infringement case.

Less controversial than external bodies editing movies were the rise of [[director's cut]] editions of movies, which flourished with the advent of [[DVD]]s. These restore (and occasionally also shorten or omit, as in the case of [[Alien (film)|Alien]]) scenes or footage from movies which had been shortened for whatever reason (including studio interference with the directors creative vision, inability to finish what was intended due to technology, or even the reactions of test audiences).

== History of programmed re-editing ==
[[ClearPlay]] was sued by the DGA and MPAA, but the case was rendered moot by [[Family Entertainment and Copyright Act|The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005]], which clarified that ClearPlay's filtering approach was legal and did not violate copyright law. As a result, ClearPlay has been able to offer its products to consumers in the U.S. while others have discontinued for legal reasons.

Another aspect of re-editing comes with consumer made edits, which are called [[fan edit]]s (or fanedits). It is when consumers load the films into their computers and use video editing software to produce mostly a version with changed content for their own entertainment. Fan edits are becoming more popular since they are spread over the internet.

== Future of the industry ==
It is unclear where this industry is headed.  There is demand for the product.{{original research?|date=January 2017}} A 2005 [[ABC News]] poll of 1,002 adults from across the United States found that 39% of those polled were interested in purchasing re-edited films, while 58% of respondents said that would not be interested in such a purchase (with a 3-point error margin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=692068 "ABC News Poll"]. (2005, April 22).  Poll: Mixed Reviews for 'Sanitized' Movies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the aforementioned legal rulings, companies continue to sell re-edited movies via the Internet. Some have been shut down as well. Yet, search engine results on the web reveal companies continue to provide fixed media products, such as Clean Play DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/|title=Edited Movies and Clean Family Edited DVDS for Sale ,|date=9 January 2011|website=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109164222/http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/|archivedate=9 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes they use "going out of business" tactics to move inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/?gclid=CICOp_z1p6cCFQpvbAodLGjD_w|title=Edited Movies and Clean Family Edited DVDS for Sale ,|date=8 July 2011|website=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708163539/http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/?gclid=CICOp_z1p6cCFQpvbAodLGjD_w|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, physical "brick and mortar" stores have been shut down, such as Cougar Video in Provo, Utah, which remained open long after the named companies in the aforementioned lawsuit were closed down.

One company, Swank, offers re-edited movies created by the studios themselves, supposedly for showings in correctional facilities and other non-theatrical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.swankmp.com/insti/edited.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510012800/http://college.swankmp.com/insti/edited.asp |archivedate=2011-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if these versions are the same re-edited versions that studios create for airlines or television showings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">A '''re-recording mixer''' in North America, also known as a '''dubbing mixer''' in Europe, is a [[post-production]] [[audio engineer]] who mixes recorded dialogue, sound effects and music to create the final version of a [[soundtrack]] for a [[feature film]],  [[television program]], or [[television advertisement]]. The final mix must achieve a desired sonic balance between its various elements, and must match the [[film director|director]]'s or [[sound design]]er's original vision for the project. For material intended for broadcast, the final mix must also comply with all applicable laws governing sound mixing (e.g., the [[Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act|CALM Act]] in the United States and the EBU R128 loudness protocol in Europe).  

The different names of this profession are both based on the fact that [[live sound mixing|the mixer is not mixing a live performance to a live audience]] nor [[Production sound mixer|recording live on a set]].  That is, he or she is re-recording sound already recorded elsewhere (the basis of the North American name) after passing it through mixing equipment such as a [[digital audio workstation]] and may dub in additional sounds in the process (the basis of the European name).  While mixing can be performed in a recording studio or home office, a full-size mixing stage or dubbing stage is used for feature films intended for release to movie theaters in order to help the mixer envision how the final mix will be heard in such large spaces. 

During production or earlier parts of post-production, sound editors, sound designers, sound engineers, production sound mixers and/or music editors assemble the tracks that become raw materials for the re-recording mixer to work with. Those tracks in turn originate with sounds created by professional musicians, singers, actors, or foley artists. 

The first part of the traditional re-recording process is called the "premix." In the dialog premix the re-recording mixer does preliminary processing, including making initial loudness adjustments, [[fade (audio engineering)|cross-fading]], and reducing environmental noise or [[Spill (audio)|spill]] that the on-set microphone picked up. In most instances, audio restoration software may be employed. For film or television productions, they may add a temporary/permanent music soundtrack that will have been prepared by the music editor, then the resulting work will be previewed by test audiences, and then the film or television program is re-cut and the soundtrack must be mixed again. Re-recording mixer may also augment or minimize audience reactions for television programs recorded in front of a studio audience. In some cases, a [[laugh track]] may augment these reactions.

During the "final mix" the re-recording/dubbing mixers, guided by the director or producer, must make creative decisions from moment to moment in each scene about how loud each major sound element (dialog, sound effects, laugh track and music) should be relative to each other. They also modify individual sounds when desired by adjusting their loudness and spectral content and by adding artificial reverberation. They can insert sounds into the three-dimensional space of the listening environment for a variety of venues and release formats: movie theaters, home theater systems, etc. that have stereo and multi-channel ([[5.1]], [[7.1]], etc.) sound systems.

[[File:Sanger's amphitheatre - Evanion collection (1886) - BL.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Poster for an 1886 production of Reece's ''Aladdin and the Forty Thieves'']]
'''Robert Reece''' (2 May 1838 – 8 July 1891) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] comic playwright and librettist active in the [[Victorian era]].  He wrote many successful [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]], [[comic opera]]s, farces and adaptations from the French, including the English-language adaptation of the operetta ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', which became the longest-running piece of [[musical theatre]] in history up to that time.  He sometimes collaborated with [[Henry Brougham Farnie]] or others.

==Early life and career==
Reece was born in the island of [[Barbados]], [[West Indies]].  His father, Robert Reece (1808–1874), was a [[barrister]] of the [[Inner Temple]].  Reece matriculated from [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]] in 1857 and received his B.A. in 1860 and his M.A. in 1864.  He was admitted a student at the Inner Temple in 1860 but was not [[called to the bar]]. For a short time he was a medical student. Between 1861 and 1863, he was an extra clerk in the office of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and from 1864 to 1868 an extra temporary clerk to the emigration commissioners.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Reece, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1860s to the 1880s, Reece wrote comic pieces for the stage with fair success, often adapting three-act European operettas into two-act English-language pieces. He even scored a number of hits, including his adaptation of ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', which ran for over 700 performances in 1878–79, the longest run in the history of [[musical theatre]] up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html List of longest running plays in London and New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reece's first professionally produced effort was the libretto of an operetta, ''Castle Grim'', with music by G. Allen, produced at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1865.  Among his subsequent contributions to the same stage were the [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] ''Prometheus'' (1865),&lt;ref&gt;Printed in Lacy's ''Acting Edition of Plays'', vol. lxviii&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lady of the Lake'' (1866),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxi&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat'' (1871, starring [[Fred Sullivan]] and [[Henrietta Hodson]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxxix&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote for the Royalty ''Dora's Device'', a comedietta (1871),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xc&lt;/ref&gt; ''Little Robin Hood'', a burlesque (1871), revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] (1882),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xci&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Paquita, or Love in a Trance'', a [[comic opera]] with music by J. A. Mallandine (1871).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xciv&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Queen's Theatre]], he produced ''The Stranger, stranger than Ever,'' a burlesque (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxxii&lt;/ref&gt;  Another burlesque the same year at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] was ''Agamemnon and Cassandra''&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1UM5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA542&amp;lpg=RA1-PA542&amp;dq=%22robert+reece%22+benefit+play+london&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mPgy_EebRu&amp;sig=3xr-gTdElh5MxbMKRoRKFqXq9tw#PPA23,M1 A Dictionary of the Drama, ''Agamemnon and Cassandra'' described on p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
He wrote many other burlesques for the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]], the [[Olympic Theatre]] (including ''Richelieu'' in 1873 and ''Clockwork'' in 1877),&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref name=programmes&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/programm.htm Programme listings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420221553/http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/programm.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] (including ''Green Old Age'', with music by [[Frederic Clay]], in 1874; and a burlesque, ''Ruy Blas Righted''),&lt;ref name=programmes/&gt; the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and the Gaiety. At the Gaiety, he produced fourteen pieces between 1872 and 1884, among them the [[pantomime]]s ''Ali Baba'' (1872), ''Don Giovanni in Venice'' (1873), ''[[The Forty Thieves]],'' (written with [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]], [[H. J. Byron]] and [[W. S. Gilbert]]) (1878) and another version of the same story, with music by [[Meyer Lutz]] in 1880;&lt;ref&gt;"The Gaiety", ''The Times'', 25 December 1880, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the burlesques ''Aladdin,'' (1881); ''Little Robin Hood,'' (1882); and ''[[Valentine and Orson]],'' (1882).

He collaborated with [[Henry Brougham Farnie]] on 15 libretti or adaptations and occasionally joined with other dramatic writers.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; With Farnie, for the [[Folly Theatre]] in London, he wrote ''Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea'' (1877);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 Information from the Operetta Research Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727081746/http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stars and Garters'' (1878); his biggest success, ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'' (1878); and ''The Creole''.  For the  [[Comedy Theatre]], he wrote ''Boccaccio'', with music by [[Franz von Suppé]] (1882).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. ''A Dictionary of the Drama (1904) 1904 Chatto &amp; Windus, London&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote the successful burlesque, ''Carmen; or Sold for a Song'' (1879) for the Folly Theatre.  ''The Highest Bidder'' played in New York in 1887, starring [[E. H. Sothern]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/04/24/103141659.pdf New York Times article of 24 April 1887]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=393134 Information about ''The Highest Bidder'' from the IBDB database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, he wrote ''Cattarina'', a comic opera with music by Frederic Clay, produced at the [[Charing Cross Theatre]], and in 1879 he wrote the comic opera ''La Petite Mademoiselle'', together with [[Henry Sambrooke Leigh]], for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  Also for the Alhambra, in 1881 he wrote an English-language adaptation of ''Jeanne, Jeannette and Jeanneton'', a grand opera by P. Lacome after an original libretto by Clairville &amp; Delacour.&lt;ref name=programmes/&gt;

Despite all of his successful work, Reece fell on hard times in the 1880s.  He died in London at the age of 53 and was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8667">[[Image:Rochester_Poets_logo.jpg|right|thumbnail|129px]]'''Rochester Poets''' is the oldest ongoing literary organization in the [[upstate New York]] region. Founded in 1920 as the [[Rochester, New York]], chapter of the [[Poetry Society of America]], the group ceased its affiliation with the Society in the 1980s in order to accept a wider variety of members. At that time, the organization adopted its current name.
		
From June 2005 to May 2013, meeting/workshops were held monthly on the third (later fourth) Saturday at the Center at High Falls Gallery; the Gallery closed in June 2013, and subsequent meetings were held at various venues such as [[Panera Bread]] restaurants in the Rochester area.

From 2003 to 2005, the organization held monthly readings at Writers &amp; Books. In January 2006, the venue was changed to [[St. John Fisher College]] in [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford, NY]], where it  held a reading on the third Sunday of each month in the Ross Art Gallery of the Skalny Welcome Center. In August, 2015, the group moved to the [[Clover Center for Arts &amp; Spirituality]] in [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton, NY]], and in March, 2017 moved to the [[Legacy at Clover Blossom]] complex, also in Brighton.   

A large portion of the Rochester Poetry Society and Rochester Poets correspondence, minutes and other documents from 1922 to 1973 are archived in the Rare Books and Special Collection Department of the [[Rush Rhees Library]] located at the [[University of Rochester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester Poetry Society|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=1113|work=Department of Rare Books, Special Collections and Preservation|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Rochester Poets sends out regular email flyers of area literary events, publishes a monthly newsletter and ''The Pinnacle Hill Review''*, an annual anthology of selected member work. The group maintains a website, a mailing list (informing subscribers of area literary events) which can be joined via the website, and a [[blog]].

From 2004 to 2011, Rochester Poets sponsored an annual Poets Against the War event for the Rochester area. From April 2007 until September 2009, they co-sponsored a monthly series of readings at the Anti-War Storefront of the Peace, Action &amp; Education Committee of Rochester MetroJustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester MetroJustice Peace Action &amp; Education|url=http://www.metrojustice.org/pae_storefront.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212140750/http://metrojustice.org/pae_storefront.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, they began sponsoring annual [[World Poetry Day]] and [[National Poetry Month]] celebrations at St. John Fisher College in March and April of each year; the World Poetry Day event was merged with the April National Poetry Month event in 2009. The Celebration is open to poets, musicians and singers of all ages and levels from throughout the region.

From 2007 to 2011, the group sponsored an Emerging Poets event in December of each year at St. John Fisher College. The event was open to poets of all ages; the primary criterion for eligibility was that participants were not yet "established" with a published volume of poems or had a significant number of poems appear in literary journals. From 2007 to 2011, the group also hosted the weekly Free Speech Zone series each Tuesday at the Tango Cafe in Rochester; the series moved to Mondays in 2011 before it was suspended in December 2011 pending finding a new venue.

==Publications==
The group's anthology has had various titles over the years, among them ''The Oracle''&lt;ref name="FWP" /&gt;{{RP|128}}, ''Touchstone'', ''The Gleam'', ''In Between Seasons'', ''Images'', ''Daylight Burning Lanterns'', ''Disguised As Shapes You Love'', and, most recently, ''The Pinnacle Hill Review''. Many of the volumes are held by the Rochester Public Library, Central Branch Literature Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester Public Library, Central Branch Literature Collection|url=http://catalogplus.libraryweb.org/#section=search&amp;term=Rochester Poetry Society|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable members==
The group was founded by [[Edith Willis Forbes]], who was also active in the [[Women's Education and Industrial Union]], the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], and the [[Door of Hope]];&lt;ref name="FWP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rochester and Monroe County|year=1937|publisher=Scrantom's|location=Rochester, NY|url=https://archive.org/details/rochesterandmonr00federich|author=Federal Writer's Project|authorlink=Federal Writer's Project|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|128}} its first president was [[Carl Lamson Carmer]].&lt;ref name="FWP" /&gt;{{RP|132}} Past and current members of note include [[Al Poulin, Jr.]] (1938–1996), [[Patricia Janus]] (1932–2006), [[Dale Davis (poet)|Dale Davis]], Leah Zazulyer, [[Cornelius Eady]], [[Dane Gordon]], Jordan Smith, [[James Lavilla-Havelin]], Etta Ruth Weigl, [[Israel Emiot]] (1909–1978), Gary Lehmann, John Roche, Vincent Golphin, Anne Coon, Carol Oliver, Gerald Clarke, Robert Koch, Wynne McClure, Ruth Kennedy, [[Francesca Gulì]] (ca 1921–2009), Paul Humphrey (1915–2001), Eleanor McQuilken (1908–2004), George Monagan (1925–2005), David Michael Nixon, [[W. E.

Other Rochester area poets of note affiliated with the group include [[Adelaide Crapsey]] (1878–1914), who knew many of the founders of the group, [[William Heyen]] and [[Anthony Piccione]] (1939–2001), who were honored by the Society, and [[John Ashbery]] (1927–2017), who was raised in the area and knew and remained friends with many of the group's members and officers.

==Rochester Poets Walk==
In 2009, officials of the City of Rochester, in conjunction with the [[Art Walk Project]], which had created an area along University Avenue in Rochester in the "arts district", proposed an extension west along University and north and south along Goodman Street. The majority of the project would be along the sidewalks bordering two sides of Rochester's [[Memorial Art Gallery]]. The relationship between the City and Art Walk deteriorated, and eventually, a new entity, The Art Walk Extension Project, was created. Two of the proposed development for the Extension were a [[Poets Walk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rochester ''Democrat &amp; Chronicle'', Poets Walk|url=http://artdrop.democratandchronicle.com/poets-walk|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be constructed in 2012 as a redesigned front sidewalk of MAG on University, and a Fiction Writers Walk, still in development, on the east side of the Gallery along Goodman.

Many of those nominated for inclusion in Poets Walk were poets (several of them deceased) who were members of Rochester Poets or had been honored by or affiliated with the group in some way. And many of those nominees were among the first inductees honored in November 2011. They included: Sam Abrams, Linda Allardt, John Ashbery, Anne C. Coon, [[Adelaide Crapsey]], Finvola Drury, [[Cornelius Eady]], Israel Emiot, Vincent F. A. Golphin, Dane Gordon, [[Anthony Hecht]], [[William Heyen]], M. J. Iuppa, Patricia Janus, [[bobby johnson]], Kathryn Jospé, [[Frank Judge]], [[Galway Kinnell]], [[Judith Kitchen]], James LaVilla-Havelin, [[Li-Young Lee]]. [[Gary Lehmann]], Stephen Lewandowski, Karla Linn Merrifield, [[John Logan (poet)|John Logan]], Donna Marbach, Rennie McQuilkin, Eleanor McQuilkin, [[Marianne Moore]], David Michael Nixon, Lori D. Nolasco, [[Beatrice O'Brien]], [[Joel Oppenheimer]], [[Anthony Piccione]], [[Jarold Ramsay]], [[Hyam Plutzik]], [[A. Poulin, Jr.]], [[Shreela Ray]], Patricia Roth Schwartz, [[W. D. Snodgrass]], Bruce Sweet, [[Michael Waters (writer)|Michael Waters]], and Leah Zazulyer.

'''Scottish jewellery''' is [[jewellery]] created in [[Scotland]] or in a style associated with Scotland, which today often takes the form of the Celtic style. It is often characterised by being inspired by nature, Scandinavian mythology, and [[Celts|Celtic]] knot patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/blog/scotland/jewellery-gifts/|title=Scotland's amazing jewellery makers|date=2015-02-09|work=The Blog|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewellery has a history in Scotland dating back to at least the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-37481840|title=Iron Age pin recreated using 3D printer|date=2016-09-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional examples ==
[[File:Silver Brooch, National Museum of Scotland (6930614532).jpg|left|thumb|[[Penannular brooch]] from the [[St Ninian's Isle Treasure]]]]
Traditional examples of Scottish jewellery are often functional objects that have been decorated and over time have become jewellery items.  Over time, these necessary objects took on more and more decorative appearances, and are now considered an aesthetic item that is more of an accessory.

==== Kilt pin ====
The [[kilt pin]] is a functional object that weighs down the edge of the apron of a kilt to keep it in place during movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kiltsociety.com/blogs/the-blog/kilt-pin|title=The Essential Kilt Pin|work=KILT SOCIETY™|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Penannular/ Celtic brooch ====
The ring and pin style [[Celtic brooch|penannular brooch]], also known as the Celtic or Viking brooch, had the original purpose of being a fastener for clothing. Also native to Ireland, it's design was meant to mirror that of the [[torc]]. The first examples of this style of brooch date from circa 700CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.claddaghdesign.com/history/celtic-brooch-brief-history/|title=A Brief History of the Celtic Brooch {{!}} Claddagh Design|website=www.claddaghdesign.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These items were first produced for the elite class out of precious metals, and over time the more simple item of the thistle brooch emerged out of this tradition.

==== Thistle brooch ====
The thistle brooch as a simpler version of the penannular brooch, with less surface decoration, which gained popularity around 1100. The [[thistle]] is the national flower of Scotland and acts as an emblem. Today, thistle brooches are often made of silver and contain a thistle motif, and are not necessarily a penannular brooch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamiltonandyoung.co.uk/thistle-brooches-103-c.asp|title=Thistle Brooches|website=www.hamiltonandyoung.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Luckenbooth brooches .jpg|thumb|Examples of different styles of Scottish Luckenbooth brooches with varying decoration styles]]

==== Luckenbooth brooch ====
The [[Luckenbooth brooch]] is a style of brooch that originated on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh. It is a kind of annular brooch that is heart shaped. It often comes in the form of two hearts woven together, with more ornate brooches also containing a crown pattern. The name Luckenbooth comes from the locked booths along the royal mile that had a similar pattern. This style first gained popularity in the 17th century, and had a revival in the 19th century in the form of pebble jewellery. They were traditionally given as a token of love or as an engagement present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walkerscelticjewelry.com/blogs/celticjewelry/11786253-history-of-the-luckenbooth-brooch|title=History of the Luckenbooth Brooch|last=Jewelry|first=Walker Metalsmiths Celtic|work=Walker Metalsmiths Celtic Jewelry|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scottish pebble set jewellery 16th century.JPG|left|thumb|A set of 16th Century Scottish Pebble Jewels, made of agate, gold and enamel]]

==== Pebble jewellery ====
Pebble jewellery, featuring the stones agate or "Scotch Pebbles", Cairngorm, jasper, jaspagate, and sometimes bloodstone, freshwater pearls, gold, silver and granite, is a style of jewellery that has a long history associated with Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scottish-Pebble-Jewellery-History-Materials/dp/0955810604|title=Scottish Pebble Jewellery: Its History and the Materials from Which it Was Made|last=Crawford|first=Nick|date=2007|publisher=Lapidary Stone Publications|year=|isbn=9780955810602|location=Kingsdown|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pebble jewellery refers to a style rather than a specific item, with many examples of pebble brooches and bracelets, though other items such as pendants have also been known to be decorated in this style.

== Materials ==
The materials traditionally used to create jewellery in Scotland are also found in the local area, for example the agate mined from volcanic rocks north of Dundee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.countryfile.com/go-outdoors/britains-treasure-map-our-guide-on-where-and-how-to-hunt-for-treasure/|title=Britain's treasure map: our guide on where and how to hunt for treasure|work=Countryfile.com|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metals ===

The most common forms of metal in Scottish jewellery are silver, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], gold, pewter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.incorporationofgoldsmiths.org/content/hallmarkingarchive-home/|title=Welcome to our Hallmarking Archive {{!}} Incorporation of Goldsmiths|website=www.incorporationofgoldsmiths.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kiltsociety.com/blogs/the-blog/kilt-pin|title=The Essential Kilt Pin|work=KILT SOCIETY™|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are often the backing to a stone setting in the case of rings and brooches, but can also provide decoration through casting and other decorative methods. Gold can be found locally in Scotland around the areas of Lowther Hills, Wanlockhead and Leadhills. The first documentation of gold in the area is from the 16th century, and this gold was made into the Scottish Crown and supported a community of goldsmiths around the country who are still active today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leadminingmuseum.co.uk/gold-panning/|title=Gold Panning - The Lead Mining Museum|work=The Lead Mining Museum|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was even a short lived gold rush in the 1860s. Silver was also actively mined in Scotland, with over 5 individual sites that over time have had silver extracted from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk/~arb/scotland/mines_biblio.html|title=The Mines of Scotland: A Bibliography|website=www.sat.dundee.ac.uk|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stones ===
Stones such as [[agate]], cairngorm citrine, jasper, [[malachite]] and granite were mined in the hills of Scotland and were popular in jewellery. Agate was made popular in Scottish jewellery styles in the 19th century, popularised by Queen Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.beryllane.com.au/blog-2/17-antique-scottish-jewellery|title=Antique Scottish Jewellery|last=Trudy|work=Beryl Lane|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stones are often found on bracelets, pendants and brooches.

Sapphires, although rare in Scotland, can be mined from the [[Harris, Scotland|Isle of Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12107325.legal-moves-take-shine-off-discovery-of-large-sapphire/|title=Legal moves take shine off discovery of large sapphire|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearls are often common in jewellery in Scotland, with the addition of them to the Scottish Crown in the 16th century. They come from a pearl bearing mussel, half the population of which are native to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.karipearls.com/scottish-pearls.html|title=Scottish Pearls|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
Throughout history, metalworkers did not only produce jewellery, but also work to produce handles and decorative cookware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A. G. G.|date=1957|title=Review of Scottish Gold and Silver Work by Ian Finaly|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume= 99 no.605|issue=650|pages=165–166|jstor=872178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cold metalworking techniques can be used to make penannular brooches, beginning with wire and then flattening the ends to create the brooch shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medievalyork.com/2015/08/26/easy-metal-project-basic-penannular-brooches/|title=Easy metal project: basic penannular brooches|date=2015-08-27|work=Medieval York: Eulalia Hath a Blogge|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Iona Celtic Art pendant.jpg|thumb|A pendant with a Celtic pattern from Iona]]
The crafting of jewellery or fictional items that could have been embellished to create a form of jewellery has a history in Scotland at least dating back to at least 300BCE, with the emergence of the "Celtic" style of decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotland.org/features/ancient-history-of-scotland|title=Ancient History of Scotland {{!}} Scotland is Now|website=Scotland|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtic style and the Pictish style are very similar and both have this influence in Scottish jewellery today. Pictish has been discovered through archaeological investigation since the 18th century, and is commonly made of silver. A sizeable example of a discovery of Pictish jewellery was found at the Gaulcross hoard in Aberdeenshire, with examples of fragments of silver bracelets brooches, and pendants from the post-Roman period. These finds contain examples of chain work, and ornate decoration on the fragments. They are now on display at the National Museum in Edinburgh. Other Pictish hoards have often found torcs, and different kinds of penannular brooches, some zoomorphic, though bronze brooches are more common than silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble|first=Gordon|last2=Goldberg|first2=Martin|last3=McPherson|first3=Alistair|last4=Sveinbjarnarson|first4=Oskar|date=2016|title=(Re)discovering the Gaulcross hoard|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/rediscovering-the-gaulcross-hoard/1D4141D467B8007487F63D58CF913825|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=90|issue=351|pages=726–741|doi=10.15184/aqy.2016.71|issn=0003-598X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle ages, ornate jewellery was a sign of a high class, lower class people tended to wear more simple items that were primarily functional and made of more simple materials such as copper or pewter, compared to richer materials such as silver or gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/a-history-of-jewellery|title=V&amp;A · A history of jewellery|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1800s, a boom in the production of Scottish style jewellery resulted due to the building of railways in Britain and increased access to travel. Scotland became a holiday destination, and jewellery was in demand as a souvenir. As a result, the styles of Scottish jewellery started to be produced in England, specifically Birmingham and Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.langantiques.com/university/Scottish_Jewelry|title=Scottish Jewelry - AJU|website=www.langantiques.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A resurgence of Celtic and medieval style Scottish jewellery occurred in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walkerscelticjewelry.com/blogs/celticjewelry/113430788-antique-irish-and-scottish-jewelry-exhibit-in-andover|title=Antique Irish and Scottish Jewelry Exhibit in Andover|last=Jewelry|first=Walker Metalsmiths Celtic|work=Walker Metalsmiths Celtic Jewelry|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the popularisation of agate pieces, also known as "pebble jewellery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.langantiques.com/university/Scottish_Jewelry|title=Scottish Jewelry - AJU|website=www.langantiques.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period there was a rise in creation and wear of agate brooches and bracelets due to Queen Victoria's interest in the stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jewellerymuse.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/vintage-and-antique-scottish-agate-jewellery-info-guide/|title=Vintage and Antique Scottish agate jewellery info guide|date=2014-02-14|work=The Jewellery Muse|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in agate re-emerged again in the 1970s. The Victoria and Albert Museum has many examples of Scottish jewellery from the later half of the 19th century, both pebble styles and celtic designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O120371/brooch-fenton-james/|title=Brooch {{!}} Fenton, James {{!}} V&amp;A Search the Collections|website=collections.vam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modernist period of jewellery making began in Britain in the 1950s, inspired by the sleek, simple style of Scandinavian designs from earlier in the 20th century. According to the National Museum of Scotland "British Modernist jewellery became defined by the use of textural, sculptural gold work, inspired by nature and often incorporating large gemstones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nms.ac.uk/explore-our-collections/stories/art-and-design/modernist-jewellery/|title=Explore|website=National Museums Scotland|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern ==
Today, Scotland are offers a wide range of styles of jewellery, ranging from the traditional Celtic style, to vintage Victorian and Edwardian pieces, to contemporary art deco and art nouveau styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/08/shopping.shoppingdirectory89|title=Shopping directory: Jewellery: Scotland|date=2007-12-08|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of jewellery making in Scotland continues today with many courses offered in Colleges around Scotland in various levels of difficulty in jewellery making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/study/evening-courses/jewellery-workshop-beginners/|title=Jewellery Workshop - Beginners|last=KirstyBarr|website=www.gsa.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crown Jewels ==
[[File:The Queen at the Scottish Parliament.jpg|thumb|The Scottish Crown in 2011]]

Despite the [[Honours of Scotland]] being often referred to as the "crown jewels", there are no pieces of pure jewellery in the usual sense in the set. It consists of the [[Crown of Scotland|crown]], the sceptre and the Sword of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/The-Honours-of-Scotland/|title=The 'Honours' of Scotland and the Scottish Crown Jewels|work=Historic UK|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crown is the only object of the three that is supposed to have been made in Scotland, it was originally dating from approximately 1503, but was remodelled due to damage in 1540 by the Edinburgh goldsmith John Mosman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.royal.uk/honours-scotland|title=The Honours of Scotland|last=Ciara.Berry|date=2016-01-15|work=The Royal Family|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over six weeks, Mosman added 68 Scottish freshwater pearls, 41 ounces of gold, and 44 gemstones to the new crown, but also made use of the gold and jewels from the original state crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/art365232|title=Parliament Week: Meet the man who gave the Crown of Scotland a long overdue clean {{!}} Culture24|website=www.culture24.org.uk|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Noteworthy Pieces ==
This section contains information on other famous pieces of jewellery that either originate from or are associated with Scotland.

=== Stewart Jewels ===
The Stewart Jewels are items of jewellery that originate from the Stewart dynasty who ruled Scotland for generations and went on to rule England after the death of Elizabeth I. The set consists of three items, all of which are on display with the Honours at Edinburgh Castle: the St. Andrew Jewel, a collar of the Order of the Garter, and a ring with a ruby set into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/scottish_crown_jewels.html|title=The Crown Jewels of Scotland.|website=www.englishmonarchs.co.uk|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lorne Jewels ===
The Lorne Jewels, part of the Secondary Honours of Scotland, were gifted to the nation in the 1930s by [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], Duchess of Argyle. The jewels consist of a single necklace with a pendant and a locket that was made in London in the 1870s and was a gift from the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|9th Duke of Argyll]] to his soon to be wife. It consists of a chain made of diamonds studded with pearls, the pendant has a pearl set in the centre which is surrounded by two rows of diamonds of different shapes. The locket hangs from the bottom of the pendant and is attached by 2 emeralds shaped into the likeness of bog myrtle. The locket itself is shaped like a pear and is encrusted with diamonds, with extra decoration in sapphires depicting the motto of the House of Lorne and the Galley of Lorne. This piece is also on display at Edinburgh Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.historicenvironment.scot/objects/10251|title=The Lorne Jewels|website=Collections {{!}} Historic Environment Scotland|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noteworthy jewellers ==

=== The Mossman family ===
The two Mossman men, John and James, both were goldsmiths who worked in Edinburgh in the 16th century. Both served as court jewellers to the Stewart family during their Scottish rule. They are also known for owning the [[John Knox House]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britainexpress.com/scotland/Lothian/properties/John-Knox-House.htm|title=John Knox's House, Royal Mile, Edinburgh {{!}} History &amp; Photos|last=Express|first=Britain|work=Britain Express|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identities of the two men are often confused, with many sources being unclear on who is the father and who is the son.

==== John Mossman ====
John Mossman was an Edinburgh based goldsmith who is most famous for remodelling the Scottish crown in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecourtjeweller.com/2017/08/the-crown-of-scotland.html|title=The Crown of Scotland|website=www.thecourtjeweller.com|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== James Mossman ====
James Mossman was the son of John Mossman, and was the Court Jeweller, and was executed for his loyalty to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] during the siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1573, in which he played the part of defending the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenman|first=Bruce P.|date=1995|title=Jacobean Goldsmith-Jewellers as Credit-Creators: The Cases of James Mossman, James Cockie and George Heriot|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|volume=74|issue=198|pages=159–177|jstor=25530681}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was hanged on 3 August 1573. He was the court jeweller for [[Mary of Guise]], and reportedly produced pieces for both her and the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/concerningfamily00kale|title=Concerning the family of Mossman|last=Kaler|first=Bertha Dickie Mossman|date=1900|publisher=[S.l. : s.n.]|others=Allen County Public Library Genealogy Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charles Rennie Mackintosh ===
Although [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] was not a jeweller himself, he made a significant contribution to influencing the style of jewellery through his work as a designer. Today, "Charles Rennie Mackintosh" jewellery is sold that are pieces made to replicate decorative work he did on furniture, buildings, and light fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rennie-mackintosh-jewellery.co.uk|title=The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Jewellery Collection.|website=Rennie Mackintosh Jewellery|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his return from Italy in 1977, Farthing has had one-man shows in the UK, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the United States.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing's work featured in the 1989 [[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo Biennale]] and that same year he served as the Artist in Residence at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in London.  He also won prizes in the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition on eight separate occasions between 1976 and 1999.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;

Farthing was elected as a member of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing's work is in the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)]] and he also showed at the [[Tate Britain]] in 2006 as part of a project called "Drawing from Turner," that he designed and curated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/drawingfromturner/ |title=Drawing from Turner |publisher=Tate |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farthing also painted large murals for the [[Cleveland Browns]] Football Club in Cleveland, Ohio (2004) and [[Aston Villa]] Football Club in Birmingham, UK (2008).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1405273,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephen Farthing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/marco.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193759/http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/marco.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Farthing's teaching career began at [[Canterbury College of Art]] (1977–1979) where he was a lecturer of painting.  He went on to teach at the [[Royal College of Art]] (1980–1985) before becoming the Head of Painting and later the Head of Fine Art at [[West Surrey College of Art and Design]] (1985–1989).&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing spent the next ten years at [[Oxford University]] serving as the Ruskin Master at the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].  He was also made a Professorial Fellow of Oxford's [[St Edmund Hall]] (1990–2000).  Upon leaving the university in 2000, Farthing was made a professor emeritus of St Edmund Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/users/stephenfarthing |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Seh.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing moved to New York in 2000 to become the Executive Director of the [[New York Academy of Art]] and led the Academy until he became the Rootstein Hopkins Research Chair of Drawing at the [[University of the Arts London]] in 2004, a position he held until 2017.&lt;ref name="chelsea.arts.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-staff/a-z/professor-stephen-farthing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150046/http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-staff/a-z/professor-stephen-farthing/ |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing has published extensively.  Most known for his authorship of ''1001 Paintings You Must See Before You Die'' and ''501 Great Artists''.   He also authored the Intelligent Person's Guide to Modern Art, published in 2000 in addition to numerous academic essays and journal articles.&lt;ref name="chelsea.arts.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/biblio.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208064936/http://stephenfarthing.com/biblio.htm |archivedate=8 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Farthing continues to live and work in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Work==
[[File:Step9.gif|thumb|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''Louis XV Rigaud'' (1975), [[Walker Art Gallery]]]]''

Farthing described his work in a 2005 interview, saying "I have dined with the devil in terms of becoming a modern artist.  I have taken hold of history, tried to understand it—and then used and abused it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=196599&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Draw the line at copying? Not him &amp;#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2005-06-10 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's work reflects his education, personal experience and perspective on historical events that have captured his imagination.  After spending a period of study at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris while a student at the [[Royal College of Art]], Stephen Farthing inadvertently fell upon what one could later describe as a postmodernist relationship with history.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Paris, he painted an interpretation of [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s portrait of [[Louis XV]] that as a student won him a prize at the John Moores Exhibition in Liverpool, today this painting stands as an early example of British post modernist painting.&lt;ref name="Stephen Farthing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |title='Louis XV Rigaud', Stephen Farthing - Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool museums |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228131607/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s whilst showing with Edward Totah in London, Farthing showed works that positioned Latin American vernacular culture within a modernist idiom and classicism within the vernacular.

During the 1990s, he reinvented history painting as a viable contemporary narrative taking on subject matters as diverse as the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], swagger portraiture, and the topographical mapping of cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193821/http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/122406/pro_122406079.shtml |title=Cleveland Browns owner getting his kicks from English football &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date=2006-12-24 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most recent work makes explicit a theme that has consistently sat between Farthing and his audience, the "narrative" and "text".

[[File:MH.Trafalgar.2.20.06.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Hands of Fate. |''Hands of Fate'', ([[Battle of Trafalgar]])]]
[[File:GetAttachment-2.aspx.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''The Backstory: Boucher'' (2009)]]

Farthing commented that his work is, "not this thing about 'Oh, let's let the audience make up their mind what it is'…" but about "degrading it on purpose so it becomes not more ambiguous, but less what it was in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|title=Stephen Farthing : Marginally Out of Control|publisher=Lynnparr.co.uk|accessdate=2013-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193753/http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 2009, Farthing had his first one-person show at the Purdy Hicks Gallery in London where, for the first time, he showed the "back-story" paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "back-story" paintings are a series of images painted with a text in reverse sitting on the picture plane between the audience and the image.  The text tells us what is going on not in the picture but behind it, so compromising and at the same time informing the image with  text.   His technically very skilled paintings  all seem to be grounded on one guiding principle  - that what we see will always be  always conditioned by what we know.

In November 2010, Farthing became the second living Royal Academician to be featured in the "laboratory" series of one man shows at the Royal Academy of Arts London. "The Back Story," featured an epic 30 foot painting of the Atlantic ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Academy of Arts|title=Artists' Laboratory 02: Stephen Farthing RA, The Back Story|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301044735/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|work=Press Release|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chelsea Space|title=Stephen Farthing's Ultra Marine Painting|url=http://www.chelseaspace.org/blog/archives/272|work=Atlantic Ocean|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's  work  as a painter  sits midway between the conservative and the cutting edge  between a classical and radical painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2123">'''The Flea''' is an Italian literary [[fairy tale]] written by [[Giambattista Basile]] in his 1634 work, the ''[[Pentamerone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Basile, ''The Pentamerone'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/pentamerone/5flea1911.html "The Flea"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A king raised a flea until it was the size of a sheep.  Then he had it skinned and promised his daughter in marriage to whoever could guess what the skin came from.  An [[ogre]] guessed, and the king had to marry his daughter to him.  The [[Princess and dragon|ogre]] took her to his house, decorated by the bones of men he had eaten, and brought her back men's bodies to eat.  She wept by the window and told an old woman her plight. The old woman told her that she had seven marvelous half-giants sons who could help her.  The next day, the old woman and her sons came and carried her off.

The oldest son heard the ogre whenever he approached, and each of his brothers [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|put]] up an obstacle:  one washed his hands and produced a sea of soapsuds, one transformed a piece of iron into a field of razors, one turned a little stick into a forest, and one turned a little water into a river.  The last one turned a pebble into a tower where they could take refuge, but they were trapped there, and the ogre came with a ladder.  The youngest son shot his eye out and cut his head off.

The sons brought her to her father and were richly rewarded.  The princess was married to a suitable prince and lived happily.

"'''The Flying Trunk'''" (''Den flyvende Kuffert'') is a [[fairy tale]] by the Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a young man who has a flying trunk that carries him to Turkey where he visits the Sultan's daughter. The tale was first published [[1839 in literature|1839]].

== Plot summary ==
A young man squanders his inheritance until he has nothing left but a few shillings, a pair of slippers, and an old dressing-gown. A friend sends him a trunk with directions to pack up and be off. Having nothing to pack, he gets into the trunk himself. The trunk is enchanted and carries him to the land of the Turks. He uses the trunk to visit the sultan's daughter, who is kept in a tower because of a [[Self-fulfilling prophency|prophecy]] that her marriage would be unhappy.

He persuades her to marry him. When her father and mother visit her tower, he tells them a story. They are impressed and consent to the marriage. To celebrate his upcoming marriage, the young man buys fireworks and flies over the land setting them off. Returning to the earth, a spark incinerates the trunk, and the young man can no longer visit the princess in the tower. Instead, he wanders the world, telling stories.

==Analysis==

The trunk suggests the flying carpets of "[[The Arabian Nights]]", a collection of tales Andersen read and loved as a child.

== Publication ==

The tale was first published in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]] by C.A. Reitzel 19 October 1839 as part of ''Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. Second Booklet. 1839.'' (''Eventyr, fortalte for Børn. Ny Samling. Andet Hefte. 1839.''). "The Flying Trunk" was the second tale in the booklet with "The Garden of Paradise" (''Paradisets Have'') being the first, and "The Storks" (''Storkene'') being the third and last. "The Flying Trunk" was republished 18 December 1849 as a part of ''Fairy Tales. 1850.'' (''Eventyr. 1850.''), and again 15 December 1862 as a part of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. First Volume. 1862.'' (''Eventyr og Historier. Første Bind. 1862.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=24 Hans Christian Andersen Center: Hans Christian Andersen: The Flying Trunk]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptations ==

*[[Andrew Lang]] included the tale in ''[[The Pink Fairy Book]]''.
*[[Lotte Reiniger]] made an animated silhouette film based on the tale in [[1921 in film|1921]].
*In 1993, Copenhagen's [[Tivoli Gardens]] created an amusement ride based on "The Flying Trunk". The ride depicts 32 scenes from the fairy tales of Andersen.
*In 2014, a musical theatre adaptation of "The Flying Trunk" by Bobby Sample (book, lyrics, and music), with music by Josh Hontz, Katie Sample, and Connor Sample, debuted at Spotlight Youth Theatre of [[Glendale, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spotlightyouththeatre.org/events/the-flying-trunk Spotlight Youth Theatre: The Flying Trunk]&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation won the 2014 National Youth Arts Award for Outstanding New Musical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalyouththeatre.com/news/news_nya_awards2014.asp#peoria National Youth Arts Awards 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Magic Monastery''''' is a collection of [[teaching stories]] from the [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Mysticism|mystical]] tradition, by the writer [[Idries Shah]], together with some stories by the author himself.

The work was first published by the [[Octagon Press]] in 1972. ISF Publishing, sponsored by [[The Idries Shah Foundation]], published a paperback edition on 2017, followed by the [[e-book]] version which can be read online at the ISF official website. 

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had performed while alive. As such, ''The Magic Monastery'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Summary==
''The Magic Monastery'' with the subtitle ''Analogical and Action Philosophy of the Middle East and Central Asia'', contains traditional [[teaching story|teaching stories]] as well as pieces composed by [[Idries Shah]]. The author writes in the preface: "It consists of a representative cross-section of Sufi teaching which constitutes a harmonized whole rather than a selection of typical extracts."

==Reception==
In the August 1972 edition of ''[[Encounter (magazine)| Encounter]]'' magazine, [[Doris Lessing]] described the work as "a particularly and intriguingly informative" "textbook for students".

The book was featured in ''[[The Observer]] Review'''s Book of the Year on 17 December 1972, where it was described as "remarkable for its precise response to the real and inner needs of the time."

In October 1972, writing in the journal ''[[Asian Affairs]]'', historian [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams]] described ''The Magic Monastery'' as "accurately expressing Sufi thought and practice in vivid terms easily comprehensible to readers" and wrote that it illustrates "the manner in which Sufi practice, with its devastating criticism of purely academic learning and its continuing Socratic search for truth at any cost, exercises a powerful appeal to many thoughtful people in the West."&lt;ref name="AsianAffairs"&gt;{{cite journal

On June 5, 1972, the ''[[Worcester News|Worcester Evening News]]'' wrote that book contained "an enormous amount of commonsense" and that the reader "will become amused, educated, immersed."

A reviewer wrote in the ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]'' on 22 June 1972 that the book "offers much in the way of contemplation and hope, a respite from the ills of modern society."

In the London ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|Evening News]]'' on 5 April 5 1972, the reviewer wrote that the book "...prob[ed] gently into deeper levels of the mind and echo[ed] with what might be conscience."

In the ''Kingston Borough News'', on 19 January 1973, the reviewer was of the opinion that "You won't be quite the same person when you have read this book." and rated the work as "Highly recommended."

Writer, novelist and philosopher, [[Colin Wilson]] in his review of ''The Magic Monastery'' noted that Shah "is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine. He is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted... The [[Sufism|Sufis]] transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the Zen masters, and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces."&lt;ref name="BooksAndBookmen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Colin|author-link=Colin Wilson|title=Worlds of Magic|journal=Books &amp; Bookmen|publisher=[[Hansom Books]]|volume=17|issue=201|date=June 1972|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted psychiatrist Arthur Deikman, in his book ''The Observing Self'' , also mentions tales found in ''The Magic Monastery'' as examples of stories that can indirectly communicate important teachings, for instance, by illustrating the difficulty in describing mystical perception to those who've never experienced it.&lt;ref name=&gt;''The Observing Self'' {{cite book

'''''La Société du Spectacle''''' ('''''Society of the Spectacle''''') is a black and white 1973 film by the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[Guy Debord]] based on his 1967 [[Society of the Spectacle|book of the same name]]. It was Debord's first feature-length film. It uses [[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]] and [[détournement]] in a radical [[Marxist]] [[critique]] of [[mass marketing]] and its role in the [[Social alienation|alienation of modern society]].

==Film content==
The 88 minute film took a year to make and incorporates an apparent jumble of footage from feature films juxtaposed with still photographs, industrial films, early 1970s glossy 'lifestyle' TV ads, and news footage of unrest in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6113599464218751854 The pussies of Guy Debord]'', selected excerpts from the film&lt;/ref&gt; The feature films include ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'', ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[The Shanghai Gesture]]'', ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'', ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', and ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'', as well as other Soviet films.

Throughout the film, there are intertitles consisting of quotations from ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', along with Debord (in voice-over) reading texts from [[Marx]], [[Machiavelli]], the 1968 [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Émile Pouget]], and [[Sergey Solovyov]] and others. Without citations, these quotes are hard to decipher, especially with the conflicting subtitles (which exist even in the French version): but that is part of Debord's goal to "problematize reception" (Greil and Sanborn) and force the viewer to be active. In addition, the words of some of the authors are [[détournement|détourned]] through deliberate misquoting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/SOTS-detournements.html Guide to the détournements in ''The Society of the Spectacle'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of historical events is included, such as the murder of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] (the assassin of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963), the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]] and the [[May 1968 in France|Paris riots]] in May 1968, along with clips of people such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the Spanish anarchist [[Durruti]].

In 1984, Debord withdrew his films from circulation because of the negative press and the assassination of his friend and patron [[Gerard Lebovici]]. Since Debord's suicide in 1994, Debord's wife [[Alice Becker-Ho]] has been promoting Debord's film. A DVD box set titled ''Guy Debord: Oeuvres cinématographiques complètes'' was released in 2005 and contains Debord's seven films.

==Music==
The piece used in the film is [http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/9/9e/IMSLP74228-PMLP148883-Corrette_Délices.pdf#page=22 ''Les Delices de la Solitude'', Op. 20 No. 6] - Sonata in D Major : I. ''Allegro Moderato'', by [[Michel Corrette]].

'''The Spoils of War (symposium)'''
[[File:Looted_Art_-_German_loot_stored_at_Schlosskirche_Ellingen_-_Ellingen_(Bavaria_-_Germany).jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|German repository of looted possessions in a church at Ellingen, Bavaria, May 1945.]]
"The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property" was a ground-breaking international [[symposium]] held in New York City in 1995 to discuss the artworks, cultural property, and historic sites damaged, lost, and [[Nazi plunder|plundered as a result of World War II]]. The three-day event was sponsored by the [[Bard Graduate Center]] for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;January 19–21, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organized by [[Elizabeth Simpson (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Simpson]], an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.

Worldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.

==New York conference and proceedings==
[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|Generals Bradley, Patton, and Eisenhower examining works of art stored by the Nazis in the Merkers mine, Germany, April 1945.]]The program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aamd.org/standards-and-practices |title=Standards &amp; Practices &amp;#124; Association of Art Museum Directors |website=Aamd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/home |title=Welcome to |publisher=Lootedart.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Spoils of War cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spoils of War'' (1997), showing paintings stolen from the Russian palaces at Petrodvorets and Pushkin, abandoned in March 1945 in East Prussia by German soldiers fleeing the Red Army.]]

The conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth. ''The Spoils of War--World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property''. New York: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]] in association with the Bard Graduate Center, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the "[[Lieber Code]]" of 1863 and the "[[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]]," and continue with the treaties following World War I, the "[[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954]]" for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]]" on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13039&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects]] of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention |title=Cultural Property - 1995 Convention - Unidroit - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law - Institut International pour l'Unification du droit privè |publisher=Unidroit |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses resulting from World War II==
Elizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of ''The Return of Cultural Treasures'',&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette. ''The Return of Cultural Treasures.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; provided introductory comments on the subject, along with [[Lynn H. Nicholas|Lynn Nicholas]], author of ''The Rape of Europa'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn. ''The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War''. New York: Vintage Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|The Jewish Museum]], New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).

==The "Monuments Men"==
[[File:Capt Edith Standen at Central Collecting Point Wiesbaden 1946.jpg|thumb|Captain Edith Standen at the Wiesbaden Collecting Point, 1946.]]A group of the so-called [[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art|"Monuments Men"]] (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monumentsmen.com |title=Official Site |publisher=The Monuments Men |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], recounted the discovery of [[looted art]] and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points. Of the veteran officers speaking the New York conference—James S. Plaut (d. 1996), [[Walter Farmer|Walter I. Farmer]] (d. 1997), [[Edith Standen|Edith A. Standen]] (d. 1998), [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] (d. 2006), [[S. Lane Faison]] (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper (d. 2016)—none survives today.

==Reappearance and recovery==
Other repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the [[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Church Treasures]], the Soviet Secret Repositories,&lt;ref&gt;Akinsha, Konstantin, Grigorii Kozlov, and Sylvia Hochfield. ''Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe's Art Treasures'', New York: Random House, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Treasure of Priam," which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, Vladimir, and Mikhail Treister. ''The Gold of Troy: Searching for Homer’s Fabled City''. Moscow and New York: Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in association with Harry N. Abrams, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.[[File:Sophia Schliemann wearing Treasure A, Troy.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Heinrich Schliemann's wife, Sophia, wearing gold jewelry from Treasure A, Troy, ca. 1873.]]

==Current issues and cooperative efforts==
The conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of [[UNESCO]], offered a list of "Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War":

# Cultural objects that have been taken from territory occupied during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War by any belligerent will be returned to the country from which they have been taken.
#Where there have been successive displacements, the objects will be returned to the territory where they were located at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.
#Principle 1 will apply whether  transfers of the cultural objects concerned have taken the form of open looting or plunder, or of transactions apparently legal in form, even when they purport to have been voluntarily effected.
#Cultural property taken from an occupied territory shall never be detained as war reparations.
#Where cultural objects displaced during or immediately after hostilities in the Second World War have passed into the hands of third parties, the state that is responsible for their removal from the country where they were located in 1939 shall reacquire them for return to the state from which they were taken, by repurchase, indemnity or other appropriate means.
#No time limits can be set.
#Cultural objects being repatriated are to be accompanied by the relevant scientific documentation where available.
#Restitution by replacement is an available remedy where unique cultural objects have been destroyed.

==Press coverage and controversy==
The "Spoils of War" symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the [[Associated Press]] and in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''New York [[Newsday]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', and ''[[Pravda]]''. The [[The Forward|''Jewish Forward'']] published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.

[[File:Amber Room Catherine Palace Tsarskoye Selo pre-war photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The original [[Amber Room]] in the [[Catherine Palace]], Pushkin (Tsarskoye Selo), Russia, in an early 20th century photograph before it was lost as a result of the Second World War.]]This issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the "Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of "[[Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/122038.htm |title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art |publisher=State.gov |date=1998-12-03 |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by organizer [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]], as well as "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/decl.htm |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Yeni Yüzyıl]]'', [[Russian News Agency TASS|''ITAR-TASS'']], and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12071">'''Tingatinga''' (also spelt '''Tinga-tinga''' or '''Tinga Tinga''') is a painting style that developed in the second half of the 20th century in the [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]] area in [[Dar es Salaam]] ([[Tanzania]]) and later spread to most East Africa. Tingatinga is one of the most widely represented forms of tourist-oriented paintings in Tanzania, [[Kenya]] and neighboring countries. The genre is named after its founder, Tanzanian painter [[Edward Said Tingatinga]].
[[File:Tingatinga school paintings.JPG|thumb|The Tingatinga school of painting sold their work in Oyster Bay, Dar es Salaam. Picture from 1973]]

Tingatinga is traditionally made on [[masonite]], using several layers of bicycle paint, which makes for a brilliant and highly saturated colors. Many elements of the style are related to requirements of the tourist-oriented market; for example, the paintings are usually small so they can be easily transported, and subjects are intended to appeal to the Europeans and Americans (e.g., the [[Big Five Game|big five]] and other wild fauna). In this sense, Tingatinga paintings can be considered a form of "[[airport painting]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-112811/exploring-tingatinga-art-movement-tanzania Exploring the Tingatinga Art Movement in Tanzania]&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings themselves can be described as both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[caricature|caricatural]], and [[humor]] and [[sarcasm]] are often explicit.

==History==
Edward Tingatinga began painting around 1968 in [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Tanzania]] (Dar es Salaam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_art.html |title=Tinga Tinga art |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed low cost materials such as [[masonite]] and [[bicycle paint]] and attracted the attention of tourists for their colorful, both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[surrealism|surrealistic]] style. When Tingatinga died in 1972, his style was so popular that it had started a wide movement of imitators and followers, sometimes informally referred to as the "Tingatinga school".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm The tingatinga school of painting]. This is an informal term (i.e., those who paint after Tingatinga's example) and not to be confused with the Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society, which is a specific organization, although sometimes also referred to as a "school".  {{cite web |url=http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917035235/http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of artists from the Tingatinga school basically reproduced the works of the school's founder. In the 1990s new trends emerged within the Tingatinga style, in response to the transformations that the Tanzanian society was undergoing after independence. New subjects related to the new urban and multi-ethnic society of Dar es Salaam (e.g., crowded and busy streets and squares) were introduced, together with occasional technical novelties (such as the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]). One of the most well known second-generation Tingatinga painters is Edward Tingatinga's brother-in-law, [[Simon Mpata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm Tingatinga first students]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507131843/http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm |date=7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his short artistic life, Tingatinga left only a relatively small number of paintings, which are sought-after by collectors. Today it is known that fakes were produced from all famous Tingatinga paintings like ''The lion'', ''Peacock on the Baobab Tree'', ''Antelope'', ''Leopard'', ''Buffalo'', or ''Monkey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |title=Are Tingatinga fakes a problem today? |publisher=Alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314042953/http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com/ |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:wall painting ngapa1.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], the village of E.S.Tingatinga's father]]
[[File:wall painting ngapa3.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in Ngapa depict animals in a [[naive art|naïve style]] that might resemble Tingatinga art]]

It is controversial whether Tingatinga's style is completely original or a derivative of traditional forms of East Africa. In his seminal paper ''Tingatinga and His Followers'', [[Sweden|Swedish]] critic Berit Sahlström claimed that Tingatinga was of [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] origin and thus suggested that his style might have connections with modern Mozambique. The claim that Tingatinga was of Mozambican descent is nevertheless rejected by most scholars and by the Tingatinga Society. Art trader Yves Goscinny suggested that Edward Tingatinga might have been influenced by [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] paintings that were sold in [[Dar es Salaam]] at his times.&lt;ref&gt;"Art in Tanzania 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this claim could be some articles by Merit Teisen, where she also claims that Tingatinga decorated two house walls for payment before he started painting on masonite boards.

The claim by Teisen about Tingatinga decorating house walls might also be interpreted as a clue of another origin of Tingatinga's paintings, namely the traditional [[hut (dwelling)|hut]] wall decorations of [[Makua people|Makua]] and [[Makonde people]]. These paintings were first witnessed by [[Karl Heule]] in 1906 and described in his book ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Weule (1908), ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika'', Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Jesper Kirknaes]] and Japanese painting curator [[Kenji Shiraishi]], as well as modern travellers, have seen and documented these paintings in several locations of southern Tanzania, including [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], a village where many relatives of Tingatinga's father still live today.

Jesper Kirknaes also documented those painting being done in Dar es Salaam by Makua and Makonde migrants. Shiraishi is one of the scholars who most firmly supported the theory that Tingatinga's art is connected to traditional Makua wall paintings. Among other considerations, Shiraishi observed that it is unlikely that a style emerged and spread so quickly over most East Africa without any connection to traditional art. He claimed that his studies provided evidence for this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shiraishi, ''Commentary to Tingatinga II''; article: ''Tinga TingaContemporary African Art and Mural''; ''Tingatinga: Afurikan poppu-ato no sekai'' / Kenji Shiraishi and Fumiko Yamamoto. Tokyo: Kodansha, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Hanne Thorup interviewed Tingatinga student Omari Amonde, who confirmed that Tingatinga used to paint on hut walls as a young boy (around 12 years old).&lt;ref&gt;Hanne Thorup and Chitra Sundaram (2010), ''Tingatinga, Kitsch or Art'', p. 22; article: ''Off the walls to Hard Board and Canvas; What inspired Tingatinga?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Further elaborating on the Makua painting hypothesis, Shiraishi also suggested a connection between hut walls painting and traditional [[rock art|rock paintings]], an art form that in Africa has continued past [[stone age]] to at least the 19th century. Based on this connection, Shiraishi concludes that Tingatinga art might be seen as the "longest artist trend ever".&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shirashi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos'', Africa Hoy, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tingatinga Cooperative Society==
After Tingatinga's death, his direct 6 followers Ajaba Abdallah Mtalia, Adeusi Mandu, January Linda, Casper Tedo, [[Simon Mpata]], and Omari Amonde &lt;ref&gt;Mwasanga, National Arts Council, Mture Publishers, Tingatinga, p 30&lt;/ref&gt; tried to organize themselves. Relatives of Tingatinga also joined this group, which would be later called the "Tingatinga (or Tinga Tinga) Partnership". Not all of Tingatinga followers agreed to be in the partnership; some created a new group at Slipway.&lt;ref&gt;Abdellahamani Hasani&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the Tingatinga Partnership constituted itself into a society, renamed to '''Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society''' (TACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_cooperative.html |title=Tingatinga Co-operative Society |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the TACS is usually recognized as the most authoritative representative of the Tingatinga heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SomaliPress.com |url=http://www.somalipress.com/guides/culture/tanzania-tingatinga-arts-achievement.html |title=Tingatinga Arts Achievement |publisher=Somalipress.com |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a small fraction of Tingatinga artists are directly linked to this society.

The Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society launched their own website on May 2018: [Http://Www.tingatingaArt.com www.tingatingaArt.com]

==Tingatinga and George Lilanga==

Although the internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artist [[George Lilanga]] was not a student of the Tingatinga school, nor a member of the Tingatinga Society, he's known to have frequented Tingatinga artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lilanga| first = George| title = Colors of Africa| year = 2007| isbn = 978-88-89298-32-9| page = 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some influence of Tingatinga is evident in his work, for what concerns painting (an art form that Lilanga approached in 1974).&lt;ref&gt;''George Lilanga'', Kamphausen&lt;/ref&gt; This influence has been recognized by Lilanga himself in an interview with Kenji Shiraishi, specifically in reference to the use of [[enamel paint]] and square [[hardboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See K. Shiraishi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos, Africa Hoy'', p. 7. The book reports Lilanga's words as follow: ''It was entirely my own idea to incorporate this style. Nobody suggest I do it. In the Tingatinga style, I use enamel paint on hardboard. This board is excellent for achieving vivid color."&lt;/ref&gt; Besides using materials and techniques originally adopted by Tingatinga painters, Lilanga's art resembles Tingatinga also in its use of vibrant colors&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Masceloni, ''Catalogue Raisonne, George Lilanga'', p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] style, that shares the same [[horror vacui]] of Tingatinga art. It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Thorup| first1 = Tine| last2 = Sam| first2 = Cuong| title = Tingatinga Kitch Or Quality Bicycle Enamel on Board &amp; Canvas| year = 2011| isbn = 978-87-992635-2-3| page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Lilanga (who was originally a sculptor) actually learned to paint from Tingatinga painters such as [[Noel Kapanda]] and later [[Mchimbi Halfani]], who collaborated with him.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [http://www.lilanga.org Lilanga.org] and [http://www.makonde-carvings.info Makonde Carvings] websites&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration between Lilanga and Kapanda lasted several years.&lt;ref&gt;K. Shiraishi, ''Tingatinga and Lilanga'', The Museum of Art, Kochi, Japan 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts''', based in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]], was a performing arts center supported through the Shakur Family Foundation. The Shakur Center's mission was to provide opportunities for young people through the arts, and offers programs such as drama, dance, and creative writing classes. The organization also ran a Performing Arts Day Camp for youth ages twelve to eighteen.  

The center, located off of [[Memorial Drive (Atlanta)|Memorial Drive]] was named in honor of the late American [[Hip Hop]] artist [[Tupac Amaru Shakur]], and was founded by his mother [[Afeni Shakur]].&lt;ref name=RS_2016&gt;Lee, Christina.

Rolling Stone. 6 July 2016. Retrieved 22 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The center was founded in 1997 by Tupac Shakur's mother [[Afeni Shakur]] in the interest of preserving her son's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasf.org/about.asp|title=Tasf.org|publisher=Tasf.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to bring quality arts training to young people including some students that face many social-economic issues such as poverty.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwIexeXLKecC&amp;pg=PT152&amp;dq=tupac+amaru+shakur+foundation&amp;lr=&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20amaru%20shakur%20foundation&amp;f=false|title=Tupac Remembered|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students have enriched their artistic abilities through this center and some have even received part-time jobs.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; 

In July 1999 the foundation began its first annual summer session of PA camps with twenty campers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bu6atp8MeBcC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=tupac+amaru+shakur+foundation&amp;lr=&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20amaru%20shakur%20foundation&amp;f=false|title=How Long Will They Mourn Me?|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp continued to grow throughout the years. On June 11, 2005 The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts Peace Garden and visitor centre was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasf.org/news_article.asp?id=67|title=Tasf.org|publisher=Tasf.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peace garden was designed as a tribute to Tupac Shakur as well as others who have died. In 2006 the music video for the single [[Pac's Life]] for the self-titled album was shot at the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIlUNd7suew|title=2Pac - Pac's Life ft. T.I., Ashanti|work=YouTube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tupac's mother [[Afeni Shakur]] also went to Africa in 2006 and fostered a relationship between The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts and The Nelson Mendela foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=tupac+amaru+shakur+foundation&amp;lr=&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20amaru%20shakur%20foundation&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2006 the foundation showed signs of growth as many additional programs were created such as after school programs, dance classes and cultural exchange programs. Fees for these program resemble prices similar to those of joining a local sports league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasf.org/|title=Tasf.org|publisher=Tasf.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has also held Tupac birthday concert celebrations since 2009.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Programs==
The foundation offered acting, after school and dancing classes. In addition, they offer yearly leadership and arts programs. They had also set up cross cultural exchanges with Japan and South Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3648">A '''vanity gallery''' is an [[Contemporary art gallery|art gallery]] that charges artists fees to exhibit their work and makes most of its money from artists rather than from sales to the public.  Some vanity galleries charge a lump sum to arrange an exhibition, while others ask artists to pay regular membership fees and then promise to organise an exhibition with a certain period.&lt;ref name="Gulrich"&gt;{{cite book|

==Derivation==
Vanity galleries are an offshoot of [[Artist-run initiative|cooperative galleries]] (also called artist-run initiatives), galleries which are operated by artists who pool their resources to pay for exhibits and publicity.  Unlike cooperative galleries, which carefully jury their members, vanity galleries will exhibit anyone who pays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally a vanity gallery will appear to have a selection process.  This is because "if every participant is promised a one- or two-person show every two years, the number of artists on the membership roster cannot exceed the available time slots for shows."&lt;ref&gt;Debora Melz (1995), "Vanities: Caveat Exhibitor" in ''Getting Exposure: The Artist's Guide to Exhibiting the Work''.  Art Calendar Publishing, Inc., p. 182. {{ISBN|0-945388-04-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial art galleries derive their profit from sales of artwork and therefore take great care to select art and artists that they believe will sell and will enhance their gallery's reputation.  They spend time and money cultivating collectors.  If the artwork sells, the gallery makes a profit, and the artist is then paid.

Vanity galleries have no incentive to sell art, as they have already been paid by the artist.  Vanity galleries are not selective because they do not have to be.  Many professional artists recommend that new artists avoid exhibiting work in them, primarily because professional critics and reviewers tend to avoid them.&lt;ref name="Gulrich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/08/10/191830.php Vanity Galleries]'' by Lenny Campello, 10 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54033">This '''list of the works of [[William Crooke]]''' (1848–1923) represents much of his literary output in pursuit of his interests in [[ethnology]] and [[folklore]], for which he was far many years considered to be a leading authority.

In addition to the items listed below in respect of ''Folk-lore Record'' and its successor, ''Folk-lore'', the journal of the [[Folklore Society]], Crooke also contributed frequently to that journal in the form of letters and brief observations. He was editor of the journal from 1915 until his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;

In addition to these works, Crooke made many contributions to the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics''.

He had been editing the ''Katha Sagara Kosa'', as translated by [[Charles Henry Tawney]], at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;

Women have been active participants in the development of [[radio]] (initially called "[[wireless]]") communications since its beginning. The age of [[radio communication]] began with the development of [[wireless telegraphy]] around 1900, in which [[Morse code]] could be transmitted over large distances using simple [[spark gap]] or [[carbon arc]] transmitting equipment, and various types of detectors for reception. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] achieved international fame in 1901 when he succeeded in sending a simple message in Morse code - the letter "s" - across the Atlantic from [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

==Women as wireless operators==
Women had worked as [[telegraph]] operators since the late 1840s, and it was not long before women telegraphers began to work as wireless operators as well. In early 1901, the announcement of the inauguration of a Hawaiian inter-island communications system noted that four of the fourteen operators were women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047165/1901-02-02/ed-1/seq-1/ "Marconi's System Finally a Success"], ''Honolulu Republican'', February 2, 1901, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Anna Nevins, who had worked as a telegrapher for [[Western Union]], began work as a wireless operator for [[Lee de Forest]]'s station "NY", located at 42 Broadway in [[New York City]].  She was later employed as a wireless operator at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, Louise R., "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications." ''The A.W.A. Review,'' Volume 4, 1989, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early female shipboard operators==
One of the earliest applications of wireless telegraphy was enabling communication between ships at sea and land stations.  While early ships' operators were mostly male, some women entered the field as well.  The primary requirement was a knowledge of Morse code and equipment operation, which many female telegraph operators possessed. Perhaps the earliest woman to operate on shipboard was Medora Olive Newell, an experienced telegrapher who was a passenger on the [[Cunard]] liner Slavonia in 1904, when Hungarian members of the [[Hague]] Peace Commission wished to send a birthday greeting to [[Emperor Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]].
Medora Olive Newell (1872 - December 31, 1946) began work as a telegraph operator in Durango, [[Iowa]], in 1886 at the age of fourteen.  In 1897, she moved to [[Chicago]] and became a commercial operator for the Postal Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Medora O. Newell, ''Long Beach Independent'', Long Beach, CA, January 1, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Medora Olive Newell.jpg|thumb|right|Medora Olive Newell, Early Wireless Telegrapher. Source: ''Chicago Daily Tribune, '', February 13, 1907.]]
Newell’s first-class operator pay enabled her to live a fairly affluent lifestyle; as ''Telegraph Age'' reported in 1909, “Miss Newell has been in the habit of spending her vacations abroad, and has always made these trips the occasion for investigating telegraph and railway management and operation in European countries.”&lt;ref&gt;''Telegraph Age'', June 1, 1909, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; On her return voyage from Europe in 1904, she found herself aboard the Cunard liner Slavonia together with  members of the Hague Peace Commission, who were on their way to the United States to persuade President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to call another international conference to continue the work begun at the Hague in 1899.  The Hungarian members of the delegation wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary by wireless, but the ship’s wireless operator was unable to send the message.  Newell, who, according to ''Telegraph Age'', “had a good working knowledge of wireless,” took her place at the key and soon had successfully transmitted the greeting.  The grateful delegates thanked her for her assistance, and the secretary of the Hungarian parliament invited her to visit Hungary as the guest of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jepsen, ''My Sisters Telegraphic'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910]] required US ships to be equipped with wireless equipment for the first time, and to have an operator on board who was capable of sending and receiving messages. The first woman to be officially employed as a shipboard wireless operator was Graynella Packer, a telegrapher from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], who was employed as a wireless operator for the [[United Wireless Telegraph Company]] aboard the steamship Mohawk from November 1910 to April 1911.&lt;ref name="feminine"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=The Feminine Wireless Amateur | work= The Electrical Experimenter| date=October 1916 | pages= 396–7, 452 | url=https://archive.org/details/electricalexperi04gern/page/396/mode/1up | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packer started practicing telegraphy in order to send messages in code to her school friends as a young girl.  She eventually took on telegraphy as a career because her eyes were not strong and 'handling a key is no strain on the sight'.&lt;ref&gt;(January 3, 1911).

Publisher: St. Petersburg (Florida) Evening Independent&lt;/ref&gt;  She became manager of the Postal Telegraph office in Sanford, Florida, before hiring onto the Mohawk as the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity.  After operating in full charge of the wireless, she eventually moved on to become an elected member of the Oklahoma State Bar Association from Oklahoma City in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;(1992)[https://books.google.com/books?id=wdg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=graynella+packer&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=graynella%20packer&amp;f=false Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Oklahoma State Bar].

The [[Radio Act of 1912]] required radio operators in the U.S. to be licensed for the first time.  The first woman to be licensed as a shipboard operator was Mabelle Kelso, who passed the operator's examination and received her operating license in January 1912.&lt;ref name="operators"&gt;{{cite web | title= YL Amateur Radio Operators: 'Their Struggles and Achievements' | author= Elizabeth (VE7TLK/VA7TK)|work=qsl.net|date=2008| url= http://www.qsl.net/ylradio/archives/YLstor/images/YLSlideShow7.pdf | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabelle Kelso was a native of [[Seattle, Washington]], and had been previously employed as a stenographer.  After passing a [[U.S. Navy Department]] examination, she was hired by the United Wireless Telegraph Company and assigned a position as an operator on board the SS Mariposa, a steamship which travelled between Seattle and Alaska. Her appointment as shipboard operator generated some opposition from members of Congress who wished to bar women from holding such positions on seagoing ships; however, she received support from the Pacific Coast Wireless Inspector of United Wireless, who stated that "he knew of no law which would bar Miss Kelso from her position."&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Kelso of Seattle, Only Woman to Hold License as Wireless Operator," ''Atlanta Constitution'', July 7, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"May Flash Law On Wireless Girl," ''Oakland Tribune'', Oakland, California, July 25, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, over 30 women had been licensed as shipboard operators.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women as radio amateurs==
[[Amateur radio]] became a popular hobby in the early years of the twentieth century, and many hobbyists built their own transmitting and receiving equipment. Some of the earliest women radio amateurs, called "YLs," were Mrs. M.J. Glass of [[San Jose, California]], who operated as station FNFN in 1910, and Olive Heartburg, who operated as station OHK in [[New York City]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; M.S. Colville, of Bowmanville, [[Ontario]], who began to operate as XDD in 1914, was one of the earliest Canadian YLs.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;

The [[Radio Act of 1912]] also required radio amateurs to be licensed. [[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]] (September 27, 1901 - August 3, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= California Death Index, 1940 - 1997 |  work= Ancestry.com | url= http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi | accessdate= 2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest women to obtain a government issued license. In 1916, while a fifteen-year-old high school student at the Dominican College in [[San Rafael, California]], she obtained a first class commercial radio operators' license with the call sign 6SO.
[[File:gladys kathleen parkin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]], 1916. Source: ''The [[Electrical Experimenter]]'', October 1916.]]

Parkin was quoted in an article titled "The Feminine Wireless Amateur," which appeared in the October 1916 issue of ''The Electrical Experimenter'':

"With reference to my ideas about the wireless profession as a vocation or worthwhile hobby for women, I think wireless telegraphy is a most fascinating study, and one which could very easily be taken up by girls, as it is a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed. I am only fifteen, and I learned the code several years ago, by practising a few minutes each day on a buzzer. I studied a good deal and I found it quite easy to obtain my first grade commercial government license, last April. It seems to me that every one should at least know the code, as cases might easily arise of a ship in distress, where the operators might be incapacitated, and a knowledge of the code might be the means of saving the ship and the lives of the passengers. But the interest in wireless does not end in the knowledge of the code. You can gradually learn to make all your own instruments, as I have done with my 1/4 kilowatt set. There is always more ahead of you, as wireless telegraphy is still in its infancy."&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt; Use of the term "YL" to refer to female radio amateurs was formally adopted by the [[American Radio Relay League]] in 1920.

==World War I and women as radio operators==
[[File:ww1 wireless women.jpg|thumb|right|Naval reservists training as wireless operators, 1916. Source: ''The Electrical Experimenter'', October 1916.]]
As the U.S. prepared to enter [[World War I]], the Navy Department began a program to train women as radio operators who could be called into action in the event of war.  The Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve established training camps at the Martha Washington Post, in Edgewater, New Jersey, and the Betsy Ross Post, at Bay Ridge, [[Brooklyn]], where young women were trained to become wireless operators.&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt;

In January 1917, the [[National League for Women's Service]] (NLWS) was created from the Woman’s Department of the National Civic Federation readiness and relief activities and modelled on similar groups in Britain and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Shanna|title=National League for Woman’s Service: Minute Women of Washington|url=http://www.washingtonhistory.org/research/whc/milestones/aftersuffrage/minutewomen/nlws/|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National League of Women's Services|url=http://brooklynology.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/post/2010/07/29/National-League-of-Womens-Services.aspx|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The League was divided into thirteen national divisions, one of which was "Wireless and Telegraphy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Ida Clyde|author-link=Ida Clyde Clarke|title=American Women and the World War|date=1918|publisher=D.

==Women as broadcast radio engineers==
[[File:Violet McKenzie with wireless.png|thumb|right|[[Florence Violet McKenzie]] working with the wireless radio c1922]]
By 1920, the technology had evolved to the point where voice and music could be transmitted as well as Morse telegraphy, and several radio stations began to broadcast regular programs of music and news. In 1920, Eunice Randall (1898-1982), an employee of The American Radio and Research Company, or AMRAD, became an engineer and announcer for the AMRAD radio station, 1XE.  Her interest in radio had begun at the age of nineteen, when she built her own amateur radio equipment and operated with the call sign 1CDP. In addition to her technical duties at 1XE, which included repairing equipment and occasionally climbing the transmitting tower, she read stories for children as "The Story Lady," and gave the police report over the air.

In 1922, the AMRAD station changed its call sign to WGI. Eunice Randall remained as engineer and assistant chief announcer until 1925, when the company went bankrupt and the station was taken off the air.  However, she continued to work as an engineer and draftsman, and resumed her amateur radio activities under the call sign of W1MPP.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Remembering the Ladies-- A Salute to the Women of Early Radio | author= Donna L.

'''Wooden tomb models''' were an [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|Egyptian funerary custom]] throughout the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] in which wooden figurines and sets were constructed to be [[Grave goods|placed in the tombs]] of Egyptian royalty. These wooden models represented the work of servants, farmers, other skilled craftsman, armies, and religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Bard, Steven Blake Shubert, Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, pp.266f, Routledge, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The different types of models served as symbols and were believed to perform various functions for the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Bard &amp; Shubert 1999, pp.266f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
During the [[Naqada III|Protodynastic]] and [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic]] period (3200–2686 BC) the funerary [[Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices|sacrifice of servants]] was practiced to provide for the deceased royal retainers to accompany him into the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Shaw &amp; Paul Nicholson, The British Museum Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.134, 1995, British Museum Press&lt;/ref&gt; At Abydos and Saqqara (3100–2890 BC), the tombs of 1st-Dynasty rulers suggest this practice with shared-roof subsidiary burials surrounding the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw &amp; Nicholson 1995, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of [[human sacrifice]] was later superseded by the wooden model representations of servants instead.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw &amp; Nicholson 1995, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian royalty likely felt a pressing need for servants in the afterlife, having been waited on hand and foot by them during their entire lifetime. This seems to have led to the diverse variety of models found in tombs to perform various functions.&lt;ref&gt;"Ancient Egypt: Funerary Objects", Kibbutz Reshafim, n.p., [cited 9 Dec. 2014]. Online: http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/funerary_practices/funerary_objects.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Originally royal tombs were provided only one model servant, but as time went on the number of wooden models increased, some containing 365, one for every day of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw &amp; Nicholson 1995, p.266&lt;/ref&gt; Additional scenery, animals, and objects also began to be provided.&lt;ref&gt;Kibbutz Reshafim, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; As the practice of wooden models moved into the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], numbers continued to increase. More than 700 figurines are said to have populated the tomb of [[Seti I|Sety I]] (1294–1279 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw &amp; Nicholson 1995, p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variety of models==
[[Image:FuneraryPaddlingBoatW-TombOfMeketre MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|255px|Model of a paddling funerary boat from the tomb of Meketre.]]
As the practice of funerary models increased in popularity, especially during the Middle Kingdom, so did the variety of the models and their functions. In addition to models of servants, models of bakeries, farms, granaries, factories, military, and religious worship complete with workers, tools, weapons, and animals were made. Each model had a different purpose in the belief of the Egyptians and was provided to perform its specific function. Model houses were included to ensure existence in the afterlife. Farmers, artisans, and craftsmen models were said to increase the material wealth of the individual. If the tombs resident needed to perform a specific task in the afterlife, a wooden model would be included to perform that task for him. Funerary boat models reflected the mythological beliefs of the Egyptians, that they would help to further the deceased's progression in the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Kibbutz Reshafim, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known wooden models come from the tomb of the chancellor [[Meketre]], over half of which are funerary boats.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum, "Wooden model of a granary with figures", The British Museum, n.p., [cited 9 Dec. 2014]. Online: https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/w/wooden_model_of_a_granary_with.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Usage==
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:EgytianShabti.jpg|thumbnail|Example of Egyptian Shabtis]] --&gt;
During the New Kingdom and into the Late Period (747–332 BC), the wooden models were developed into what are known as [[Ushabti|Shabti or Ushabti]]. Shabti, similarly, were funerary models provided in the tombs of Egyptian royalty to spare the tomb owner from labor in the next life. Shabtis were inscribed with chapter 6 of The Book of the Dead providing them with instructions that enabled them to perform their labors. "Overseer" models were also provided to ensure the shabti performed their labors. Shabtis were composed of wood, clay, wax, stone, bronze, faience, or glass. The practice died out during the Ptolemaic period (332–30 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw &amp; Nicholson 1995, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6976">The success of [[World Book and Copyright Day]], launched in 1996, encouraged [[UNESCO]] to develop the concept of '''World Book Capital''' City, selecting [[Madrid]] as the Capital for 2001. This was again a success, and so UNESCO's General Conference resolved to make the designation of a World Book Capital City an annual event.

UNESCO invited the [[International Publishers Association]], the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] and the [[International Booksellers Federation]] to participate in the nomination process, to ensure the three major branches of the book industry can participate in the decision.

The nomination does not include any financial prize; it rather acknowledges the best programmes dedicated to books and reading.

==Nomination criteria==
The nominating committee welcomes programmes &amp;mdash; presented by or endorsed by the mayor of the city making the application — that promote and foster reading. The programmes are to run from one World Book and Copyright Day and the next. The nomination committee will turn its attention to certain criteria:
* the degree of participation of all levels (from the municipal to the international level)
* the programme's potential impact
* the scope and quality of the activities proposed by the candidates, and the extent to which they involve writers, publishers, booksellers and libraries
* any other projects promoting books and reading
* the extent to which the programme respects the principles of freedom of expression, as stated by the UNESCO Constitution as well as by Articles 19 and 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and by the [[Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials]]

==Biography== 
Al-Wasiti was probably born in [[Wasit]] واسط  south of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bloom and Sheila S. Blair (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p.210; 
Kember, P. (ed.), ''Benezit Dictionary of Asian Artists,'' Oxford University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|9780199923014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1236-37 he transcribed and illustrated a copy of [[Al-Hariri of Basra|al-Hairi]]'s ''[[Maqama|Maqamat]]'' typically shortened to ''Maqamat,'' and also known as the ''Assemblies,''&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bloom and Sheila S. Blair (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p.294&lt;/ref&gt; a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra]]. Al-Wasiti's illustrations, which are among the finest examples of a style used in the 13th-century, served as an inspiration for the modern Baghdad art movement in the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,'' p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations from ''[[Maqama]]t''==

In total, ''Maqmat'' has 96 illustrations, all by al-Wasiti. They are of "outstanding quality with fine composition, expressive figures, and vivid but controlled colours"  and provide readers with "fascinating series of glimpses into and commentaries on 13th-century Islāmic life." &lt;ref&gt;"Yaḥyā ibn Maḥmūd al-Wāsiṭī," in: ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yahya-ibn-Mahmud-al-Wasiti Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
