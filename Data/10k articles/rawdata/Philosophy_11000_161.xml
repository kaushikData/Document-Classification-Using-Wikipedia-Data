{{italic title}}
'''''A Philosophical View of Reform''''' is a major prose work by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] written in 1819-20 and first published in 1920 by [[Oxford University Press]]. The political essay is Shelley's longest prose work.

==Analysis==

Shelley composed ''A Philosophical View of Reform'' between November, 1819 and 20 May 1820, meant to address political developments in England at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy, Mark. "A Philosophical View of Reform". ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. First published 21 March 2002 [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7042, accessed 20 July 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated non-violence and a moderate response to the repressive measures imposed by the British government. One of the events he addressed was the [[Peterloo Massacre]], which occurred on 16 August 1819, in St. Peter's Field near Manchester, where a peaceful demonstration seeking parliamentary reform was attacked by militia.

The bookseller [[Richard Carlile]] had been found guilty of blasphemy by a jury in November, 1819 for printing an edition of ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1794-6) by [[Thomas Paine]]. The “Six Acts” had been promulgated in December which placed restrictions on public gatherings and freedom of the press.

It was during this unstable political period in England in late 1819 when Shelley started writing ''A Philosophical View of Reform''. Shelley told John and [[Maria Gisborne]] on 6 November: "I have deserted the odorous gardens of literature to journey across the great sandy desert of Politics."

Shelley proposed five reforms:&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, Brian. "Percy Bysshe Shelley's 'A Philosophical View of Reform'": www.shelley.235.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

#abolish the national debt. 
#disband the standing army. 
#abolish sinecures. 
#abolish tithes, and make all religions, all forms of opinion regarding the origin and government of the universe, equal under the law. 
#make justice inexpensive, certain, and speedy, and extend the institution of juries to every possible occasion of jurisprudence.

Shelley opposed revolution, advocating instead gradual change through non-violence. He argued that individual and institutional reform went hand in hand. He maintained that poets, writers, and philosophers would stimulate reforms of the social institutions that would benefit everyone in society.

Shelley informed his publisher [[Charles Ollier]] on 19 December 1819 that he sought ''A Philosophical View of Reform'' "to be an instructive and readable book, appealing from the passions to the reason of men", informing him that he would not finish it "this season".

On 26 May 1820 he asked [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] if he could find a publisher for the work: "Do you know any bookseller who wd publish for me an octavo volume entitled 'A philosophical View of Reform'. It is boldly but temperately written – &amp; I think readable – It is intended for a kind of standard book for the philosophical reformers."

[[Mary Shelley]] had a transcript made of the manuscript with plans to publish the work. The political essay remained unpublished, however, until 1920 when it appeared for the first time in print in an edition published by [[Humphrey Milford]], Oxford University Press, with an introduction and appendix by [[Thomas William Rolleston]].

'''Abu al-Abbas Iranshahri''' ({{lang-fa| حکیم ایرانشهری}}) was a 9th-century [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;Henry Corbin, "The voyage and the messenger: Iran and philosophy", North Atlantic Books, 1998. pg 72.&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher, [[mathematician]], natural scientist, historian of religion, [[astronomer]] and author.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Daryoush Kargar and EIr, "IRĀNŠAHRI" in Encyclopaedia Iranica.  Accessed via online in Nov, 2010 at: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iransahri-abul-abbas-mohammad-b-mohammad]&lt;/ref&gt; According to traditional sources, he is the first figure in the wider [[Muslim world]] to be associated with philosophy after the advent of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossain Nasr, "Philosophy and Cosmology," in Frye, ed., The Cambridge History of Iran, pp 421.  Quote: "the first person mentioned in traditional sources as having devoted himself to philosophy in the Islamic period is Abu'l-Abbas Iranshahri, who flourished in the 3rd/9th century.."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Nishapur]] (modern [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] in Iran), the city also known as Iranshahr, hence his title Iranshahri.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; According to [[Nasir Khusraw]], Iranshahri taught [[Rhazes]] and [[Biruni]] ancient [[Iranian philosophy]].

==Religious Believes==
According to [[Al-Biruni]] his rare impartiality is rooted in his lack of dependence on a particular religion. he created a religion and invited others to that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abu rihan|first1=Al-Biruni|title=Critical study of what India says, whether accepted by reason or refused, Volume One|pages=4, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He authored&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; several books and treatises in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and in [[Persian language|Persian]].  All the books written, some of which are mentioned in passing by [[Biruni]] and [[Nasir Khusraw]], have been lost.

He wrote three books; ''Jalil'', ''Athir'', and ''Masael u'ttabi'a'', about philosophy and wisdom. Abulma'ali states that Iranshahri brought a new religion with a Persian book and named his miracle ''Hasti'' (existence). According to [[Biruni]], he was knowledgeable about [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Shamanism]].

==Philosophy==

According to Abu'l Ma'ali, the author of bayan al-Adyan, Iranshahri considered himself a Prophet and wrote a book in [[Persian language|Persian]] which he claimed have received a divine revelation by the angel called Hasti (Existence).&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; He believed in the unity of all religions and considered existing differences among them the results of special interests (ḡarażµ) of their followers.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; According to [[Biruni]], Iranshahri had said that God took covenant from light and darkness on the days of [[Nowruz]] and [[Mehragan]], which may reflect [[Zurvanite]] influence.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; According to [[Nasir Khusraw]], Iranshahri had expressed philosophical concepts in religious terms in such books as Ketab-e jalil and Ketab-e athir, and had led people to the true religion and the understanding of [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

He maintained that God was always a creator, and there was not a time when he was non-creative (u-rā ṣonʿ nabud) before He turned into being creative.  According to him, it is requisite that He always be creator, then it is necessary for that in which His creation appeared to be eternal (qadim).  His creation makes its appearance (padid-āyanda ast) in Matter (hayulā), and therefore, Matter, a sign of the apparent power of [[God]], is eternal; and since Matter, which is eternal, requires the existence of Space (makān), it follows that Space should be eternal too.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; His ideas on time were that time, world, and duration (zamān dahr wa moddat) are names whose meanings are derived from the same substance (jawhar).&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; He also philosophized that Time, a substance in motion and restless (jawhar-e ravanda wa biqarār), is the sign of God's knowledge, in the same way that Space is the sign of His power; motion is the sign of His action, and the being (jesm) is the sign of His ability, and every one of these signs is infinite and eternal.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

'''Tāj al-Dīn Abū al-Fath Muhammad ibn `Abd al-Karīm ash-Shahrastānī''' (1086–1153 [[Common Era|CE]]), also known as '''Muhammad al-Shahrastānī''', was an influential [[Persian people|Persian]] historian of religions, a [[historiographer]], [[Islamic]] scholar, philosopher and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie (1992). ''Islam: An Introduction'' (Translation of: Der Islam). SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-1327-6}}. {{OCLC|25201546}}. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[Al-Milal wa al-Nihal|Kitab al–Milal wa al-Nihal]]'' (lit. ''The Book of Sects and Creeds'') was one of the pioneers in developing an objective and philosophical approach to the [[religious studies|study of religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=William Montgomery|author-link=W. Montgomery Watt|date=1991|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters: Perceptions and Misperceptions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ|location=London and New York|publisher=Routledge|page=|isbn=0415054109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Very few things are known about al-Shahrastānī's life. He was born in 1086 CE [[Hijri year|A.H.]], in the town of Shahristān, ([[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], province of Persia) where he acquired his early traditional education. Later, he was sent to [[Nishapur|Nīshāpūr]] where he studied under different masters who were all disciples of the [[Ash'ari|Ash`ari]] theologian [[al-Juwayni|al-Juwaynī]] (d. 1085). At the age of thirty, al-Shahrastānī went to [[Baghdad]] to pursue theological studies and taught for three years at the prestigious Ash`ari school, [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad|al-Nizāmiyya]]. Afterwards, he returned to [[Persia]] where he worked as ''Nā’ib'' (Deputy) of the chancellery for [[Ahmad Sanjar|Sanjar]], the [[Seljuk dynasty|Saljūq]] ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurāsān]]. At the end of his life, al-Shahrastānī went back to live in his native town, where he died in the year 1153.

==Works==
Al-Shahrastani distinguished himself by his desire to describe in the most objective way the universal religious history of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA68 Watt 1991, p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is reflected in his ''[[Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal]]'' (The Book of Sects and Creeds), a monumental work, which presents the doctrinal points of view of all the religions and philosophies which existed up to his time. The book was one of the earliest systematic [[religious studies|studies of religion]], and is noted for its non-polemical style and scientific approach.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA68 Watt 1991, p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt; A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by [[UNESCO]] (''Livre des religions et des sectes.'' Peeters: 1986, 1993).

Al-Shahrastani's philosophical and theological thoughts manifested in his other major works, which include:

* The ''Nihayat al-aqdam fi 'ilm al-kalam'' (The End of Steps in the Science of Theology) presents different theological discussions and shows the limits of Muslim theology (''[[kalam]]'').
* The ''Majlis'' is a discourse, written during the mature period of his life, delivered to a [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi`ite]] audience.
* The ''Musara`at al-Falasifa'' (The Struggle with Philosophers) criticizes [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna)’s  doctrines by emphasizing some peculiar [[Isma'ili]] arguments on the division of beings.
* The ''Mafatih al-Asrar wa-masabih al-abrar'' (The Keys of the Mysteries and the Lamps of the Righteous) introduces the [[Qur’an]] and gives a complete commentary on the first two chapters of the Qur’an.

===Religious belief===
Al-Shahrastani's own beliefs are difficult to categorize because he juggled many different philosophical and theological vocabularies. He was a clever thinker, demonstrated by the intricacies of many traditions and the Shi`ite notion of the 'Guide' (''[[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]]'') found in his thoughts. Al-Shahrastani had many reasons to speak somewhat allegorically. He was a very subtle author who often spoke indirectly by means of symbols. He preferred his own personal vocabulary to the traditional one. For this reason, his position is hard to determine. It may well be that ideological considerations led him to speak indirectly; he perhaps assumed those familiar with the symbols would be able to unravel his elusive ideas. For all these reasons, many scholars who have studied al-Shahrastani were misled concerning his religious identity.

Though al-Shahrastani is generally regarded as an [[Sunni]]-[[Ash'ari]] theologian, he had been accused by his contemporaries, al-Khwarazmi and al-Sam'ani, of being drawn to the "people of the mountain fortresses", i.e. the [[Nizari]] [[Isma'ili]]s of [[Alamut]] ''(See: [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] and the [[Hashshashin]])''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This view is supported by modern scholars, such as Muhammad Ridā Jalālī Nā’īnī, Muhammad Taqī Dānish-Pazhūh, [[Wilferd Madelung]], Jean Jolivet, Guy Monnot, and Diana Steigerwald who characterize his works as belonging to the Isma'ili tradition, while attributing his public Ash'arism and [[Shafi'i]]sm to the practice of ''[[taqiyya]]'' (religious dissimulation), since Ismā`īlis were persecuted during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Steigerwald|1997|pp=298–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
As opposed to [[Ash'ari]]tes, al-Shahrastani presents a gradation in the creation (''khalq''). He gives a definition of the Prophetic Impeccability (''`Isma'') opposed to the Ash`arite tradition, maintaining that it subsists in the [[Prophet]] as part of his real nature. As did [[al-Ghazzali]], al-Shahrastani harshly criticizes [[Avicenna]]'s Necessary Being who knows the [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] but not the [[particular]]. Al-Shahrastani, particularly in the ''Musara`a al-Falasifa'', has an [[Isma'ili]] conception of the Originator (''Mubdi`'') beyond [[Being]] and non-Being. He argues convincingly for the existence of Divine Attributes, but he does not ascribe them directly to God. True worship means ''[[Tawhid]]'' - declaring the Unicity of God. This includes the negation of all attributes which humans give to God, the Ultimate One who is totally transcendent. God is Unknowable, Indefinable, Unattainable, and above human comprehension.

As for the theory of creation, in the ''Nihaya'', al-Shahrastani insists that God is the only Creator and the only Agent. He also develops a different interpretation of [[ex-nihilo]] creation which does not mean creation out of nothing, but creation made only by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|al-Shahrastani|1934|pp=18–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Majlis'' and the ''Mafatih al-Asrar'', the angels play a dominant role in the physical creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|al-Shahrastani|1998|p = 82}}; {{harv|al-Shahrastani|1989|loc=vol. I: 109 verso line 24 to 110 recto line 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of the Divine Word (''Kalima'') has a convincing Isma'ili imprint; for example, his hierarchy of angels and Divine Words (''Kalimat'' ) are conceived as being the causes of spiritual beings. Al-Shahrastani in the ''Nihaya'' writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... his [Divine] Command (''Amr'') is pre-existent and his multiple ''Kalimat'' are eternal. By his Command, ''Kalimat'' become the manifestation of it. Spiritual beings are the manifestation of ''Kalimat'' and bodies are the manifestation of spiritual beings. The ''Ibda`'' (Origination beyond time and space) and ''khalq'' (physical creation) become manifested [respectively in] spiritual beings and bodies. As for ''Kalimat'' and letters (''huruf''), they are eternal and pre-existent. Since his Command is not similar to our command, his ''Kalimat'' and his letters are not similar to our ''Kalimat''. Since letters are elements of ''Kalimat'' which are the causes of spiritual beings who govern corporeal beings; all existence subsists in the ''Kalimat'' Allah preserved in his Command."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|al-Shahrastani|1934|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Majlis'', al-Shahrastani divides the creation into two worlds – the spiritual world (i.e. the world of the Origination of spirits (''Ibda'-i arwah'')) in an achieved (''mafrugh'') state and the world of physical creation (''khalq'') in becoming (''musta'naf''). He shares an Isma`ili cosmology in which God has built his religion in the image of creation.

The conception of Prophecy developed in the ''Nihaya'' is closer to that of Isma`ilis and Falasifa ([[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]]) than to Ash`arites, because al-Shahrastani establishes a logical link between miracles and Prophetic Impeccability (''`Isma''). For al-Shahrastani, the proof of veracity (''sidq'') of the Prophet is intrinsic to his nature and is related to his Impeccability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|al-Shahrastani|1934|pp=444–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He develops the concept of cyclical time explicitly in the ''Milal'', the ''Majlis'', and the ''Mafatih'' and implicitly in the ''Nihaya''. In the ''Majlis'', his understanding of the dynamic evolution of humanity is similar to Isma`ilism, in which each Prophet opens a new cycle. Al-Shahrastani recovers the mythical Qur'anic story of [[Moses]] and the Servant of God inspired by ''Al-Risala al-Mudhhiba'' of [[al-Qadi al-Nu'man]] (d. 974).

Al-Shahrastani was an able and learned man of great personal charm. The real nature of his thought is best referred to by the term [[Transcendent theosophy|theosophy]], in the older sense of "divine wisdom". However, al-Shahrastani was certainly not totally against theology or philosophy, even if he was very harsh against the theologians and the philosophers. As he explained in the ''Majlis'', in order to remain on the right path, one must preserve a perfect equilibrium between intellect (''`aql'') and audition (''sam`''). A philosopher or a theologian must use his intellect until he reaches the rational limit. Beyond this limit, he must listen to the teaching of Prophets and Imams.

His works reflect a complex interweaving of intellectual strands, and his thought is a synthesis of this fruitful historical period. In his conception of God, Creation, Prophecy, and ''[[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imama]]'', al Shahrastani adopted many doctrinal elements that are reconcilable with [[Nizari]] [[Isma'ilism]]. The necessity of a Guide, belonging both to the spiritual and the physical world, is primordial in his scheme since the ''Imam'' is manifested in this physical world.

===Christian commentary===

In ''Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal'', al-Shahrastani records a portrayal of [[Christianity]] very close to the orthodox tenets while continuing the Islamic narrative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The Christians. (They are) the community (''[[ummah|umma]]'') of the Christ, [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], son of Mary (peace upon him). He it is who was truly sent (as prophet; ''mab'uth'') after Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him were (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of the dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and innate disposition (''[[fitra]]'') are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, his coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. For all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age of) forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at (the age of) thirty. The duration of his (prophetic) mission (''[[da'wa]]'') was three years and three months and three days.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA68 Watt 1991, p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Al-Shahrastani also explains the differences between Christians in ''Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal'' regarding the incarnation (''tajassud''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;“They affirmed that God has three hypostases (''aqanim''). They said that the Creator (may he be exalted) is one substance (''jawhar''), meaning by this what is self-subsistent (''al-qa'im bi-n-nafs''), not (what is characterized by) spatial location and physical magnitude; and he is one in substantiality, three in hypostaticity (''uqnumiyya''). By the hypostases they mean the attributes (''sifat''), such as existence, life and knowledge, and the father, the son and the holy spirit (''[[Holy Spirit in Islam|ruh al-qudus]]''). The (hypostasis of) knowledge clothes itself and was incarnated, but not the other hypostases.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA69 Watt 1991, p. 69.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Often cited for his work on the twentieth-century philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]],&lt;ref&gt;Giannis Triantafillou, "Bertrand Russell is Relevant even Today," ''Eleftherotipia'' (Greece), 21 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juan Ignacio Rodriguez Medina, "Las buenas razones de Bertrand Russell," ''Il Mercurio'' (Chile), 19 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "Guides to Russell's Writings," Bertrand Russell Archives, 29 November 2010, http://www.mcmaster.ca/russdocs/writings.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Irvine has  argued in favour of [[physicalism]]&lt;ref&gt;James Robert Brown, "Logic, Epistemology, Philosophy of Science," ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', 2012, {{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/logic-epistemology-philosophy-of-science |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603125532/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/logic-epistemology-philosophy-of-science |archivedate=2013-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and against several commonly held views in the history of modern philosophy, including the claim that [[Gottlob Frege]] succeeded in developing a workable theory of mathematical platonism&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Frege on Number Properties," ''Studia Logica'', vol. 96 (2010), 239-60&lt;/ref&gt; and the claim that Bertrand Russell was an advocate of epistemic logicism,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Epistemic Logicism and Russell's Regressive Method," ''Philosophical Studies'', vol. 55 (1989), 303-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Russell on Method," in Godehard Link (ed.), ''One Hundred Years of Russell's Paradox'', Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter Publishing Company, 2004, 481-500&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that one commentator has concluded is now "thoroughly debunked."&lt;ref&gt;Conor Mayo-Wilson, "Russell on Logicism and Coherence," ''Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', vol. 31 (2011), 66; for a less sympathetic appraisal, see [[Anders Kraal]], "The Aim of Russell's Early Logicism: A Reinterpretation," ''Synthese'', vol. 191 (2014), 1493-1510&lt;/ref&gt;

He has defended a two-box solution to [[Newcomb's paradox|Newcomb's problem]] in which he abandons "the (false) assumption that past observed frequency is an infallible guide to probability"&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "How Braess' Paradox Solves Newcomb's Problem," ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', vol. 7 (1993), 141-60 at 157&lt;/ref&gt; and a non-cognitivist solution to the [[liar paradox]], noting that "formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient" for determining whether individual sentence tokens have meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Gaps, Gluts, and Paradox," ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'', supplementary vol. 18 [''Return of the A priori''] (1992), 273-99 at 294&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[modal logic]] (which studies theories of possibility and necessity), he has argued in favour of the non-normal system S7, rather than more traditional systems such as S4 or S5.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "S7," ''Journal of Applied Logic'', vol. 11 (2013), 523-529&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other systems, S7 allows logicians to choose between competing logics, each of which, if true, would be necessarily true, but none of which are necessarily the correct system of necessary truths. As Irvine puts it, "just as being ''physically possible'' means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being ''logically possible'' means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 gives us the language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths. S7 gives us the language to assert not only that some propositions really are necessary; it gives us the language also to note that their denials, although impossible, remain possibly possible."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "S7," ''Journal of Applied Logic'', vol. 11 (2013), 527&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there is a mechanism in which even sets of necessary truths can be compared to their alternatives.

== Political work ==

An advocate of traditional democratic [[civil liberties]], Irvine has argued in favour of [[Freedom of speech|free speech rights]], both for political reasons&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Free Speech, Democracy, and the Question of Political Influence," in W. Wesley Pue (ed.), ''Pepper in Our Eyes: The APEC Affair'', Vancouver: UBC Press, 2000, 29-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine and David Sutherland, "Know Thy Neighbour's Views," ''Globe and Mail'', 08 April 2005, A15&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of defending [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Let Truth and Falsehood Grapple," ''University of Toronto Quarterly'', vol. 67 (1998), 549-66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Bertrand Russell and Academic Freedom," ''Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', vol. 16 (1996), 5-36&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Stephen Wexler, he has  argued that modern constitutional protections of the [[rule of law]] can trace their roots as far back as Socrates' demand that even lawmakers must be bound by the law.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine and Stephen Wexler, "The Other Trial of Socrates," ''Quadrant'', vol. 62 (2018), 50-3&lt;/ref&gt; It was this demand that led to [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] distinction between ''psephismata'' (votes of the assembly) and ''nomos'' (statute law), and to the resulting debate over how best to decide questions of legal supremacy within a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wexler and Andrew David Irvine, "Aristotle on the Rule of Law," ''Polis'', vol. 23 (2006), 116-38&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Jason Gratl, he has  argued that, in its modern form, the [[rule of law]] helps resolve tensions between [[national security]] and public accountability&lt;ref&gt;Jason Gratl and Andrew David Irvine, "National Security, State Secrecy and Public Accountability," ''University of New Brunswick Law Journal'', vol. 55 (2005), 251-71&lt;/ref&gt; and, together with John Whyte, he has argued that care needs to be taken with regard to electoral reform, especially when it comes to implementing proposals focusing on [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;John Whyte and Andrew David Irvine, "Searching for Democratic Vitality: An Analysis of Electoral Reform," ''Policy Dialogue'', no. 17 (Winter 2008), 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; He is often cited in the media on issues ranging from free speech&lt;ref&gt;Neal Hall, "Little Sisters' Appeals to Highest Court," ''Vancouver Sun'', 19 February 1999, A6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shawn Ohler, "Human Rights Tribunal Says Columnist's Opinion Anti-Semitic," ''National Post'', 04 February 1999, A4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin Freeze, "Protesters Cynical about an Apology," ''Globe and Mail'', 27 March 2002, A6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hume, "Teacher's Suspension Sparks Free Speech Fight," ''Calgary Herald'', 24 April 2003, A3&lt;/ref&gt; and academic freedom &lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kay, "Propaganda in the Classroom" ''National Post'', 15 December 2004, A17&lt;/ref&gt; to parliamentary procedure&lt;ref&gt;Jason Unrau, "Professor Queries Speaker's Ruling," ''Whitehorse Star'', 12 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial activism.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Seeman, "Who Runs Canada?" ''National Post'', 24 July 1999, B3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatre work ==

In 2007 Irvine premiered [[Socrates on Trial (play)|''Socrates on Trial'']], a [[Play (theatre)|play]] depicting the life and death of the ancient Greek philosopher [[Socrates]]. The play tells the story of how Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens and for failing to honour the city's gods. The play contains adaptations of several classic Greek works including the slapstick comedy [[Clouds (Aristophanes)|''Clouds'']], written by [[Aristophanes]] and first performed in 423 BCE, and the dramatic monologue [[Apology (Plato)|''Apology'']], written by [[Plato]] to record the defence speech Socrates gave at his trial in 399 BCE. The premiere was directed by Joan Bryans of Vital Spark Theatre Company at the [[Chan Centre for the Performing Arts]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "Stage Listings," ''Vancouver Sun'', 29 May 2008, {{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastlife/story.html?id%3D56963701-382d-41cc-b75c-53fb57678d7d |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215020022/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastlife/story.html?id=56963701-382d-41cc-b75c-53fb57678d7d |archivedate=2015-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of one reviewer, "The play is refreshingly illuminating on the relationship between Socrates' execution and the lasting influence of Aristophanes' negative depiction of him on the evolution of the Athenian psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Alapin, Maya, Review of ''Socrates on Trial'', ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review,'' 2008.08.08&lt;/ref&gt; According to another, the play not only gives an entertaining portrayal of Plato's famous mentor, but also a fascinating introduction to the "pompous, arrogant and often petulant" individual presented by Aristophanes,&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "Socrates on Trial," ''Riveting Riffs Magazine,'' 2008, http://www.rivetingriffs.com/Socrates%20On%20Trial.html&lt;/ref&gt; giving modern audiences a greater understanding of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death.

== Bibliographical work ==

In 1999, Irvine produced scholarly bibliographies of both the primary&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Select Primary Bibliography," in Andrew David Irvine (ed.), ''Bertrand Russell: Life, Work and Influence,'' London: Routledge, 1999, 217-46&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Select Secondary Bibliography," in Andrew David Irvine (ed.), ''Bertrand Russell: Life, Work and Influence,'' London: Routledge, 1999, 247-312&lt;/ref&gt; literature surrounding the Nobel Laureate [[Bertrand Russell]]. Together with Dawn Ogden, he also produced the first bibliographical index for Russell's influential book, ''A History of Western Philosophy.''&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Ogden and Andrew David Irvine, "A Bibliographical Index for Bertrand Russell's ''History of Western Philosophy''," ''Russell'', vol. 19 (1999), no. 1, 63-83&lt;/ref&gt; The index is based on the second British edition (of 1979). A conversion table gives page references for both the first American edition (of 1945) and the first British edition (of 1946).

Together with Edmond Rivère, Irvine is the author of the first comprehensive, scholarly bibliography of Canada's premier literary prize, the [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Literary Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew David Irvine, "Bibliographic Errata regarding the Cumulative List of Winners of the Governor General's Literary Awards / Liste cumulative des lauréates et des lauréats des Prix littéraires du Gouverneur général, 2011," ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada'', 50 (2012), 51-61; Andrew David Irvine, "The Governor General's Literary Awards: An Introduction," ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada'', 52 (2014), 7-33; Andrew David Irvine, "The Governor General's Literary Awards: English-language Winners, 1936-2013," ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada'', 52 (2014), 35-161; and Andrew David Irvine and Edmond Rivère, "Prix littéraires du Gouverneur général: Lauréats en langue française, 1936-2013," ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada'', 52 (2014), 163-267&lt;/ref&gt; The bibliography covers the history of the awards from their inception in 1936 through to the end of 2013 and appeared in ''Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada'' in 2014.

== Literary references ==

In 1994, Irvine served as inspiration for the character Hardy Orbs in the dystopian novel, ''Fair New World''. The novel was written by [[Lou Marinoff]] under the pseudonym Lou Tafler. A twentieth-anniversary re-issue in 2014 contained a foreword purportedly written by Orbs.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Tafler, ''Fair New World'', second edition, Denver: Argo Navis, 2014, xiii-xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">'''Anthony of the Mother of God''' ({{lang-es|'''Antonio de la Madre de Dios}}), [[Discalced Carmelites|O.C.D.]]''' (1583, [[León, Spain|Leon]]&amp;ndash;27 November 1637, [[Salamanca]]), was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Discalced Carmelite]] friar, who was notable as a professor of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]], who initiated the compilation.

==Career and works==
Born '''Antonio Oliva y Ordás''', as a young man, he entered the Order of [[Discalced Carmelites]] around 1600. After completing his studies at their [[seminary]], then part of the [[University of Salamanca]], in 1609 he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercaba.org/Rialp/S/salmanticenses.htm|work=Gran Enciclopedia Rialp|title=Salmanticenses|first=Enrique|last=LLamas|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony then taught [[Aristotle]]'s [[dialectics]] and [[natural philosophy]] at another seminary of his Order, part of the [[Universidad Complutense]], at that time located in [[Alcalá de Henares]].

With the collaboration of his colleagues, Anthony undertook an encyclopaedia intended for students in arts and [[philosophy]], as a guide to the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]. This work, of which he is credited with the authorship of two volumes, was originally called the ''Collegium Complutense philosophicum'' (''Philosophical Writings of the Complutense College'')&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá, 1624; other editions Frankfurt, 1629; Lyons, 1637, 1651, 1668&lt;/ref&gt; was highly esteemed by [[Thomists]].

The work was at first a treatise on [[logic]]; but in the course of time, [[metaphysics]] and moral philosophy were added, and the work served as an introduction to the ''Curso Dogmático Salmanticense'' (''Theological Curriculum of Salamanca''), the first three volumes of which are also attributed to Anthony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9640">'''Chick culling''' is the process of killing newly hatched [[poultry]] for which the industry has no use. It occurs in all industrialised egg production whether free range, organic, or [[battery cage]]—including that of the UK and US.  Because male chickens do not lay eggs and only those on breeding programmes are required to fertilise eggs, they are considered redundant to the egg-laying industries and are usually killed shortly after being [[Chick sexing|sexed]], which occurs after they hatch.&lt;ref name=2018review&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krautwald-Junghanns|first1=ME|last2=Cramer|first2=K|last3=Fischer|first3=B|last4=Förster|first4=A|last5=Galli|first5=R|last6=Kremer|first6=F|last7=Mapesa|first7=EU|last8=Meissner|first8=S|last9=Preisinger|first9=R|last10=Preusse|first10=G|last11=Schnabel|first11=C|last12=Steiner|first12=G|last13=Bartels|first13=T|title=Current approaches to avoid the culling of day-old male chicks in the layer industry, with special reference to spectroscopic methods.|journal=Poultry science|date=1 March 2018|volume=97|issue=3|pages=749-757|doi=10.3382/ps/pex389|pmid=29294120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many methods of culling do not involve anaesthetics and include [[cervical dislocation]], [[asphyxia|asphyxiation]] by carbon dioxide and maceration using a high speed grinder.

Due to modern [[selective breeding]], laying hen [[strain (biology)|strain]]s differ from meat production strains ([[broilers]]). In the United States, males are culled in egg production, since males "don’t lay eggs or grow large enough to become broilers".&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt;

Chicks are also culled in the production of [[foie gras]]. However, because males put on more weight than females in this production system, the females are culled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodenburg|first=T. B.|last2=Bracke|first2=M. B.

==History==
Prior to the development of modern [[broiler]] meat breeds, most male chickens (cockerels) were slaughtered for meat, whereas females (pullets) would be kept for egg production. However, once{{when|date=June 2016}} the industry bred separate meat and egg-producing hybrids, there was no reason to keep males of the egg-producing hybrid. As a consequence, the males of egg-laying chickens are killed as soon as possible after hatching and sexing to reduce losses incurred by the breeder. [[Chicken sexing|Special techniques]] have been developed to accurately determine the sex of chicks at as young an age as possible.

As of 2018, worldwide around 7 billion day-old male chicks were culled per year in the egg industry.&lt;ref name=2018review/&gt;

Chicks are also culled in the production of [[foie gras]].  After hatching, the ducklings are sexed.  Males put on more weight than females, so the females are killed, sometimes in an industrial macerator.  Up to 40 million female ducks per year may be killed in this way.  The remains of female ducklings are later used in cat food, fertilisers and in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/shocking-video-shows-hundreds-live-4468027|title=Shocking video shows hundreds of live ducklings 'thrown into mincer' on cruel 'foie gras farm'|publisher=The Mirror|year=2014|author=Hughes, I.|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:מדגרה_2.jpg|thumb|Chick grinding machine]]
Several methods are used to cull chicks:
*Maceration; the chicks are placed into a large high-speed grinder.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;
*[[Cervical dislocation]]; the neck is broken.
*[[Electrocution]]; an electric current is passed through the chick's body until it is dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agri.gov.il/AGEN/Reports/Shamir001.html Humane Killing of Male Chicks at the Laying Branch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010751/http://www.agri.gov.il/AGEN/Reports/Shamir001.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Suffocation]]; the chicks are placed in plastic bags.&lt;ref name="Saraswathy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/unilever-working-to-end-the-culling-of-male-chicks-114100400651_1.html|title=Unilever working to end the culling of male chicks|author=Saraswathy, M.|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gas chamber|Gases or gas mixtures]]; [[carbon dioxide]] is used to induce unconsciousness and then death.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

===US recommended methods===
The [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] recommends cervical dislocation, maceration, and [[Controlled Atmosphere Killing|asphyxiation by carbon dioxide]] as the better options.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005-2006 American Veterinary Medical Association Executive Board proposed a policy change, which was recommended by the Animal Welfare Committee on disposal of unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs. The policy states "Unwanted chicks, poults, and [[Egg_tooth#Birds|pipped]] eggs should be killed by an acceptable humane method, such as use of a commercially designed macerator that results in instantaneous death. Smothering unwanted chicks or poults in bags or containers is not acceptable. Pips, unwanted chicks, or poults should be killed prior to disposal. A pipped egg, or pip, is one where the chick or poult has not been successful in escaping the egg shell during the hatching process."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/060915e.aspx Executive Board meets pressing needs - September 15, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[Animal welfare]] advocates maintain that many of the current practices surrounding chicken slaughtering are unethical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upc-online.org/battery_hens/42203woodchipper.htm DA asks for more information in chicken chipping case&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/blog/treated-like-garbage-chicks-burned-drowned-walked/ Treated Like Garbage, These Chicks Are Burned, Drowned, and Walked On].

==Alternatives==
A Unilever spokesperson has been quoted as saying "We have also committed to providing funding and expertise for research and introduction of alternative methods such as in-ovo gender identification (sexing) of eggs. This new technology offers the potential to eliminate the hatching and culling of male chicks."&lt;ref name="Saraswathy" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">[[File:Hawaje-NoRedLine.jpg|thumb|right|260px|An example of cladogenesis today is the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian archipelago]], to which stray organisms traveled across the ocean via ocean currents and winds. Most of the species on the islands are not found anywhere else on Earth due to evolutionary divergence.]]

'''Cladogenesis''' is an [[evolution]]ary splitting of a parent [[species]] into two distinct species, forming a [[clade]].&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gould | first1=Stephen Jay | last2=Eldredge | first2=Niles | year=1977 | title=Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered | url=http://www.nileseldredge.com/pdf_files/Punctuated_Equilibria_Gould_Eldredge_1977.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Paleobiology | volume=3 | issue=2| pages=115–151 [145] | doi=10.1017/s0094837300005224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event usually occurs when a few organisms end up in [[Allopatric speciation|new, often distant areas]] or when environmental changes cause several extinctions, opening up ecological niches for the survivors and causing [[population bottleneck]]s and [[founder effect]]s changing [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] of diverging populations compared to their ancestral population. The events that cause these species to originally separate from each other over distant areas may still allow both of the species to have equal chances of surviving, reproducing, and even evolving to better suit their environments while still being two distinct species due to subsequent [[natural selection]], [[mutation]]s and [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Strotz | first1=LC | last2=Allen | first2=AP | year=2013 | title=Assessing the role of cladogenesis in macroevolution by integrating fossil and molecular evidence | journal=PNAS | volume=110 | issue=8| pages=2904–9 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1208302110 | pmid=23378632 | pmc=3581934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cladogenesis is in contrast to [[anagenesis]], in which an ancestral [[species]] gradually accumulates change, and eventually, when enough is accumulated, the species is sufficiently distinct and different enough from its original starting form that it can be labeled as a new form - a new species. Note that with anagenesis the lineage in a [[phylogenetic tree]] does not split.

To determine whether a speciation event is cladogenesis or anagenesis, researchers may use simulation, [[evidence]] from fossils, molecular evidence from the DNA of different living species, or modelling. It has however been debated whether the distinction between cladogenesis and anagenesis is necessary at all in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vaux | first1=F | last2=Trewick | first2=SA | last3=Morgan-Richards | first3=M | year=2016 | title=Lineages, splits and divergence challenge whether the terms anagenesis and cladogenesis are necessary | journal=Biol J Linnean Soc | volume=117 | issue=2| pages=165–176 |doi=10.1111/bij.12665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bij.12885 |title=Species, lineages, splitting, and divergence: why we still need ‘anagenesis’ and ‘cladogenesis’ |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=474–479 |year=2017 |last1=Allmon |first1=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bij.12872 |title=Speciation through the looking-glass |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=480–488 |year=2017 |last1=Vaux |first1=Felix |last2=Trewick |first2=Steven A. |last3=Morgan-Richards |first3=Mary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultura Sparebank''', branded as '''Cultura Bank''', is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[savings bank]] in the [[ethical banking]] movement that uses its assets on [[ethics|ethical]] investments.  The bank has offices in [[Oslo]] and has total assets of [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 657 million (2014).

Cultura's roots date back to an initiative from 1982 from a group of Norwegian [[anthroposophy|anthroposophists]] including [[Sophus Clausen]] and economics professor [[Leif Holbæk-Hanssen]], that sought to establish an ethical bank. In 1986, ''Cultura Lånesamvirke'' was established, and in 1997, Cultura was granted a full banking license as a savings bank. Cultura is inspired by [[GLS bank]], the leading anthroposophical ethical bank in Germany.

==Mission==

Cultura Bank's mission is to promote projects with a social and ethical quality. Profitability is secondary, but, of course, economic viability of the projects is a prerequisite for financing.

Cultura Bank offers a range of basic banking products e.g. current accounts with overdraft facilities, loans for new working capital as well as investments loans.

One of the banks projects is the establishment of support accounts where part of the interest rate is transferred to one of the organisations [[Fremtiden i Våre Hender]], [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[Regnskogfonded]], [[Save the Children]] or [[Kvinne- og Familieforbundet]].

==Loans==
Organic agriculture is one important area and includes manufacturing and distribution of natural food. Another large area is education where the bank finances primary and secondary schools as well as university level institutions. Medicine and healthcare is a third large area in the loan portfolio. Cultural activities like free theatre groups and several artists should also be mentioned. 
One important goal is to find new ways to finance individual initiatives seen as alternatives to mainstream business and government offerings, projects often turned down by other finance institutions.

Owing to alternative ways of collateralising loans, such as using larger groups of guarantors, many good projects rejected by normal banks have materialised. The bank is also active in the public debate, offering information about alternatives to mainstream economic thought.

===Microfinance===
In 2003 the bank co-funded the foundation MicroInvest to provide [[microcredits]]. Since 2005 the bank has acted as the operational arm of MicroInvest, and cooperation has further deepened since 2006 when the bank and MicroInvest jointly became eligible for the guarantee facility of the [[European Investment Fund]]. From 2009 the activities of MicroInvest is merged into and continued by Cultura Bank’s own Guarantee Fund (CGF) acting in its capacity as an independent trust.

Cultura Bank is looking to expand further and meet the growing demand for ethical banking products. The bank will take on larger projects, not least where the financing of real estate for schools and agriculture is concerned. Cultura Bank has also, since the start up of the bank, been active in the area of small business loans in general. The idea is to assist in the process of establishing local business initiatives, especially to promote the sustainability of local communities. Cultura Bank is looking to further expand its microfinance activities, both with NCN-members and the bank’s own clients.

==History==
The bank can trace its roots back to 1986 when '''Cultura Lånesamvirke''' was established to promote ethical banking.  Through the 1980s and 1990s the bank has merged with a number of domestic lending foundations and funds and was in 1997 made a savings bank.

The bank has issued [[grunnfondsbevis]], but is one of two savings banks in Norway who haven't listed them on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].

'''Damon Young''' (born 1975 in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) is an Australian philosopher, writer and commentator, and author of the books ''Distraction'', ''Philosophy in the Garden'' and ''How to Think About Exercise''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damonyoung.com.au Damon Young's website]&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Honorary Fellow in [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/researcher/person100033.html Damon Young's staff page at the University of Melbourne]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
In 2013 Young won the Australasian Association of Philosophy's media prize for his public writing and broadcasting.

Young is the author of ''Distraction'', an eclectic popular history of Western philosophy, focusing on themes such as attention to life and distraction from it, work, freedom and necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Kelly, "Distraction" (Review), Overland, 23 February 2010, [http://overland.org.au/blogs/not-assigned/2010/02/distraction/ Overland.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brad Frazier, "Review – ''Distraction''", Metapsychology Online Reviews, 16 Feb 2010(Volume 14, Issue 7), [http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&amp;id=5395&amp;cn=394 Metapsychology.mentalhelp.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Damon Young", Readings, [http://www.readings.com.au/interview/damon-young Readings.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Australian]]'' called it lacking in precision, saying its "central proposition – that new information technologies distract us from our common existential challenge – is never thoroughly probed"&lt;ref&gt;Luke Slattery, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/on-paying-attention/story-e6frg8no-1111117371752 "On paying attention"] (Review of ''Distraction: A Philosopher's Guide to Being Free'' by Damon Young), ''[[The Australian]]'', 6 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while London's ''[[Financial Times]]'' called it "lucid and optimistic".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Vernon, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cfd91158-7ad9-11dd-adbe-000077b07658.html ''Distraction'' (Review)], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 8 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''Philosophy in the Garden'', published in Australia in December 2012, was described by ''The Australian'' as "fluent and stylish and never marred by cliches or cliched thinking".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/ground-prepared-for-a-meandering-discourse/story-fn9n8gph-1226547206552 Theaustralian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in the UK in April 2014 by Rider, an imprint of Random House, under the title ''Voltaire's Vine and Other Philosophies: How Gardens Inspired Great Writers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/9781846044175 Random House] Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's columns, reviews and features have been published in ''[[The Age]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', ''The Australian'', ''[[Herald Sun]]'', [[BBC]] and [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://damon-young.blogspot.com.au/p/journalism.html Damon Young]&lt;/ref&gt; He has written poetry and fiction for ''[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]'' and ''[[Meanjin]]'' magazines.

Young regularly comments on radio, and has appeared on Channel 7 ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' and [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]]. He was a regular panellist on [[ABC Radio National]]'s ''Life Matters]]'', a monthly guest on ''Mornings'' with [[Alan Brough]] on [[774 ABC Melbourne]], and was "philosopher-in-residence" on ''Afternoons'' with [[James Valentine (journalist)|James Valentine]] on [[ABC Radio Sydney|ABC Sydney 702]], and "sports philosopher" with Francis Leach on [[1116 SEN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://damon-young.blogspot.com.au/p/radiotelevision.html Damon Young]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">For [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–84), '''discontinuity''' and continuity reflect the flow of history and the fact that some "things are no longer perceived, described, expressed, characterised, classified, and known in the same way" from one era to the next. (1994).

== Explanation ==
In developing the theory of ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge|archaeology of knowledge]]'', Foucault was trying to analyse the fundamental codes which a culture uses to construct the ''episteme'' or configuration of knowledge that determines the empirical orders and social practices of each particular historical era. He adopted discontinuity as a positive working tool. Some of the [[discourse]] would be regular and continuous over time as knowledge steadily accumulates and society gradually establishes what will constitute truth or reason for the time being. But, in a transition from one era to the next, there will be overlaps, breaks and discontinuities as society reconfigures the discourse to match the new environment. 

The tool is given an expanded role in ''genealogy'', the next phase of [[discourse analysis]], where the intention is to grasp the total complexity of the use of power and the effects it produces. Foucault sees power as the means for constituting individuals’ identities and determining the limits of their autonomy. This reflects the symbiotic relationship between ''power'' (''pouvoir'') and ''knowledge'' (''savoir''). In his study of prisons and hospitals, he observed how the modern individual becomes both an object and subject of knowledge. Science emerges as a means of directing and shaping lives. Hence, the modern conception of sexuality emerges from Christian codes of morality, the science of psychology, the laws and enforcement strategies adopted by the police and judiciary, the way in which issues of sexuality are discussed in the public media, the education system, etc. These are covert forms of domination (if not oppression), and their influence is to be found not only in what is said, but more importantly, in what is not said: in all the silences and lacunae, in all the discontinuities. If one idea is discussed, then it is not discussed, whose interest is served by this change?

'''Epistemological psychology''' is a multi-sided perspective in [[psychology]] uncovering simple primary hidden inklings (images) in ideas, actions, feelings and all social interactions.

The inkling is presumed to trigger an affect which encapsulates and saturates all human experience. In everyday life, inklings induce detection either via human enactments (through habitual behavior) or through spontaneous devotion (conscious expression in the arts).

The term episteme is related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word επιστήμη, which translates literally as ''standing near or by that which causes'' but is often simplified as ''[[knowledge]]'' or ''[[science]]''. By ignoring ego interests the core impetus or the essence of a deed, real or imagined, is recovered.

==History==
Episteme psychology began with the 1940s written works of [[Gaston Bachelard]], whose many books focused on [[poetics]] and (day-) dreaming.  Episteme psychology was established as a separate discipline in the late 1980s through the work of v.d. [[Stok v. Altenæ]].

{{Contract law}}

'''Frustration of purpose''', in [[law]], is a defense to enforcement of a [[contract]]. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made.&lt;ref name="1982 HCA 24"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1992|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |date=11 May 1982 |courtname=auto}}.austlii&lt;/ref&gt; Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.

For example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, suppose after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a [[hell or high water clause]], Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a [[foreclosure]] on his [[credit rating]].

Frustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of [[impossibility]]. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.

However, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.

The ''[[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]]'', Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:
{{quote|Where, after a contract is made, a party's principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his remaining duties to render performance are discharged, unless the language or circumstances [of the contract] indicate the contrary.}}

A circumstance is not deemed to be a "basic assumption on which the contract is made" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of [[Prohibition]], when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.

If the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.

==In English law==
{{main|Frustration in English law}}
{{see also|Coronation cases}}

The [[English law| English]] case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' established the doctrine of frustration, alleviating the potential harshness of "[[sanctity of contract]]".&lt;ref&gt;Beale (2002) p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a [[Royal Surrey Gardens|music hall]], for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contracting, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. Since the contract was impossible to perform, [[Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn|Judge Blackburn]] held that the absolute liability set forth in ''[[Paradine v Jane]]'' would not apply here, as there was an [[Implied terms in English law|implied term]] that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts.&lt;ref name=km1&gt;Koffman, Macdonald, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; 

The requirement of "impossibility" in ''Taylor v Caldwell'' was modified in the 1903 case of ''[[Krell v Henry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Krell v Henry]]'' [1903] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 740.&lt;/ref&gt; which concerned a party who had rented a room for the purpose of watching the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation procession]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. The king fell ill and the coronation was indefinitely postponed. The hirer refused to pay for the room, so the owner sued for [[breach of contract]]; and the hirer then countersued for the return of his £25 deposit. The court determined that the cancellation of the coronation was unforeseeable by the parties, and discharged the contract, leaving the parties as they were: the hirer lost his one-third deposit, and the owner lost the rest of the rent. The court reasoned that the doctrine of "impossibility" could not be applied in this case because it was technically been possible for the hirer to take possession of the flat and sit on the balcony. However, the owner knew the only reason the hirer would want to rent the flat was to watch the procession; had the hirer actually gone to the flat and sat on the balcony, he would have seen nothing of interest. Thus the purpose of the contract had been frustrated by an outside event (the King's illness and consequent cancellation of the parade), justifying termination (but not rescission) of the contract.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4706">'''Gaspar Lax'''  (1487, [[Sariñena]] – 23 February 1560, [[Saragossa]]) was a Spanish mathematician, logician, and philosopher who spent much of his career in Paris.&lt;ref name="DictPR"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33983842|title=Dictionary of philosophy and religion : Eastern and Western thought|last=Reese|first=William|date=1996|publisher=Humanities Press|isbn=0391038648|edition=New and enl.|location=Atlantic Highlands, N.J.|oclc=33983842|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lax was the son of  Leonor de la Cueva and Gaspar Lax,  a physician, and  had two brothers and four sisters.&lt;ref&gt; González Ancín, Miguel &amp; Towns, Otis. (2017) [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3093969 ''Miguel Servet en España (1506-1527). Edición ampliada''], pp.140-142, 360. &lt;/ref&gt; He studied the [[Seven Liberal Arts]] and theology at the [[University of Saragossa]], where he acquired a master's degree. Also during this period of time, all along with another friend, Lax fatally wounded another student by hitting his head.&lt;ref&gt; González Ancín, Miguel &amp; Towns, Otis. (2017) p. 143, 359-360&lt;/ref&gt;.  He later moved to Paris, and there  he taught in 1507–1508 at the [[Collège de Calvi]]  and then at the [[Collège de Montaigu]], where he was a student of [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]] (or Major) and simultaneously was a teacher himself. In Paris he was known as the "Prince of [[Sophist]]s," and his works and lessons were very praised. He taught in Paris until 1516,  and then returned to Spain. Some researchers think there was an attempt by some of king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s servants to appoint him [[University of Zaragoza]]'s High Master, just as they had tried to appoint [[Erasmus]] as High Chancellor of the same University during the same months.&lt;ref&gt; González Ancín, Miguel &amp; Towns, Otis. (2017) p. 149,241-242&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end this was not possible, and he was appointed as a teacher in the University of [[Huesca]], that same year. There he taught until 1520, when he became University of Saragosa's High Master (similar to a [[Dean (academia)|dean]]), vice-chancellor and [[Rector (academia)|rector]], and also was simultaneously one of the four Masters of Arts, a position  very similar to Arts faculty's professor in other Universities.  There he had his brilliant nephew [[Michael Servetus]]  as a student in the same University, who also became in 1525 one of the four Masters of Arts. During this period of time Lax, who had erasmian friends, permitted that Erasmus's works would be read and taught in the University. In 1527 apparently Lax attacked his nephew and colleague Michael Servetus in a violent brawl of which no other details are known, but that got Servetus expelled.   The most probable causes of this clash is  that Servetus would have started talking of his "heretic" theological ideas, or that Lax had silenced Servetus's probable collaboration in his work ''Quaestiones phyisicales'',  which just 11 days before had  started to get in print.&lt;ref&gt;González Ancín, Miguel &amp; Towns, Otis. (2017) pp.148-151, 190-233, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;. Lax kept being University of Saragossa's High master, teaching Arts,   until his death in 1560, blind and with gout in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;González Ancín, Miguel &amp; Towns, Otis. (2017) pp. 371-373&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gim Jongjik''' ([[Hangul]]:김종직, 1431–1492), often known by his pen name '''Jeompiljae'''(점필재), was a leading [[Korean Confucianism|Korean Neo-Confucian]] scholar in the early [[Joseon Dynasty]].  He was born in [[Miryang]] in [[Gyeongsang]] province, to a [[yangban]] family of the [[Seonsan]] Gim lineage.  He passed the ''jinsa'' literary [[gwageo|licentiate examination]] in 1453 and the higher examination in 1459.  

After passing the examination, Gim entered government service, holding a wide range of positions.  He earned the special favor of [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]], as well as the enmity of the [[Hungupa]] (Loyal Retainers) faction.

After his death, Gim Jongjik's writings became the basis for the [[Korean Literati Purges|First Literati Purge of 1498]] under the rule of [[Yeonsan-gun of Joseon|Prince Yeonsan]].  His students included [[Gim Goeng-pil]], who was killed in the subsequent [[Korean Literati Purges|Second Literati Purge]] or Gapja massacre of scholar along with many others.  Later Gim Jongjik's memory was rehabilitated, and he was enshrined in various ''[[seowon]]'' including [[Yerim Seowon]] in Miryang and [[Geumo Seowon]] in [[Gumi, South Korea|Gumi]].

'''Huberto Rohden Sobrinho''', known as '''Huberto Rohden''', (1893–1981) was a [[Brazil]]ian philosopher, educator and [[theologist]].

He was born in São Ludgero.

A pioneer of [[transcendentalism]] in Brazil who wrote more than 100 works, where he taught ecumenical lecture of spiritual approach towards [[Education]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], emphasizing self-knowledge.

Rohden was a major proposer of a ''cosmo philosophy'', which consists of an individual cosmic harmony within a "cosmocracy": a self-governed individual through universal ethical laws in connection with a collective consciousness of the universe and the flourishing of the divine essence of humans, assuming one has to be responsible for its acts and pursue an intimate reform, with no appeal to an ecclesiastic authority to release the debts of its moral behaviour.

He is a translator of the [[New Testament]], of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Tao Te Ching]]; he was concerned with editing them with low prices, in order to enable access to these works.

A former jesuit priest during the beginning of the literary career; major in Sciences, Philosophy and [[Theology]] at the [[Innsbruck]] University ([[Austria]]), [[Valkenburg aan de Geul|Valkenburg]] and [[Napoles]] ([[Italy]]).

In Brazil he founded the ''Instituição Cultural e Beneficente Alvorada'' (1952), taught at the [[Princeton University]], [[American University]] ([[Washington D.C.]]) and at the [[Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie]] ([[Sao Paulo]], Brazil). Delivered lectures in the United States, [[India]] and [[Portugal]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hugo Kołłątaj was born 1 April 1750 in Dederkały Wielkie (now in Western Ukraine) in [[Volhynian Voivodeship (1569–1795)|Volhynia]] into a family of minor [[Polish nobility]]. Soon after, his family moved to [[Nieciesławice]], near [[Sandomierz]], where he spent his childhood.&lt;ref name="min"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bauer40/&gt;&lt;ref name="tucz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; He attended school in [[Pińczów]].&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt; He began his studies at the [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków Academy]], subsequently, [[Jagiellonian University]], where he studied law and gained a doctorate.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer40"/&gt; Afterwards, around 1775 he took [[holy orders]].&lt;ref name="kai"/&gt; He studied in [[Vienna]] and Italy ([[Naples]] and [[Rome]]), where he would have encountered [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bauer40/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aj"/&gt; He is thought to have gained two further doctorates abroad in philosophy and [[theology]].&lt;ref name=kai/&gt;

Returning to Poland, he became a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Kraków]],&lt;ref name=aj/&gt; and [[parish]] priest of [[Krzyżanowice Dolne]] and [[Tuczępy, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship|Tuczępy]].&lt;ref name=tucz/&gt;&lt;ref name=nd/&gt; He was active in the [[Commission of National Education]] and the [[Society for Elementary Books]], where he took a prominent role in the development of the national network of schools.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt; He spent two years in Warsaw, but returned to Kraków where he reformed the Kraków Academy, on whose board he sat from 1777, and whose [[Rector (academia)|rector]] he was between 1783-1786.&lt;ref name="WIEM"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kai/&gt;&lt;ref name=aj/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt; The reform of the Academy was very substantial. It established innovative standards. Notably, he substituted [[Polish language|Polish]] for [[Latin]] which till then was used for lectures. The removal of Latin in favour of a national language in higher education was then still uncommon in Europe.&lt;ref name="Bauer41"/&gt; The reform proved so controversial that his political enemies plotted successfully to have him temporarily removed from Kraków in 1781, on grounds of corruption and immorality. Although in 1782 the decision was rescinded.&lt;ref name="Bauer42"/&gt;

===Reforms of the Great Sejm===
[[File:Huga Kałantaj. Гуга Калантай (XIX).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kołłątaj]]
Kołłątaj was also active politically. In 1786 he assumed the office of the [[Referendary]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], and moved to Warsaw.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; He became prominent in the [[reform movement]], heading an informal group that was on the radical wing of the [[Patriotic Party]], and labelled by their political enemies as "[[Kołłątaj's Forge]]".&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kai/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt; As leader of the Patriotic Party during the [[Great Sejm]], he set out its programme in his ''Several Anonymous Letters to [[Stanisław Małachowski]]'' (1788–1789) and in his essay, ''The Political Law of the Polish Nation'' (1790).&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; In his works he advocated a republican-tinged constitutional reform and the need for other social reforms.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt; Among the goals he pursued were the strengthening of the king's constitutional position, a larger national army, abolition of the [[liberum veto]], the introduction of universal taxation, and the emancipation of both townspeople and the peasantry.&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; An organizer of the townspeople's movement, he edited a text that demanded reform and which was delivered to the [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|king]] during the [[Black Procession]] of 1789.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt;

Kołłątaj co-authored the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt; He also founded the [[Friends of the Constitution]] to assist in the document's implementation.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt; In 1786 he received the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]] and in 1791, the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]].&lt;ref name=min/&gt; In 1791-92 he served as [[Crown Vice Chancellor]] (Podkanclerzy Koronny).&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt;

During the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|Polish-Russian war]] that broke out over the [[3 May Constitution]], Kołłątaj, along with other royal advisers, persuaded King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanisław August]], himself a co-author of the Constitution, to seek a compromise with their opponents and to join the [[Targowica Confederation]] that had been formed to bring down the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt; However, in 1792, when the Confederates' won, Kołłątaj emigrated to [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], where in 1793 he wrote, with [[Ignacy Potocki]], an essay entitled, ''On the Adoption and Fall of the Polish May 3 Constitution''.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt;

===Exile and final years===
[[File:Huga Kałantaj. Гуга Калантай (J. Pfeiffer, 1810).jpg|thumb|upright|Kołłątaj, by Jan Pfeiffer, 1810]] 
In exile, his political views became more radical and he became involved with the preparation for an insurrection.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt; In 1794 he took part in the [[Kościuszko Uprising]], contributing to its ''Uprising Act'' on 24 March 1794 and to the [[Proclamation of Połaniec|Połaniec Manifesto]] on 7 May 1794. He headed the [[Supreme National Council]]'s [[Treasury]] Department, and backing the Uprising's wing of [[Polish Jacobins]].&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; After the suppression of the Uprising in the same year, Kołłątaj was imprisoned by the Austrians until 1802.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt; In 1805, with [[Tadeusz Czacki]], he organized the [[Krzemieniec Lyceum]] in Volhynia.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; In 1807, after the creation of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], he was initially involved in its government,&lt;ref name=kai/&gt; but was soon excluded from it through the intrigues of political opponents, and soon afterwards, was interned and imprisoned by the Russian authorities until 1808.&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; On his release he found himself barred from public office. Despite that he sought to present a programme for rebuilding and developing Poland in his "Remarks on the Present Position of That Part of the Polish Lands that, since the Treaty of Tilsit, have come to be called the Duchy of Warsaw", (1809).&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt; In 1809 he became a member of the [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning]]. In the years 1809-1810 he was once again involved with the Kraków Academy, bringing it back from its temporarily [[Germanized]] form.&lt;ref name=aj/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-194"/&gt;
[[Image:Hugo kollataj pomnik park jordana krakow.jpg|thumb|upright|Kołłątaj, [[Jordan Park]], [[Kraków]]]]

In his ''The Physico-Moral Order'' (1811), Kołłątaj sought to create a socio-ethical system emphasizing the [[Social equality|equality]] of all people, based on the [[physiocratic]] idea of a "physico-moral order".&lt;ref name="interia"/&gt; Steeped in the [[natural sciences]], [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]] in particular, he went on to write ''A Critical Analysis of Historical Principles regarding the Origins of Humankind'', published posthumously in 1842. &lt;ref name="SokolKissane1992"/&gt; In this work he put forward the first Polish presentation of ideas of social [[evolution]] based on [[geological]] concepts. This work is also seen as an important contribution to [[cultural anthropology]].&lt;ref name=interia/&gt; In ''The State of Education in Poland in the Final Years of the Reign of Augustus III'', published posthumously in 1841, he argued against the [[Jesuit]] domination of education and presented a study of the [[history of education]].&lt;ref name=interia/&gt;

He died on 28 February 1812,"forgotten and abandoned" by his contemporaries.&lt;ref name=kai/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt; He was buried in the [[Powązki Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=kai/&gt;

==Remembrance==
Despite his lonely death, Kołłątaj became an influence on many subsequent reformers and is now recognised as one of the key figures of the [[Enlightenment in Poland]], and "one of the greatest minds of his epoch".&lt;ref name=WIEM/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKIEducation1996"/&gt; He is one of the figures immortalized in [[Jan Matejko]]'s 1891 painting, ''[[Constitution of May 3, 1791 (painting)|Constitution of May 3, 1791]].''

Several learned institutions in Poland are named in Hugo Kołłątaj's honour, including the [[Agricultural University of Cracow]] of which he was co-founder and patron.

'''Jang Heunghyo''' (1564–1633) was one of the principal scholars of [[Neo-Confucianism in Korea]] in the early 17th century, active in the [[Gyeongbuk]] province.
He was one of the main representatives of the second generation of scholars of the [[Yi Hwang|Toegye]] school.
His life and the development of his philosophy are well-documented thanks to his lifelong practice of keeping a [[diary]].

'''Jules de Gaultier''' (born in 1858 in Paris, died in 1942 in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]), born '''Jules Achille de Gaultier de Laguionie''', was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and essayist. He was a contributor to ''Mercure de France'' and one of the chief advocates of "[[nietzscheism]]" in vogue in the literary circles of the day. He was known especially for his theory of "[[bovarysme]]" (the name taken from Flaubert's novel), by which he meant the continual need of humans to invent themselves, to lie to themselves. His books include ''De Kant à Nietzsche'' (1900) and ''Le Bovarysme, essai sur le pouvoir d'imaginer'' (1902).&lt;ref&gt;Le Petit Robert 2, S.E.P.R.E.T. (Paris), 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krystyn Lach Szyrma''' (17 December 1790 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1866, [[Devonport, Devon]]) was a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Warsaw University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a writer, journalist, translator and political activist.

==Life==
Szyrma was professor of philosophy at [[Warsaw University]] from 1824 to 1831. He left no philosophical writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szyrma was one of nearly all the university professors of philosophy in Poland before the [[November Uprising|November 1830–31 Uprising]] who held a position that shunned both [[Positivism]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation, affined to the [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Scottish philosophers]] but linked in certain respects to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian critique.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milan Komar''', also known as '''Emilio Komar''' (4 June 1921 – 20 January 2006) was a [[Argentines of Slovene descent|Slovene Argentine]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[philosopher]] and [[essayist]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], to a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] family who had emigrated from the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italian]]-occupied [[Julian March]]. His father, Ludvik was a retired officer of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. Milan spent his childhood in Ljubljana and [[Škofja Loka]], and in 1939 he enrolled in the [[University of Ljubljana]] where he studied law. He specialized in [[Canonical law]] and continued his studies at the [[University of Turin]], where he graduated in 1942. He first developed an interest in philosophy in Ljubljana, under the supervision of the Slovenian [[Neothomism|Neo-thomist]] thinker [[Aleš Ušeničnik]] and the [[White Emigre|Russian émigré]] [[Eugeni Vasilievitch Spektorsky]] (1875-1951), who thought [[philosophy of law]] at the University of Ljubljana. He further developed his philosophical knowledge in [[Turin]] under the influence of [[Giuseppe Gemellaro]] and [[Carlo Mazzantini]]. In those years, he also discovered the thought of [[France|French]] [[Personalism|personalists]] such as [[Jacques Maritain]] and [[Emmanuel Mounier]]. He was also influenced by the political writings of [[Luigi Sturzo]] which were then circulating in the Catholic [[anti-Fascist]] underground.

Already as a student in Ljubljana, he became involved in a [[integralism|Catholic integralist]] youth group, organized within the Slovenian [[Catholic Action]]. This group, called ''Borci'' ("Fighters", after their internal journal, ''Mi mladi borci'', that is "We, young fighters") had an [[anti-Communist]] ideology. To them, [[Communism]] was the greatest danger to humanity; nevertheless, they insisted to fight it on a cultural, intellectual and artistic field, rejecting both direct political engagement and armed struggle.

After the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Capitulation of Italy]] in September 1943, Komar returned to [[Slovenia]], which was then occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. In the [[Slovenian Littoral]], he joined the [[Slovenian National Defense Corps]] (''Slovenski narodno varstveni zbor'' – SNVZ), a small [[collaborationist]] militia, closely affiliated  to the [[Slovene Home Guard]], which fought against the [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan resistance]] in the [[Julian March]]. Until 1945, he worked in the section for propaganda and culture, and helped to establish several cultural institutions (journals, publishing houses, schools) throughout the [[Goriška]] region. In May 1945, he withdrew to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]-occupied Northern [[Italy]] in order to escape [[Communist]] persecution. From there he emigrated to [[Argentina]] in 1948.

He settled in [[Buenos Aires]], where he spent most of his later life. Initially, he worked as a manual worker in a glass factory, studying for the [[habilitation]] exam in philosophy and [[pedagogy]]. In the late 1940s, he started teaching philosophy and [[classical languages]] in different high schools, and later philosophy and pedagogy at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. In 1959, started teaching history of modern philosophy at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]]. From 1981 to 1982, he was dean of the Faculty for Philosophy at the same university. He retired from his teaching position in 1998.

During his time in [[emigration]], he started to publish essays in the local [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], as well as [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-language press. Nevertheless, he became famous especially as a teacher and a pedagogue and the so-called "Komar School" developed around him. In 1992, pope [[John Paul II]] gave him the insignia of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]]. He spent the last decades of his life in the town of [[Boulogne Sur Mer, Buenos Aires|Boulogne sur Mer]] in the [[Buenos Aires Province]]. He died at the age of 84 in the Argentine town of [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires|San Isidro]] and was buried in the [[Žale]] Cemetery in his native [[Ljubljana]].

Komar was a [[polyglot (person)|polyglot]]: he was fluent in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]; he read also in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

==Thought==

He started as an expert on the Rationalist philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and later turned to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]. He was an attentive critic of modern [[Immanence|immanentist]] philosophy, which drew him closer to certain aspect of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], especially the current represented by [[Edith Stein]]. He was also strongly influenced by the thought of the Spanish philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Miguel de Unamuno]]. He later developed an interest in [[psychology]], particularly [[Sigmund Freud]], to whom he kept a respectful disaccord, and [[Erik Erikson]].

He was also influenced by [[Non-conformists of the 1930s|non-conformist]] Catholic thinkers such as [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Georges Bernanos]], but he always remained connected to the [[Neo-Scholasticism|Neo-Scholastic]] tradition, best exemplified by the thought of [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Josef Pieper]]. In the mid 1960s, he developed a strong intellectual and personal friendship with the Italian philosopher and political scientist [[Augusto Del Noce]], whom he regarded as his "spiritual brother". Together with him and with the [[Poland|Polish]] philosopher [[Stefan Swieżawski]], he started to work on his uncompleted life project, namely the reperiodization of modern philosophy.

During the [[Communist]] regime, all his writings were prohibited in [[Slovenia]]; they were first published in the early 1990s, but his influence is still stronger in [[Latin America]], in [[Spain]] and in [[Italy]] than in his native country.

In the [[philosophy of science]], '''models of scientific inquiry''' have two functions: first, to provide a descriptive account of ''how'' scientific inquiry is carried out in practice, and second, to provide an explanatory account of ''why'' scientific inquiry succeeds as well as it appears to do in arriving at genuine knowledge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The search for scientific knowledge ends far back into antiquity.  At some point in the past, at least by the time of Aristotle, philosophers recognized that a fundamental distinction should be drawn between two kinds of scientific knowledge—roughly, knowledge ''that'' and knowledge ''why''.  It is one thing to know ''that'' each planet periodically reverses the direction of its motion with respect to the background of fixed stars;  it is quite a different matter to know ''why''.  Knowledge of the former type is descriptive;  knowledge of the latter type is explanatory.  It is explanatory knowledge that provides scientific understanding of the world.  (Salmon, 2006, pg. 3)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work."&lt;ref name=NRC-1996/&gt;

==Accounts of scientific inquiry==

===Classical model===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from [[Aristotle]], who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Pragmatic model===
{{main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}

===Logical empiricism===
[[Wesley Salmon]] (1989)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt; began his historical survey of scientific explanation with what he called the ''received view'', as it was received from [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] in the years beginning with their ''Studies in the Logic of Explanation'' (1948) and culminating in Hempel's ''[[Aspects of Scientific Explanation and other Essays in the Philosophy of Science|Aspects of Scientific Explanation]]'' (1965).  Salmon summed up his analysis of these developments by means of the following Table.

{| class="wikitable" align="center" style="text-align:center; width:90%"
|-
! Laws / Explananda !! Particular Facts !! General Regularities
|-
! Universal Laws
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
| D-N

Deductive-Nomological
|-
! Statistical Laws
| I-S

Inductive-Statistical
| D-S

Deductive-Statistical
|}

In this classification, a [[deductive-nomological]] (D-N) explanation of an occurrence is a valid deduction whose conclusion states that the outcome to be explained did in fact occur.  The deductive argument is called an ''explanation'', its premisses are called the ''explanans'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''explaining'') and the conclusion is called the ''explanandum'' ([[Latin|L:]] ''to be explained'').  Depending on a number of additional qualifications, an explanation may be ranked on a scale from ''potential'' to ''true''.

Not all explanations in science are of the D-N type, however.  An ''inductive-statistical'' (I-S) explanation accounts for an occurrence by subsuming it under statistical laws, rather than categorical or universal laws, and the mode of subsumption is itself inductive instead of deductive.  The D-N type can be seen as a limiting case of the more general I-S type, the measure of certainty involved being complete, or [[probability]] 1, in the former case, whereas it is less than complete, probability &amp;lt; 1, in the latter case.

In this view, the D-N mode of reasoning, in addition to being used to explain particular occurrences, can also be used to explain general regularities, simply by deducing them from still more general laws.

Finally, the ''deductive-statistical'' (D-S) type of explanation, properly regarded as a subclass of the D-N type, explains statistical regularities by deduction from more comprehensive statistical laws.  (Salmon 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

Such was the ''received view'' of scientific explanation from the point of view of [[logical empiricism]], that Salmon says "held sway" during the third quarter of the last century (Salmon, p.&amp;nbsp;10)&lt;ref name=Salmon_FourDecades/&gt;.

==Choice of a theory==
{{See also|Commensurability (philosophy of science)}}
During the course of history, one theory has succeeded another, and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena. The reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple. The philosophy of science includes the question: ''What criteria are satisfied by a 'good' theory''. This question has a long history, and many scientists, as well as philosophers, have considered it. The objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn/&gt; Several often proposed criteria were summarized by Colyvan.&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; A good theory:
# Is elegant (Formal elegance; no ''ad hoc'' modifications)
# Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements (simplicity/parsimony)
# Agrees with and explains all existing observations (unificatory/[[explanatory power]])
# Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can [[disprove]] or [[falsify]] the model if they are not borne out.
# Is fruitful: the emphasis by Colyvan is not only upon prediction and falsification, but also upon a theory's [[wikt:seminality|seminality]] in suggesting future work.

[[Stephen Hawking]] supports items 1–4, but does not mention fruitfulness.&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; On the other hand, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of seminality.&lt;ref name=Kuhn0/&gt;

The goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary. Nonetheless, these criteria contain subjective elements, and are [[heuristics]] rather than part of [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; Also, criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories. Quoting Bird:&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;
{{quote|"They [such criteria]  cannot determine scientific choice. First, which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable (''e.g.'' does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form?). Secondly, these criteria are imprecise, and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold. Thirdly, there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another, especially when they conflict." |Alexander Bird|Methodological incommensurability}}

It also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria, which may represent goals not yet achieved. For example, explanatory power over all existing observations (criterion 3) is satisfied by no one theory at the moment.&lt;ref name=Realism/&gt;
{{quote|Whatever might be the ultimate goals of some scientists, science, as it is currently practiced, depends on multiple overlapping descriptions of the world, each of which has a domain of applicability. In some cases this domain is very large, but in others quite small.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;|E.B. Davies |Epistemological pluralism, p. 4}}

The [[wikt:desiderata|desiderata]] of a "good" theory have been debated for centuries, going back perhaps even earlier than [[Occam's razor]],&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt; which often is taken as an attribute of a good theory. Occam's razor might fall under the heading of "elegance", the first item on the list, but too zealous an application was cautioned by [[Albert Einstein]]: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt; It is arguable that ''parsimony'' and ''elegance'' "typically pull in different directions".&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;   The falsifiability item on the list is related to the criterion proposed by Popper as demarcating a scientific theory from a theory like astrology: both "explain" observations, but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong:&lt;ref name=Popper1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popper0/&gt;
{{quote|"It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."
"Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science."
|Karl Popper|The logic of scientific discovery, p. 18 and p. 280}}
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice which result in [[paradigm shift]]s.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2/&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the [[heliocentric]] "[[Copernican Revolution]]" replaced the [[geocentric]] views of [[Ptolemy]] not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.

==Aspects of scientific inquiry==

===Deduction and induction===
[[Deductive logic]] and [[inductive logic]] are quite different in their approaches.

'''Deductive logic''' is the reasoning of proof, or [[Logical consequence|logical implication]]. It is the logic used in mathematics and other [[axiomatic system]]s such as formal logic. In a deductive system, there will be [[axiom]]s (postulates) which are not proven. Indeed, they cannot be proven without circularity. There will also be primitive terms which are not defined, as they cannot be defined without circularity. For example, one can define a line as a set of points, but to then define a point as the intersection of two lines would be circular. Because of these interesting characteristics of [[formal system]]s, Bertrand Russell humorously referred to mathematics as "the field where we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether or not what we say is true". All theorems and corollaries are proven by exploring the implications of the axiomata and other theorems that have previously been developed. New terms are defined using the primitive terms and other derived definitions based on those primitive terms.

In a deductive system, one can correctly use the term "proof", as applying to a theorem. To say that a theorem is proven means that it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. For example, we could do a simple [[syllogism]] such as the following:

# [[Arches National Park]] lies within the state of [[Utah]].
# I am standing in Arches National Park.
# Therefore, I am standing in the state of Utah.

Notice that it is not possible (assuming all of the trivial qualifying criteria are supplied) to be in Arches and not be in Utah. However, one can be in Utah while not in Arches National Park. The implication only works in one direction. Statements (1) and (2) taken together imply statement (3). Statement (3) does not imply anything about statements (1) or (2). Notice that we have not proven statement (3), but we have shown that statements (1) and (2) together imply statement (3). In mathematics, what is proven is not the truth of a particular theorem, but that the axioms of the system imply the theorem. In other words, it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. The strength of deductive systems is that they are sure of their results. The weakness is that they are abstract constructs which are, unfortunately, one step removed from the physical world. They are very useful, however, as mathematics has provided great insights into natural science by providing useful models of natural phenomena. One result is the development of products and processes that benefit mankind.

Learning about the physical world requires the use of '''inductive logic'''. This is the logic of theory building. It is useful in such widely divergent enterprises as science and crime scene detective work. One makes a set of observations, and seeks to explain what one sees. The observer forms a hypothesis in an attempt to explain what he/she has observed. The hypothesis will have implications, which will point to certain other observations that would naturally result from either a repeat of the experiment or making more observations from a slightly different set of circumstances. If the predicted observations hold true, one feels excitement that they may be on the right track. However, the hypothesis has not been proven. The hypothesis implies that certain observations should follow, but positive observations do not imply the hypothesis. They only make it more believable. It is quite possible that some other hypothesis could also account for the known observations, and may do better with future experiments. The implication flows in only one direction, as in the syllogism used in the discussion on deduction. Therefore, it is never correct to say that a scientific principle or hypothesis/theory has been proven. (At least, not in the rigorous sense of proof used in deductive systems.)

A classic example of this is the study of gravitation. Newton formed a law for gravitation stating that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For over 170 years, all observations seemed to validate his equation. However, telescopes eventually became powerful enough to see a slight discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury. Scientists tried everything imaginable to explain the discrepancy, but they could not do so using the objects that would bear on the orbit of Mercury. Eventually, Einstein developed his theory of [[general relativity]] and it explained the orbit of Mercury and all other known observations dealing with gravitation. During the long period of time when scientists were making observations that seemed to validate Newton's theory, they did not, in fact, prove his theory to be true. However, it must have seemed at the time that they did. It only took one counterexample (Mercury's orbit) to prove that there was something wrong with his theory.

This is typical of inductive logic. All of the observations that seem to validate the theory, do not prove its truth. But one counter-example can prove it false.  That means that deductive logic is used in the evaluation of a theory.  In other words, if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been supported by many observations using the best scientific instruments and experiments. However, his theory now has the same status as Newton's theory of gravitation prior to seeing the problems in the orbit of Mercury. It is highly credible and validated with all we know, but it is not proven. It is only the best we have at this point in time.

Another example of correct scientific reasoning is shown in the current search for the [[Higgs boson]].  Scientists on the [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] have conducted experiments yielding data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. However, realizing that the results could possibly be explained as a background fluctuation and not the Higgs boson, they are cautious and waiting for further data from future experiments.  Said Guido Tonelli:

{{Quote|"We cannot exclude the presence of the [[Standard Model]] Higgs between 115 and 127 [[GeV]] because of a modest excess of events in this mass region that appears, quite consistently, in five independent channels [...] As of today what we see is consistent either with a background fluctuation or with the presence of the boson."}}

A brief overview of the '''scientific method''' would then contain these steps as a minimum:

# Make a set of observations regarding the phenomenon being studied.
# Form a hypothesis that might explain the observations.  (Inductive Step)
# Identify the implications and outcomes that must follow, if the hypothesis is to be true.
# Perform other experiments or observations to see if any of the predicted outcomes fail.
# If any predicted outcomes fail, the hypothesis is proven false since if A implies B, then not B implies not A.  (Deductive Logic)  It is then necessary to change the hypothesis and go back to step 3.  If the predicted outcomes are confirmed, the hypothesis is not proved, but rather can be said to be consistent with known data.

When a hypothesis has survived a sufficient number of tests, it may be promoted to a [[scientific theory]].  A theory is a hypothesis that has survived many tests and seems to be consistent with other established scientific theories.  Since a theory is a promoted hypothesis, it is of the same 'logical' species and shares the same logical limitations.  Just as a hypothesis cannot be proven but can be disproved, that same is true for a theory.  It is a difference of degree, not kind.

'''Arguments from analogy''' are another type of inductive reasoning. In arguing from analogy, one infers that since two things are alike in several respects, they are likely to be alike in another respect. This is, of course, an assumption. It is natural to attempt to find similarities between two phenomena and wonder what one can learn from those similarities. However, to notice that two things share attributes in several respects does not imply any similarities in other respects. It is possible that the observer has already noticed all of the attributes that are shared and any other attributes will be distinct. Argument from analogy is an unreliable method of reasoning that can lead to erroneous conclusions, and thus cannot be used to establish scientific facts.

The '''Network of Spiritual Progressives''' (NSP) is an international political and [[social justice]] movement based in the [[United States]] that seeks to influence [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] towards more humane, [[Progressivism|progressive]] values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=20495|author=Kirkwood, Peter|title=Rabbi takes on Religious Right|publisher=Eureka Street|date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v23n4p16.htm|author=Spencer, Metta|title=Progressive Spirit: A Conversation with Rabbi Michael Lerner|publisher=Peace Magazine|date=Oct–Dec 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also challenges what it perceives as the misuse of religion by political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and the anti-religious attitudes of many [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060424/lerner|author=Lerner, Michael|title=Bringing God Into It|publisher=The Nation|date=April 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the international sphere, the NSP seeks to foster [[Religious pluralism|inter-religious understanding]] and work for social justice.

The NSP was founded in 2005 by [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Rabbi Michael Lerner]], who serves as co-director of the organization with [[Cornel West]] and [[Joan Chittister|Sister Joan Chittister]]. More than 1,200 activists attended each of the group's conferences in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] (July 2005) and [[Washington, D.C.]] (May 2006).

As of December 2007, the NSP had chapters in 31 states as well as [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada; [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]; and in [[Costa Rica]].

==Basic tenets==
The Network of Spiritual Progressives was founded based on three basic tenets:

* Changing the bottom line in America.
* Challenging the misuse of religion, God and spirit by the [[Religious Right]].
* Challenging the many anti-religious and anti-spiritual assumptions and behaviors that have increasingly become part of the [[Liberalism|liberal culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritualprogressives.org/article.php/tenets|title=Our Mission|publisher=Network of Spiritual Progressives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5543">'''New realism''' was a [[philosophy]] expounded in the early 20th century by a group of six US based scholars, namely [[Edwin Holt|Edwin Bissell Holt]] ([[Harvard University]]), [[Walter Taylor Marvin]] ([[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]]), [[William Pepperell Montague]] ([[Columbia University]]), [[Ralph Barton Perry]] (Harvard), [[Walter B. Pitkin|Walter Boughton Pitkin]] (Columbia) and [[Edward Gleason Spaulding]] ([[Princeton University]]).

==Overview==
The central feature of the new realism was a rejection of the [[epistemological dualism]] of [[John Locke]] and of older forms of realism. The group maintained that, when one is conscious of, or knows, an object, it is an error to say that the object in itself and our knowledge of the object are two distinct facts. If we know a particular cow is black, is the blackness on that cow or in the observer's mind? Holt wrote: "That color out there is the thing in [[consciousness]] selected for such inclusion by the [[nervous system]]'s specific response." Consciousness is not physically identical with the [[nervous system]]: it is "out there" with the cow, all throughout the field of sight (and smell, and hearing) and identical with the set of facts it knows at any moment. The nervous system is merely a system of selection.

This position, which belongs to a broader category of views sometimes called [[neutral monism]] or, following [[William James]], [[radical empiricism]], has not worn well over the subsequent century, partly because of the problem of the nature of abstract ideas such as blackness. It seems very natural to locate blackness as an abstract idea in the mind that's useful in dealing with the world. The new realists did not want to acknowledge [[representationalism]] at all but later embraced something akin to Aristotle's form of realism: blackness is a general quality that many objects have in common, and the nervous system selects not just the object but the commonality as a fact. But [[Arthur Lovejoy]] showed in his book ''[[The Revolt Against Dualism]]'' that the perception of black varies so much, depending on context in the visual field, the perceiver's personal history and cultural usage, that it cannot be reduced to commonalities within objects. Better, Lovejoy thought, to bring representational ideas back into the account after all.

==New realism (contemporary philosophy)&lt;!--New realism (contemporary philosophy)' redirects here--&gt;==
In the framework of [[Continental philosophy|continental]] [[hermeneutics]], as a reaction against its constructivist or nihilistic outcomes, [[Maurizio Ferraris]] has proposed the so-called '''new realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''Manifesto del nuovo realismo'', 2012), a philosophical orientation shared by both analytic philosophers (such as Mario De Caro, see Bentornata Realtà, ed. by De Caro and Ferraris, 2012), and [[continental philosopher]]s, such as [[Mauricio Beuchot]] (''Manifesto del realismo analogico'', 2013), and [[Markus Gabriel]] (''Fields of Sense: A New Realist Ontology'', 2014). In South America [[:pt:Rossano Pecoraro|Rossano Pecoraro]] (''Cenários da Filosofia contemporânea: fim da pós-modernidade e new realism?'', São Paulo, 2015; ''Cosa resta della Filosofia Contemporanea?'', Salerno-Roma, 2013) propose a political philosophy based on the Italian New Realism. (New realism intersects with other realistic continental movements that arose independently but responding to similar needs, such as the "[[speculative realism]]" defended by the French philosopher [[Quentin Meillassoux]] and the American philosopher [[Graham Harman]].)

For new realism, the assumption that science is not systematically the ultimate measure of truth and reality does not mean that we should abandon the notions of reality, truth or objectivity, as was posited by much of twentieth century philosophy. Rather, it means that philosophy, as well as jurisprudence, linguistics or history, has something important and true to say about the world. In this context, new realism presents itself primarily as a negative realism: the resistance that the outside world poses to our conceptual schemes should not be seen as a failure, but as a resource – a proof of the existence of an independent world. If this is the case, however, this negative realism turns into a positive realism: in resisting us reality does not merely set a limit we cannot trespass, but it also offers opportunities and resources. This explains how, in the natural world, different life-forms can interact in the same environment without sharing any conceptual scheme and how, in the social world, human intentions and behaviors are made possible by a reality that is first given, and that only at a later time may be interpreted and, if necessary, transformed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1677">The '''Office for Legal Complaints''' ('''OLC''') is the board of the [[Legal Ombudsman]], the free service that investigates complaints about [[lawyers]] in [[England and Wales]].

The OLC was established by the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]. The [[Legal Services Board]], a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Ministry of Justice]], appoints the OLC's members. 

==Objectives==
The OLC ensures that they and the Legal Ombudsman promote the regulatory objectives set out in the Act, which are: 

* protecting and promoting the public interest;
* supporting the constitutional principle of law;
* improving access to justice;
* protecting and promoting the interests of consumers;
* promoting competition in the provision of services;
* encouraging an independent, strong, diverse and effective legal profession;
* increasing public understanding of the citizen's legal rights and duties; and
* promoting and maintaining adherence to the professional principles

==Members==
The OLC has eight members, including Steve Green, the chair. It meets regularly and has created two committees to help it fulfil its role. The first is the Audit and Risk Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the Legal Ombudsman's risk management processes, governance and financial control framework. The second is the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, which is responsible for overseeing, among other things, the terms of employment of Legal Ombudsman staff.

===Previous members===
Previous OLC members included:
* Elizabeth France Chair from 2009 - 2014;
* Margaret Doyle;
* Mary Seneviratne;
* Brian Woods-Scawen;

This publication prompted criticism in [[Lenin]]'s ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]''. By the 1920s Yushkevich abandoned political activities and worked at the [[Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute|Marx-Engels Institute]] in Moscow from 1922.

==Early years==
He attended Odessa High School, where he became active in a Marxist [[study circle]].&lt;ref name=Rumy/&gt; He was arrested and jailed, however, before being sent to exile in [[Kishinev]], where he showed particular interest in [[mathematics]]. He went into exile in France and studied mathematics at the [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]]. Upon graduation he returned to Odessa. Here he had to attend lectures to gain a qualification recognised in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ermolavae|title=Prehistory of Seminars at St Petersburg,/Petrograd/Leningrad University|journal=Proceedings of the St. Petersburg Mathematical Society|date=2000|volume=199|issue=2|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=djZsHCsRo2wC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=%22P.+S.+Yushkevich%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PDSBUjBCTw&amp;sig=WTGXSKvXuiltAuCIkofgDJ7L_XM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitsunJsfbWAhVKtBoKHTz5AnsQ6AEIXDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22P.%20S.%20Yushkevich%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a journalist.

==Philosophical work==
Yushkevich saw no need for Marxism to be fearful of "bourgeois theories", claiming that if Marxism was as powerful as it purported to be, it would simply assimilate other theories rather than be assimilated by them.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chris|first1=Read|title=Religion, Revolution and the Russian Intelligentsia 1900–1912: The Vekhi Debate and its Intellectual Background|date=1979|publisher=Macmillan Press|location=London|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gPCxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=P.S.+Yushkevich&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FdrHVhGb2N&amp;sig=Z0Hpf0qXMizeVDB8GKnzQi0kmSo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIgP6ZrPbWAhXFChoKHXztAhgQ6AEITDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=P.S.%20Yushkevich&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2261">Philosophers throughout the [[history of philosophy]] have been held in courts and tribunals for various offenses, often as a result of their philosophical activity, and some have even been put to death.  The most famous example of a philosopher being put on trial is the case of [[Socrates]], who was tried for, amongst other charges, corrupting the youth and impiety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/socratestrial/f/SocratesCharge.htm "What Was the Charge Against Socrates?"] Retrieved September 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socrates==
The [[trial of Socrates]] took place in 399 BC.  Attended by the Ancient Greek philosophers [[Plato]] (who was a student of Socrates') and [[Xenophon]], it resulted in the death of Socrates, who was sentenced to drink the poison [[conium|hemlock]].  The trial is chronicled in the Platonic dialogues ''[[Euthyphro]]'', ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', and ''[[Phaedo]]''.

==Giordano Bruno==
[[Giordano Bruno]] was a famous Italian philosopher and astronomer who was well known as a proponent of [[heliocentrism]] and the infinity of the universe. He held that the sun was one amongst an infinite number of stars.  Due to his [[pantheism]], heretical and controversial views, he was [[burned at the stake]] by the [[Roman Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_kessler/giordano_bruno.html "Giordano Bruno: The Forgotten Philosopher"] Retrieved September 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tommaso Campanella==
[[Tommaso Campanella]] was confined to a [[convent]] for his heretical views, namely, an opposition to the authority of [[Aristotle]].  Later, he then spent twenty-seven years imprisoned in a castle during which he wrote his most famous works, including ''[[The City of the Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/campanella/#Year "Tommaso Campanella" - first published Wed Aug 31, 2005" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baruch Spinoza==
[[Baruch Spinoza]], a Jewish philosopher, was [[excommunicated]] from the Nation of Israel for his pantheistic views of God and his claim that God is part of a deterministic system.

'''Petre Țuțea''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈpetre ˈt͡sut͡se̯a|lang}}; 6 October 1902 – 3 December 1991) was a Romanian philosopher, journalist and economist.

== Biography ==

=== Early years: from Marxism to the Legionary Movement ===

Petre Țuțea was born in the village of [[Boteni]], Muscel region (now in [[Argeş County]]). His father, Petre Bădescu, was a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] priest and his mother, Ana Țuțea, was of peasant stock. After the First World War, Țuțea left his village to finish high school in Cluj and went on to study law at the [[University of Cluj]]. After graduating, he obtained a PhD in Administrative Law, also at the University of Cluj.&lt;ref name="faradzeu"&gt;[http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?data=2000-08-02&amp;id=48014 ""Fara Dumnezeu omul devine un animal rational, care vine de nicaieri si merge spre nicaieri"], ''Ziua'', 2 August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Petre Țuțea  moved to Bucharest and in 1932 he founded, together with [[Petre Pandrea]],&lt;ref name="intredzeu"&gt;Petre Țuțea, ''Între Dumnezeu și Neamul meu'', Fundația Anastasia, Bucharest, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; a leftist newspaper, "Stânga" ("The Left"),&lt;ref name="Popescu, p. xxii"&gt;Popescu, p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; that was quickly and forcefully closed by the government. According to an anecdote told by [[Emil Cioran]], Țuțea once went to a newspapers stand and bought the Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' despite not being able to read [[Russian language|Russian]], then kissed it, showing his appreciation for [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=222&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=8289 "Rusia, «cealaltă» Europă – interviu cu Georges NIVAT"], ''[[Dilema Veche]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, later in life, he would change his political views, departing from the Marxism&lt;ref name="Gilder"&gt;Eric Gilder, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3818/is_200804/ai_n25501544 Review: "Petre Tutea: Between Sacrifice and Suicide"], ''Anglican Theological Review'', Spring 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and later became a devout [[Orthodox Christian]].&lt;ref name="faradzeu"/&gt;

In 1935 Țuțea and four other writers published a nationalist program of economic and social development, "Manifestul revoluției naționale" ("Manifesto for a National Revolution").&lt;ref name="Popescu, p. xxii"/&gt; Around the same time he met the influential philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]] and wrote for his famous newspaper "Cuvântul" along with [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Radu Gyr]], [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], [[Mihail Sebastian]] and other known writers.

Țuțea was a member of the [[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]] literary society and, like many other fellow members, became a sympathizer of the [[Iron Guard]], a right-wing, ultra-nationalist organization.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Petreu, ''An Infamous Past: E.M. Cioran and the Rise of Fascism in Romania'', Ivan R. Dee, Publisher; 2005; {{ISBN|1-56663-607-8}} p.60&lt;/ref&gt; According to various published interviews, at that time Țuțea reckoned that democracy would have not guaranteed the sovereignty of the Romanian people.&lt;ref name="intredzeu"/&gt; He also noted that many Romanian intellectuals had supported the Legionnaires, because "their radical position against the harmful influence of Russian [[Bolshevism]]", which he considered to be "controlled by Jews" (see ''[[Judeo-Bolshevism]]'').&lt;ref name="intredzeu"/&gt; Speaking of the Iron Guard, he notes the main difference between this organization and [[Fascism]] or [[National Socialism]] was its avowed Christian character.&lt;ref name="intredzeu"/&gt;

Between 1936 and 1939, he was a director in the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in charge of the ''Office of Economics Publications and Propaganda'', then, he was a director of the research office in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. As the [[National Legionary State]] was proclaimed in 1940, he was a member of the Romanian delegation to [[Moscow]] for economic negotiations. He returned after the [[National Legionary State]] was abolished (after January 1941).&lt;ref name="Popescu, p. xxiii"&gt;Popescu, p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war against the Soviet Union began, he asked to be sent to the front, but his request was refused.&lt;ref name="intredzeu"/&gt; He worked as a director in the Ministry of War Economy and after 23 August 1944, a director of studies in the Ministry of National Economy.&lt;ref name="Popescu, p. xxiii"/&gt;

=== Communist era ===

Țuțea was arrested by the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] in 1949, and was sent, without a trial, to "re-education" (euphemism for forced labor) at [[Ocnele Mari]] state prison.&lt;ref name="Popescu, p. xxiv"&gt;Popescu, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 1953 and, unable to find work, he lived with friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Popescu, p. xxiv"/&gt; Arrested again in 1956, he was tried for "Conspiracy against the State"&lt;ref name="Gilder"/&gt; (common charge against political rivals at the time).  He was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years of hard labor, of which he served 8 years in various prisons, ending up in the infamous [[Aiud prison]].
 
After the release of all political prisoners in 1964, Petre Țuțea became famous as a [[Socrates|Socratic]] type of philosopher. He also started to write books and essays, created an original dramatic form, "Theater as Seminar" and produced a philosophical manifesto, "The Philosophy of Nuances" (1969). Due to censorship very little of his work could be published and virtually nothing appeared after 1972. Under permanent observation, Țuțea had many of his manuscripts confiscated by the Romanian secret police, the [[Securitate]]. In the late 1980s he started working on a massive unfinished project in five volumes, "Man, a Christian Treatise of Anthropology".

=== After the revolution ===

After the [[Romanian Revolution]], Țuțea was embraced by Romanian intellectuals,&lt;ref name="Gilder"/&gt; receiving frequent requests from journalists and TV crews for interviews while living for one year with a student in theology, [[Radu Preda]]. Țuțea spent the last year of his life in a Christian hospice, "Christiana".  He died in Bucharest at age 89 before seeing any of his books published.

A very popular book (sold in more than 70,000 copies) is ''322 de vorbe memorabile'', a collection of [[aphorism]]s taken from various interviews, ordered alphabetically. In these interviews Țuțea adopted a hyperbolic, rhetorical style and the editor's choices included several controversial topics, such as [[atheism]], [[Communism]] and [[Anti-Semitism]]. He generally adopts a hardline Orthodox Christian point-of-view, being critical of various groups, including [[atheism|atheists]] (whom he names "[[weasel]]s"), [[Communism|communists]] (naming communism a "social cancer") and [[Jews]] (whom he finds responsible for the existence of [[Anti-Semitism]]).&lt;ref&gt;''322 de vorbe memorabile ale lui Petre Țuțea'', [[Editura Humanitas]] Bucharest, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12498">The '''role of chance, or''' "'''[[luck]]'''", '''in science''' comprises all ways in which unexpected discoveries are made.

Many domains, especially psychology, are concerned with the way science interacts with chance — particularly "[[serendipity]]" (accidents that, through sagacity, are transformed into opportunity). Psychologist Kevin Dunbar and colleagues estimate that between 30% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are accidental in some sense (see [[#Serendipitous discoveries|examples below]]).&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

Psychologist Alan A. Baumeister says a scientist must be "sagacious" (attentive and clever) to benefit from an accident.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt; Dunbar quotes [[Louis Pasteur]]'s saying that "Chance favors only the prepared mind".&lt;ref&gt;Oersted vit tout à coup (par hasard, direz-vous peut-être, mais souvenez-vous que, dans les champs de l'observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprits préparés), il vit tout à coup l'aiguille se mouvoir et prendre une position très différente de celle que lui assigne le magnétisme terrestre.&lt;/ref&gt; The prepared mind, Dunbar suggests, is one trained for observational rigor. Dunbar adds that there is a great deal of writing about the role that serendipity ("happy accidents") plays in the scientific method.&lt;ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck&gt;Dunbar, K., &amp; Fugelsang, J. (2005). Causal thinking in science: How scientists and students interpret the unexpected. In M. E. Gorman, R. D. Tweney, D. Gooding &amp; A. Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and Technological Thinking (pp. 57–79). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darden, L. (1997). Strategies for discovering mechanisms: Schema instantiation, modular subassembly, forward chaining/backtracking. Proceedings of the 1997 Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, P. (1999). How Scientists Explain Disease.

Cognitive Science, 12, 139–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that scientists are taught various [[heuristics]] and practices that allow their investigations to benefit, and not suffer, from accidents.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"&gt;Oliver, J.E. (1991) Ch2. of The incomplete guide to the art of discovery. New York:NY, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; First, careful [[scientific control|control conditions]] allow scientists to properly identify something as "unexpected". Once a finding is recognized as legitimately unexpected and in need of explaining, researchers can attempt to explain it: They work across various disciplines, with various colleagues, trying various analogies in order to understand the first curious finding.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

==Preparing to make discoveries==
[[File:DunbarFugelsangLuckInScience.png|thumb|left|A model based on the work of Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang. The two say that the first step is to realize a result is unexpected and unexplained.]]
Accidental discoveries have been a topic of discussion especially from the 20th century onwards. Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang say that somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are unexpected. This helps explain why scientists often call their discoveries "lucky", and yet scientists themselves may not be able to detail exactly what role luck played (see also [[introspection illusion]]). Dunbar and Fugelsang believe scientific discoveries are the result of carefully prepared experiments, but also "prepared minds".&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

The author [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls science "anti-fragile". That is, science can actually use — and benefit from — the chaos of the real world. While some methods of investigation are fragile in the face of human error and randomness, the scientific method relies on randomness in many ways. Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.&lt;ref name=Taleb&gt;Taleb contributes a brief description of anti-fragility,http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taleb/&gt;&lt;ref name=TalebBook&gt;Taleb, N. N. (2010). The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: "On Robustness and Fragility". NY: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; According to  M. K. Stoskopf, it is in this way that serendipity is often the "foundation for important intellectual leaps of understanding" in science.&lt;ref name=Stoskopf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16179740&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum|title=Observation and cogitation: how serendipity provides the building blocks of scientific discovery |last=Stosskopf |first= M. K |publisher=American College of Zoological Medicine, Wildlife and Aquatic Medicine and Environmental and Molecular Toxicology |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "[[Serendipity]]" is frequently understood as simply "a happy accident", but [[Horace Walpole]] used the word 'serendipity' to refer to a certain kind of happy accident: the kind that can only be exploited by a "sagacious" or clever person.&lt;ref name=Stoskopf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MertonBarber&gt;{{Cite book|first=Robert K. |last=Merton |first2=Elinor |last2=Barber |title=The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity: A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=0691117543 }} (Manuscript written 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dunbar and Fugelsang talk about, not just luck or chance in science, but specifically "serendipity" in science.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

Dunbar and Fugelsang suggest that the process of discovery often starts when a researcher finds bugs in their experiment. These unexpected results lead a researcher to self-doubt, and to try and fix what they ''think'' is an error in their own  methodology. The first recourse is to explain the error using local hypotheses (e.g. analogies typical of the discipline). This process is also local in the sense that the scientist is relatively independent or else working with one partner. Eventually, the researcher decides that the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. Self-doubt is complete, and so the methods shift to become more broad: The researcher begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, sometimes seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise. The highly controlled, cautious, curious and even social aspects of the scientific method are what make it well suited for identifying persistent systematic errors (anomalies).&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/&gt;

[[Albert Hofmann]], the Swiss chemist who discovered [[LSD]]'s [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] properties when he tried ingesting it at his lab, wrote
{{quotation|It is true that my discovery of LSD was a chance discovery, but it was the outcome of planned experiments and these experiments took place in the framework of systematic pharmaceutical, chemical research. It could better be described as serendipity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v11n2/11222gro.pdf Maps Organization. (2001). "Stanislav Grof interviews Dr. Albert Hofmann, 1984". Esalen Institute. Big Sur. Volume 11. Number 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dunbar and colleagues cite the discoveries of Hofmann and others as having involved serendipity. In contrast, the mind can be "prepared" in ways that obstruct serendipity — making new knowledge difficult or impossible to take in. Psychologist Alan A. Baumeister describes at least one such instance: Researcher Roy Heath failed to recognize evidence of "pleasure brain circuits" (in the [[septal nuclei]]). When Heath stimulated the brains of his schizophrenic patients, some of them reported feeling pleasure — a finding that Heath could have explored. Heath, however, was "prepared" (based on prior beliefs) for patients to report alertness, and when other patients did, it was on the reports of alertness that Heath focused his investigations. Heath failed to realize he had seen something unexpected and unexplained.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16608738&amp;query_hl=4&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum|title=Serendipity and the cerebral localization of pleasure |last=Baumeister |first= A.A|publisher=Department of Psychology, Louisiana State University |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
Fugelsang and Dunbar observe scientists while they work together in labs or analyze data, but they also use experimental settings and even [[neuroimaging]].&lt;ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck/&gt; [[Functional MRI|fMRI]] investigation found that unexpected findings were associated with particular brain activity. Unexpected findings were found to activate the [[prefrontal cortex]] as well as the [[left hemisphere]] in general. This suggests that unexpected findings provoke more attention, and the brain applies more linguistic, conscious systems to help explain those findings. This supports the idea that scientists are using particular abilities that exist to some extent in all humans.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, M. (2000). Cerebral specialization and interhemispheric communication: does the corpus callosum enable the human condition? ''Brain'', 123, 1293–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote  =  Absent sagacity, a chance observation of an important phenomenon will have no impact, and the observer may be denied historical attribution for the discovery.|source = Alfred A Baumeister &lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt;}} 
On the other hand, Dunbar and Fugelsang say that an ingenious experimental design (and control conditions) may not be enough for the researcher to properly appreciate when a finding is "unexpected". Serendipitous discoveries often requires certain mental conditions in the investigator beyond rigor. For example, a scientist must know all about what is expected before they can be surprised, and this requires experience in the field.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt; Researchers also require the sagacity to know to invest in the most curious findings.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt;

==Serendipitous discoveries==
{{Main| List of discoveries influenced by chance circumstances}}

Royston Roberts says that various discoveries required a degree of genius, but also some lucky element for that genius to act on.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, Royston M. (1989). Serendipity: Accidental Discoveries in Science. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gaughan writes that accidental discoveries result from the convergence of preparation, opportunity, and desire.&lt;ref name=Gaughan&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Gaughan |title=Accidental Genius: The World's Greatest By-Chance Discoveries |publisher=Metro Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4351-2557-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of luck in science is when drugs under investigation become known for different, unexpected uses. This was the case for [[minoxidil]] (an [[antihypertensive]] [[vasodilator]] that was subsequently found to also slow [[alopecia|hair loss]] and promote hair regrowth in some people) and for [[sildenafil]] (a medicine for [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], now familiar as "[[Viagra]]", used to treat [[erectile dysfunction]]). 

The hallucinogenic effects of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) were discovered by [[Albert Hofmann]], who was originally working with the substance to try and treat [[migraines]] and bleeding after childbirth. Hofmann experienced mental distortions and suspected it may have been the effects of LSD. He decided to test this hypothesis on himself by taking what he thought was "an extremely small quantity": 250&amp;nbsp;micrograms. Hofmann's description of what he experienced as a result of taking so much LSD is regarded by Royston Roberts as "one of the most frightening accounts in recorded medical history".&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">'''Source–sink dynamics''' is a theoretical model used by ecologists to describe how variation in [[habitat]] quality may affect the [[population dynamics|population]] growth or decline of [[organism]]s.

Since quality is likely to vary among patches of habitat, it is important to consider how a low quality patch might affect a population.  In this model, organisms occupy two patches of habitat.  One patch, the source, is a high quality habitat that on average allows the population to increase. The second patch, the sink, is very low quality habitat that, on its own, would not be able to support a population.  However, if the excess of [[individual]]s produced in the source frequently moves to the sink, the sink population can persist indefinitely.  Organisms are generally assumed to be able to distinguish between high and low quality habitat, and to prefer high quality habitat.  However, [[ecological traps|ecological trap]] theory describes the reasons why organisms may actually prefer sink patches over source [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches]].  Finally, the source-sink model implies that some habitat patches may be more important to the long-term survival of the population, and considering the presence of source-sink dynamics will help inform [[conservation ethic|conservation]] decisions.

==Theory development==
Although the seeds of a source-sink model had been planted earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Holt, R. D. 1985. Population-Dynamics in 2-Patch Environments - Some Anomalous Consequences of an Optimal Habitat Distribution. [[Theoretical Population Biology]] 28:181-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Pulliam&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"&gt;Pulliam, H. R. 1988. Sources, sinks, and population regulation. [[American Naturalist]] 132:652-661.&lt;/ref&gt; is often recognized as the first to present a fully developed source-sink model.  He defined source and sink patches in terms of their demographic parameters, or [[Matrix population models|BIDE rates]] ([[birth]], [[immigration]], [[death]], and [[emigration]] rates).  In the source patch, birth rates were greater than death rates, causing the population to grow.  The excess individuals were expected to leave the patch, so that emigration rates were greater than immigration rates.  In other words, sources were a net exporter of individuals.  In contrast, in a sink patch, death rates were greater than birth rates, resulting in a population decline toward extinction unless enough individuals emigrated from the source patch.  Immigration rates were expected to be greater than emigration rates, so that sinks were a net importer of individuals.  As a result, there would be a net flow of individuals from the source to the sink [[#table1|(see Table 1)]].

Pulliam's work was followed by many others who developed and tested the source-sink model.  Watkinson and Sutherland&lt;ref name="Watkinson-1995"&gt;Watkinson, A. R., and W. J. Sutherland. 1995. Sources, sinks and pseudo-sinks. [[Journal of Animal Ecology]] 64:126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a phenomenon in which high immigration rates could cause a patch to appear to be a sink by raising the patch's population above its [[carrying capacity]] (the number of individuals it can support).  However, in the absence of immigration, the patches are able to support a smaller population.  Since true sinks cannot support any population, the authors called these patches "pseudo-sinks". Definitively distinguishing between true sinks and pseudo-sinks requires cutting off immigration to the patch in question and determining whether the patch is still able to maintain a population.  Thomas et al.&lt;ref name="Thomas-1996"&gt;Thomas, C. D., M. C. Singer, and D. A. Boughton. 1996. Catastrophic extinction of population sources in a butterfly metapopulation. [[American Naturalist]] 148:957-975.&lt;/ref&gt; were able to do just that, taking advantage of an unseasonable frost that killed off the host plants for a source population of [[list of subspecies of Euphydryas editha|Edith's checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha''). Without the host plants, the supply of immigrants to other nearby patches was cut off.  Although these patches had appeared to be sinks, they did not become extinct without the constant supply of immigrants.  They were capable of sustaining a smaller population, suggesting that they were in fact pseudo-sinks.

Watkinson and Sutherland's&lt;ref name="Watkinson-1995"/&gt; caution about identifying pseudo-sinks was followed by Dias,&lt;ref name="Dias-1996"&gt;Dias, P. C. 1996. Sources and sinks in population biology. [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] 11:326-330.&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that differentiating between sources and sinks themselves may be difficult.  She asserted that a long-term study of the demographic parameters of the populations in each patch is necessary.  Otherwise, temporary variations in those parameters, perhaps due to climate fluctuations or natural disasters, may result in a misclassification of the patches.  For example, Johnson&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2004. Source-sink dynamics in a temporally, heterogeneous environment. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 85:2037-2045.&lt;/ref&gt; described periodic flooding of a river in [[Costa Rica]] which completely inundated patches of the host plant for a rolled-leaf beetle (''Cephaloleia fenestrata'').  During the floods, these patches became sinks, but at other times they were no different from other patches.  If researchers had not considered what happened during the floods, they would not have understood the full complexity of the system.

Dias&lt;ref name="Dias-1996"/&gt; also argued that an inversion between source and sink habitat is possible so that the sinks may actually become the sources.  Because reproduction in source patches is much higher than in sink patches, natural selection is generally expected to favor adaptations to the source habitat.  However, if the proportion of source to sink habitat changes so that sink habitat becomes much more available, organisms may begin to adapt to it instead.  Once adapted, the sink may become a source habitat.  This is believed to have occurred for the [[blue tit]] (''Parus caeruleus'') 7500 years ago as forest composition on [[Corsica]] changed, but few modern examples are known.  Boughton&lt;ref name="Boughton-1999"&gt;Boughton, D. A. 1999. Empirical Evidence for Complex Source-Sink Dynamics with Alternative States in a Butterfly Metapopulation. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 80:2727-2739.&lt;/ref&gt; described a source—pseudo-sink inversion in butterfly populations of ''E. editha''.&lt;ref name="Thomas-1996"/&gt;  Following the frost, the butterflies had difficulty recolonizing the former source patches.  Boughton found that the host plants in the former sources senesced much earlier than in the former pseudo-sink patches.  As a result, immigrants regularly arrived too late to successfully reproduce.  He found that the former pseudo-sinks had become sources, and the former sources had become true sinks.

One of the most recent additions to the source-sink literature is by Tittler et al.,&lt;ref name="Tittler-2006"&gt;Tittler, R., L. Fahrig, and M. A. Villard. 2006. Evidence of large-scale source-sink dynamics and long-distance dispersal among wood thrush populations. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 87:3029-3036.&lt;/ref&gt; who examined [[wood thrush]] (''Hylocichla mustelina'') survey data for evidence of source and sink populations on a large scale.  The authors reasoned that emigrants from sources would likely be the juveniles produced in one year dispersing to reproduce in sinks in the next year, producing a one-year time lag between population changes in the source and in the sink.  Using data from the [[Breeding Bird Survey]], an annual survey of North American birds, they looked for relationships between survey sites showing such a one-year time lag.  They found several pairs of sites showing significant relationships 60–80&amp;nbsp;km apart.  Several appeared to be sources to more than one sink, and several sinks appeared to receive individuals from more than one source.  In addition, some sites appeared to be a sink to one site and a source to another (see Figure 1).  The authors concluded that source-sink dynamics may occur on continental scales.

One of the more confusing issues involves identifying sources and sinks in the field.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"&gt;Runge, J. P., M. C. Runge and J. D. Nichols. 2006. The role of local populations within a landscape context:defining and classifying sources and sinks. [[American Naturalist]] 167:925-938.&lt;/ref&gt;  Runge et al.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"/&gt; point out that in general researchers need to estimate per capita reproduction, probability of survival, and probability of emigration to differentiate source and sink habitats.  If emigration is ignored, then individuals that emigrate may be treated as mortalities, thus causing sources to be classified as sinks.  This issue is important if the source-sink concept is viewed in terms of habitat quality (as it is in Table 1) because classifying high-quality habitat as low-quality may lead to mistakes in ecological management.  Runge et al.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"/&gt; showed how to integrate the theory of source-sink dynamics with population projection matrices&lt;ref name="Caswell-2001"&gt;Caswell, H. 2001. Matrix population models: Construction, analysis, and interpretation. 2nd edition.  Sinauer. Sunderland, Mass., USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and ecological statistics&lt;ref name="Williams-2001"&gt;Williams, B. K., J. D. Nichols, and M. J. Conroy. 2001. Analysis and management of animal populations.  Academic Press. San Diego, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to differentiate sources and sinks.

|''Habitat patches are represented in terms of their (1) inherent abilities to maintain a population (in the absence of immigration), (2) their attractiveness to organisms that are actively dispersing and choosing habitat patches, and (3) whether they are net exporters or importers of dispersing individuals.  Note that in all of these systems, source patches are capable of supporting stable or growing populations and are net exporters of individuals.  The major difference between them is that in the ecological trap model, the source patch is avoided (or at least not preferred to the low quality trap patch).  All of the low quality patches (whether sinks, pseudo-sinks, or traps) are net importers of dispersing individuals, and in the absence of dispersal, would show a population decline.  However, pseudo-sinks would not decline to extinction as they are capable of supporting a smaller population.  The other major difference between these low quality patch types is in their attractiveness; sink populations are avoided while trap patches are preferred (or at least not avoided).''

==Modes of dispersal==
Why would individuals ever leave high quality source habitat for a low quality sink habitat? This question is central to source-sink theory.  Ultimately, it depends on the organisms and the way they move and distribute themselves between habitat patches. For example, plants disperse passively, relying on other agents such as wind or water currents to move seeds to another patch. Passive dispersal can result in source-sink dynamics whenever the seeds land in a patch that cannot support the plant's growth or reproduction. Winds may continually deposit seeds there, maintaining a population even though the plants themselves do not successfully reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A. 1982. Population Ecology on an Environmental Gradient - Cakile-Edentula on a Sand Dune. [[Oecologia]] 52:348-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Another good example for this case are soil protists. Soil protists also disperse passively, relying mainly on wind to colonize other sites.&lt;ref&gt;Foissner, W. 1987. Soil protozoa: fundamental problems, ecological significance, adaptations in ciliates and testaceans, bioindicators, and guide to the literature. [[Progress in Protistology]] 2:69-212.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, source-sink dynamics can arise simply because external agents dispersed protist propagules (e.g., cysts, spores), forcing individuals to grow in a poor habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, L. D. 2015. Source-sink dynamics shapes the spatial distribution of soil protists in an arid shrubland of northern Chile. [[Journal of Arid Environments]] 113:121-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, many organisms that disperse actively should have no reason to remain in a sink patch,&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"&gt;Diffendorfer, J. E. 1998. Testing models of source-sink dynamics and balanced dispersal. [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] 81:417-433.&lt;/ref&gt; provided the organisms are able to recognize it as a poor quality patch (see discussion of [[ecological traps]]).  The reasoning behind this argument is that organisms are often expected to behave according to the "[[ideal free distribution]]", which describes a population in which individuals distribute themselves evenly among habitat patches according to how many individuals the patch can support.&lt;ref&gt;Fretwell, S. D., and H. L. Lucas, Jr. 1969. On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. [[Acta Biotheoretica]] 19:16-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  When there are patches of varying quality available, the ideal free distribution predicts a pattern of "balanced dispersal".&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"/&gt;  In this model, when the preferred habitat patch becomes crowded enough that the average [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] (survival rate or reproductive success) of the individuals in the patch drops below the average fitness in a second, lower quality patch, individuals are expected to move to the second patch.  However, as soon as the second patch becomes sufficiently crowded, individuals are expected to move back to the first patch.  Eventually, the patches should become balanced so that the average fitness of the individuals in each patch and the rates of dispersal between the two patches are even.  In this balanced dispersal model, the probability of leaving a patch is inversely proportional to the carrying capacity of the patch.&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"/&gt;  In this case, individuals should not remain in sink habitat for very long, where the carrying capacity is zero and the probability of leaving is therefore very high.

An alternative to the ideal free distribution and balanced dispersal models is when fitness can vary among potential breeding sites within habitat patches and individuals must select the best available site.  This alternative has been called the "ideal preemptive distribution", because a breeding site can be preempted if it has already been occupied.&lt;ref&gt;Pulliam, H. R., and B. J. Danielson. 1991. Sources, Sinks, and Habitat Selection - a Landscape Perspective on Population-Dynamics. [[American Naturalist]] 137:S50-S66.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the dominant, older individuals in a population may occupy all of the best territories in the source so that the next best territory available may be in the sink.  As the subordinate, younger individuals age, they may be able to take over territories in the source, but new subordinate juveniles from the source will have to move to the sink.  Pulliam&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt; argued that such a pattern of dispersal can maintain a large sink population indefinitely.  Furthermore, if good breeding sites in the source are rare and poor breeding sites in the sink are common, it is even possible that the majority of the population resides in the sink.

==Importance in ecology==
The source-sink model of population dynamics has made contributions to many areas in ecology.  For example, a species' [[ecological niche|niche]] was originally described as the environmental factors required by a species to carry out its life history, and a species was expected to be found only in areas that met these niche requirements.&lt;ref name="Grinnell-1917"&gt;Grinnell, J. 1917. The Niche-Relationships of the California Thrasher. [[The Auk]] 34:427-433.&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept of a niche was later termed the "fundamental niche", and described as all of the places a species could successfully occupy.  In contrast, the "realized niche", was described as all of the places a species actually did occupy, and was expected to be less than the extent of the fundamental niche as a result of competition with other species.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, G. E. 1957. Concluding remarks. Cold Spring Harbor Symposium [[Quantitative Biology]] 22:415-427.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the source-sink model demonstrated that the majority of a population could occupy a sink which, by definition, did not meet the niche requirements of the species,&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt; and was therefore outside the fundamental niche (see Figure 2).  In this case, the realized niche was actually larger than the fundamental niche, and ideas about how to define a species' niche had to change.

Source–sink dynamics has also been incorporated into studies of [[metapopulation]]s, a group of populations residing in patches of habitat.  Though some patches may go extinct, the regional persistence of the metapopulation depends on the ability of patches to be re-colonized.  As long as there are source patches present for successful reproduction, sink patches may allow the total number of individuals in the metapopulation to grow beyond what the source could support, providing a reserve of individuals available for re-colonization.&lt;ref name="Howe-1991"&gt;Howe, R. W., G. J. Davis, and V. Mosca. 1991. The Demographic Significance of Sink Populations. [[Biological Conservation]] 57:239-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Source–sink dynamics also has implications for studies of the coexistence of species within habitat patches.  Because a patch that is a source for one species may be a sink for another, coexistence may actually depend on immigration from a second patch rather than the interactions between the two species.&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt;  Similarly, source-sink dynamics may influence the regional coexistence and demographics of species within a [[metacommunity]], a group of communities connected by the dispersal of potentially interacting species.&lt;ref&gt;Leibold, M. A., M. Holyoak, J. M. Chase, M. F. Hoopes, R. D. Holt, J. B. Shurin, R. Law, D. Tilman, M. Loreau, and A. Gonzalez. 2004. The metacommunity concept: a framework for multi-scale community ecology. [[Ecology Letters]] 7:601-613.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the source-sink model has greatly influenced [[ecological traps|ecological trap theory]], a model in which organisms prefer sink habitat over source habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, B. A., and R. L. Hutto. 2006. A framework for understanding ecological traps and an evaluation of existing evidence. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 87:1075-1085.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Land managers and conservationists have become increasingly interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned.  As a result, it is important to understand how to identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change.  Because a large proportion of a species' population could exist in sink habitat,&lt;ref name=lamb16&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamb |first=C.T.. |authorlink= |author2=Mowat, G. |author3=McLellan, B.N. |author4=Nielsen, S.E. |author5=Boutin, S. |year=2016 |title=Forbidden fruit: human settlement and abundant fruit create an ecological trap for an apex omnivore |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]  |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12589|pmid= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservation efforts may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements.  Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat.  Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there.  Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances.&lt;ref name="Tittler-2006"/&gt;  Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the functional elements necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction.  For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.

In considering where to place [[nature reserves|reserves]], protecting source habitat is often assumed to be the goal, although if the cause of a sink is human activity, simply designating an area as a reserve has the potential to convert current sink patches to source patches (e.g. [[no-take zones]]).&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"&gt;Roberts, C. M. 1998. Sources, sinks, and the design of marine reserve networks. [[Fisheries (journal)|Fisheries]] 23:16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Either way, determining which areas are sources or sinks for any one species may be very difficult,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Derek E.|last2=Bolger|first2=Douglas T.|date=2017-05-05|title=Movements and source–sink dynamics of a Masai giraffe metapopulation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10144-017-0580-7|journal=Population Ecology|language=en|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s10144-017-0580-7|issn=1438-3896}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an area that is a source for one species may be unimportant to others.  Finally, areas that are sources or sinks currently may not be in the future as habitats are continually altered by human activity or climate change.  Few areas can be expected to be universal sources, or universal sinks.&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"/&gt;  While the presence of source, sink, or trap patches must be considered for short-term population survival, especially for very small populations, long-term survival may depend on the creation of networks of reserves that incorporate a variety of habitats and allow populations to interact.&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"/&gt;

Besides being the home of the Metropolis's summer and winter camps, the Faith and Heritage Center also allows Orthodox parishes to hold weekend retreats for youth and families and each September, the Metropolis sponsors an [[Open house (common school event)|open house]] which coincides with the celebration of the [[Feast of the Cross]] when the blessing of the waters service takes place. During this service [[Methodios Tournas|Metropolitan Methodios]] throws the cross into the lake and campers dive to retrieve it.&lt;ref name="cloughvillehist" /&gt; Also holding programs at the camp are [[Hellenic College and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology|Hellenic College-Holy Cross]], the [[Orthodox Church in America]], the [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese]] and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], while the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[United Church of Christ]], and the New Hampshire Council of Churches have used the facility for retreats and gatherings in addition to many community organizations and schools.&lt;ref name="cloughvillehist" /&gt;

==History==
===Camp Merrimac===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The property that is now St. Methodios was a community known as "Cloughville" in the 19th century. In 1919, the patriarchs of the Clough family, Joseph and Sylvia Clough, died, and the property was sold to Mr. Price and Mr. Pick of [[New York (state)|New York]], who established Camp Merrimac, a summer camp for Jewish boys, on the site. The first campers arrived in 1921. The camp was in a scenic location at the end of a dirt road on a lake officially known as Clement Pond, but known to generations of Merrimac campers as Lake Josylvia. Several of the old Cloughville buildings survived the transition—the local post office became the camp office. The ice house was the head counselor's shack. The village hall housed the mature staff, and a 19th-century barn lasted until it fell down one winter about 1960.

Mr. Price and Mr. Pick ran Camp Merrimac until the late 1940s when it was purchased by Abe Beleson, a teacher at the [[Bronx High School of Science]]. In 1953, Maury Bleifeld became a part owner, and in 1954 Harry Levine bought a share of the camp. In 1957, Werner Rothschild, Robert "Bob" Bomze, and Fred Egre purchased the property.

In 1958, Egre was bought out while Rothchild and Bomze continued operating the camp. Keeping the name Camp Merrimac, they continued to run a general [[summer camp]] program. One innovation they introduced in the 1960s was to have counselors from England, Sweden, and other European countries. In addition, being [[Physical education class|physical education]] teachers, they began the New England Hockey Camp and New England Figure Skating Camp. Youth would travel by bus to [[Concord, New Hampshire]], to the [[Everett Arena]] for ice time.

Both boys and girls attended the camp from after World War II until 1998. The majority of campers came from the [[New York metropolitan area]] at first. From the late 1980s until the end campers came from all over the United States, plus Canada, Mexico and Europe.

Nearing retirement, and perhaps a bit exhausted after 40+ summers at camp, Mr. Rothschild and Mr. Martin (as Bomze was then known) were ready to sell. They wanted the property to remain a youth facility. They were searching for a buyer who would continue youth programs. In 1998, the camp was sold to the [[Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston|Greek Orthodox Metropolis]] of [[Boston]].

The former {{convert|191|acre|adj=on}} Camp Merrimac property was purchased with the help of a $500,000 donation by former pharmaceutical company owner [[George D. Behrakis]] in the summer of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |quote=Metropolitan Methodios, bishop of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of Boston, received a welcome surprise recently when George Behrakis, a well-known church benefactor, announced that he was donating $500,000 toward the purchase of a diocesan camp and retreat center.

The '''summa''' (word in Latin) is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Didactic method|didactics]] [[literature|literary]] [[genre]] that was written in [[Latin language|Latin]]. This genre was born during the 12th century and was developed during the following centuries.

==Features==
It was a kind of [[encyclopedia]] that developed a matter about [[Law]], [[Theology]] or [[Philosophy]] most of all. Matters were divided in a more detailed way as it was in the ''tractatus'' ([[treatise]]), since they were divided into ''quaestiones'' (questions) and these ones were also divided into ''articles''. The articles had the following structure:

*1. Title of the article as a question and showing two different positions (''disputatio'').
*2. Objeccions or arguments against one of the alternatives, specially the one that defended the author.
*3. Arguments in favor of such an alternative, based on the [[Bible]], the [[Holy Fathers]] and so on.
*4. Solution, that includes arguments that combine faith and reason and that express the author's thought.
*5. The ''sententia'' or answer to the question, that consists in the refutation of the initial objections against the author's solution.&lt;ref&gt;Mateu Ibars, Josefina.

XIII-XVI'' Barcelona: Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 1984 https://books.google.es/books?id=HsPEsH9MMX4C&amp;dq=suma+%22g%C3%A9nero+literario%22&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.es/books?id=kyley4JXgNEC&amp;dq=suma+%22g%C3%A9nero+literario%22&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Summae'' in the area of Law==

In the area of Law, the ''summa'' is a practical and didactic genre, that was developed from the methodology of the [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]]. It was divided into two different literary genres: the summa (derived from the ''similia''), and the ''questio legitima'' (derived from the ''contraria'').

The ''summa'' was born in the minor Law schools whose aim was to instruct their students with easy summaries of the [[Justinian]] codes. In order to achieve this goal, easy, simple and systematic summaries of whole works were made, and the literary genre of the ''summae'' in the legal area was born.

The ''summae'' were developed specially in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] schools of [[Occitanie]] specially regarding Justinian's ''Institutiones''.

==Some important legal ''summae''==
*[[Azo of Bologna]]'''s Summa Codicis''.
*''Summa Codicis'' written in [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and known as ''Lo Codi'', translated into Latin by [[Riccardo Pisano]].

==The ''Summae'' in the areas of Theology and Philosophy==
The teaching of [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] during the Middle Ages had two different ways: ''lectio'' and ''disputatio'':
* The ''lectio'' (lesson) was very similar to a present class. The teacher commented the sentences and doctrines of famous and known authors, such as for instance, [[Aristotle]]'s or [[Boethius]]' works, or [[Peter Lombard]]'s sentences. 
* The ''disputatio'' (dispute) was more informal than the ''lectio'', and was a real dialogue between teachers and disciples, where arguments in favour of or against any theses or subject were defended.
These two school methods originated their literary forms:
* From the ''lectio'', the ''commentaria'' (commentaries) were born. And these ones brought the ''summae'' about, which were freer and more autonomous and systematic than the ''commentaria''. 
* The ''disputatio'' originated the ''quaestiones disputatae'' (disputed matters), that gather the material of the disputes that were held every two weeks; and the ''quodlibeta'' (random questions), that gathered the disputes that were held in [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]. This metodology of the ''disputationes'' was the technical model of the famous mediaeval ''summae''.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, J.A. OFM. Historia de la filosofía franciscana. Madrid. BAC. 1993, p. 13. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some important theological ''summae''==
There are more or less sixty extant ''summae'' in this field. The following ones must be pointed out:
*[[Simon of Tournai]]'s ''Summa'' or ''Institutiones in sacram paginam'', 1165.
*[[Prepositinus of Cremona]]'s ''Summa de officiis'' or ''Summa de poenitentia''.
*[[William of Auxerre]]'s ''Summa Aurea'', 1220.
*Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa Theologiae]], 1274.
*Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.
*[[Alexander of Hales]]' ''Summa Theologiae'', 13th century.
*[[Gerard of Bologna]]'s ''Summa Theologiae'', 1317.
*[[Francesc Eiximenis]]' ''Summa Theologica'' (fragments). 14th century.

'''Susan Lynn Hurley''' (September 16, 1954 – August 16, 2007) was appointed professor in the department of Politics and International Studies at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1994, professor of philosophy at Bristol University from 2006 and the first woman fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/14/guardianobituaries.obituaries|title=Obituary: Susan Hurley|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote on practical philosophy as well as on philosophy of mind, bringing these disciplines closer together. Her work draws on sources from the social sciences as well as the neurosciences, and can be broadly characterised as both naturalistic and interdisciplinary.

== Early life ==
Hurley was born in New York City and brought up in Santa Barbara, California. Her mother, a first-generation Armenian immigrant, was a secretary, and her father was an aviation industry executive.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Clark, [http://education.guardian.co.uk/obituary/story/0,,2168844,00.html Obituary Susan Hurley] ''The Guardian'' (London), September 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After a philosophy degree at [[Princeton University]] (1976), she studied law at [[Harvard]], resulting in a degree in 1988, and pursued graduate work in philosophy (a BPhil, 1979, and a doctorate, 1983) at Oxford, supervised primarily by [[John McDowell]]. She married the British neuroscientist, Professor [[Nick Rawlins]], in 1986.

== Philosophy of Mind ==
In ''Consciousness in Action'', as well as in many of her articles, Hurley defends vehicle externalism, the view that mental processes do not necessarily have to be explained in terms of  internal processes. There is no good reason to assume, Hurley argues, that subpersonal processes on which the mind depends always need to respect the boney boundary of the skull. Hurley's externalism is connected to her critiques of what she has called 'the classical sandwich model of the mind'. Traditionally, philosophers and empirical scientists of the mind have regarded perception as input from world to mind, action as output from mind to world, and cognition as sandwiched between. According to Hurley there is no reason to suppose the mind is necessarily organised in this vertically modular way and, moreover, there is good reason to believe it is actually organised differently. An alternative would be a horizontally modular architecture, which is for example used in [[Rodney Brooks]]'s robots. In one of her last texts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppls.ed.ac.uk/ppig/documents/Hurley-05252004_preprint.pdf The Shared Circuits Model: How Control, Mirroring and Simulation Can Enable Imitation, Deliberation, and Mindreading] to appear in ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt; Hurley proposes a horizontally modular architecture that could enable social cognitive skills.

'''''The Concept of Mind''''' is a 1949 book by philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], in which the author argues that "mind" is "a philosophical illusion hailing chiefly from [[René Descartes]] and sustained by logical errors and '[[category mistake]]s' which have become habitual."&lt;ref name="Webster" /&gt; The work has been cited as having "put the final nail in the coffin of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]]"&lt;ref name= "Tanney" /&gt; and has been seen as a founding document in the [[philosophy of mind]], which received professional recognition as a distinct and important branch of philosophy only after 1950.&lt;ref name="Flanaganarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flanagan, Owen |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |pages=570–572 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In the chapter "Descartes' Myth," Ryle introduces the term "the dogma of the [[Ghost in the machine]]" to describe the philosophical concept of the mind as an entity separate from the body. He argues, "I hope to prove that it is entirely false, and false not in detail but in principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category mistake."

===Critique of Cartesian dualism===
Ryle rejects Descartes' theory of the relation between mind and body, on the grounds that it approaches the investigation of mental processes as if they could be isolated from physical processes.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro"&gt;de Morais Ribeiro, Henrique (1989) [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Cogn/CognRibe.htm "On the Philosophy of Cognitive Science"], ''Proceedings of the 20th World Congress of Philosophy'', Boston MA, 10–15 August 1998 (accessed 29 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to demonstrate how this theory may be misleading, he explains that knowing how to perform an act skillfully may not only be a matter of being able to reason practically but may also be a matter of being able to put practical reasoning into action. Practical actions may not necessarily be produced by highly theoretical reasoning or by complex sequences of intellectual operations. The meaning of actions may not be explained by making inferences about hidden mental processes, but it may be explained by examining the rules that govern those actions.

According to Ryle, mental processes are merely intelligent acts. There are no mental processes that are distinct from intelligent acts. The operations of the mind are not merely represented by intelligent acts, they are the same as those intelligent acts. Thus, acts of learning, remembering, imagining, knowing, or willing are not merely clues to hidden mental processes or to complex sequences of intellectual operations, they are the way in which those mental processes or intellectual operations are defined. Logical propositions are not merely clues to modes of reasoning, they are those modes of reasoning.

The [[rationalist]] theory that there is a ''transformation into'' physical acts of some purely mental faculty of "Will" or "Volition" is therefore a misconception because it mistakenly assumes that a mental act could be and is distinct from a physical act, or even that a mental ''world'' could be and is distinct from the physical world. This theory of the separability of mind and body is described by Ryle as "the dogma of the ghost in the machine".  He explains that the workings of the mind as it governs the body are neither an independent nor a distinct mechanism, that there is no entity called "Mind" inside a mechanical apparatus called "the body", but that the workings of the mind may be better conceptualized as the actions of the body.

Cartesian theory holds that mental acts determine physical acts and that volitional acts of the body must be caused by volitional acts of the mind. This theory, according to Ryle, is "the myth of the ghost in the machine".

There ''is'' no contradiction between saying that an action is governed by physical laws and saying that the same action is governed by principles of reasoning. The motives of observable actions are ''[[wikt:propensity|propensities]]'' and ''[[disposition]]s''; these explain why behaviors occur, and not some purely mental process. For example, the disposition to want or not to want something is not explained by an intellectual motive for that thing. The disposition to want something is explained by ''the behaviors that are involved'' in wanting that thing. Thus, the mind does consist of abilities and dispositions that do explain behaviors, for example the learning, remembering, knowing, feeling, or willing behaviors. However, personal abilities and dispositions are not the same as mental processes or events. To refer to abilities or dispositions as if they were purely mental occurrences is to make a basic kind of category-mistake.

The nature of a person's motives may be defined by the actions and reactions of that person in various circumstances or situations. The nature of a person's motives in a particular situation may not necessarily be determined by any hidden mental processes or intellectual acts within that person. Motives may be revealed or explained by a person's behavior in a situation.

Ryle criticizes the theory that the mind is a place where mental images are apprehended, perceived, or remembered. Sensations, thoughts, and feelings do not belong to a mental world which is distinct from the physical world. Knowledge, memory, imagination, and other abilities or dispositions do not reside "within" the mind as if the mind were a space in which these dispositions could be placed or located. Furthermore, dispositions are not the same as behavioral actions, but actions may be explained by dispositions.

Dispositions are neither visible nor hidden, because they are not in the same logical category as behavioral actions. Dispositions are not mental processes or intellectual acts, they are propensities which explain various modes of behavior. Perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and feelings may be understood as observable behaviors which have various modes of production.

Ryle admits that his approach to the theory of mind is behavioristic in being opposed to the theory that there are hidden mental processes that are distinct from observable behaviors. His approach is based on the view that actions such as thinking, remembering, feeling, and willing are revealed by modes of behavior or by dispositions to modes of behavior. At the same time, however, he criticizes both Cartesian theory and behaviorist theory for being overly mechanistic. While Cartesian theory may insist that hidden mental events produce the behavioral responses of the conscious individual, behaviorism may insist that stimulus-response mechanisms produce the behavioral responses of the conscious individual. Ryle concludes that both Cartesian theory and behaviorist theory may be too rigid and mechanistic to provide us with an adequate understanding of the concept of mind.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt;

=== Category mistakes ===
As a [[linguistic philosophy|linguistic philosopher]],&lt;ref name= "Tanney" /&gt; a significant portion of Ryle's argument is devoted to analyzing what he perceives as philosophical errors based in conceptual use of language.  His critique of Cartesian dualism refers to it as a "category mistake."&lt;ref&gt;Calef, Scott (2005) [http://www.iep.utm.edu/dualism/ Dualism and Mind], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy,'' June 9, 2005 (accessed 30 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Category mistakes, such as the ones Ryle points out, are made by people who do not know how to properly wield the concepts with which they are working. Their puzzles arise from the inability to use certain items in human language. A much-cited example is of a foreign visitor being shown round Oxford (which has no campus) and after having been shown colleges, libraries, laboratories and playing fields asks in puzzlement "But where is the university?" The answer is, of course, all of these.

The theoretically interesting category mistakes are those made by people who are perfectly competent to apply [[concept]]s, at least in the situations with which they are familiar, but are still liable in their [[abstract thinking]] to relocate those concepts to [[logical type]]s to which they do not belong.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jones_mind"&gt;Jones, Roger (2008) [http://www.philosopher.org.uk/mind.htm "Philosophy of Mind, Introduction to Philosophy since the Enlightenment"], philosopher.org  (accessed Oct. 30, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The dualist doctrine establishes a [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposition]] between mind and body. At the language level, the mental properties are logical negations (in the Aristotelian sense) of the physical properties. So they belong, in accordance with the concept of category, to the same logical types, given that the expressions that are used for the descriptions of mental events are always mere negatives of the expressions used for the descriptions of material events. Ryle then says that such use implies a 'categorical mistake' for the descriptions of mental events that do not properly belong to the categories used for describing the corporeal events. Hence, 'mind' and 'matter' cannot be the polar opposites that Dualism suggests. Ryle writes that this would be comparable to claiming that "She came home in floods of tears" and "She came home in a sedan chair" (from the sentence "Miss Bolo came home in a flood of tears and a sedan chair", a [[zeugmatic]] sentence from Dickens) to be polar opposites. Such mistakes are, from the Rylean standpoint, the dogma of the mental ghost in the corporeal machine. Then, dualist doctrines are mythic in an [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] sense.&lt;ref name= "Jones"&gt;Jones, Roger (2008) [http://www.philosopher.org.uk/anal.htm "Analytic philosophy, Introduction to Philosophy since the Enlightenment"], philosopher.org  (accessed Oct. 30, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antecedents==
Ryle builds on the work of the philosophers [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref name= "Tanney"&gt;Tanney, Julia (2007) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/ "Gilbert Ryle"], in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''; Dec 18, 2007; substantive revision Mon Nov 2, 2009 (accessed Oct. 30, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Jones" /&gt; among others.  According to [[Bryan Magee]], the central thesis of ''The Concept of Mind'' and the essentials of its subsidiary theses were derived from Schopenhauer, whose works Ryle had read as a student, then largely forgotten. Ryle, who believed that he had expounded an original theory, did not realize what he had done until someone pointed it out to him after the book was published.&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Bryan. ''Confessions of a Philosopher'', Ch. 16: "As a student he read Schopenhauer, and much later, in his fiftieth year&amp;mdash;having, he thought, forgotten Schopenhauer almost entirely&amp;mdash;published ''The Concept of Mind'', in which not only the central thesis, but the essentials of the subsidiary theses come straight out of Schopenhauer. Ryle genuinely believed he was putting forth his own ideas. Only when someone pointed it out after publication did he realize he had recycled Schopenhauer."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Concept of Mind'' has been compared to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943) by [[Iris Murdoch]], who writes that English analytic philosophy shares the same general orientation as [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Murdoch, Iris |title=Sartre: Romantic Rationalist |publisher=Collins |location=London |year=1968 |pages=8–9 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle has been interpreted by [[David Stannard]] as maintaining that the psychoanalytic idea of [[unconscious mind|the unconscious]] is rooted in the Cartesian conception of a body-mind dichotomy and as such is one version of the "Ghost in the Machine" fallacy. According to Stannard, Ryle views the dogma as a logical error based on a category mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1980 |page=55 |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], in ''[[Why Freud Was Wrong]]'' (1995), praises Ryle's clarity and strength of argument, but suggests that while his arguments effectively dissolve the [[mind-body problem]], they have failed to bring about a revolution in human knowledge. Webster attributes this to the fact that Ryle's case that subjective aspects of experience such as sensation, memory, consciousness and sense of self are not the essence of "mind" has not been universally accepted by contemporary philosophers, neuroscientists, and psychologists. Webster believes that Ryle's willingness to accept the characterization of ''The Concept of Mind'' as [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] misrepresents its more nuanced position, writing that Ryle's acceptance of that description is not harmless, as Ryle himself suggested. Webster stresses that Ryle does not deny the reality of what are often called internal sensations and thoughts, but simply rejects the idea that they belong to a realm logically distinct from and independent of the external realm of ordinary human behaviour.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=461, 483, 613 |isbn=0-9515922-5-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryle has been characterized as an "ordinary language" philosopher.&lt;ref name= "Tanney" /&gt;  The book's style of writing has attracted comment. [[Stuart Hampshire]] remarked in a review in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' that, "There is only one property which I can discover to be common to Professor Ryle and [[Immanuel Kant]]; in both cases the style is the philosopher - as Kant thought and wrote in dichotomies, Professor Ryle writes in [[epigram]]s. There are many passages in which the argument simply consists of a succession of epigrams, which do indeed effectively explode on impact, shattering conventional trains of thought, but which, like most epigrams, leave behind among the debris in the reader's mind a trail of timid doubts and qualifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hampshire, Stuart |editors=Wood, Oscar P. &amp; Pitcher, George |title=Ryle: A Collection of Critical Essays |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Co, Inc |location=Suffolk |year=1971 |pages=17–18 |isbn=0333122658 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its style of writing was commented on more negatively by [[Herbert Marcuse]], who observes that the way in which Ryle follows his presentation of "Descartes' Myth" as the "official doctrine" about the relation between body and mind with a preliminary demonstration of its "absurdity" which evokes "John Doe, Richard Roe, and what they think about the 'Average Taxpayer'" shows a style that moves "between the two poles of pontificating authority and easy-going chumminess", something Marcuse finds to be characteristic of philosophical [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcuse, Herbert |title=One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1991 |pages=173–175 |isbn=0-415-07429-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Searle]], who believes that no great work of philosophy contains many footnotes and that philosophical quality varies inversely with the number of bibliographical references, considers the absence of footnotes in ''The Concept of Mind'' a sign of its quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Searle, John |title=The Rediscovery of the Mind |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1994 |page=xiv |isbn=0-262-69154-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Racial Contract''''' is an essay by Jamaican-American philosopher [[Charles_W._Mills|Charles W. Mills]] in which he attempts to show that, although it is conventional to represent the [[social contract]] moral and political theories of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant as neutral with respect to race and ethnicity, in actuality the philosophers understood them to regulate only relations between whites; in relation to non-whites, these philosophers helped to create a "racial contract," which in both formal and informal ways permitted whites to oppress and exploit non-whites and violate their own moral ideals in dealing with non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Mills, ''The Racial Contract'', Ithaca and London:  Cornell University Press, 1997, pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because in contemporary  [[political philosophy]] white philosophers take their own white privilege for granted, they do not recognize that white supremacy is a political system, and so in their developments of ideal moral and political theory never consider actual practice.  Mills proposes to develop a non-ideal theory "to explain and expose the inequities of the actual nonideal policy and to help us see through the theories and moral justifications offered in defense of them." Using it as a central concept, "the notion of a Racial Contract might be more revealing of the real character of the world we are living in, and the corresponding historical deficiencies of its normative theories and practices, than the raceless notions currently dominant in political theory."&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Mills, ''The Racial Contract'', Ithaca and London:  Cornell University Press, 1997, pp.1-2, 5, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Synopsis==
Mills argues that racism is at the core of the “social contract," rather than racism being an unintended result attributed to the failings of imperfect men. Specifically, the Racial Contract is a tacit (and at times explicit) agreement among members of the tribes of Europe to assert, promote, and maintain the ideal of white supremacy as against all other tribes of the world. This intention is deliberate and an integral characteristic of the social contract, a characteristic which persists to the present day.  In Mills’ words, “…what has usually been taken...as the racist ‘exception’ has really been the rule; what has been taken as the ‘rule’…[racial equality]…has really been the exception.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Racial Contract|year=1999|edition=paperback|publisher=Cornell Paperbacks|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mills argues however, that these ideals of the Social Contract are at worst pure fiction or at best were intended only to apply to a specific group of people, namely members of the tribes of Europe and their genetic descendants. “…''’when white people say ‘Justice,’ they mean ‘Just Us’.''”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Racial Contract|year=1999|edition=paperback|publisher=Cornell Paperbacks|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">'''Valentin Feldman''' (23 June 1909 – 27 July 1942) was a [[French philosopher]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] of Jewish-Russian origin. In 1942, he was murdered by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation of France]].

Born in [[Saint Petersburg]], he left the [[USSR]] in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the [[Lycée Henri IV]] and the [[Sorbonne]] University. A pupil of French philosopher [[Victor Basch]], he worked on [[aesthetics]] and wrote an essay, ''L'Esthétique française contemporaine'' (''French contemporan aesthetic''), Félix Alcan, 1936.

Involved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the [[Front populaire]] and the [[Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1937. Among his friends were [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Gaston Bachelard]] and [[Georges Politzer]]. In September 1939, he volunteered for the [[French Army]] despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in [[Rethel]], he began to write his ''Journal de guerre'' in January 1940 in the middle of the [[Phoney War]]. He survived several air attacks and bombardments during the [[Fall of France]] (May–June 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[German Occupation]] he was a teacher in [[Dieppe]] but suffered from the first French [[Statute on Jews]] (October 1940). He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the [[French Resistance]]. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, [[Rouen]] and [[Paris]]. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationist [[Vichy regime]] and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper ''L'Avenir normand'' in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review ''[[La Pensée libre]]'', supervised by [[Georges Politzer]], [[Jacques Decour]] and [[Jacques Solomon]]. Becoming part of the underground, he joined a group of communist Resistance in Rouen, where he participated in actions against the German occupiers.

Arrested in February 1942 after the sabotage of a factory, he was imprisoned and tortured. Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Feldman was executed by a firing squad on July 27, 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: "Imbeciles, it is for you that I die! "&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last words inspired numerous French writers : [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Aragon]] were among them.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Cahiers pour une morale'', Gallimard, 1983, p. 212 ; Louis Aragon, ''L'Homme communiste'', Gallimard, 1946, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; French-Swiss film-maker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] dedicated a short film to him, ''The Last Word'' (1988).

==History==
Veterans Today was founded in 2003 "in opposition to the invasion of Iraq."  According to ''[[Politico]]'', the site "soon began publishing wild conspiracy theories".&lt;ref name="SchreckingerMilitary"/&gt;  It has ties with the state-backed Iranian [[PressTV]], and has had ties with   Russia’s [[New Eastern Outlook]] since 2013. Its editorial board includes a former head of Pakistan’s intelligence services.&lt;ref name="SchreckingerMilitary"/&gt; It has published headlines including, “Israeli death squads involved in Sandy Hook bloodbath” and “Water Terrorism by India to Overawe Pakistan.”&lt;ref name="SchreckingerMilitary"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schreckinger |first1=Ben |title=How Russia Targets the U.S. Military |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/12/how-russia-targets-the-us-military-215247 |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website is formally partnered with several Russian institutions, and, according to ''Politico'', "has consistently published articles that push the Kremlin party line".&lt;ref name="SchreckingerMilitary"/&gt; According to [[University of Washington]] professor [[Kate Starbird]], ''Veterans Today'' is a [[fake news]] site actively pushing the Kremlin party line.&lt;ref name="SchreckingerMilitary"/&gt; According to the [[Manchester Union Leader]], the website mixes "advice for veterans on how to find jobs and pay medical bills" with conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda.&lt;ref name="GoldsteinGordon"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gordon |first1=Greg |last2=Goldstein |first2=David |title=Russian propaganda engaged U.S. vets, troops via social media, study finds |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1953868609/fulltext/A1ACBB0D8FA1434CPQ/18?accountid=10226 |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=[[The Union Leader]] |date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the website's chairman, Gordon Duff, told an interviewer that "about 30% of what's written on ''Veterans Today'', is patently false. About 40% of what I write, is at least purposely, partially false, because if I didn't write false information I wouldn't be alive".&lt;ref name="SchreckingerMilitary"/&gt;

'''William Douw Lighthall'''  {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KC|LLD|FRSC}}  (December 27, 1857 &amp;ndash; August 3, 1954), often referred to as '''W.D. Lighthall''', was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] lawyer, historian, novelist, poet and philosopher.&lt;ref name=mcmaster&gt;"[http://library.mcmaster.ca/archives/findaids/fonds/l/lightall.htm Lighthall, W. D., 1857-1954]," The William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections, McMaster University, McMaster.ca, Web, Apr. 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Born in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Canada West]], to Margaret Wright McIntryre and William Francis Lighthall, W.D. Lighthall grew up in [[Montreal]] and attended the [[High School of Montreal]] and [[McGill University]], where he graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1879, [[Bachelor of Civil Laws]] in 1881, and [[Master of Arts|M.A]]. in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quebecgenweb.com/~qcmtl-w/LighthallWmDouw.htm William Douw Lighthall] at quebecgenweb.com, accessed 30 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Admitted to the Quebec Bar in 1881,&lt;ref name=roots&gt;"[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~qcmtl-w/LighthallWmDouw.htm William Douw Lighthall]," RootsWeb, Ancestry.com, Web, Apr.29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; he practiced law in Montreal for the next 63 years, from 1881 to 1944.&lt;ref name=mcmaster/&gt;

In 1890 he married Cybel Charlotte Wilkes, and they had three children: Alice Margaret Schuyler Lighthall (born 1891), Cybel Katharine Schuyler Lighthall, (born 1893), and William Wilkes Schuyler Lighthall, born 1896.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

In 1893 W.D. Lighthall did the legal work ''[[pro bono]]'' to incorporate the Montreal Women's Club.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

He served as [[mayor]] of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]] from 1900 to 1903.&lt;ref name=mcmaster/&gt; During that time he originated, and in 1901 co-founded, the Union of Canadian Municipalities (now the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]]). He also served as vice president of the National Municipal League of America.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

In 1915 he founded Canada's first veterans' group, the Canadian Association of Returned Soldiers.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

Lighthall was a member of the International Congress of [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; He published in the ''Philosophical Review'' three times in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name=works&gt;"[http://philpapers.org/s/W.%20D.%20Lighthall Works by W.D. Lighthall]," PhilPapers.org, Web, Apr. 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

He took a long-time interest in [[Canadian history]], originating the Château Ramezay Historical Museum, and serving on the Royal Historical Monuments Commission and as chairman of the McCord Historical Museum. He wrote historical books, such as ''Montreal After 250 Years'', and monographs, like ''The Manor House of Lacolle''.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

Lighthall also wrote historical romances, initially under the pen name of Wilfrid Châteauclair, beginning with ''The Young Seigneur, or Nation Making'' in 1888.&lt;ref name=mcmaster/&gt; He wrote poetry as well,  publishing his first book, ''Thoughts, Moods and Ideals'', in 1887.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; He was an early supporter of the Canadian Authors Association, becoming its president in 1930.&lt;ref name=mcmaster/&gt;

In literary circles, though, Lighthall "is remembered mainly for his anthology, ''[[Songs of the Great Dominion]]'' ... which included a large number of poets whose names are still familiar, for example, [[William Wilfred Campbell|Wilfred Campbell]], [[Bliss Carman|Carman]], [[Isabella Valancy Crawford|Crawford]], [[Pauline Johnson|Johnson]], [[Archibald Lampman|Lampman]], and [[Charles G.D. Roberts]]."&lt;ref name=new/&gt;

==Recognition==

W.D. Lighthall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1902,&lt;ref name=mcmaster/&gt; and served as its president in 1918 and 1919.&lt;ref name=new&gt;William H. New, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mkh2vJ_9GpEC&amp;pg=PA666#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lighthall, William Douw]," ''Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada,'' 666, Google Books, Web, Apr. 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 he was made an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] by McGill.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt;

==Lighthall's philosophy==

Lighthall was among a number of the post-Darwinian thinkers of the nineteenth century who struggled with the concept of a Supreme Cause. Some of them not only struggled to redefine "God"; they also struggled to rename this entity. For his part Lighthall defined the cause as a "force of will" and called that force "The Outer Consciousness", "The Outer Knowledge",  "The Directive Power", and "The Person of Evolution". However unlike the philosopher Schopenhauer or the novelist Hardy, Lighthall, who considered himself to be both a philosopher and a novelist was optimistic in his view of the nature of "the will". That optimism was based on Lighthall's unbending faith in the positive nature of evolutionary progress. His views are present in his Novels particularly in ''The Master of Life'' as well as in his hope for Canada as a nation.

A reader of Lighthall's philosophical works may encounter some difficulty with the style. The main problem lies in the fact that Lighthall seldom completely reworked the lecture notes, pamphlets, and texts that he used to create the works as he published them. Furthermore, he preferred to number his paragraphs, as he considered these paragraphs to be "capsular" ideas. Perhaps due to his training in law he preferred to protect the integrity of these modules rather than sacrifice any of their meaning for the integrated flow of ideas in a particular chapter as a whole. Because of this practice the author's style appears jarringly disjointed at times. Ironically, the logical progression of deductive reasoning, so important to Lighthall's system, is often under stress because of this style.
 
The Lighthall system was an attempt to remarry science and religion in a single philosophical understanding of reality. Within the structure of that system Lighthall claimed to have avoided what he called the "metaphysical" problem. He insisted that all that was proposed in the hypothesis was derived from his observation of scientific fact. 
To be precise Lighthall considered the principles of his theory to be "proven" scientific facts and the proof to be founded upon deductive reasoning.

The system equated Instinct with Will. Further it viewed Will as the manifest cause of both the conscious and unconscious act. Lighthall stated: 'All living action is willing, and all is by nature purposive.'

Lighthall informed his readers that it was the phenomenon of the altruistic act that had been the initial "middle" ground that had led him to the formulation of the theory:
:'The utilitarian school, with its intellectual solutions on the basis of joy and pains, reflected by sympathy, appeared to me to give a reasonable account of most other moral acts,-but that an individual could deliberately annihilate himself for another evidently imported some element extraneous to the individual's own ordinary machinery of willing. Determined to accept no superficial 'explanation' of the problem such as glib use of words like 'volition' and 'conation,' I reduced acts of will to their simplest forms, noting their gradual shadings into, and intimate connections with habits, instincts, functions, reflexes, etc., and observing that these led to a world outside the consciousness of the individual. Thence I was brought to conclude, like Schopenhauer, that there is a unitary directive cause behind all these processes, and I included Evolution itself, regarded as one long act of willing. The characteristics that struck me most forcibly were the independence of this outer will, and its apparently highly conscious nature.'&lt;ref&gt;1983 "The Lighthall Theory: Defining the directive cause" in Studies in Religion, Vol. 12, No. 2, Winter '83, pages 191-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6962">'''İsmail Beşikçi''' (born in 1939 in [[İskilip]], [[Turkey]]) is a Turkish sociologist, philosopher, revolutionary, and writer. He is a [[International PEN|PEN]] Honorary Member.&lt;ref name="PEN"&gt;{{cite web | author = International PEN | title = Newsletter of the Writers in Prison Committee of International PEN | url = http://www.pensweden.org/images/PenewsSept03.pdf | accessdate = August 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served 17 years in prison&lt;ref name=sohbetodasi&gt;{{cite web | author = Derya Sazak on Milliyet | title= İmralı'daki değil dışarıdakiler konuşsun (not the one in İmralı but others should speak) | url= http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2006/03/14/siyaset/asiy.html | accessdate = March 25, 2007 | language = Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; on propaganda (trumped up) charges stemming from his writings about the Kurdish population in Turkey.
[[File:İsmail_Beşikçi.jpg|thumb|İsmail Beşikçi]]

Beşikçi studied at the Faculty of Political Sciences of Ankara University, and graduated in 1962. After his military duty he became an assistant professor at Atatürk University in [[Erzurum]]. He prepared his first anthropological study, an investigation of one of the last nomadic Kurdish tribes, the [[Alikan]], here, which he submitted in 1967 to the Ankara Faculty of Political Sciences. 

His second encounter with the Kurds was during his military service when he served in [[Bitlis]] and [[Hakkâri]] where he first saw the nomadic Alikan tribe pass through Bitlis on their migrations from winter to summer meadows and back.

|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book "The order of East Anatolia", first published in 1969, in which he sought to adapt and apply Marxist concepts to the analysis of Kurdish society and to the processes of socio-economic and political change taking place, made him a public enemy. While the book did not cause much debate either in academic or left intellectual circles, the university took disciplinary measures against him which would lead to a trial after the [[1971 Turkish coup d'état|1971 coup]]. He was detained and put on trial for communist and anti-national propaganda where he was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for violating the indivisibility of the Turkish nation.

Beşikçi did not have to serve his full 13 years and benefited amnesty in late 1974. He unsuccessfully applied for a position at the Faculty of Political Sciences in Ankara, which in 1970 had appeared willing to employ him. He never found academic employment again and was henceforth to do his research as an independent scholar, in economically precarious circumstances. 

For many years, Ismail Beşikçi was the only non-Kurdish person in Turkey to speak out loud and clearly in defense of the rights of the Kurds. Continuing to write and speak in spite of all attempts to silence him, Beşikçi has become a powerful and important symbol for the Kurds and for the human rights movement of Turkey.He was charged for over 100 years&lt;ref name="PEN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etext.org/Politics/Arm.The.Spirit/Kurdistan/Articles/ismail-besikci.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but released from jail in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/449006.stm|title=BBC News - Europe - Turkish writer released from jail|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he was a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. 32 of the 36 books that he has published have been banned in Turkey.&lt;ref name="rudaw.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/30052014|title=Rudaw’s 2014 Person of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been described as "modern Turkey's pioneer of Kurdish studies".
&lt;ref name="van Bruinessen 2005"/&gt;

In 2010 he was again prosecuted, this time by the attorney general of Istanbul for “PKK propaganda” on account of an article on "The rights of the nations to self-determination and the Kurds" that he wrote for the "Association of Contemporary Lawyers".

Ismail Besikci has authored several important works on Kurdish social organization and the continuing plight of Kurds today. His most famous work is International Colony Kurdistan. Besikci argues that the Turkish state has been practicing a policy of genocide against Kurds over the past 80 years. International Colony Kurdistan is probably Besikci's most open critique of the present division of Kurdistan, an ethnically contagious area (mainly) between Turkey, Iran and Iraq - with a Kurdish population of several million people. Besikci argues that, for all their political differences, there is a longstanding understanding between these regional states to deny Kurds the right of self-determination and nationhood. Ismail Besikci's International Colony Kurdistan was originally published in 1991 and led to the imprisonment of the author in Turkey. The book remains a roadmap for our understanding of Kurdistan today.
