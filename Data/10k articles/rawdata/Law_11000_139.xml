      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5688">On July 26, 2006 the [[Chicago City Council]] voted to approve an ordinance which for 7 weeks made Chicago the largest United States city that required [[Big-box store|big-box retailers]] to pay what the ordinance's sponsors characterized as a "[[living wage]]." Formally entitled "AMENDMENT OF TITLE 4 OF MUNICIPAL CODE OF CHICAGO BY CREATION OF NEW CHAPTER 404 ENTITLED "LARGE RETAILERS"",&lt;ref name="ordinance"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal = Chicago City Council Journal of Proceedings|pages = 83061–83070|date = 2006-07-26|title = Unfinished Business|url = http://docs.chicityclerk.com/journal/2006/july26_2006/july26_2006_part3optimize.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ordinance was popularly known as the "Living Wage Ordinance" or "Big Box Ordinance." The ordinance defined "Large Retailers" as those with annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more or with stores of 90,000 square feet or more. "Large retailers" were required to pay $9.25 per hour in wages and $1.50 per hour in benefits, with a schedule of [[cost of living]] increases.&lt;ref name=ordinance/&gt; (At the time, the minimum wage was $6.50 per hour state and $5.15 federal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072700197.html|title=Chicago Council Passes 'Living Wage' Act|author=Bellandi, Deanna|accessdate=2007-10-12|date=2006-07-27|publisher=The Washington Post Company|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Elections}}

The '''2015 cash-for-votes scam''' was a South Indian [[political scandal]], the second scandal of its kind since the 2008 North Indian [[cash-for-votes scandal]]. The 2015 political scandal started off when the [[Telugu Desam Party]] Leaders of [[Telangana]] state were caught in a video footage, aired in the media, offering bribes to a nominated MLA for his vote in the 2015 elections of the [[Telangana Legislative Council]]. The Telugu Desam MLA [[Revanth Reddy]] was arrested by the Telangana Police when he was offering Rs. 50 [[lakh]]s to the nominated MLA Elvis Stephenson. Reddy was then presented before the court of justice and sent to jail. Similarly, the phone conversation, which was quoted as the voice of [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]], the [[Andhra Pradesh]] Chief Minister, with the same nominated MLA was aired in the news media.&lt;ref&gt;Rahul, U.

The Telugu Desam party alleged that the scandal, was a political vendetta, doctored by the Telangana State Government under the direction of [[Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao|K. Chandrashekhar Rao]], the Chief Minister of Telangana, alongside the [[YSR Congress Party]].But eventually proved as a false statement in investigation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-cash-for-vote-case-poll-alleged-bribe-an-audio-clip/|title=Cash-for-vote case explained: Poll, alleged bribe, an audio clip|date=10 June 2015|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further development, The [[High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad]] for the States of Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, granted bail to [[Revanth Reddy]] and two other co-accused due to lack of substantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/cashforvote-case-hc-grants-bail-to-revanth-reddy/article7370014.ece|title=Revanth Reddy gets bail; ACB set to approach Supreme Court|author=V Rishi Kumar|work=The Hindu Business Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Events and allegations===
The elections for the Council of [[Telangana]] Assembly were initiated and the notification for six upper house seats were released. Five candidates from TRS, one from Congress and one from Telugu Desam got ready to contest the elections. The Telugu Desam and allied [[BJP]] together does not have enough votes to win the contest. Then the news came out that they were trying to get votes from other parties. The Party President Chandrababu Naidu conducted meetings to analyze this matter, based on his suggestion the TDP Party Leaders got into action. The rival parties have sensed that they are attempting to lure their MLA’s, so the respective party leaders became cautious. In this process a high drama took place at Stephenson’s place. The TDP MLA Revanth Reddy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/Cash-for-vote-Scam-TDP-MLA-Revanth-Reddy-Gives-Murky-Twist-to-MLC-Poll/2015/06/01/article2843684.ece|title=Cash-for-vote Scam: TDP MLA Revanth Reddy Gives Murky Twist to MLC Poll|work=The New Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; met Stephenson with the help of an aide. Following Revanth’s suggestion this aide tried to deliver Rs.50 lakh currency bundles. The videos of Revanth Reddy during this transaction turned out to be critical and aired on TV News channels.

==Revanth Reddy conversation==
The video recording shows that Revanth Reddy spoke several matters with Stephenson. He mentioned that he is the active leader in Telangana and also said that his ‘Boss’ assigns crucial matters only to him. He assured that everything will be taken care by '''Boss'''. And mentioned that he reported about money matter. He stressed that everything is done based on Boss instruction. Authorities arrested Revanth Reddy and later the video was telecasted in media. Everyone understood that when a Party MLA refers someone as ‘Boss’ repeatedly, it may be none otherthan the Party President Chandrababu Naidu.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/andhra-pradesh-news/cash-for-votes-case-andhra-pradesh-chief-minister-in-alleged-call-controversy-769579|title=Cash-for-Vote Case: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu in Controversy Over Alleged Phone Call|author=Uma Sudhir|date=7 June 2015|work=NDTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stephenson arguments==
As per the arguments of nominated MLA Stephenson, it is coming to know that Chandrababu was the one who doctored the entire episode. The sequential events began on May 28 when one by name Mattaiah met Stephenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ap7am.com/lv-190841-stephenson-reveals-about-cash-for-vote-deal.html|title=Stephenson reveals about cash-for-vote deal|work=ap7am.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Mattaiah tried to offer cash in regard to MLC elections. But, Stephenson approached ACB authorities believing that it is unethical. Later Sebastian, another person from TDP and after him Revanth Reddy entered the course of events. On May 30 Sebastian along with Revanth Reddy went straight to Stephenson’s residence to negotiate the deal. The duo told him that a secret meeting with Chandrababu will be arranged. The same day evening they made him speak to Chandrababu over phone. Chandrababu assured him that he will take care of everything and mentioned that his persons informed him about the deal. He then assured him that the promises will be honored. The next day i.e., on May 31 Revanth Reddy along with his aides met Stephenson with cash. The ACB Authorities who were already on alert arrested Revanth Reddy.

==Alleged Chandrababu Naidu's (Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh) role==
When the Telugu Desam MLA Revanth Reddy got arrested everyone’s attention fell on the party’s activities. Already in Andhra Pradesh the Telugu Desam Party is facing allegations that it has bought several MPS, independent MLAs, local body leader, primarily in the Zilla parishad and mandal parishad elections, that the party has bribed MPTCs and ZPTCs to win Mandal president and ZP chairperson. Is it moving ahead with the same strategy in Telangana?, was the suspicion that spread out. In the meanwhile an audio tape came into light, stating that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Mr.Chandrababu Naidu &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/leaked-recordings-in-cash-for-vote-case-hits-cm-chandrababu-naidu-where-it-hurts-the-most-2284310.html|title=Cash-for-vote case: Leaked tape recordings hit Chandrababu Naidu where it hurts most|work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke to Stephenson. Based on what was aired in the TV news channels, Chandrababu Naidu had a phone conversation &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; with Stephenson which contains the message,** our men told me everything, I will look into your matter, promises will be honoured, I am with you, don’t bother, we will work together.

==Attempts to sidetrack the issue==
The Telugu Desam party has started damage control measures to handle the repeated broadcasting of the conversation in the TV news channels. To begin with, Chandrababu went to Delhi and met the top cadre leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150610/nation-current-affairs/article/cash-vote-scam-amid-controversy-chandrababu-naidu-meets|title=Cash-for-vote scam: Amid controversy, Chandrababu Naidu meets Narendra Modi|work=Deccan Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no favorable response from them, the Central Law Minister announced that they will not interfere in this matter. Governor Narsimhan also traveled to Delhi to submit a report on this matter. Outraged by this move the TDP Ministers and leaders started abusing the Governor; this became a hot topic of discussion. In the meanwhile the Telugu Desam aggravated emotions and anger throughout the State stating that this is a matter of prestige and dignity of Andhra Pradesh. They did propaganda that there is no safety to Andhra people in Hyderabad and demanded that Section-8 must be implemented in Hyderabad which was a common capital. To some extent this was successfully driven into the public. Surprisingly there is no word on Section-8 after the so believed truce accorded between two ruling parties.

==Chandrababu Naidu's course of action==
The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu took this seriously as discussions on this issue was propagating throughout the State. He focused all his attention on this matter for several days and conducted meetings and reviews with Police higher officials. He immediately sacked the then intelligence chief Mrs.Anuradha for failing to grab information about telangana ACB plans. The word spread rapidly that the chief initiator behind this scandal was Telugu Desam President Chandrababu Naidu after the arrest of Telugu Desam MLA Revanth Reddy in Cash for Vote &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/cash-vote-case-10-reasons-tdp-no-takers-battle-trs-2304552.html|title=Cash for vote case: 10 reasons why TDP has no takers in its battle with TRS|work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; scandal. Though it is a matter concerned to the Party, Chandrababu took it as a matter of the Andhra Pradesh Government and deployed the government authorities to handle the issue.

[[File:Dilma Rousseff e Nicolás Maduro.jpg|thumb|[[Dilma Rousseff]] and [[Nicolás Maduro]]]]

On 13 May 2016 a [[state of emergency]] was declared in [[Venezuela]] by [[President of Venezuela|President]] [[Nicolás Maduro]]. The details of this emergency condition were not explained by Maduro but he mentioned conspiracy within the country and from an [[OPEC]] country and the [[United States]] to overthrow the [[Caracas]] government.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN0Y501X | title=Venezuela president declares emergency, cites U.S., domestic 'threats' | work=Reuters | date=13 May 2016 | accessdate=14 May 2016 | author=Buitrago, Deisy | author2=Ulmer, Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guar"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/14/venezuela-president-declares-60-day-state-of-emergency-blaming-us-for-instability | title=Venezuela president declares 60-day state of emergency, blaming US for instability | work=The Guardian | date=14 May 2016 | accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/venezuela-president-declares-emergency-citing-us-domestic-threat/ | title=Venezuela president declares emergency, citing U.S. domestic 'threats' | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=14 May 2016 | accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last state of emergency occurred in 2015 due to issues near the Colombian border, resulting in the suspension of constitutional guarantees and the [[Venezuela–Colombia migrant crisis]].&lt;ref name="guar" /&gt;

== Rationale ==
Maduro accused the United States of fomenting a hidden [[coup]] against his government.&lt;ref name="guar" /&gt; On May 13, Friday night, state television broadcast statements by Maduro saying: "[[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] is activating measures at the request of Venezuela’s fascist right, who are emboldened by the coup in [[Brazil]]."&lt;ref name="guar" /&gt; According to Maduro's opinion, the [[impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff|impeachment process against Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff]] is a sign that shows he is the next one.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; In a meeting with the Council of Ministers Maduro stated that the state of emergency decree is directed against "oligarchical parasites and speculators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ria.ru/world/20160514/1432835940.html |title=Глава Венесуэлы продлил чрезвычайное положение в экономике|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian| date=14 May 2016| accessdate =14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States statements ==   
In the lead up to the declaration, United States intelligence officials announced that Washington was worried about an economic and political crisis in Venezuela, predicting that Maduro would not complete his presidency.&lt;ref name="guar" /&gt; The officials added: "You can hear the ice cracking.

It was founded in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://alsb.mobi/history-of-the-alsb | title = History of the ALSB | accessdate = 2012-08-03 | last = Herron | first = Dan  | date = July 2002 | work = Official web site | publisher = ACADEMY OF LEGAL STUDIES IN BUSINESS | quote = 
The origins of the ACADEMY OF LEGAL STUDIES IN BUSINESS began with the 1924 American Association of Law Schools annual meeting in December, 1924 at the LaSalle Hotel in Chicago.  At that meeting, a new group was formed called the ASSOCIATION OF INSTRUCTORS OF LAW IN COLLEGIATE SCHOOLS OF BUSINESS.
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and now has an international membership. The nearly 1,000 members teach primarily in schools of business in colleges and universities, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Members come from all fifty states, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, England, and a number of other nations.

The Academy provides a forum for the exchange of ideas, and encourages support and cooperation among those who teach and conduct research in the field of legal studies. The Academy publishes two top-tier journals: the '''American Business Law Journal''' (ABLJ) and the '''Journal of Legal Studies Education''' (JLSE). For new faculty members in business law fields, the organization offers a Mentorship Program that pairs new ALSB members with experienced teachers and researchers. 

The ALSB hosts an annual conference for members to share their scholarly works and teaching innovations. Recent conferences have been held in St. Petersburg, FL (2006), Indianapolis, IN (2007), Long Beach, CA (2008), Denver, CO (2009), Richmond, VA (2010), New Orleans, LA (2011), Kansas City, KS (2012), Boston, MA (2013), Seattle, WA (2014), Philadelphia, PA (2015), and San Juan, PR (2016). Upcoming locations include Savannah, GA (2017), Portland, OR (2018), and Montreal, Quebec, Canada (2019). 

In addition to international events, the organization has twelve related regional organizations which host annual meetings. Several of the regional organizations also sponsor academic journals.

'''Adobe''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|i|audio=En-us-adobe.ogg}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ə|ˈ|d|əʊ|b|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adobe definition of adobe from Oxford Dictionaries Online]. Retrieved 25 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|aˈðoβe|lang}}) ({{lang-ar|الطوب|aṭ-ṭūb}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/adobe|title=the definition of adobe|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;'')'' is a building material made from earth and organic materials. Adobe is Spanish for [[mudbrick]], but in some English-speaking regions of Spanish heritage, the term is used to refer to any kind of earth construction. Most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to [[cob (material)|cob]] and [[rammed earth]] buildings. Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world.

==Description==
Adobe bricks are rectangular prisms small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking. They can be subsequently assembled, with the application of adobe mud to bond the individual bricks into a structure.  There is no standard size, with substantial variations over the years and in different regions. In some areas a popular size measured 8" inches x 4" inches x 12" inches weighing about 25 pounds; in other contexts the size is 10" x 4" x 14" weighing about 35 pounds. The maximum sizes can reach up to 100 pound; above this weight it becomes difficult to move the pieces, and it is preferred to ram the mud ''in situ'', resulting in a different typology known as [[rammed earth]].

==Strength==
In dry climates, adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. Adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater [[thermal mass]], but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not somehow reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=adobe Short documentary about adobe preparation and [[2010 Chile earthquake]]] Livingatlaschile.com, FICh, retrieved 5 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Collyns |first=Dan |authorlink= |title=Peru rebuilds two years on from quake |work= |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |date=15 August 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8201971.stm |doi= |accessdate=24 August 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090815100847/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8201971.stm| archivedate= 15 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake]] the [[2003 Bam earthquake]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake]], the [[2003 Bam earthquake]], and the [[2010 Chile earthquake]].

==Distribution==
Buildings made of sun-dried earth are common throughout the world ([[Middle East]], [[Western Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[West Africa]], [[South America]], southwestern [[North America]],  [[Spain]], and [[Eastern Europe]].)&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, Trevor. ''The Masons of Djenne''. Bloomington: University of Indiana Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Lithuanian life, Rumsiskes, Lithuania (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe had been in use by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in the [[Southwestern United States]], [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Andes]] for several thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = | author2 = Linda Black |author3=Larry S.

Adobe bricks were used in Spain from the [[Bronze Age#Age sub-divisions|Late Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s (eighth century BCE onwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= de Chazelles-Gazzal|first=Claire-Anne|title=Les maisons en terre de la Gaule méridionale|publisher=Éditions Monique Mergoil|year=1997|location=Montagnac, France|pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture, and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural hazards in El Salvador|last=Rose|first=William I.|author2=Julian J.

A distinction is sometimes made between the smaller ''adobes'', which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks, and the larger ''adobines'', some of which may be one to two yards (1–2&amp;nbsp;m) long.

==Etymology==
[[File:San Pedro de Atacama church.jpg|thumb|left|Church at [[San Pedro de Atacama]], [[Chile]]]]
The word ''adobe'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|iː}} has existed for around 4000 years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning. The word can be traced from the [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]] (c. 2000&amp;nbsp;BC) word ''ɟbt'' "mudbrick." Middle Egyptian evolved into [[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] or "pre-Coptic", and finally to Coptic (c. 600&amp;nbsp;BC), where it appeared as τωωβε {{IPA|tōʾpə}}. This was adopted into Arabic as {{lang|ar|الطوب}} ''aṭ-ṭawbu'' or ''aṭ-ṭūbu'', with the [[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] ''al-'' attached.&lt;ref&gt;"adobe", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition, on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''tuba'',&lt;ref&gt;''Spanish Word Histories and Mysteries: English Words that Come from Spanish'', Houghton Mifflin Co., 2007, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth-auroville.com/adobe_moulding_en.php "Adobe Moulding" Auroville Earth Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; This was assimilated into the [[Old Spanish language]] as ''adobe'' {{IPA|[aˈdobe]}}, probably via [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]]. English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century, still referring to [[mudbrick]] construction.

[[File:Santa Fe adobe.jpg|thumb|Adobe style in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]]]
In more modern English usage, the term "adobe" has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of North America, especially in [[New Mexico]], regardless of the construction method.

==Composition==
An adobe brick is a [[composite material]] made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as [[straw]] or [[Dung (matter)|dung]]. The [[soil]] composition typically contains [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vargas|first=J.|author2=J. Bariola|author3= M. Blondet|title=Seismic Strength of Adobe Masonry|journal=Materials and Structures|year=1986|volume=9|issue=4|pages=253–256|doi=10.1007/BF02472107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dung offers the same advantage. The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10–30% silt, and 55–75% fine sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrison|first=James|title=Adobe-The Material, Its Deterioration, Its Coatings|url=http://missions.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/1%20Garrison-Adobe%20Characteristics.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2013|pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source quotes 15–25% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles {{convert|2|to|10|in|mm|order=flip|-1|abbr=on}}, with no deleterious effect. Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland [[cement]] up to 10% by weight.

No more than half the clay content should be [[expansive clay]]s, with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite. Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick, resulting in cracking, while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick. Typically the soils of the Southwest United States, where such construction has been widely used, are an adequate composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Austin |first=George |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |work=New Mexico Geology, November 1984 |publisher=New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources |title=Adobe as a building material |deadurl=yes |accessdate=27 February 2013 |page=70 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232337/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Material properties==
[[File:Djenne great mud mosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Djenné]], [[Mali]], is built in adobe. The struts projecting from the wall serve as decoration, as well as supports for scaffolding during maintenance]]
Adobe walls are load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |title=14.7.4 NMAC |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818200926/http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; call for a minimum compressive strength of 300&amp;nbsp;lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (2.07&amp;nbsp;newton/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the adobe block. Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses. To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50&amp;nbsp;lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.345&amp;nbsp;newton/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the finished block.

In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction. In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the temperature of the living space. The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ([[radiation]]) and from the surrounding air ([[convection]]) before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time-lag effect. Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.

Thermodynamic material properties are sparsely quoted. The thermal resistance of adobe is quoted as having an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] of R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.41 h ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; °F/([[Btu]] in)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ECMD/FORMS/documents/MANUAL2.1.pdf |title=2009 New Mexico Energy Conservation Code: Residential Applications Manual |publisher=Emnrd.state.nm.us |accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a conductivity of 0.57 W/(m K) quoted from another source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chávez-Galán|first1=Jesus|last2=Almanza|first2=Rafael|last3=Rodríguez|first3=Neftali|title=Experimental Measurements of Thermal Properties for Mexican Building Materials to Simulate Thermal Behavior to Save Energy|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-75997-3_89|publisher=Spriner|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third source provides the following properties: conductivity=0.30 Btu/(h ft °F); heat capacity=0.24 Btu/(lb °F); density=106 lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1700&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HVAC Systems AE-390|url=http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~act27/AE390/A5/index_files/Page536.htm|publisher=Drexel University|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To determine the total R-value of a wall for example, multiply R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by the thickness of the wall. From knowledge of the adobe density, heat capacity and a diffusivity value, the conductivity is found to be k = 0.20 Btu/(h ft °F) or 0.35 W/(m K). The heat capacity is commonly quoted as c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.20 Btu/(lb F) or 840 joules/(kg K).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/QandA/adobe/mass.htm |title=Mass and insulation with adobe |publisher=Green Home Building |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density is 95 lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 1520&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The thermal diffusivity is calculated to be 0.0105&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/h or 2.72x10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s.

==Uses==
===Poured and puddled adobe walls===
[[File:Cueva de las Jarillas.jpg|thumb|left|Cliff dwellings of poured or puddled adobe (cob) at [[Cuarenta Casas]] in Mexico.]]
Poured and [[Puddling (engineering)|puddled]] adobe (puddled clay, piled earth), today called ''cob'', is made by placing soft adobe in layers, rather than by making individual dried bricks or using a form. "Puddle" is a general term for a clay or clay and sand-based material worked into a dense, plastic state.&lt;ref&gt;"puddle, n. 4.". ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-rom.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms, and later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.&lt;ref name="Keefe"&gt;Keefe, Laurence. ''Earth Building: Methods and Materials, Repair and Conservation''. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005. 22. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adobe bricks===
[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]]]
Bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame. In North America, the brick is typically about {{convert|25|by|36|cm|0|abbr=on}} in size. The mixture is molded into the frame, which is removed after initial setting. After drying for a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying. Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.

The same mixture, without straw, is used to make [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and often [[plaster]] on interior and exterior walls. Some cultures used [[Lime (material)|lime]]-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks. Reinforcement can include manure, straw, [[cement]], [[rebar]] or wooden posts. Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Technical Information Online |url=http://practicalaction.org/docs/technical_information_service/mud_plasters_and_renders.pdf |title=Mud Plasters and Renders – Technical Information Online – Practical Answers |publisher=Practicalaction.org |accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A test is done on the soil content first. To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid. The container is shaken vigorously for one minute. It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers. Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]] at [[New Mexico State University]] recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.

===Adobe wall construction===
[[File:Fort Saint-Sébastien - Visite des fouilles juin 2012 68.jpg|thumb|The [[earthen plaster]] removed exposing the adobe bricks at Fort St. Sebastian in France]]
The ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed, as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively.  Modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a [[lintel]] is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.

===Adobe roof===
The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand and organic materials. The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe.

Depending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly. This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.

The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads. The heaviest wooden beams, called [[Viga (architecture)|vigas]], lie atop the wall. Across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl-building.com/preservation-historic-adobe-buildings/ |title=Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings |publisher=Dawson Lupul |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon those brush is then laid. Finally, the adobe layer is applied.

To construct a flat adobe roof, beams of wood were laid to span the building, the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls. Once the vigas, latillas and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed. An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof. Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least {{convert|1|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick's edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/materials/adobe-construction2.htm|title=How Adobe Construction Works|date=2012-04-17|work=Add Water, Then Stir - How Adobe Construction Works {{!}} HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roof design evolved around 1850 in the American Southwest. Three inches of adobe mud was applied on top of the latillas, then 18 inches of dry adobe dirt applied to the roof. The dirt was contoured into a low slope to a downspout aka a 'canal'. When moisture was applied to the roof the clay particles expanded to create a waterproof membrane. Once a year it was necessary to pull the weeds from the roof and reslope the dirt as needed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof. The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials. The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls.

==Adobe around the world==
The largest structure ever made from adobe is the [[Arg-é Bam]] built by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in [[Peru]], with 100 million signed bricks and the ''ciudellas'' of [[Chan Chan]] and [[Tambo Colorado]], both in Peru.

The '''Application Services Library''' ('''ASL''') is a [[public domain]] framework of [[best practices]] used to [[standardization|standardize]] [[business process|processes]] within [[application management|Application Management]], the discipline of producing and maintaining [[information system]]s and [[application software|applications]]. The term "library" is used because ASL is presented as a set of books describing best practices from the [[Information Technology|IT]] industry.

ASL is closely related to the frameworks [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]] (for [[IT Service Management]]) and [[Business Information Services Library|BiSL]] (for [[Information Management]] and [[Functional Management]]) and to the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMM).

The ASL framework was developed because ITIL proved inadequate for Application Management.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} At that time, ITIL lacked specific guidance for application design, development, maintenance and support. Newer ITIL versions, particularly [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Overview of ITIL 2007 edition|V3]], have increasingly addressed the Application Development and Application Management domains; the ASL BiSL Foundation has published a white paper comparing ITIL v3 and ASL.&lt;ref&gt;http://aslbislfoundation.org/nl/?wpfb_dl=635&lt;/ref&gt;

ASL was developed in the late nineties in the [[Netherlands]], originally as the proprietary R2C model, which evolved into ASL in 2000. In 2001 it was donated by the IT [[Service Provider]] [[PinkRoccade]] to the ASL Foundation, now the ASL BiSL Foundation. The version [[#Structure of ASL2|ASL2]] was published in 2009.

==Purpose==
The ASL2 is intended to support Application Management by providing tools. Two main categories of aids are defined:
*Descriptions of the processes for Application Management. Plus the use of best-practises 
*Standard terminology, avoiding the pitfall of talking about different topics while using the same words.

==Structure of ASL2==
ASL2 contains 3 levels, 6 clusters of processes (3 on the operational level, 1 on the tactical level, 2 on the strategic level) and a totality of 26 processes.

===Operational level===
[[Application Support]] cluster

There are 4 processes within the Application Support cluster. The processes in the Service Organisation cluster support the daily use of the information systems. The processes in this cluster are: 
*[[Use Support]] 
*[[Configuration Management]] 
*[[IT Operation Management]]
*[[Continuity Management]] 
These processes have as well been defined in the ITIL framework. The processes are similar, but are viewed from another point of view, therefore the activities in each of these processes may differ from the activities in an ITIL-environment.

[[Application Maintenance]] and Renewal cluster

There are 5 processes within the Application Maintenance and Renewal cluster. Within this cluster the majority of the work of Application Development is done. A major part of the work of Application Management deals with designing, [[Mathematical programming|programming]] and testing applications and information systems. Processes are:
*[[Change impact analysis|Impact analysis]]
*[[Design]]
*Realization
*[[Software testing|Testing]] 
*[[Implementation]]
These processes are not described at all in the ITIL V1 framework, but do have their counterparts in BiSL, the model for Information management / Functional Management.

[[Connecting Process]]es Operational Level cluster

There are 2 processes within the Connecting Processes Operational Level cluster. The connecting processes aim at the synchronisation of the activities between Service Organisation/operations (using the applications) and development and maintenance (changing the applications). The two processes included are: 
*[[Change Management]] 
*[[Software Control and Distribution]]

===Management level===
[[Management Process]]es cluster

There are 5 processes within the Management Processes cluster. The processes in this cluster are used in the management of the activities within the clusters on the operational level. The processes are located on the tactical level, are used for steering the operational processes. The processes included are: 
*[[Contract Management]]
*[[Planning and Control]]
*[[Quality Management]]
*[[Financial Management]]
*[[Supplier Management]]

===Strategic level===
[[Application Strategy]] cluster

There are 5 processes within the Application Strategy cluster. Applications live for longer than expected. Systems, functionality, concepts and structure of information systems remain stable over many years. This knowledge is rarely used. It is important that, while maintaining and enhancing systems, there is a clear view needed what the demands are in the future, and based on that, what and how the future of these applications should look like. 
This view, the application management strategies, is created within the cluster Application Strategy. The processes in this cluster are:
*IT Developments Strategy
*Customer Organizations Strategy
*Customer Environment Strategy
*Application Life Cycle Management
*[[Application Portfolio Management]]

[[Application Management]] Organization Strategy cluster

There are 5 processes within the Application Management Organization Strategy cluster. Also the future of the Application Management organisation, with aspects as skills and capabilities, markets and customers, is very important. Creating the organisation management strategies for this is the aim of Application Management Organization Strategy cluster. Processes in this cluster include:
*Account and Market Definition
*Capabilities Definition
*Technology Definition
*Supplier Definition
*Service Delivery Definition

==ASL2 Maturity Model==

There is also ASL2 Maturity Model with 5 levels of process maturity:
*Level 1 - Initial
*Level 2 - Repeatable
*Level 3 - Defined and managed
*Level 4 - Optimizing
*Level 5 - Chain

[[Image:Argonne aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial view of Argonne National Laboratory]]

'''Argonne National Laboratory''' is a science and engineering research [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|national laboratory]] operated by the [[University of Chicago]] Argonne LLC for the [[United States Department of Energy]] located near [[Lemont, Illinois]], outside [[Chicago]]. It is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the [[Midwest]].

Argonne was initially formed to carry out [[Enrico Fermi]]'s work on [[nuclear reactor]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page xx (Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the US's [[nuclear navy]], and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994 the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and [[renewable energy]], environmental [[sustainability]], [[Supercomputer|supercomputing]], and [[national security]].

UChicago Argonne, LLC, the operator of the laboratory, "brings together the expertise of the [[University of Chicago]] (the sole member of the LLC) with [[Jacobs Engineering Group|Jacobs Engineering Group Inc]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicagoargonnellc.org/ |title=World-class Scientific Research &amp; Innovation |publisher=UChicago Argonne, LLC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne is a part of the expanding [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]]. Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West (or simply Argonne-West) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. In 2005, the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|work = Post Register|location = Idaho Falls, ID|title = Cleaning house and charting a future at INL|last = Menser|first = Paul|publisher = |accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020138/http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|archivedate = 2013-11-13|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Argonne has five main areas of focus. These goals, as stated by the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|accessdate=2009-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095748/http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of:

* Conducting [[Basic research|basic scientific research]];
* Operating national scientific facilities;
* Enhancing the nation's energy resources;
* Developing better ways to manage environmental problems;
* Protecting national security.

==History==
[[Image:ZGS preaccelerator.png|thumb|200px|[[Albert Crewe]] (right), Argonne's third director, stands next to the [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]]'s [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]].]]
Argonne began in 1942 as the "[[Metallurgical Laboratory]]" at the [[University of Chicago]], which became part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The Met Lab built [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], under the stands of a University of Chicago sports stadium. Considered unsafe, in 1943, CP-1 was reconstructed as CP-2, in what is today known as [[Red Gate Woods]] but was then the Argonne Forest of the Cook County Forest Preserve District near [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]]. The lab was named after the surrounding Argonne Forest, which in turn was named after the [[Forest of Argonne]] in [[France]] where U.S. troops fought in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anl.gov/about-argonne/history|title=Argonne: History|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermi's pile was originally going to be constructed in the Argonne forest, and construction plans were set in motion, but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt. Since speed was paramount, the project was moved to the squash court under [[Stagg Field]], the football field on the campus of the University of Chicago. Fermi told them that he was sure of his calculations, which said that it would not lead to a runaway reaction, which would have contaminated the city.

Other activities were added to Argonne over the next five years. On July 1, 1946, the "Metallurgical Laboratory" was formally re-chartered as Argonne National Laboratory for "cooperative research in nucleonics." At the request of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation's peaceful nuclear energy program. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the laboratory moved to a larger location in unincorporated [[DuPage County, Illinois]] and established a remote location in [[Idaho]], called "Argonne-West," to conduct further nuclear research.

In quick succession, the laboratory designed and built [[Chicago Pile 3]] (1944), the world's first [[heavy water reactor|heavy-water moderated reactor]], and the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (Chicago Pile 4), built in Idaho, which lit a string of four light bulbs with the world's first nuclear-generated electricity in 1951. A complete list of the reactors designed and, in most cases, built and operated by Argonne can be viewed in the, "[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/ANL-Reactors.html Reactors Designed by Argonne]" page. The knowledge gained from the Argonne experiments conducted with these reactors 1) formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and 2) inform the current evolving designs of liquid-metal reactors for future commercial power stations.

Conducting classified research, the laboratory was heavily secured; all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint, many of the buildings were classified, and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded. Such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized—including [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]] and [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica of Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne Highlights: 1950–1959 |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/fifties.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and unauthorized. Shortly past 1 a.m. on February 6, 1951, Argonne guards discovered reporter [[Paul Harvey]] near the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} perimeter fence, his coat tangled in the barbed wire. Searching his car, guards found a previously prepared four-page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified "hot zone". He was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public, but was not indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephens |first = Joel |title = New documents show longtime friendship between J. Edgar Hoover and Paul Harvey |publisher = Washington Post |date = 2010-01-23 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/22/AR2010012202602.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors, however. While designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957, Argonne physicist William Nelson Beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] images of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = William Nelson "Nels" Beck: Joliet Physicist's Work Changed Medical World |publisher = CityofJoliet.com |url = http://www.cityofjoliet.com/halloffame/scientists/wnbeck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas, sealed laboratories or caves.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the "Janus" reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on biological life, providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants, laboratories and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Research helps safeguard nuclear workers worldwide |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/news960803.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists at Argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the [[Moon|moon's]] surface using [[alpha decay|alpha radiation]], which launched aboard the [[Surveyor 5]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Jacobsen |first = Sally |title = Getting Aboard Viking: No Room on the Mars Lander. |date = December 1971|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JgsAAAAAMBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the [[Apollo 11]] mission.

In addition to nuclear work, the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1955, Argonne chemists co-discovered the [[Chemical element|elements]] [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], elements 99 and 100 in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert [[noble gas]] [[xenon]], opening up a new field of chemical bonding research.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, they discovered the [[Aqueous electron|hydrated electron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne History: Innovation and Serendipity |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/chemhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-energy physics made a leap forward when Argonne was chosen as the site of the 12.5 GeV [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]], a [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] that opened in 1963. A [[bubble chamber]] allowed scientists to track the motions of [[subatomic particle]]s as they zipped through the chamber; in 1970, they observed the [[neutrino]] in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|U.S.S. ''Nautilus'']], which steamed for more than 513,550 nautical miles (951,090&amp;nbsp;km). The next nuclear reactor model was Experimental [[Boiling Water Reactor]], the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants, and [[Experimental Breeder Reactor II]] (EBR-II), which was sodium-cooled, and included a fuel recycling facility. EBR-II was later modified to test other reactor designs, including a [[fast-neutron reactor]] and, in 1982, the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] concept—a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel, reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Frontline: Nuclear Reaction: Interview with Dr. Charles Till |publisher = PBS |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/till.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, however, the U.S. Congress terminated funding for the bulk of Argonne's nuclear programs.

Argonne moved to specialize in other areas, while capitalizing on its experience in physics, chemical sciences and [[metallurgy]]. In 1987, the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called [[plasma wakefield acceleration]], which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne History: Understanding the Physical Universe |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |url=http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html#neutrino |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909173546/http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html |archivedate=9 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cultivated a strong [[battery (electricity)|battery]] research program.

Following a major push by then-director Alan Schriesheim, the laboratory was chosen as the site of the [[Advanced Photon Source]], a major X-ray facility which was completed in 1995 and produced the brightest X-rays in the world at the time of its construction.

'''Blackshirts''' are members of the [[anti-religious]], [[atheist]] quasi-political organization [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], founded by [[Periyar Ramasami|"Periyar" E V Ramasamy]]. The members wear black shirts to mock and protest the [[saffron]] vestments of [[Hindu]] religious leaders and [[sadhus]] as black is generally associated with death and bad-luck in contrast with saffron's auspicious association. This has its origins in  the banning of black flags as a protest tool in Tamil Nadu. To circumvent this ban, members wore black shirts. Black shirts and black flags were also seen as a symbol of anarchy in southern India especially in Tamil Nadu during the early 20th century.

'''Boris Nikolayevich Chicherin''' ({{lang-ru|Бори́с Никола́евич Чиче́рин}}) (May 26, 1828 – February 3, 1904) was a Russian Empire jurist and political philosopher, who worked out a theory that Russia needed a strong, authoritative government to persevere with liberal reforms. By the time of the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], Chicherin was probably the most reputable legal philosopher and historian in Russia.

==Biography==
Chicherin was born in [[Tambov Governorate|Tambov]], where his noble ancestors had been residing for many centuries. In 1849, he matriculated from the law department of the [[Moscow University]]. On insistence of Dr. [[Timofey Granovsky]], he continued to work in the university as a professor of Russian law. Together with his friend [[Konstantin Kavelin]], he penned a comprehensive program of Russian [[liberalism]] which was published by [[Alexander Herzen]] in [[London]].

Chicherin was a great champion of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s reforms of the 1860s, hailing them as "the best monument of Russian legislation". He published the ''Regional Administration of 17th-century Russia'' in 1856, followed by the treatise ''On Popular Representation'' 10 years later. Chicherin's mature works, imbued with [[Hegel]]'s thought as they were, advocated the [[constitutional monarchy]] as an ideal form of government for [[Russia]].

In 1868, Chicherin resigned his position at the university as a protest against government repressions and settled in his estate near [[Tambov]]. It was here that he wrote several volumes of his bulky ''History of Political Theories''. Its magnificent literary style was acclaimed by such masters as [[Ivan Turgenev]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].

Later, Chicherin returned to [[Moscow]], where he was elected the city [[mayor]] in 1882. At that period, he supported Alexander's harsh measures in [[Poland]] and the tsar's struggle against radical revolutionaries. His speech at [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]'s coronation in the [[Kremlin]] was interpreted as too liberal, however, and he was forced to resign. He spent his last years writing 4 volumes of memoirs and some books on [[chemistry]], [[zoology]], and [[geometry]].
The memoirs have been reprinted by Oriental Research Partners (Newtonville, MA) in 1974 with a new introduction on Chicherin's life by Prof. D. Hammer, Indiana University.

'''Burke Act''' (1906), also known as the '''Forced Fee Patenting Act''', amended the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 (formally known as the General Allotment Act ("GAA"), under which the communal land held by tribes on the [[Indian reservations]] was broken up and distributed in severalty to individual households of tribal members. It required the government to assess whether individuals were "competent and capable" before giving them fee simple patents to their allotted land.

Because the federal government believed that most Indians were not prepared for United States [[citizenship]], the act further provided that citizenship not be granted to Native American individuals until at the time of the final validation of their trust patents, at the end of the probationary period of 25 years, instead of upon the receipt of the trust patents, as stated in the Dawes Act. It was named for U. S. Congressman [[Charles H. Burke]].

==Background==

===Competence===
The Burke Act amended the GAA to provide for the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to assess individual Native Americans as ‘competent and capable.’ before issuing any person receiving a land allotment a patent in fee simple. Receiving a fee simple patent meant that the land of the allotee would be removed from federal trust status and made subject to taxation. The allotee would be able to sell it on the private market.

The act reads:
:“..the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, and he is hereby authorized, whenever he shall be satisfied that any Indian allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs at any time to cause to be issued to such allottee a patent in fee simple, and thereafter all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance [sic], or taxation of said land shall be removed.”

Studies have shown that Bureau of Indian Affairs officials tended first to classify people as 'competent and capable' if they were of mixed-race (with some European ancestry). These allotees were deemed ‘competent’ because BIA officials believed that their European ancestry made them mentally superior, that they were more likely to be assimilated culturally, and therefore they were able to take responsibility of their land.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Allowing officials to assess competence made administration of the act more subjective, increasing the exclusionary power of the Secretary of Interior and inviting corruption among those with an opportunity to profit by gaining Indian-owned land.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  Although the act gave power to the allotee to decide whether to keep or sell the land, provided the harsh economic reality of the time, and lack of access by many Native Americans on reservations to credit and markets, liquidation of Indian-owned lands was almost inevitable.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  The Department of Interior officials associated with this program expected that virtually 95% of fee patented land would eventually be sold to whites.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robertson, ''The Power of the Land,'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2014}}

The following passage from the 1913 annual report from the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] reveals that the supervisor of the reservation expected eventual dispossession of land after individual [[Lakota people]] had been issued fee patent. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) reservation superintendent characterized this result as a ‘valuable lesson.’ 
:“It is still the conviction of this office that the issue of a patent in fee for a portion of an Indian’s land who is judged as being competent or near-competent, is the proper procedure in dealing with the land question among the Indians… Even if the proceeds derived from the dispossession of the land are squandered he still has plenty of land left and he may have learned a few lessons that will prove of value in the future.” (Department of the Interior, Annual Report of the Pine Ridge Agency, SD, August 1, 1913){{page needed|date=February 2014}}

The Burke Act had other consequences. In some cases, individual Indians deemed "competent" were not notified of the status and were not informed that their land's status had shifted from trust land to fee patent. As a result, individual owners did not realize the land was subject to taxation. After a period of taxes being unpaid, local or state jurisdictions could sell the land without the owner's consent to pay past taxes. This process was known as the "forced fee patent process." In this way, the Burke Act contributed to the ongoing fractionation of lands within reservation boundaries and overall loss of Tribal or Indian-owned lands.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Citizenship===
The Dawes Act had provided for Native Americans to be granted United States citizenship (for those who did not yet have it) when they received their trust patents to the individual allotment of land. Because of a range of problems that arose during implementation of the allotment program on different reservations, federal officials had concluded that most Indians were not prepared for United States [[citizenship]] and its obligations.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The Burke Act was amended to postpone granting of citizenship to Native American individuals in cases related to land allotments until the conclusion of a 25-year probationary period, at the end of which their trust patents would receive final validation.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This had numerous adverse results. For one, effectively this meant that Native Americans were given some tools to participate in United States society in an assimilated way (by holding private lands) but they were excluded as voters from the political system and could not draw on it, even to gain help from Congressional or state representatives, to help them through problems arising from the lucrative markets in land.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

'''''Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd''''',&lt;ref name="BPA HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|13|1994|litigants=Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1994) 179 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 520 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=24 March 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[tort law]] case from the [[High Court of Australia]], which decided it would abolish the rule in ''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'',&lt;ref name="Rylands v Fletcher"/&gt; and the ''[[ignis suus]]'' principle, incorporating them generally into the tort of negligence.

==Background==

===Facts===
A fire, caused by an independent contractor’s employee welding negligently, began on the defendant’s premises and spread to a nearby property. The property was burnt causing A$2.5M of damages. The plaintiff sued under ''ignis suus'', [[nuisance]], [[negligence]] and the rule in ''Rylands v Fletcher'' (a rule of absolute liability),&lt;ref name="Rylands v Fletcher"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Rylands v Fletcher]]|year=1868|court=UKHL|num=1 |parallelcite= (1868) LR 3 HL 330 |courtname=auto |date=17 July 1868}}.&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted in part through the duty of occupier to invitee.

The defendant was Burnie Port Authority (Burnie), located in Burnie Tasmania, who provided storage facilities, and the plaintiff was General Jones who stored a large quantity of frozen vegetables.  General Jones suffered damage when the vegetables were ruined by fire which destroyed Burnie property.

===Prior proceedings===
*[[Supreme Court of Tasmania]]: found for the plaintiff against the defendant on the grounds of the ''ignis suus'' rule.  Other defendants were the contracting firm who did the welding as part of expanding coolroom capacity, and the manufacturers of Isolite, the highly flammable insulating material, which was set alight by welding sparks, and which produces noxious gases.&lt;ref name="TasSC"&gt;{{cite AustLII|TASSC|74|1989|litigants=General Jones Pty Ltd v Wildridge &amp; Sinclair Pty Ltd and Burnie Port Authority |parallelcite= |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Tasmania|Supreme Court]] (Tas) |date=19 December 1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Defendant appealed to the [[Full Court]] of the Supreme Court of Tasmania: found for the plaintiff on the basis of ''Rylands v Fletcher'' principle.&lt;ref name="Rylands v Fletcher"/&gt; The grounds of nuisance and negligence were not appealed.&lt;ref name="TasSC FC"&gt;{{cite AustLII|TASRp|15|1991|litigants=Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd |parallelcite=[1991] [[Tasmanian Reports|Tas R]] 203 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Tasmania|Supreme Court]] (Tas) (Full Court) |date=11 September 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Appealed to the High Court of Australia

==High Court Judgment==
The High Court held that Rylands involved ‘quite unacceptable uncertainty’.&lt;ref name="BPA HCA"/&gt;{{rp|p 540}} It said that Blackburn J’s formulation had been ‘all but obliterated by subsequent judicial explanations and qualifications’.&lt;ref name="BPA HCA"/&gt;{{rp|p 536}} And at the time of ''Rylands'',&lt;ref name="Rylands v Fletcher"/&gt; negligence liability was limited to ‘a miscellany of disparate categories of cases’ and only with ''[[Heaven v Pender]]''&lt;ref name="Heaven v Pender"&gt;''[[Heaven v Pender]]'' (1883) 11 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QBD]] 503.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'',&lt;ref name="Donoghue v Stevenson"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]|year=1932|court=UKHL|num=100 |parallelcite=[1932] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 562 |courtname=auto |date=26 May 1932}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was liability grounded on general foreseeability.&lt;ref name="BPA HCA"/&gt;{{rp|p 543}} The justices therefore felt that the rule should be done away with and so the independent contractor was not liable under that, but could only be culpable in the law of negligence.

HCA Held: The appeal by Burnie was dismissed. 
Burnie, by allowing its contractor to introduce dangerous substances and activities on site, owed a duty of care to Jones to take reasonable steps to prevent fire, and the breach created liability under the normal rules of negligence. The joint judgment stated "The rule in Rylands v Fletcher, with all its difficulties, uncertainties, qualifications, and exceptions, should now be seen ... as absorbed by the rules of ordinary negligence. Under those principles, a person who takes advantage of his or her control of premises to introduce a dangerous substance, to carry on a dangerous activity, or to allow another to do one of those things, owes a duty of reasonable care to avoid a reasonably foreseeble risk of injury or damage to the person or the property of another."&lt;ref name="BPA HCA"/&gt;{{rp|pp 556–7}}

The ''ignis suus'' (his or her fire) rule was held to be ancient common law that was modified by statute in the UK, but never became law in Australia.

Damages in the tort of nuisance were not pleaded in the HCA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3233">The '''California Insurance Code''' are the codified [[California law]]s regarding [[insurance]].  The code not only covers requirements for home, auto, medical and business insurance policies, but also covers the licensing of bail bond agents, workers' compensation, motor club services, and other related business types. Topics include: classes of insurance, code provisions governing the insurance commissioner, laws pertaining to insurance adjusters, insurance contracts, liability limitations, and common carrier liability insurance.  The [[California Department of Insurance]] oversees the enforcement of the code and execution of its policies.&lt;ref name="CIC"&gt;{{cite web|title=California Insurance Code|author=State Legislature|url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0250-insurers/0500-legal-info/0100-insurance-code/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Slavery Era Insurance Registry===
In September 2000, Governor [[Gray Davis]] signed State Bill 2199 into law, adding a provision into the California Insurance Code for creation of a Slavery Era Insurance Registry. The bill was created with the intent of preserving historical information regarding [[list of slave owners|slave owners]] and their slaves in order to provide genealogical research information for slave descendants as well as to preserve possible evidence for potential [[Reparations for slavery|reparation]] claims. The bill requires insurance companies to provide the California Department of Insurance with any historical records regarding slaveholder insurance policies issued by any predecessor corporation during the [[Slavery in the United States|era of slavery]]. The information collected is to be made available to the public by the Department.&lt;ref name="Slavery Regulations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumers: Slavery Era Insurance Regulations|author=State Legislature|url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0100-consumers/0300-public-programs/0200-slavery-era-insur/insur-slavery-regs.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescission Provision Upheld===
Under the code sections 331 and 359, when an insured has misrepresented or concealed facts which are material to the application for insurance, the underwriter may rescind the policy. On March 8, 2005, the California Court of Appeal's 2nd Appellate District Div. Five affirmed and enforced California's Marine Rule in ''James E. Mitchell, Individually and as Trustee of the Mitchell Family Trust vs. United National Ins. Co.''. The summary finding stated:&lt;ref name="Rescission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rescission in California|author=Barry Zalma|publisher=IRMI.com|url=http://www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2005/zalma08.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]n insurer may, under [California] Insurance Code sections 331 and 359, rescind a fire insurance policy based on an insured's negligent or unintentional misrepresentation of a material fact in an insurance application, notwithstanding the willful misrepresentation clause included in the required standard form fire insurance policy (Insurance Code sections 2070 and 2071).

The '''Cambridge University Act 1856''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]], which regulates [[corporate governance]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. It requires that most members of full-time academic staff have voting rights over the Council of the Senate, which is ultimately the leading body in the university's administration.

==Contents==
Section 5, states that the Council of the Senate is the top management body.

Section 12, concerns "Votes of electors." It states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;‘In all elections of members of the Council every elector may vote for any number of persons, being heads of colleges, professors, or members of the Senate as aforesaid respectively, not exceeding the number of heads of colleges, professors, or members of the Senate respectively to be then chosen; and in case of an equality of votes for any two or more of such heads of colleges, professors, or members of the Senate respectively, the Vice-Chancellor shall name from amongst those persons for whom the number of votes shall be equal as many as shall be requisite to complete the number of heads of colleges, professors, or members of the Senate to be then chosen.’&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In United States [[property law]], '''cloud on title''' or '''title defect''' refers to any irregularity in the chain of [[Title (property)|title]] of property (usually [[real property]]) that would give a reasonable person pause before accepting a conveyance of title. According to [[Investopedia]], a cloud can be defined as: "Any document, claim, unreleased lien or [[encumbrance]] that might invalidate or impair the title to real property or make the title doubtful. Clouds on title are usually discovered during a [[title search]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cloud_on_title.asp|title=Cloud On Title|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=16 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clouded title can thus be contrasted with a [[clear title]], which indicates that a property is unencumbered. 

A cloud on title may reduce the value and marketability of property because any prospective buyer aware of the cloud will know that they are buying the risk the grantor may not be able to convey good title.  Often, the discovery of a cloud on title will provide the grantee a reason to back out of a contract for the sale of real property. Some documents that affect title may be considered clouds, but nonetheless are unlikely to affect marketability or resale, such as with [[covenants, conditions and restrictions]] in a [[homeowner's association]] or [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-14/news/8701120459_1_title-problems-lender-clouds|title=A Cloud On A Home`s Title Can Make It Unmarketable|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of clouds on title include a property's address being misspelled in a [[deed]] conveying title, a mortgage [[lien]] whose repayment hasn't been officially recorded, a deed which has been signed but hasn't been properly recorded, an [[easement]] that has not been properly recorded, unpaid property taxes, a failure to transfer property rights (such as [[mineral rights]]) to a former owner of the property, and a pending lawsuit before a court of law over ownership to the property. The usual remedy for a cloud on title is to file a [[civil action]] to [[quiet title]] which resolves the outstanding or unresolved cloud.

The '''Council of Luxembourg''' was the central institution in the government of the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] from 1444 to 1795, in direct descent from the medieval council of the dukes. It was a body that had both administrative and judicial authority. The council was reorganized by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1531–1532.&lt;ref&gt;R. Petit, "Keizerlijke verordening houdend reglement van de Raad van Luxemburg, 1532", tr. M. Grauwen, in ''Doorheen de nationale geschiedenis'' (State Archives in Belgium, Brussels, 1980), pp. 132-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1782, legal decisions of the council could be appealed to the [[Great Council of Mechelen]]. On 1 August 1782 the council was made "sovereign", that is, the highest court in its jurisdiction.

The council was abolished on 7 June 1795.

'''EurObserv'ER''' is a consortium dedicated to the monitoring of the development of the various [[Renewable energy in the European Union|sectors of renewable energies in the European Union.]]

Created in 1999 by Observ'ER, the Observatory of renewable energies in France, it is composed of five other partners: ECN (The Energy research Centre of the Netherlands), IEO (EC BREC Institute of Renewable Energetic Ltd), RENAC (Renewables Academy AG), FS ([[Frankfurt School]] of finance and management) and IJS (Institut Jozef Stefan).

Each year it publishes a number of reports, one for each sector: [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], [[Wind power|wind energy]], [[Biomass|solid biomass]], [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]], solar thermal, concentrated solar power, [[Marine energy|ocean energies]], [[geothermal energy]], [[biofuel]]s, [[biogas]] and [[Municipal solid waste|solid waste]]. These reports are called "Barometers", e.g. "Biofuels barometer 2013". These barometers summarises the state for each of the EU member states for the particular energy sector using both technical and socioeconomic indicators. It also publishes an annual report on the state of renewable energies in Europe.

EurObserv'ER provides free information to a large public and many other actors as the policy makers, industry players and journalists. 
It is supported by the [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/intelligent/ Intelligent Energy- Europe Programme], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100906134758/http://www2.ademe.fr/servlet/getDoc?id=11433&amp;m=3&amp;cid=96 Ademe] and [[Caisse des Dépôts]].

== Objectives ==

'''EurObserv'ER's objective''' is to provide a synthetic and a very reactive picture of the energy, industry and policy trends observed in the EU 28 Member States for each RES sector. Thus, it gives a reactive measurement tool that makes up for the gap between the end of the year and the time when official statistics are released.

By monitoring the EU Member States progression towards the 2020 RES directive targets, EurObserv'ER works as a support to the fulfilment of the EU policy to develop the RES share of gross final energy consumption
The current project will extend the scope of indicators and analysis to the integration of Croatia and the provision of a complete set of investment indicators. In fact, because of the economic crisis, public spending on RES development are being decreased in many Member States, so the EurObserv'ER team wants to help attracting private investments in the RES sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaci-projects.eu/iee/page/Page.jsp?op%3Dproject_detail%26prid%3D2608 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040633/http://www.eaci-projects.eu/iee/page/Page.jsp?op=project_detail&amp;prid=2608 |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

Since 1999, the '''EurObserv'ER barometer''' project has been an independent tool, which provides relevant, synthetic and reliable indicators on the level of development of renewable energy sectors within countries of the European Union in support of the European legislation dedicated to the development of renewable energy production. The fields covered by EurObserv’ER are related to energy, industry, socioeconomic dimensions and, with this new phase of work, investment indicators.
The barometers do not only provide reliable figures on the markets but also analysis and description of the facts and trends in each RES sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/solar-energy-industry-reports-with-eurobserver/&lt;/ref&gt; They publish comparable data by using collection and calculation methodologies that are the same for all the countries of EU.

They illustrate the contribution of RES development to European economy, activities and employment. The socio-economic indicators that are constructed on a European and national level help evidence that RES sectors have a lot of assets to help the transition to a competitive, dynamic and knowledge based economy.

« The State of Renewable Energy in Europe » &lt;ref&gt;The State of Renewable energies in Europe, 12th EurObserv'ER Report, 2012, 240 pages&lt;/ref&gt; provides clear landmarks of where the Member States stand as a whole about the RES share of gross final energy consumption.
All barometers will be available in up to five languages soon: English, French, German, Polish, and Romanian. Some of them will also be available in Italian and Spanish.

== Members of the consortium ==

=== Coordinator ===

==== Observ’ER ====

Set up in 1980, '''Observ'ER''', composed of economists and policy experts, produces studies that are recognised on the national and European levels.

Listened to and respected for the rigour of its work, Observ'ER publishes Systèmes Solaires, Le Journal des energies renouvelables, a bi-monthly magazine about renewable energy and two special editions about the photovoltaic and wind power sectors. In this way it plays an advisory role for public authorities and decision-makers, and takes an active part in major contemporary energy debates. 
Its other mission is to quantify and qualify the progress made by renewable energies. 
Observ'ER has been successfully leading the consortium since the creation of the EurObserv’ER project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abcvert.fr/annuaire/energies-renouvelables/promotion-des-energies-renouvelables/observ-er.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partners ===

==== ECN ====

'''The Energy research Centre of the Netherlands''' (ECN) is active within the transition area between fundamental research carried out by universities and the application of knowledge within the market. It is the largest research center in the Netherlands in the field of energy (600 people employed by the end of 2006).

ECN focuses on the knowledge and information required by the government to develop and evaluate policies and to achieve policy objectives in the field of energy, the environment and technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurec.be/en/Network/ECN-Energy-Research-Centre-of-the-Netherlands/&lt;/ref&gt;
ECN works together with national and international industry in the development and implementation of products, processes and technologies important for the transition to a sustainable energy system. The multidisciplinary project teams provide consultancy services at the national, European and global level.

==== IEO ====

'''EC BREC Institute of Renewable Energetic Ltd''' is an independent consultancy company, established in 2001. In EC BREC Ltd, the personal knowledge and experience of experts is used to develop projects connected with renewable energy promotion and implementation in Poland.

EC BREC Ltd provides 22 highly qualified specialists, with sound expert background in renewable energy and sustainable energy problems. Depending on the requirements, the projects are supported by experts working in various fields of utilisation of renewables.

== Users ==

Over time, the '''EurObserv'ER barometer''' has become a reference in Europe (in 2012, more than 92 000 downloads were counted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobserv-er.org/monitoring.asp See barometers downloads – EurObserv'ER official website]&lt;/ref&gt;). Numerous actors use its indicators:

* '''National policy makers''' who, in this way, have immediate arguments, backed up by figures on the impact of their policies
* '''[[European Civil Service|DG ENER civil servants]]''' who need these figures to monitor, as closely as possible, the efforts made by each Member State without waiting for official statistic figures to be released.
* '''Industry players''' who, in this way, can have reliable indicators and policy indications for the renewable sectors and thus, a kind of « compass » helping them to better grasp their growth potential and investment opportunities
* '''Financers and developers''' who will find relevant information on policy support measures and on the industry context
* '''Journalists''', who write more and more articles on climate change and renewable energies and need to find basic up to date information
* '''Research consultancies''' in charge of energy modelling, which use the barometer's figures as an input in their economic analyses
* '''Chambers of commerce''' who have to inform their clients on the situation of RES in the different EU countries
* '''RES associations''' for the promotion of renewable energies that use barometer data in their communications or projects
* '''High school''' and university teachers' trainings, which can supplement their courses with latest trends in the RES sectors

The '''"Fab 40"''' (''i.e.'' "Fabulous Forty") was a weekly [[playlist]] of popular records used by the British [[pirate radio|"pirate" radio]] station "Wonderful" [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] (also known as "Big L") which broadcast off the [[Essex]] coast from 1964 to 1967.

==Basis of the chart==
{{See also|List of Fab 40 number-one singles}}
{{Wiktionarypar|fab}}
"Fab" (short for "fabulous") was a very fashionable [[adjective]] in the mid-1960s, associated with the [[Beatles]], who were known as the "Fab Four", and much used by such trend-setters as [[Cathy McGowan (presenter)|Cathy McGowan]], who presented the weekly rock music show ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|independent television]]. 

Unlike the [[charts]] published in the ''[[Melody Maker]]'', ''[[New Musical Express]]'' and other music papers (or, for that matter, used by the [[BBC]] or the rival pirate station [[Radio Caroline]] &lt;ref&gt;Caroline's sales based top 50 was generally known as the "Caroline Countdown"  [http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/caroline/stonewashed/index.html].&lt;/ref&gt;), the Fab 40 was not based on sales of records. Thus, although it mostly contained what was current and popular, it was often ahead of movements in the authentic charts and was subject to more dramatic fluctuations. Whereas, in the sales charts of the 1960s, many records would climb in stages and then drop gradually, a record might suddenly emerge near the top of the Fab 40 one week and disappear from it the next. Equally, there was often room for records to scale the higher echelons of the Fab 40 without entering the sales charts at all (for example, the [[The Settlers (band)|Settlers]]' ''[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]'' in March 1966 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl/scrap60/fabforty/65fabs/march66/fab200366/fab200366.html Radio London - Big L Fab Forty 20 March 1966&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). As a result, a number of records that are well remembered from the mid-1960s were not, in fact, particularly successful in commercial terms.

==Fab 40 show==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Radio London Ship - MV Galaxy.jpg|thumb|right|Wonderful Radio London's transmitter ship, the MV ''Galaxy'']]  --&gt;
The Fab 40 was unveiled each week during a three-hour programme at lunchtime on Sunday (11{{nbsp}}am to 2{{nbsp}}pm), which, through such programmes as ''[[Family Favourites]]'' and ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'', the BBC had established as a prime time for radio listening. The show, which followed the ''[[Colgate-Palmolive]] Request Hour'', was presented by the station's [[disc jockeys]] on a rotational basis. This format largely mirrored that of the BBC's ''[[Pick of the Pops]]'', which [[Alan Freeman]] had presented each Sunday on the [[Light Programme]] since 1961.&lt;ref&gt;''Pick of the Pops'' was first broadcast in 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final Fab 40 show was introduced by [[Tommy Vance]] on 6 August 1967, the number one record that week being the [[Beach Boys]]' ''[[Heroes and Villains]]'', which entered the chart in the top position &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl/scrap60/fabforty/aug67/fab060867.html]  The final show overran by 22 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; (whereas, in terms of sales, it entered the British top 20 a month later and reached no higher than number eight &lt;ref&gt;Charlie Gillett &amp; Simon Frith (1976) ''Rock File 4''&lt;/ref&gt;). Radio London closed on 14 August 1967 following enactment of the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] that, in effect, outlawed such stations. In August 2007 the final "Fab 40" was re-presented by former Radio London disc jockey [[Dave Cash (disc jockey)|Dave Cash]] as part of a celebration on [[BBC Radio Essex]] to mark the fortieth anniversary of the pirates' demise.

When the BBC opened its own "pop" station [[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]] in September 1967, its sales-based top 30 chart was known informally for a time as the "Fun 30",&lt;ref&gt;For example, the ''Tony Blackburn Show'' (known formally as ''Daily Disc Delivery''), Radio 1, 30 September 1967&lt;/ref&gt; no doubt in imitation of London's "Fab 40".

==Reconstructing the Fab 40==
Some 30–40 years after they were in use, meticulous attempts were made to reconstruct the Fab 40 charts by Radio London Ltd. These drew on surviving lists prepared between 1965 and 1967, at Radio London's offices at 17 Curzon Street in London and informal ones compiled at the time by listeners, although there were sometimes discrepancies between the "official" list and the records that were actually delivered to the ship, the ''[[MV Galaxy (radio ship)|MV Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl/scrap60/fabforty/completeindexintro.html Radio London - complete Fab Forty Index intro&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Complete charts are available on the Radio London website, from 24 January 1965, five weeks after the station opened, till the final Fab 40, 6 August 1967 and are regularly updated with new information and input from featured artists. The first Fab 40 anticipated the sales chart a week later,&lt;ref&gt;Gillett &amp; Frith (1976) ''Rock File 4''&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Moody Blues]] were at number one with ''[[Go Now (song)|Go Now]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/rl/scrap60/fabforty/65fabs/jan65/fab240165/fab240165.html Radio London - Big L Fab Forty 65 - 24 Jan 1965&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== GSM frequency usage around the world ==

A dual-band 900/1800 device is required to be compatible with most networks apart from deployments in ITU-Region 2.

=== GSM-900, EGSM/EGSM-900 and GSM-1800 ===
GSM-900 and GSM-1800 are used in most parts of the world (ITU-Regions 1 and 3): [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[Asia]] (apart from [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] where [[GSM]] has never been introduced) and [[Oceania]].

In common GSM-900 is most widely used. Fewer operators use GSM-1800. [[Mobile phones on aircraft|Mobile Communication Services on Aircraft]] (MCA) uses GSM-1800.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/220&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en EUROPA - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Commission Decisions on Mobile Communication Services on Aircraft - Frequently Asked Questions]. Europa.eu. Retrieved on 2013-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries GSM-1800 is also referred to as "Digital Cellular System" (DCS).

=== GSM-850 and GSM-1900 ===
GSM-1900 and GSM-850 are used in most of North, South and Central America (ITU-Region 2).
In North America, GSM operates on the primary mobile communication bands 850&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz. In [[Canada]], GSM-1900 is the primary band used in urban areas with 850 as a backup, and GSM-850 being the primary rural band. In the [[United States]], regulatory requirements determine which area can use which band.

The term ''Cellular'' is sometimes used to describe GSM services in the 850&amp;nbsp;MHz band, because the original [[analog signal|analog]] cellular mobile communication system was allocated in this spectrum. Further GSM-850 is also sometimes called ''GSM-800'' because this frequency range was known as the "800&amp;nbsp;MHz band" (for simplification) when it was first allocated for [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] in the United States in 1983. In [[North America]] GSM-1900 is also referred to as [[Personal Communications Service]] (PCS) like any other cellular system operating on the "1900 MHz band".

=== Frequency mixing between GSM 900/1800 and GSM 850/1900 ===

Some countries in Central and South America have allocated spectrum in the 900&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz bands for GSM in addition to the common GSM deployments at 850&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz for ITU-Region 2 (Americas). The result therefore is a mixture of usage in the Americas that requires travelers to confirm that the devices they have are compatible with the bands of the network at their destination. [[Frequency compatibility]] problems can be avoided through the use of multi-band (tri-band or, especially, quad-band) device.

The following countries are mixing GSM 900/1800 and GSM 850/1900 bands:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtimezone.com/gsm.html |title=GSM Bands information by country |publisher=WorldTimeZone.com |date=2016-01-16 |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GSM-450 ===
Another less common GSM version is GSM-450.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Print.aspx?NewsId=15254 Ericsson, Nokia Eye 450&amp;nbsp;MHz GSM technology]&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the same band as, and can co-exist with, old analog [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT]] systems. NMT is a first generation ([[1G]]) mobile system which was primarily used in [[Nordic countries]], [[Benelux]], [[Alpine states|Alpine Countries]], [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Russia]] prior to the introduction of GSM. The [[GSM Association]] claims one of its around 680 operator-members has a license to operate a GSM 450 network in [[Tanzania]]. However, currently all active public operators in Tanzania use GSM 900/1800&amp;nbsp;MHz. There are no publicly advertised handsets for GSM-450 available.

Very few NMT-450 networks remain in operation. Overall, where the 450&amp;nbsp;MHz NMT band has been licensed, the original analogue network has been closed, and sometimes replaced by [[CDMA2000|CDMA]]. Some of the CDMA networks have since upgraded from CDMA to [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] (LTE band 31).

== Multi-band and multi-mode phones ==
Today, most telephones support multiple bands as used in different countries to facilitate [[roaming]]. These are typically referred to as multi-band phones. Dual-band phones can cover GSM networks in pairs such as 900 and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies (Europe, Asia, Australia and Brazil) or 850 and 1900 (North America and Brazil). European tri-band phones typically cover the 900, 1800 and 1900 bands giving good coverage in Europe and allowing limited use in North America, while North American tri-band phones utilize 850, 1800 and 1900 for widespread North American service but limited worldwide use. A new addition has been the quad-band phone, also known as a World Phone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cellhire.com/products/international/cell-phone/international |title = International Cell Phones |accessdate = 3 September 2013 |publisher = Cellhire}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting at least all four major GSM bands, allowing for global use (excluding non-GSM countries such as Japan or South Korea).

There are also multi-mode phones which can operate on GSM as well as on other mobile phone systems using other technical standards or proprietary technologies. Often these phones use multiple frequency bands as well. For example, one version of the Nokia 6340i [[GAIT (wireless)|GAIT]] phone sold in North America can operate on GSM-1900, GSM-850 and legacy [[Digital AMPS|TDMA]]-1900, TDMA-800, and [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]]-800, making it both multi-mode and multi-band. As a more recent example the Apple [[iPhone 5]] and [[iPhone 4S]] support quad-band GSM at 850/900/1800/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz, quad-band UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA at 850/900/1900/2100&amp;nbsp;MHz, and dual-band [[CDMA2000|CDMA]] [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EV-DO]] Rev. An at 800/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz, for a total of 'six' different frequencies (though at most four in a single mode). This allows the same handset to be sold for [[AT&amp;T Mobility]], [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] in the U.S. as well as a broad range of GSM carriers worldwide such as [[Vodafone]], [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] and [[T-Mobile]] (Excluding-US), many of whom offer official unlocking.

The '''Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs''', also known as the ''Hague system'' provides a mechanism for registering an [[industrial design]] in several countries by means of a single application, filed in one language, with one set of fees. The system is administered by [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]].

==Instruments==
The Hague Agreement consists of several separate treaties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/legal_texts/ Full texts of the Hague Agreement, Regulations and Administrative Instructions]. WIPO&lt;/ref&gt; the most important of which are: the Hague Agreement of 1925, the London Act of 2 June 1934,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/legal_texts/wo_hal0_.htm London Act of the Hague Agreement]. WIPO&lt;/ref&gt; the Hague Act of 28 November 1960 (amended by the Stockholm Act),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/legal_texts/wo_hah0_.htm Hague Act of the Hague Agreement]. WIPO&lt;/ref&gt; and the Geneva Act of 2 July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/legal_texts/wo_haa_t.htm Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816193850/http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/legal_texts/wo_haa_t.htm |date=16 August 2009 }}. WIPO&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version of the Agreement (the 1925 Hague version) is no longer applied, since all states parties signed up to subsequent instruments. The 1934 London Act formally applied between a London act state that did not sign up to the Hague and/or Geneva Act in relation with other London act states until October 2016. Since 1 January 2010, however, the application of this act had already been frozen.

Countries can become a party to the 1960 (Hague) Act, the 1999 (Geneva) Act, or both. If a country signs up to only one Act, then applicants from that country can only use the Hague system to obtain protection for their designs in other countries which are signed up to the same Act.  For instance, because the Japan has only signed up to the 1999 (Geneva) Act, applicants which qualify to use the Hague system because their domicile is in the European Union can only get protection in countries which have also signed up to the 1999 Act or to both the 1999 and 1960 Acts.

==Contracting Parties (member countries)==
All contracting parties to one or more of the instruments of the Hague Agreement are members of the Hague Union. A list is shown below:

;Notes
{{notelist|close}}
A [http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/documents/pdf/hague.pdf list of the Contracting Parties] is maintained by WIPO.

==Use of the system==
===Qualification to use the Hague system===
Applicants can qualify to use the Hague system on the basis of any of the following criteria:
* the applicant is a national of a Contracting Party (i.e. member country)
* the applicant is domiciled in a Contracting Party
* the applicant has a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in a Contracting Party
* the applicant has its habitual residence in a Contracting Party (only available if the Contracting Party in question has adhered to the 1999 (Geneva) Act)

An applicant who does not qualify under one of these headings cannot use the Hague system.  The Contracting Parties include not only individual countries, but also intergovernmental organisations such as the [[African Intellectual Property Organization]] (OAPI) and the [[European Union]].  This means an applicant domiciled in an EU member country that is not a Contracting Party, such as Austria or the United Kingdom, can nevertheless use the Hague system on the basis of his or her domicile in the European Union.

===Application requirements===
An application may be filed in English, French, or Spanish, at the choice of the applicant. The application must contain one or more views of the designs concerned and can include up to 100 different designs provided that the designs are all in the same class of the International Classification of Industrial Designs (Locarno Classification).

The application fee is composed of three types of fees: a basic fee, a publication fee, and a designation fee for each designated Contracting Party.

===Examination and registration procedure===
The application is examined for formal requirements by the International Bureau of WIPO, which provides the applicant with the opportunity to correct certain irregularities in the application.  Once the formal requirements have been met, it is recorded in the International Register and details are published electronically in the International Designs Bulletin on the WIPO website.

If any designated Contracting Party considers that a design which has been registered for protection in that Contracting Party does not meet its domestic criteria for registrability (e.g. it finds that the design is not novel), it must notify the International Bureau that it refuses the registration for that Contracting Party.  In every Contracting Party that does not issue such a refusal, the international registration takes effect and provides the same protection as if the design(s) had been registered under the domestic law of that Contracting Party.

===Duration &amp; renewal===
The duration of an international registration is five years, extendable in further five-year periods up to the maximum duration permitted by each Contracting Party. For the 1934 London Act the maximum term was 15 years.

Renewals are handled centrally by the International Bureau.  The applicant pays a renewal fee and notifies the International Bureau of the countries for which the registration is to be renewed.

==Naming==
The agreement was concluded at the [[the Netherlands|Dutch]] city [[The Hague]].

'''Homophobic propaganda''' (or '''anti-gay propaganda''') is [[propaganda]] based on [[homonegativity]] and [[homophobia]] towards [[homosexual]] and sometimes other [[non-heterosexual]] people. Such propaganda supports anti-gay prejudices and [[LGBT stereotypes|stereotypes]], and promotes social stigmatization or discrimination. The term ''homophobic propaganda'' was used by the historian Stefan Micheler in his work ''Homophobic Propaganda and the Denunciation of Same-Sex-Desiring Men [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|under National Socialism]]'',&lt;ref name=micheler&gt;Micheler, Stefan "Homophobic Propaganda and the Denunciation of Same-Sex-Desiring Men under National Socialism", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'', Volume 11, Number 1 and 2, January/April 2002, pp. 105—130&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other works treating the topic.&lt;ref&gt;"Faultlines: homophobic innovation in Gay Rights, Special Rights - Special Issue: Fundamentalist Media" in ''Afterimage,'' Feb-March, 1995 by Ioannis Mookas&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, some forms of homophobic propaganda are considered [[hate speech]] and are prohibited by law.

==History==
===Germany===
{{further information|Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust}}
Political attitudes towards homosexuals in [[Nazi Germany]] were based on the assumption that homosexuals were destroying the German nation as "sexual degenerates". Historian Erwin J. Haeberle, in his work ''Swastika, Pink Triangle and Yellow Star: The Destruction of Sexology and the Persecution of Homosexuals in Nazi Germany'', dates the first appearance of this political attitude to 14 May 1928.&lt;ref name=haeberle&gt;Haeberle, Erwin J. "Swastika, Pink Triangle and Yellow Star: The Destruction of Sexology and the Persecution of Homosexuals in Nazi Germany". ''Journal of Sex Research'' 17:3 (1981): 270-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

===Russia===
{{see also|LGBT rights in Russia}}
In Russia, it is illegal to commit crimes against someone based on their social group, and LGBT people are considered a separate social group by law. Responsibility for it is established item 136 and item 282 of the criminal code of the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.az-libr.ru/Law/Constn/KRF93/krf029.shtml |title=The Constitution of Russian Federation |publisher=Az-libr.ru |date=2009-04-11 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, on June 30, 2013, President [[Vladimir Putin]] signed into law a bill banning the "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations" among minors, and prohibits the equation of same-sex and straight marital relationships.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'': [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/russia-law-banning-gay-propaganda Russia passes law banning gay 'propaganda'.]  June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vice News]]'' claims that many LGBT rights groups have been transformed "from being a stigmatized fringe group to full-blown [[Enemy of the people#Soviet Union|enemies of the state]]" in Russia following the introduction of this law, and that openly [[homophobic]] and [[neo-Nazi]] groups such as ''[[Occupy Paedophilia]]'' have been described by Russian authorities as "civil movements fighting the sins of society".

===Norway===
In 1981, [[Norway]] became the first country to establish a criminal penalty (a fine or imprisonment for up to two years) for public threats, [[defamation]]s, expressions of hate, or agitation for discrimination towards the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Legal_affairs/Legal_co-operation/Conferences_and_high-level_meetings/European_Public_Prosecutors/00_Norway_Penal+Code.asp  |title=Norway General Civil Penal Code, §135 a |publisher=European Public Prosecutors |date= |accessdate=2009-11-21 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
On July 1, 1987 in the [[Netherlands]] joined the Dutch Penal code, which established punishment for public defamations on the basis of sexual orientation as fees or imprisonment for up to two years.&lt;ref name=ilga-report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steff.suite.dk/report.htm  |title=Equality for lesbians and gay men. |publisher=ILGA-Europe |date=June 1998 |accessdate=2009-11-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219231206/http://www.steff.suite.dk/report.htm |archivedate = 2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In 1989 in [[Ireland]] a resolution against anti-gay hate speech came into effect. It establishes penalty in the form of fees or imprisonment for up to two years for publication or distribution of materials which contain defamations, threats, hate speech or offenses for LGBT people. The law is occasionally taken into effect.&lt;ref name=ilga-report/&gt;

===Australia===
On 2 March 1993 in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], an amendment to the antidiscrimination law came into effect which prohibits public hate speech, despisement or ridiculing of homosexuals.

===South Africa===
In February 2000 the South African Parliament enacted the [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act]], which prohibits hate speech based on any of the constitutionally prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation. The definition of hate speech includes speech which is intended to "promote or propagate hatred".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2000-004.pdf Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 4 of 2000], section 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|Section 28|LGBT rights in the United Kingdom}}
Section 28 of the [[Local Government Act 1988]] added section 2A to the [[Local Government Act 1986]], which forbade [[local authorities]] from being allowed to "promote homosexuality", or "promote the teaching in any [[maintained school]] the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Government Act 1988 Chapter 9|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/9/pdfs/ukpga_19880009_en.pdf|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=29 May 2015|format=PDF|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was repealed on 21 June 2000 in Scotland as one of the first pieces of legislation enacted by the new [[Scottish Parliament]], and on 18 November 2003 in the rest of the United Kingdom by section 122 of the [[Local Government Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Local+Government+Act+&amp;Year=2003&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=819204&amp;ActiveTextDocId=819364&amp;filesize=374 Local Government Act 2003 (c. 26) – Statute Law Database&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hutchinson v. Proxmire''''', 443 U.S. 111 (1979), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that statements made by a Senator in newsletters and press releases were not protected by the [[Speech and debate clause]].

==Background==
In 1975, Senator [[William Proxmire]] created the "Golden Fleece Award" for governmental agencies that sponsored programs and research which Proxmire considered a waste of tax dollars. Proxmire awarded a Golden Fleece to federal agencies sponsoring the research of behavioral scientist [[Ronald_R._Hutchinson|Ronald Hutchinson]]. Proxmire discussed Hutchinson's work, which he called "nonsense", in detail on the Senate floor, in conferences with his staff, and in a newsletter sent to over 100,000 of his constituents. The newsletter, which did not use Hutchinson's name, reported that "[t]he NSF, the Space Agency, and the Office of Naval Research won the 'Golden Fleece' for spending jointly $500,000 to determine why monkeys clench their jaws."&lt;ref name=justia/&gt; Hutchinson sued Proxmire for libel, claiming that Proxmire's statements were [[defamation|defamatory]] and that he had been damaged by these libelous statements.

Hutchinson filed a lawsuit against Proxmire in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin]] claiming $8 million dollars in [[damages]] for defamation, malicious conduct or conduct with grossly negligent disregard for the truth, invasion of rights to privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional anguish. The district court considered the following questions:
*Whether a press release issued by the United States Senate Service Department containing similar content to a Senate floor speech made by Proxmire was privileged under the speech or debate clause of the United States constitution.
*Whether statements made by Proxmire were libelous or defamatory.

The [[respondents]] moved for [[summary judgment]]. The district court held that the press release was privileged under the Speech and Debate Clause, writing the "press release, in a constitutional sense, was no different than would have been a television or radio broadcast of his speech from the Senate floor."&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=district&gt;{{Cite web| title = HUTCHINSON v. PROXMIRE {{!}} 431 F.Supp. 1311 (1977) | work = Leagle| accessdate = 2017-06-30| url = http://www.leagle.com/decision/19771742431FSupp1311_11549/HUTCHINSON%20v.%20PROXMIRE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the question of defamation, the district court considered whether Hutchinson was a [[public figure]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given Dr. Hutchinson's long involvement with publicly funded research, his active solicitation of federal and state grants, the local press coverage of his research, and the public interest in the expenditure of public funds on the precise activities in which he voluntarily participated, the court concludes that he is a public figure for the purpose of this suit. As he acknowledged in his deposition, "Certainly, any expenditure of public funds is a matter of public interest."&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=district/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finding that Hutchinson was a public figure, the court moved on to the question of whether Proxmire had acted with actual malice. Finding that there was no "genuine issue of [[material fact]]" the court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Proxmire.&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;

[[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] affirmed, holding that Proxmire's statements in the press release and newsletters were protected by the Speech and Debate Clause. Though they found that comments made on television and during telephone calls were not protected by that Clause, the Court held that they were still protected by the [[First Amendment]] because the petitioner was a "public figure" and had not made a sufficient showing of "actual malice."&lt;ref name=justia&gt;{{Cite web| title = Hutchinson v. Proxmire 443 U.S. 111 (1979)| work = Justia Law| accessdate = 2017-07-01| url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/443/111/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
Having granted [[certiorari]] the Supreme Court considered three questions:
*the scope of the Speech and Debate Clause
*the First Amendment claims 
*the appropriateness of summary judgment, under constitutional and state law

The Supreme Court decided that statements made by Congressmen in press releases and newsletters are not protected by the Speech and Debate Clause. In the course of their analysis, they determined that, under the precedents of the court, a member of Congress may be held liable for republishing defamatory statements that were originally made during floor speeches. They also found that Hutchinson was not a public figure and that the "actual malice" standard established by ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'' for defamation claims brought by public figure did not apply to Hutchinson's case. Although Hutchinson did have access to the news media, the facts of the case do not indicate "that he was a public figure prior to the controversy" that resulted from the Golden Fleece award. The Court wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;His access, such as it was, came after the alleged libel, and was limited to responding to the announcement of the award. Those charged with alleged defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create their own defense by making the claimant a public figure. Nor is the concern about public expenditures sufficient to make petitioner a public figure, petitioner at no time having assumed any role of public prominence in the broad question of such concern&lt;ref name=justia/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They reversed the lower court decision and remanded back to the appeals court for further proceedings.

'''Incest''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|n|s|ɛ|s|t|}} is [[human sexual activity]]&lt;!--NOTE: Using the term "sexual activity" is more accurate because the term "incest" does not only refer to sexual penetration, while the term "sexual intercourse" usually does imply sexual penetration.--&gt; between family members or close [[kinship|relatives]].&lt;ref name="Incest1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Incest|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/incest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Incest2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Incest|publisher=[[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN)|year=2009|accessdate=August 27, 2013|url=http://www.rainn.org/get-information/types-of-sexual-assault/incest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically includes sexual activity between people in [[consanguinity]] (blood relations), and sometimes those related by [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] ([[marriage]] or [[stepfamily]]), [[adoption]], [[clan]], or [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].

Ludman - 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Children of incestuous relationships have been regarded as [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]], and are still so regarded in some societies today. In most cases, the parents did not have the option to marry to remove that status, as incestuous marriages were, and are, normally also prohibited.

A common justification for prohibiting incest is avoiding [[inbreeding]]: a collection of [[inbreeding#Genetic disorders|genetic disorders]] suffered by the children of parents with a close [[Coefficient of relationship|genetic relationship]].&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005 /&gt; Such children are at greater risk for congenital disorders, death, and developmental and physical disability, and that risk is proportional to their parents' [[coefficient of relationship]]—a measure of how closely the parents are related genetically.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005&gt;{{cite book |title=Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century |first=Arthur P. |last=Wolf |first2=William H. |last2=Durham |year=2004 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&amp;pg=PA3 |isbn=0-8047-5141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Afzal&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fareed |first1=M |last2=Afzal |first2=M |year=2014 |title=Estimating the inbreeding depression on cognitive behavior: A population based study of child cohort |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=9 |issue=10 |page=e109585 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0109585 |pmid=25313490 |pmc=4196914}}&lt;/ref&gt; But cultural anthropologists have noted that inbreeding avoidance cannot form the sole basis for the incest taboo because the boundaries of the incest prohibition vary widely between cultures, and not necessarily in ways that maximize the avoidance of inbreeding.&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, D.

In some societies, such as those of [[Ancient Egypt]], brother–sister, father–daughter, mother–son, cousin–cousin, aunt–nephew, uncle–niece, and other combinations of relations within a [[royal family]] were married as a means of perpetuating the royal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], Métamorphoses de la parenté, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies, such as the [[Balinese people|Balinese]]&lt;ref name= Bateson&gt;{{cite book |title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology |last=Bateson |first=Gregory |author-link=Gregory Bateson |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |pages= |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-226-03905-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Inuit]] tribes,&lt;ref name=JBriggs&gt;{{cite book |title=Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family |last=Briggs |first=Jean |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages= |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-674-60828-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; have different views about what constitutes illegal and immoral incest.

[[File:Table of Consanguinity showing degrees of relationship.svg|upright=1.3|right|thumb|The number next to each box indicates the degree of relationship relative to the given person.]]
The English word ''[[wikt:incest|incest]]'' is derived from the Latin ''incestus'', which has a general meaning of "impure, unchaste".
It was introduced into [[Middle English]], both in the generic Latin sense (preserved throughout the Middle English period&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] [[Ancrene Riwle]] (c. 1225) has ''Incest‥is bituȝe sibbe fleschliche'', where either the generic or the narrow sense may be intended. See also [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=incest&amp;searchmode=none inetymonline.comest]&lt;/ref&gt;) and in the narrow modern sense.
The derived adjective ''incestuous'' appears in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Etymology'', T. F. Hoad (ed.) (1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the Latin term came in, incest was known in [[Old English]] as ''sib-leger'' (from ''sibb'' 'kinship' + ''leger'' 'to lie') or ''mǣġhǣmed'' (from ''mǣġ'' 'kin, parent' + ''hǣmed'' 'sexual intercourse') but in time, both words fell out of use.

===Antiquity===
In [[ancient China]], first cousins with the same surnames (i.e., those born to the father's brothers) were not permitted to marry, while those with different surnames (i.e., maternal cousins and paternal cousins born to the father's sisters) were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gulik |first=Robert Hans van |title=Sexual Life in Ancient China: a Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from ca. 1500 B.C. till 1644 A.D. |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9MUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 |isbn=90-04-03917-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s married their siblings and had several children with them. For example, [[Tutankhamun]] married his half-sister [[Ankhesenamun]], and was himself the child of an incestuous union between [[Akhenaten]] and an unidentified sister-wife. It is now generally accepted that sibling marriages were widespread among all classes in Egypt during the Graeco-Roman period. Numerous [[papyrus|papyri]] and the Roman census declarations attest to many husbands and wives being brother and sister, of the same father and mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=N. |title=Life in Egypt under Roman Rule |isbn=0-19-814848-8 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

The fable of ''[[Oedipus]]'', with a theme of inadvertent incest between a mother and son, ends in disaster and shows ancient taboos against incest as Oedipus is punished for incestuous actions by blinding himself. In the "sequel" to Oedipus, ''[[Antigone]]'', his four children are also punished for their parents' incestuousness. Incest appears in the commonly accepted version of the birth of [[Adonis]], when his mother, [[Myrrha]] has sex with her father [[Cinyras]] during a festival, disguised as a prostitute.

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Sparta|Spartan King]] [[Leonidas I]], hero of the legendary [[Battle of Thermopylae]], was married to his [[niece]] [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]], daughter of his half-brother [[Cleomenes I]]. Greek law allowed marriage between a brother and sister if they had different mothers. For example, some accounts say that [[Elpinice]] was for a time married to her half-brother [[Cimon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html |title=Elpinice |last=Lahanas |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Hellenic World encyclopaedia |publisher=Hellenica |accessdate=2009-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921025414/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incest is mentioned and condemned in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' Book VI:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_vergil_aeneid_latin_6.htm Vergil Aeneid Book VI in Latin: The descent to the Underworld].

[[Roman law|Roman civil law]] prohibited marriages within four degrees of consanguinity&lt;ref name="SRCL514"&gt;Patrick Colquhoun, ''A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law'' (London: Wm. Benning &amp; Co., 1849), p. 513-4&lt;/ref&gt; but had no degrees of affinity with regards to marriage. Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line [[:wikt:ad infinitum|''ad infinitum'']].&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an [[:wikt:unemancipated|unemancipated]] daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved.&lt;ref name="SRCL514"/&gt; Incestuous unions were discouraged and considered ''[[nefas]]'' (against the laws of gods and man) in [[ancient Rome]]. In AD 295 incest was explicitly forbidden by an imperial edict, which divided the concept of ''incestus'' into two categories of unequal gravity: the ''incestus iuris gentium,'' which was applied to both Romans and non-Romans in the Empire, and the ''incestus iuris civilis,'' which concerned only Roman citizens. Therefore, for example, an Egyptian could marry an aunt, but a Roman could not. Despite the act of incest being unacceptable within the Roman Empire, Roman Emperor [[Caligula]] is rumored to have had sexual relationships with all three of his sisters ([[Julia Livilla]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]], and [[Agrippina the Younger]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter2007|Potter]], 2007, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Claudius]], after executing his previous wife, married his brother's daughter Agrippina the Younger, and changed the law to allow an otherwise illegal union.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 2007, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibiting marrying a sister's daughter remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Judith Evans |last=Grubbs |title=Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Widowhood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X8HXDwMHawC&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-15240-2 |pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taboo against incest in Ancient Rome is demonstrated by the fact that politicians would use charges of incest (often false charges) as insults and means of political disenfranchisement.

In [[Norse mythology]], there are themes of brother-sister marriage, a prominent example being between [[Njörðr]] and his [[Sister-wife of Njörðr|unnamed sister]] (perhaps [[Nerthus]]), parents of [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]]. [[Loki]] in turn also accuses Freyja and Freyr of having a sexual relationship.

In Genesis 19:30-38, living in an isolated area after the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s two daughters conspired to inebriate and seduce their father due to the lack of available partners to continue his [[Lineage (anthropology)|line of descent]]. Because of intoxication, Lot "perceived not" when his firstborn, and the following night his younger daughter, lay with him. (Genesis 19:32-35)

===From the Middle Ages onward===
[[File:Rey_Carlos_II.jpg|thumb|[[Charles II of Spain]] was born mentally and physically disabled due to centuries of inbreeding in the [[House of Habsburg]]]]
Many European monarchs were related due to political marriages, sometimes resulting in distant cousins (and even first cousins) being married. This was especially true in the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] royal houses. However, relations between siblings, which may have been tolerated in other cultures, were considered abhorrent. For example, the accusation that [[Anne Boleyn]] and her brother [[George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]] had committed incest was one of the reasons that both siblings were executed in May 1536.

Incestuous marriages were also seen in the royal houses of ancient [[Japan]] and Korea,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, George Patrick (1998).

A study of victims of father–daughter incest in the 1970s showed that there were "common features" within families before the occurrence of incest: estrangement between the mother and the daughter, extreme paternal dominance, and reassignment of some of the mother's traditional major family responsibility to the daughter. Oldest and only daughters were more likely to be the victims of incest. It was also stated that the incest experience was psychologically harmful to the woman in later life, frequently leading to feelings of low self-esteem, very unhealthy sexual activity, contempt for other women, and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2307/3961672| jstor=3961672|title = Emotional Inheritance: A Dubious Legacy|journal = Science News| volume=111| issue=21| pages=326|year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2009}}

In Japan, there is a popular misconception that mother-son incestuous contact is common, due to the manner in which it is depicted in the press and popular media. According to Hideo Tokuoka, "When Americans think of incest, they think of fathers and daughters; in Japan one thinks of mothers and sons" due to the extensive media coverage of mother-son incest there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tokuoka |first1=Hideo |last2=Cohen |first2=Albert K.|title=Japanese Society and Delinquency|journal=International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice|year=1987|volume=11|issue=1–2|pages=13–22|doi=10.1080/01924036.1987.9688852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some western researchers assumed that mother-son incest is common in Japan, but research into victimization statistics from police and health-care systems discredits this; it shows that the vast majority of sexual abuse, including incest, in Japan is perpetrated by men against young girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gough |first=David |title=Child Abuse in Japan |journal=[[Child and Adolescent Mental Health]] |date=February 1996 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=12–18 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-3588.1996.tb00003.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While incest between adults and children generally involves the adult as the perpetrator of abuse, there are rare instances of sons sexually assaulting their mothers. These sons are typically mid adolescent to young adult, and, unlike parent-initiated incest, the incidents involve some kind of physical force. Although the mothers may be accused of being seductive with their sons and inviting the sexual contact, this is contrary to evidence.&lt;ref name="Courtois 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Courtois |first=Christine  |title=Healing the Incest Wound: Adult Survivors in Therapy |year=2010 |publisher=W.

In some cases, mother-son incest is best classified as [[acquaintance rape]] of the mother by the adolescent son.&lt;ref name="Courtois 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;

===Between childhood siblings===
Childhood [[Sibling incest|sibling–sibling incest]] is considered to be widespread but rarely reported.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt; Sibling–sibling incest becomes [[child-on-child sexual abuse]] when it occurs without consent, without equality, or as a result of [[coercion]].

Sibling abusive incest is most prevalent in families where one or both parents are often absent or emotionally unavailable, with the abusive siblings using incest as a way to assert their power over a weaker sibling.&lt;ref name=leder&gt;{{cite news|last=Leder |first=Jane Mersky |title=Adult Sibling Rivalry: Sibling rivalry often lingers through adulthood |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199301/adult-sibling-rivalry |work=Psychology Today |volume=January/February 93 |publisher=Sussex Publishers |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of the father in particular has been found to be a significant element of most cases of sexual abuse of female children by a brother.&lt;ref name=rudd&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudd |first=Jane M. |last2=Herzberger |first2=Sharon D. |title=Brother-sister incest—father-daughter incest: a comparison of characteristics and consequences |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=23 |issue=9 |date=September 1999 |pages=915–928 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damaging effects on both childhood development and adult symptoms resulting from brother–sister sexual abuse are similar to the effects of father–daughter, including substance abuse, depression, suicidality, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=rudd /&gt;&lt;ref name=cyr&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyr |first=Mireille |last2=Wrighta |first2=S John |last3=McDuffa |first3=Pierre |last4=Perron |first4=Alain |title=Intrafamilial sexual abuse: brother–sister incest does not differ from father–daughter and stepfather–stepdaughter incest |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=26 |issue=9 |date=September 2002 |pages=957–973 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(02)00365-4 |pmid=12433139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between consenting adults===
Sexual activity between adult close relatives is sometimes ascribed to [[genetic sexual attraction]].&lt;ref name="guardian2002"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hari |first=Johann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4331603,00.html |title=Forbidden love |date=2002-01-09 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of incest has not been widely reported, but evidence has indicated that this behavior does take place, possibly more often than many people realize.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt; Internet [[chatroom]]s and topical websites exist that provide support for incestuous couples.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt;

Proponents of incest between consenting adults draw clear boundaries between the behavior of consenting adults and rape, child molestation, and abusive incest.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt; However, even consensual relationships such as these are still legally classified as incest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202053600/http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-02-02 |author=Roffee, James |year=2015 |title=When Yes Actually Means Yes |pages=72–91 |doi=10.1057/9781137476159.0009 |journal=Rape Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criminalized in almost all jurisdictions {{crossref| (see [[Laws regarding incest]] for exceptions)}}.

According to one incest participant who was quoted for an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'':

{{bq|1=You can't help who you fall in love with, it just happens. I fell in love with my sister and I'm not ashamed ... I only feel sorry for my mom and dad, I wish they could be happy for us. We love each other. It's nothing like some old man who tries to fuck his three-year-old, that's evil and disgusting ... Of course we're consenting, that's the most important thing. We're not fucking perverts. What we have is the most beautiful thing in the world.&lt;ref name="guardian2002"/&gt;}}

In ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', [[William Saletan]] drew a legal connection between gay sex and incest between consenting adults.&lt;ref name="slate2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2081904/ |title=Incest Repellent? If gay sex is private, why isn't incest? |last=Saletan |first=William |authorlink=William Saletan |date=2003-04-23 |publisher=''[[Slate Magazine]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he described in his article, in 2003, U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]] commented on a pending U.S. Supreme Court case involving sodomy laws (primarily as a matter of [[Civil and political rights|constitutional rights]] to [[Right to privacy#United States|privacy]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection under the law]]):

{{bq|1="If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery."&lt;ref name="slate2003" /&gt;}}

Saletan argued that, legally and morally, there is essentially no difference between the two, and went on to support incest between consenting adults being covered by a legal right to privacy.&lt;ref name="slate2003" /&gt; [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA]] law professor [[Eugene Volokh]] has made similar arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/2010/12/12/incest/ |title=Incest |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |date=December 12, 2010 |work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent article, Saletan said that incest is wrong because it introduces the possibility of irreparably damaging family units by introducing "a notoriously incendiary dynamic—sexual tension—into the mix".&lt;ref name="slt10"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html |title=Incest Is Cancer |last=Saletan |first=William |date=Dec 14, 2010 |work=Slate |accessdate=30 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430151843/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html |archive-date=30 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aunts, uncles, nieces or nephews====
{{see also|Avunculate marriage}}
In the [[Netherlands]], marrying one's nephew or niece is legal, but only with the explicit permission of the Dutch Government, due to the possible risk of [[genetic defects]] among the offspring. Nephew-niece marriages predominantly occur among foreign immigrants. In November 2008, the Christian Democratic (CDA) party's Scientific Institute announced that it wanted a ban on marriages between nephews and nieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2008/11/gates-of-vienna-news-feed-11262008.html|title=Gates of Vienna News Feed 11/26/2008|first=Baron|last=Bodissey|date=26 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consensual sex between adults (persons of 18 years and older) is always lawful in the Netherlands and Belgium, even among closely related family members. Sexual acts between an adult family member and a minor are illegal, though they are not classified as incest, but as abuse of the authority such an adult has over a minor, comparable to that of a teacher, coach or priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfri.be/incest-strafbaar |title=is incest strafbaar ? &amp;#124; Goede raad is goud waard - Advocatenkantoor Elfri De Neve |publisher=Elfri.be |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2013-07-30|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, consensual adult sexual intercourse with someone known to be your aunt, uncle, niece or nephew constitutes a felony of the third degree.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law - Page 200, John M. Scheb - 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other states also commonly prohibit marriages between such kin.&lt;ref&gt;Family Law in the USA - Page 207, Lynn Dennis Wardle, Laurence C.

In the United Kingdom, incest includes only sexual intercourse with a parent, grandparent, child or sibling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incest by a man.|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/4-5/69/part/I/crossheading/incest|work=Sexual Offences Act 1956|publisher=National Archives UK|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the more recently introduced offence of "sex with an adult relative" extends also as far as half-siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Offences Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/64|work=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives of United Kingdom|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term 'incest' however remains widely used in popular culture to describe any form of sexual activity with a relative.

====Between adult siblings====
{{main|Sibling incest}}
The most public case of consensual adult sibling incest in recent years is the case of a brother-sister couple from Germany, [[Patrick Stübing]] and Susan Karolewski. Because of violent behavior on the part of his father, Patrick was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister Susan for the first time. The now-adult Patrick moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the siblings became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated [[prosecution]]s and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' states that the couple are happy together. According to court records, the first three children have mental and physical disabilities, and have been placed in foster care.&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt; In April 2012, at the [[European Court of Human Rights]], Patrick Stübing lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/13/world/europe/germany-incest-court/index.html?hpt=hp_bn2|title=German incest couple lose European court case - CNN|first=By the CNN Wire|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECtHR judgment"&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=905957&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Judgment] on the ''Stübing vs. Germany'' case.

Some societies differentiate between full sibling and half sibling relations. In ancient societies, full sibling and half sibling marriages occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall, Bruce W.

There are some cultures in Asia which stigmatize cousin marriage, in some instances even marriages between second cousins or more remotely related people. This is notably true in the culture of [[Korea]]. In South Korea, before 1997, anyone with the same last name and clan were prohibited from marriage. In light of this law being held unconstitutional, South Korea now only prohibits up to third cousins (see [[Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code]]). [[Hmong people|Hmong]] culture prohibits the marriage of anyone with the same last name – to do so would result in being shunned by the entire community, and they are usually stripped of their last name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kgaGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=Hmong+culture+prohibits+the+marriage+of+anyone+with+the+same+last+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e8m1_KU0qe&amp;sig=vXdn3cHbipJu-ldp-4b7PmtLh0k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLrOnUo-TdAhXm6oMKHcdSAEsQ6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hmong%20culture%20prohibits%20the%20marriage%20of%20anyone%20with%20the%20same%20last%20name&amp;f=false|title=Hmong Refugees in the New World: Culture, Community and Opportunity|last=Vang|first=Christopher Thao|date=2016-05-16|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=9781476622620|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Hindu]] communities in India prohibit cousin marriages.

====Defined through marriage====
Some cultures include relatives by marriage in incest prohibitions; these relationships are called [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] rather than [[consanguinity]]. For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|deceased wife's sister]] was the subject of long and fierce debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, involving, among others, [[Matthew Boulton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollak |first=Ellen |title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684–1814 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore MD |year=2003 |page=38 |isbn=0-8018-7204-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tann |first=Jennifer |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |date=May 2007 |chapter=Boulton, Matthew (1728–1809)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles La Trobe]]. The marriages were entered into in Scotland and Switzerland respectively, where they were legal. In medieval Europe, standing as a [[godparent]] to a child also created a bond of affinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to "raise up seed to him" (per {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5–6|HE}}).  Some societies have long practiced [[sororal polygyny]], a form of [[polygamy]] in which a man marries multiple wives who are sisters to each other (though not closely related to him).

In Islamic law, marriage among close blood relations like parents, stepparent, parents in-law, siblings, stepsiblings, the children of siblings, aunts and uncles is prohibited, while first or second cousins may marry. Marrying the widow of a brother, or the sister of deceased or divorced wife is also allowed.

==Inbreeding==
{{Main|Inbreeding}}
Offspring of biologically related parents are subject to the possible impact of inbreeding. Such offspring have a higher possibility of [[Congenital disorder|congenital birth defects]] (see [[Coefficient of relationship]]) because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are [[homozygous]] for deleterious [[recessive allele]]s that produce such disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livingstone |first=F. B. |year=1969 |title=Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=10 |pages=45–62 |doi=10.1086/201009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Inbreeding depression]]). Because most such [[allele]]s are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives [[Coefficient of relationship|share a large fraction of their alleles]], the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. This has two contrary effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thornhill |first=Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-79854-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the short term, because incestuous reproduction increases [[zygosity]], deleterious recessive alleles will express themselves more frequently, leading to increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.
* In the long run, however, because of this increased exposure of deleterious recessive alleles to [[natural selection]], their frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population, leading to a "healthier" population (with fewer deleterious recessive alleles).
The closer two persons are related, the higher the zygosity, and thus the more severe the biological costs of inbreeding. This fact likely explains why inbreeding between close relatives, such as siblings, is less common than inbreeding between cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Lieberman |first2=Debra |last3=Santtila |first3=Pekka |title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |pages=e50613 |pmid=23209792 |pmc=3509093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases. Thus, similar [[immune system]]s may be more vulnerable to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]).&lt;ref name=moral&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lieberman |first1=D. |last2=Tooby |first2=J. |last3=Cosmides |first3=L. |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2290 |title=Does morality have a biological basis?

==Laws==
{{Main|Laws regarding incest}}

Laws regarding sexual activity between close relatives vary considerably between jurisdictions, and depend on the type of sexual activity and the nature of the family relationship of the parties involved, as well as the age and sex of the parties. Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while others also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Spain]]. [[Sweden]] is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6424337.stm Incest: an age-old taboo]. BBC. 12 March 2007. retrieved 22 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While the legality of consensual incest varies by country, sexual assault committed against a relative is usually seen as a very serious crime. In some legal systems, the fact of a perpetrator being a close relative to the victim constitutes an [[aggravating circumstance]] in the case of sexual crimes such as [[rape]] and [[child sexual abuse|sexual conduct with a minor]] – this is the case in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;See Articles 218-221 of the [[Penal Code of Romania#The Penal Code of 2014|Romanian Penal Code]] [http://www.avocatura.com/ll491-noul-cod-penal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

===Jewish===

According to the Torah, per [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0318.htm Leviticus 18], "the children of Israel"—Israelite men and women alike—are forbidden from sexual relations between people who are "near of kin" (cf. verse 6), who are defined as:

# Parents and children (cf. verse 7)
# Siblings and half siblings (cf. verses 9 and 11). Relationships between these are particularly singled out for a curse in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0527.htm Deuteronomy 27], and they are of the only two kinds incestuous relationships that are among the particularly-singled-out relationships—with the other particularly-singled-out relationships being ones of non-incestuous family betrayal (cf. verse 20) and bestiality (cf. verse 21)
# Grandparents and grandchildren (cf. verse 10)
# Aunts and nephews, uncles and nieces, etc. (cf. verses 12–14).&lt;ref&gt;Also see  the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]]' [https://ccarnet.org/responsa/142-marriage-mothers-sister-or-half-sister-aunt-or/ Responsum 142].&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships between these are the second kind of relationships that are particularly singled out for a curse in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0527.htm Deuteronomy 27], and the explicit examples of children-in-law and mothers-in-law (cf. verse 23) serves to remind the Israelites that [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0436.htm the parents-in-law are also (or at least should be also) the children-in-laws' aunts and uncles]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying: 'The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded concerning the daughters of [[Zelophehad]], saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Incestuous relationships are considered so severe among [[Chillul Hashem|''chillulim HaShem'']], acts which bring shame to the name of God, as to be, along with the other forbidden relationships that are mentioned in Leviticus 18, punishable by death as specified in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0320.htm Leviticus 20].

In the 4th century BCE, the [[Soferim]] (''scribes'') declared that there were relationships within which marriage constituted incest, in addition to those mentioned by the Torah. These additional relationships were termed ''seconds'' (Hebrew: ''sheniyyot''), and included the wives of a man's grandfather and grandson.&lt;ref name="TosYeb23"&gt;''Yebamot' ([[Tosefta]]) 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; The classical rabbis prohibited marriage between a man and any of these ''seconds'' of his, on the basis that doing so would act as a ''safeguard'' against infringing the biblical incest rules,&lt;ref name="Yeb21a"&gt;Yebamot 21a&lt;/ref&gt; although there was inconclusive debate about exactly what the limits should be for the definition of ''seconds''.&lt;ref name="JewEncInce"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=incest|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=126&amp;letter=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriages that are forbidden in the Torah (with the exception of uncle-niece marriages) were regarded by the rabbis of the Middle Ages as invalid – as if they had never occurred;&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA"&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch|Shulchan 'Aruk]]'', ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 16, 1&lt;/ref&gt; any children born to such a couple were regarded as [[mamzer|bastards under Jewish law]],&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt; and the relatives of the spouse were not regarded as forbidden relations for a further marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot 94b&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, those relationships which were prohibited due to qualifying as ''seconds'', and so forth, were regarded as wicked, but still valid;&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt; while they might have pressured such a couple to divorce, any children of the union were still seen as legitimate.&lt;ref name="EbenezerSA" /&gt;

===Christian===
The [[Catholic Church]] does not generally permit the marriage if a doubt exists on whether the potential spouses are related by blood relations in any degree of the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3Y.HTM Code of Canon Law]. Can. 1091&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of incest varied throughout history.  The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] held in 1215 attempted to codify that marriage was forbidden up to and including third cousins, though permissible beyond this for fourth cousins, third cousins once removed, etc.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], marriages are banned between second cousins or closer and between second uncles / aunts and second nieces / nephews (between first cousins once removed) or closer. Marrying one's godparent or deceased spouse's sibling is also prohibited, although marrying one's stepchild is not – e.g. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] exercised his right to marry his stepdaughter after her mother's (his first wife's) death.

The [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] allows marriages up to and including first cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/|year=1962|place=Canada|title=Book of Common Prayer|chapter=A Table of Kindred and Affinity|chapterurl=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/kindred-and-affinity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s book ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', a 5th Century AD book of Christian philosophy, he claimed that the children of Adam and Eve must have married each other in order to produce offspring.

===Islamic===

===Hindu===
[[Rigveda]] regard incest to be "evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Flaherty |first=Wendy Doniger |title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology |page=7 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] speaks of incest in abhorrent terms. Hindus believe there are both [[karmic]] and practical bad effects of incest and thus practice strict rules of both [[endogamy]] and [[exogamy]], in relation to the family tree (''[[gotra]]'') or bloodline (''[[Pravaras|Pravara]]'').
Marriage within the ''gotra'' (''swagotra'' marriages) are banned under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system.&lt;ref&gt;"There can be no matrimony between the sects of Gehlawat and Kadiyan as they have a 'brotherhood' akin to consanguinity."[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/ "Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage"]. ''Indian Express''. July 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People within the ''gotra'' are regarded as kin and marrying such a person would be thought of as incest. Marriage with paternal cousins (a form of [[Parallel and cross cousins|parallel-cousin]] relationship) is strictly prohibited. 

Although generally marriages between persons having the same ''gotra'' are prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z'', James G. Lochtefeld, Rosen Publishing Group, 2002; p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; how this is defined may vary regionally.
Depending on culture and [[Indian caste system|caste]] of the population in the region, marriage may be restricted up to seven generations of ''gotra'' of father, mother, and grandmother.  In a few rural areas, marriage is banned within same local community is only allowed with those from outside of the community, as they consider a small village to be like brothers and sisters of one large family. These rules are strictly enforced and a couple breaking them is violently punished sometimes. &lt;ref&gt;"In India these rules are reproduced in the form of that one must not marry within the Gotra, but not without the caste" [http://www.sanathanadharma.com/samskaras/marriage/mar3.htm#Limitations "Limitations of Marriage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103062452/http://www.sanathanadharma.com/samskaras/marriage/mar3.htm |date=2010-11-03 }}. sanathanadharma.com&lt;/ref&gt; The seven-generation prohibition in some areas is only applied to paternal descent, with ''gotra'' is transferred down the male lineage; in these areas, the ''gotra'' of a female changes upon marriage (i.e., upon marriage a woman would belong to her husband's lineage).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', one of the two great [[Hindu Epics]], [[Arjuna]] took as his fourth wife his first and [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross cousin]] [[Subhadra]], the sister of [[Krishna]]. Arjuna had gone into exile alone after having disturbed [[Yudhishthira]] and [[Draupadi]] in their private quarters. It was during the last part of his exile, while staying at the Dvaraka residence of his cousins, that he fell in love with Subhadra. While eating at the home of [[Balarama]], Arjuna was struck with Subhadra's beauty and decided he would obtain her as his wife. Subhadra and Arjuna's son was the tragic hero [[Abhimanyu]]. According to Andhra Pradesh oral tradition, Abhimanyu himself married his first cross cousin Shashirekha, the daughter of Subhadra's brother [[Balarama]]. Cross-cousin marriages are evident from Arjuna's marriage with Subhadra, [[Pradyumna]]'s (Eldest son of Krishna) marriage with Rukmi's (brother of [[Rukmini]]) daughter. Also, Krishna married his cross cousin [[Mitravinda]] (daughter of [[Vasudeva]]'s sister Rajadhi who was queen of Avanti) and Bhadra (daughter of Vasudeva's sister Shrutakirti who was the queen of Kekaya Kingdom.)

[[Livestock]] breeders often practice controlled breeding to eliminate undesirable characteristics within a population, which is also coupled with [[culling]] of what is considered unfit offspring, especially when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock.

Although Malaysia inherited the political system of [[British India]] based on the [[Westminster system]], which made no provision for judicial review, the [[Federal Constitution of Malaysia]] instituted a system based on that of [[India]] which was in turn influenced by other constitutions including that of the [[United States]]. Judges are empowered to declare laws or executive actions ''[[ultra vires]]'' if they clashed with the Constitution and/or the parent legislation. However, this power was curbed after the [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]] by then [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] through amendments to the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/countries/Malaysia/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-Political%20Forces "Country Briefing: Malaysia"]. (Oct. 13, 2005). ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly significant amendment was the removal of the judicial power and subjecting the judiciary to such jurisdiction and powers as may be conferred by or under federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{ws |"[[s:Constitution of Malaysia#Article 121|Article_121]] of the Constitution of Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merits of detentions made under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] are also not subject to judicial review, but the procedures are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/09/28/malays11788.htm "Malaysia: ISA Detainees Beaten and Humiliated"].

{{LGBT rights}}
'''LGBT adoption''' is the [[adoption]] of children by [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people. This may be in the form of a joint adoption by a [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couple]], adoption by one partner of a same-sex couple of the other's biological child (step-child adoption) and adoption by a single LGBT person. Joint adoption by same-sex couples is legal in 27 countries and in some sub-national territories. Furthermore, 5 countries have legalized some form of step-child adoption. Given that constitutions and statutes usually do not address the adoption rights of LGBT persons, judicial decisions often determine whether they can serve as parents either individually or as couples.

Some scientific research indicates that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well or even better than the children of opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/1/349.full|title=The Effects of Marriage, Civil Union, and Domestic Partnership Laws on the Health and Well-being of Children|publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|date=|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ama-assn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=AMA Policy Regarding Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2005_SameSexMarriage.pdf|title=Position Statement on Support of Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Civil Marriage|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/Statement-on-Marriage-and-the-family.cfm?renderforprint=1|title=Statement on Marriage and the Family|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|date=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2002_Adoption.pdf|title=Position Statement on Adoption and Co-parenting of Children by Same-sex Couples |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|year=2002|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="San Diego Gay and Lesbian News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdgln.com/news/2010/08/11/apa-reaffirms-support-same-sex-marriage|title=The APA reaffirms support for same-sex marriage|publisher=[[San Diego Gay and Lesbian News]]|date=|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aannet.org/assets/docs/marriage%20equality_7-26%2012f.pdf|title=Support for Marriage Equality|publisher=[[American Academy of Nursing]]|date=July 2012|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cpa2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf|title=Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|archivedate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apsp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf |title=Elizabeth Short, Damien W.

{{Main|LGBT parenting}}
The existing body of research on outcomes for children with LGBT parents includes limited studies that consider the specific case of adoption. Moreover, where studies do mention adoption they often fail to distinguish between outcomes for unrelated children versus those in their original family or step-families, causing research on the more general case of LGBT parenting to be used to counter the claims of LGBT-adoption opponents.&lt;ref name="Charlotte Patterson 2007, pg. 2"/&gt; One study has addressed the question directly, evaluating the outcomes of adoptees less than 3-years old who had been placed in one of 56 lesbian and gay households since infancy. Despite the small sample, and the fact that the children have yet to become aware of their adoption status or the dynamics of gender development, the study found no significant associations between parental sexual orientation and child adjustment!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~cjp/articles/ffp10b.pdf|title=Parenting and Child Development in Adoptive Families: Does Parental Sexual Orientation Matter?|format=PDF|journal=[[Applied Developmental Science (journal)|Applied Developmental Science]]|department=[[Psychology Press]]|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|volume=14|issue=3|year=2010|pages=164–178|doi=10.1080/10888691.2010.500958|issn=1088-8691|last1=Farr|first1=Rachel H|last2=Forssell|first2=Stephen L|last3=Patterson|first3=Charlotte J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==

===Arguments===
Adoption of children by LGBT people is an issue of active debate. In the United States, for example, legislation to stop the practice has been introduced in many jurisdictions; such efforts have largely been defeated. Prior to 1973, state courts commonly barred gay and lesbian individuals from holding a parenting role, especially through adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Karla|title=Adoption by Homosexuals: A Look at Differing State Court Opinions|journal=Heinonline|publisher=Arizona Board of Regents/Arizona Law Review|date=Winter 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is agreement between the debating parties, however, that the [[Best interests|welfare of children]] alone should dictate policy.&lt;ref name="Charlotte Patterson 2007, pg. 2"&gt;Charlotte Patterson, et. al, "Adolescents with Same-Sex Parents: Findings from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 7 November 2007, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of LGBT adoption suggest that many children are in need of homes and claim that since parenting ability is unrelated to sexual orientation, the law should allow them to adopt children.&lt;ref name="Charlotte Patterson 2007, pg. 2"/&gt; Opponents, on the other hand, suggest that the alleged greater prevalence of depression, drug use, promiscuity and suicide among homosexuals (and alleged greater prevalence of domestic violence) might affect children&lt;ref&gt;William Satetan,[http://www.slate.com/id/2061789/ Adopting Premises], ''Slate'', 7 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or that the absence of male and female role models during a child's development could cause maladjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonmoyes.com/2009/02/26/parliamentary-inquiries-same-sex-adoption/|title=Gordon Moyes|publisher=Gordon Moyes|date=26 February 2009|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Answers]], a Catholic religious group, in its 2004 report on gay marriage addressed parenting by homosexual partners via adoption or artificial insemination. It pointed to studies finding higher than average abuse rates among heterosexual stepparent families compared with same-sex parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Special Report: Gay Marriage|publisher=Catholic Answers|year=2004|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/gay_marriage.asp|at=note 63|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303104941/http://www.catholic.com/library/gay_marriage.asp|archivedate=3 March 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-04196-021|title=Is the "Cinderella Effect" Controversial?|author1=Daly, Martin|author2=Wilson, Margo|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]/[[American Psychological Association]]|journal=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2008|editor1=C. Crawford|editor2=D. Krebs|pages=383–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychological Association notes that an ongoing longitudinal study found that none of the lesbian mothers had abused their children. It states that fears of a heightened risk of sexual abuse by gay parents are not supported by research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting-full.pdf|title=Lesbian &amp; Gay Parenting|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|page=12|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several professional organizations have made statements in defense of adoption by same-sex couples. The [[American Psychological Association]] has supported adoption by same-sex couples, citing social prejudice as harming the psychological health of lesbians and gays while noting there is no evidence that their parenting causes harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paige|first=R.

===Africa===

====South Africa====
[[South Africa]] is the only African country to allow joint adoption by same-sex couples. The 2002 decision of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] in the case of ''[[Du Toit v Minister of Welfare and Population Development]]'' amended the Child Care Act, 1983 to allow both joint adoption and stepparent adoption by "permanent same-sex life partners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lesbians, gays can adopt children|newspaper=news24|date=10 September 2002|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Lesbians-gays-can-adopt-children-20020910|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Child Care Act has since been replaced by the [[Children's Act, 2005]], which allows joint adoption by "partners in a permanent domestic life-partnership", whether same- or opposite-sex, and stepparent adoption by a person who is the "permanent domestic life-partner" of the child's current parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centreforchildlaw.co.za/images/files/mediaguides/childrens_act_media_guide.pdf|title=A Media Guide to the Children's Act 38 of 2005|publisher=Centre for Child Law; Media Monitoring Project|year=2008|author=Lynley Donelly|accessdate=8 October 2017|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|Same-sex marriage]] has been legal since 2006, and is equivalent to opposite-sex marriage for all purposes, including adoption.

On 24 November 2011, the Coahuila Supreme Court struck down the state's law barring same-sex couples from adopting, urging the state's legislature to amend the adoption law as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Coahuila"&gt;{{cite web|author=José Reyes|publisher=Vanguardia|title=Adopción gay será posible en Coahuila|date=28 November 2011|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/adopciongayseraposibleencoahuila-1158988.html|accessdate=14 February 2012|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 2014, the state's congress overwhelmingly approved the measure more than two years following the supreme court decision.&lt;ref name="Coahuila adoption"/&gt;

On 3 February 2017 the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|SCJN]] emitted tesis 08/2017 in which it is stated that the family of the LGBT community doesn't end with a couple, but that it also extends onto the right to have and raise children. Therefore, LGBT couples wishing to form a family and adopt children will be legally protected and can't be limited by any governmental entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdpnoticias.com/gay/2017/02/02/aprueba-scjn-derecho-a-la-vida-familiar-para-parejas-lgbti|title=Aprueba SCJN derecho a la vida familiar para parejas LGBTI|trans-title=SCJN approves right to family life for LGBTQ couples|language=es|date=2 June 2017|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the law was signed by President and took effect.&lt;ref name="americasquarterly.org"/&gt; According to Equipos Mori Poll's, 53% of Uruguayans are opposed to same sex adoption against 39% that support it.

===Asia===
LGBT rights for adoption of children in Asia are almost inexistent, except in [[LGBT rights in Israel|Israel]]. Some Asian countries still criminalise same-sex activities, do not have anti-[[violence against LGBT people|discrimination]] laws, which are an obstacle from legislating for LGBT adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carrie Craft|title=Gay Adoption Basics|url=http://adoption.about.com/od/adopting/tp/gayadoptionbasics.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2005 ruling of the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] allowed stepchild adoptions for same-sex couples. Israel previously allowed limited co-guardianship rights for non-biological parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/01/011005isAdopt.htm|title=Gay News From|publisher=365gay.com|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, a court in [[Israel]] ruled that same-sex couples were now permitted to adopt a child regardless of whether the child is biologically related or not to either parent.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/ag-okays-wider-adoption-rights-for-same-sex-couples-1.239054|title=AG okays wider adoption rights for same-sex couples|author=Yuval Yoaz|date=12 February 2008|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a watershed in granting [[Egalitarianism|equal rights]] to all [[gay]] people in Israel.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;In Switzerland step-child adoption law went into effect on 1 January 2018.&lt;/small&gt;]]
In February 2006, [[France]]'s [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] ruled that both partners in a same-sex relationship can have parental rights over one partner's biological child. The result came from a case where a woman tried to give parental rights of her two daughters to her partner, with whom she was in a civil union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007052082 Ruling] of the Court of Cassation, first civil chamber, on recourse 04-17090&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of adoption, however, in February 2007, the same court ruled against a lesbian couple where one partner tried to adopt the child of the other partner. The court stated that the woman's partner cannot be recognized unless the mother withdrew her own parental rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000017636127|title=04-15676|language=fr|publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr|date=20 February 2007|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000017636211|title=06-15647|language=fr|publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr|date=20 February 2007|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May 2013, French President [[François Hollande]] signed into law the bill that opened marriage and adoption rights linked to it for same sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/french-president-signs-gay-marriage-into-law/2013/05/18/69a88f60-bff0-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html|author=Angela Charlton|title=French President Signs Gay Marriage Into Law|work=Washington Post|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a [[nursery school]] teacher from [[Lons-le-Saunier]], living as a couple with another woman, had applied for an authorization to adopt a child from the ''[[département]]'' (local government) of [[Jura (department)|Jura]]. The adoption board recommended against the authorization because the child would lack a paternal reference, and thus the president of the ''département'' ruled against the authorization.&lt;ref name="EB v. France"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#|title=HUDOC – European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was appealed before the administrative courts and ended before the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], acting as supreme administrative court, which ruled against the woman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Council of State (France)]], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?idTexte=CETATEXT000008117315 ruling 230533]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] concluded that these actions and this ruling were a violation of Article 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] taken in conjunction with Article 8.&lt;ref name="EB v.

On 2 June 2006, the Icelandic Parliament unanimously passed a proposal accepting adoption, parenting and assisted insemination treatment for same-sex couples on the same basis as heterosexual couples. The law went into effect on 27 June 2006.

In [[Bulgaria]], according to the Ministry of Justice the laws regarding adoption "lack a norm, concerning the sexual orientation of the individuals". Therefore, a single gay person or same-sex couples may adopt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adoption-bg.com/page/faqs|title=Frequently asked question – adoptions from Bulgaria|publisher=Family National Association|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adoption-bg.com/|title=Adoption from Bulgaria Family National Association Adoption from Bulgaria|publisher=Family National Association|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2013, the Portuguese parliament approved a bill in first reading allowing "co-adoption" of the biological or adopted child of the same-sex spouse or partner, where that spouse or partner is the only legally recognized parent of the child (e.g. the mother with the natural father not being registered). However, in October 2013 members of parliament opposed to the bill proposed a referendum on the issue and killed a motion to have the second vote in the plenary;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://exame.abril.com.br/mundo/noticias/conservadores-barram-direito-de-adocao-a-casais-gays Conservadores barram direito de adoção a casais gays]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parlamento.pt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.pt/ActividadeParlamentar/Paginas/DetalheIniciativa.aspx?BID=37202|title=Assambleia da República – Status of Bill 278/XII|publisher=Portuguese Parliament|language=pt|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the motion on the possible referendum was then considered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.pt/ActividadeParlamentar/Paginas/DetalheIniciativa.aspx?BID=38023|title=Assambleia da República – Status of Draft Resolution 857/XII|language=pt|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]] declared it unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.pt/tc/acordaos/20140176.html|title=Decision 176/2014|language=pt|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2014, the original bill was rejected in second reading.&lt;ref name="parlamento.pt"/&gt; On 20 November 2015, 5 proposals from several left-wing parties were voted favourably by the new parliament as result of 4 October General Elections.&lt;ref name="parlamento.pt"/&gt;

In July 2014 through [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Croatia|Life Partnership Act]] [[Croatia]] recognized an institution similar to step-child adoption called partner-guardian. A partner who is not a biological parent of a child can share parental responsibilities with a biological parent or parents if they agree to it, or if the court decides it is in the best interest of a child. Additionally, a biological parent or parents can temporarily give a partner who is not a biological parent full parental responsibilities. A partner who is not a biological parent can also gain permanent parental responsibilities through an institution of partner-guardian if both biological parents of a child have died, or exceptionally if a second biological parent of a child is unknown, and if the court decides it is in the best interest of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zakon.hr/z/732/Zakon-o-%C5%BEivotnom-partnerstvu-osoba-istog-spola|title=Zakon o životnom partnerstvu osoba istog spola|language=hr|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the Constitutional Court of Austria found the existing laws on adoption to be unconstitutional and ordered the laws to be changed by 31 December 2015 to allow joint adoption by same-sex couples in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vienna.at/adoptionsverbot-fuer-homosexuelle-partner-aufgehoben/4202709|title=Adoptionsverbot für homosexuelle Partner aufgehoben|trans-title=Adoption ban for homosexual partners lifted|publisher=Vienna Online|language=de|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=23025|title=Österreich: Adoptionsverbot für Homo-Paare verfassungswidrig|trans-title=Austria: Adoption ban for homosexual couples is unconstitutional|publisher=Queer.de|language=de|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2015, the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 passed by Parliament in March 2015 which extends full adoption rights to cohabiting couples and those in civil partnerships was promulgated by the President of Ireland.

On 20 November 2015 the Portuguese Parliament approved; by 141 votes against 87 with 2 abstentions; a diploma presented by all the parties (except the right-wing [[Portugal Ahead|PàF]]) to allow same-sex adoption. On 26 January 2016, the [[conservative]] Portuguese President [[Anibal Cavaco Silva]] vetoed the bill and a week later the Portuguese Parliament overridden the veto. The law went into effect on 1 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/portugals-outgoing-president-vetoes-gay-adoption-bill-165320164.html|title=Portugal's outgoing president vetoes gay adoption bill|agency=AFP|publisher=Yahoo!

On 22 June 2016 the [[Italy|Italian]] Supreme Court of Cassation upheld a lower court's decision to approve a request for a lesbian to adopt her partner's daughter. Prosecutors had appealed against the decision by the [[Rome]] court of appeal. Decisions by the supreme court set a precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/06/22/supreme-court-oks-stepchild-adoption-2_95fc5b74-30d1-4e49-9fa5-4f774b0c31f4.html|title=Supreme court OKs stepchild adoption (2)|agency=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|date=22 June 2016|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
{{See also|LGBT rights in Australia}}In [[Australia]], same-sex adoption is legal in all states and territories since April 2018.

====New Zealand====
{{See also|LGBT rights in New Zealand}}
The [[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]], which came into force on 19 August 2013, allowed [[same-sex marriage in New Zealand|same-sex marriage]] and permitted married same-sex couples to jointly adopt children. Previously, an LGBT individual was able to adopt children, but same-sex couples could not adopt jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Isaac Davidson|title=Marriage bill leaves a few inequalities to sort out|date=20 April 2013|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10878614|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are no specific barriers preventing an LGBT individual from adopting children, except that a male individual cannot adopt a female child. The same-sex marriage law became effective from 19 August 2013, and since then married same-sex couples were able to adopt children jointly. Unmarried couples of any sex and couples in a civil union can now jointly adopt children, under a [[New Zealand High Court]] ruling in December 2015. The ban breached the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]].&lt;ref name="gaynz.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://vawnet.org/news/same-sex-defacto-couples-secure-right-adopt-gaynzcom-12212015|title=Same-sex defacto couples secure the right to adopt from GayNZ.com, 12/21/2015|publisher=VAW|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum age to adopt in New Zealand is 20 years for a related child, and 25 years or the child's age plus 20 years (whichever is greater) for an unrelated child.

In the law of the sale of [[property]] (both [[real estate]] and [[personal property]] or [[Personal property|chattels]]) a '''latent defect''' is a fault in the property that could not have been discovered by a reasonably thorough inspection before the sale.

The general law of the sale of property is [[caveat emptor]] (let the buyer beware) and buyers are under a general duty to inspect their purchase before taking [[Possession (law)|possession]].  However, it is understood at law that inspection is often not sufficient to detect certain deficiencies in the product that can only be discovered through destructive testing or other means that a seller could not reasonably be expected to allow under normal conditions.  For example, wood beams and interior brickwork often cannot be fully assessed without destructive testing, and it would be unreasonable for the seller to allow the buyer to destroy part of the property in order to discover such defects.

As such, the law expects that buyers will protect themselves in the sales [[contract]] against defects they cannot possibly be expected to assess prior to purchase.  As such, the term "latent defect" is often used as part of the guarantee clauses in a sales contract so that the buyer can recover damages from the seller if defects turn up in the property after the sale.  For example, the seller may be required to pay for repairs of any such damage.

In Common Law, there is no automatic right for a buyer to claim against a seller for such latent defects when they are discovered, absent an agreement in contract.  Civil Law in some jurisdictions (Quebec, Canada) does provide for such an automatic right unless a property is sold "without guarantee" as to its quality.  However, if a latent defect is discovered, there is often a presumption against the seller when a claim is made in misrepresentation that the seller knew about the latent defect.  As such, the seller is required to show that he or she could not possibly have known of the defect, rather than the buyer having to show that the seller did know about the defect.  However, if it can be shown the seller could not have known about the defect (and was not [[willful blindness|wilfully blind]] to the possibility) then the buyer's claim will not succeed.

However, when the defect could have been discovered by the buyer by a thorough inspection (a "[[patent defect]]"), the buyer cannot possibly succeed in a claim against the seller unless the seller actively took steps to hide the defect from a normal inspection.

In all cases, where a seller actively [[misrepresentation|misrepresents]] the condition of the property, such as by taking steps to make an inspection impossible or by lying about problems when directly asked, the buyer will almost always succeed unless it can be shown that the buyer was independently aware of the defect and completed the transaction nevertheless.

In construction contracting a latent defect is defined as a defect which exists at the time of acceptance but cannot be discovered by a reasonable inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acquisition.gov/far/97/pdf/46.pdf |title=Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) PART 46—QUALITY ASSURANCE |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085608/http://www.acquisition.gov/far/97/pdf/46.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leximetrics''' is a field which attempts to rank the strength or weaknesses of laws, by assigning a numerical value to each type of [[law]] in a particular field. The law's numbers are then used to compare the efficacy of different legal systems, and how these numbers correlate with particular goals such as [[economic growth]] or [[employment]].

==History==
The term leximetrics was first coined by Robert Cooter and Tom Ginsburg, drawing on their comparative law studies.&lt;ref&gt;“Leximetrics: Why the Same Laws are Longer in Some Countries than Others” (2003), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=456520&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt to assign numerical values to rules in different legal systems, to evaluate their perceived strength or weakness, was made by a group of finance economists called [[Rafael La Porta]], [[Florencio Lopez de Silanes]], [[Andrei Shleifer]], and [[Robert W. Vishny]]. In work that was commissioned by the [[World Bank]], and with views consistent with the [[Washington Consensus]], they collated information on a select number of shareholder rights. They believed they could show that the protection of shareholder rights correlated with, and probably caused, more efficient market economies. They also argued that, according to their [[legal origins theory]], [[common law]] systems were better at protecting shareholder rights than [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, on the whole. With other people involved later, these studies were extended to [[labour law]], and [[constitutional law]] protections for property, and other issues which concerned the researchers.

La Porta, Lopez, Shleifer and Vishny's studies, although picked up by the World Bank and the [[International Monetary Fund]], were widely criticised for failing to disclose their methodology adequately, misunderstanding the law in multiple jurisdictions, oversimplifying complex legal problems, and bias. Before long other researchers, such as those at the [[Cambridge Judge Business School]], Centre for Business Research, led by [[Simon Deakin]], began undertaking parallel studies. These sought to do the same work but more accurately, and usually came to the opposite conclusions. For example, it was found that when measured more accurately, and over time, common law countries were not outperformed by civil law countries in various shareholders protection measures, and that labour law was in fact positive for economic development in most cases.

The field of work has continued to attract substantial academic interest.

==Methodology and criticism==
A common criticism of leximetrics, particularly among the legal profession, is that it fails to capture the complexity of legal issues, and by reducing the "strength" of laws to a numerical value, may well miss the practical effects of the law. For example, as the corporate law Professor [[John C. Coffee]] has put it, put it, public enforcement of [[directors' duties]] remains necessary despite the work carried out by [[Rafael La Porta]], [[Florencio Lopez de Silanes]], [[Andrei Shleifer]] and [[Robert W. Vishny]], because it is more effective. "This is a description," says Coffee, "quite at odds with LLS and V, who favor private enforcement (but do not understand it)..."&lt;ref&gt;JC Coffee, 'The Law and the Markets: the Impact of Enforcement' (2007) 156(2) University of Pennsylvania Law Review 229, 304-305&lt;/ref&gt;

Leximetric studies usually involve researchers with limited amounts of time to spend on each country's law that they examine, the researchers may or may not be lawyers, and may or may not be acquainted with the dozens of jurisdictions they study, even if the person leading the research is themselves a highly qualified lawyer. Even then, the assessment of whether a law is strong or not depends on an independent judgement. Numbers tend to indicate an objective quality, when in fact they are all subjective assessments of the relative efficacy of a law, and open to reinterpretation. Once the aggregated data and number have been determined by the researcher, and these are correlated with data on a country's economic development, it is then also criticised that no normative conclusions can be drawn. Correlations do not mean causation, and even very close correlations in the understanding of [[econometrics]] is not the same as causation. [[Regression analysis]] which shows, for example, a country raising its minimum wage has coincided exactly with a period of economic growth would neither demonstrate that a minimum wage ought to be raised in a different country.

Defenders of the leximetrics methodology contend that although there may be many qualifications and limitations, the work can nevertheless be useful despite its abstracted nature. It is preferable to have some information and basis for comparison rather than none at all, and the only question is whether or not the work is carried out accurately or with integrity. The more transparent the researchers' choices are, the better the work is likely to be. As more data is released, other researchers can build on and perfect the work which is done.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''Louis Franklin Bache''' (7 October 1779 – 4 October 1818) was the son of [[Richard Bache]] and [[Sarah Franklin Bache]], the daughter of the American statesman [[Benjamin Franklin]] and his wife [[Deborah Read]]. Bache served as a lieutenant colonel in the Pennsylvania State Militia during the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and Great Britain.

Bache was the commander of a detachment of 351 men in the Pennsylvania State Militia Volunteers which was assigned by Pennsylvania Governor [[Simon Snyder]] to defend the City of Philadelphia against the British in the War of 1812. In October 1814, Lt. Col. Bache refused to submit to federal military takeover of his Pennsylvania State Militia detachment because his soldiers originally joined the state militia pursuant to a later-disputed agreement with U.S. Brigadier General [[Joseph Bloomfield]] that Bache's soldiers would always serve under their state (and not federal) militia officers.

Standing firm on principle, Bache and his five subordinate officers were arrested. Bache was court-martialed and was dismissed from U.S. military service. The military court decided not to punish Bache further because the court believed Bache's closing arguments...that he acted in good faith based upon Governor Snyder's orders, his motives were pure, and that trust was placed in him by his soldiers and the soldiers' parents who allowed their sons to volunteer only under the command of trusted state militia officers. The Bache court-martial case and the related U.S. Supreme Court case of ''United States v. Peters'' has been the subject of historical discussion regarding federal-state relations and balance of power.&lt;ref&gt;Citizen Soldiers in the War of 1812, Ch. 8, Federal-State Relations, p. 141, Vol. 1998, By Carl Edward Skeen.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Bache married Margaret Riley (1781–1806) in 1802. They had two children together:
* Margaret Bache (1803–1871)
* Louis Franklin Bache, Jr. (1805–1887)

The '''METI Handmade School''', a primary school for 168 students located in [[Rudrapur, Bangladesh|Rudrapur]] in [[Dinajpur]] district of Bangladesh, was built with the assistance of local craftsmen making use of traditional materials, primarily mud and bamboo. An example of [[sustainable architecture]], the project received the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2007, not only for its simple, humane approach and beauty but also for the level of cooperation achieved between architects, craftsmen, clients and users.&lt;ref name=akdn2007&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/Content/240Nine-projects-receive-2007-Aga-Khan-Award-for-Architecture "Nine projects receive 2007 Aga Khan Award for Architecture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030128/http://www.akdn.org/Content/240Nine-projects-receive-2007-Aga-Khan-Award-for-Architecture |date=2015-11-17 }}, ''Aga Khan Development Network''. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1997, [[Anna Heringer]] from [[Bavaria]] in southern Germany, visited Bangladesh to work as a volunteer with the Bangladeshi NGO, [[Dipshikha]], which assists marginalized communities in areas such as education, agriculture and skills development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhillassociates.co.uk/dipshikha.php "Dipshikha Case Study: Strategic Planning in Bangladesh"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712005628/http://www.jhillassociates.co.uk/dipshikha.php |date=2012-07-12 }}, ''J. Hill Associates''. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While studying architecture in [[Linz]], Austria, she returned to Rudrapur with three other students. As part of their university research, they made a proposal under Dipshikha's programme for Modern Education and Training (METI). In 2004, after graduating with a thesis titled "School: handmade in Bangladesh", Anna Heringer again visited the village, maintaining the contacts she had enjoyed over the years. Unable to find suitable local expertise, Paul Cherwatigga of Dipshikha appointed her as architect for a project to build new classrooms for the village school with a mandate to make use of local materials. Heringer began her involvement by coordinating fund-raising with the German NGO, Shanti, which had initially introduced her to Dipshikha, successfully raising the USD 35,000 needed for the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanti.de/shanti/front_content.php?idcat=86 "About Shanti"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007023714/http://www.shanti.de/shanti/front_content.php?idcat=86 |date=2011-10-07 }}, ''Shanti.de''. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While the original requirement had simply been to build additional classrooms for the Dipshikha school, Cherwatigga and Heringer persuaded those responsible to use local materials rather than adopting the usual concrete construction.&lt;ref name=akdnpdf&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/architecture/pdf/3392_Ban.pdf "Hand-Made School, Rudrapur, Bangladesh"], ''Aga Khan Development Network''. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioned in January 2004, design work started in March 2004 and was approved in August 2005. The construction was completed over a period of four months from September 2005 to December 2005.&lt;ref name=akdnpdf/&gt;

==The building==

Anna Heringer worked together with her colleague Eike Roswag, developing a design based on regional construction methods and local materials but introducing new approaches for efficiency and structural integrity. As a result of improvements to the bamboo structures and lashing, it was possible to add a second storey to the building. Brick foundations were used to minimize the effects of moisture on the earthen walls. The bricks were made by local craftsmen while the remaining construction work was a collaborative effort by the architects, teachers, students and locals.&lt;ref name=METI&gt;[http://openarchitecturenetwork.org/projects/dlygad2_nominee_metischool "METI School"], ''Open Architecture Network''. Retrieved 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the classrooms required, there are also spaces where the children can interact. The classrooms on the ground floor are enclosed by a mud wall while those on the first floor have slatted bamboo walls providing diffused light and natural ventilation. 
The regularly spaced vertical bamboo support connected to horizontal slats create a powerful decorative effect enhanced by the sunlight.&lt;ref name=akdnpdf/&gt;

Among the notable advances made in the use of local materials were the introduction of a dampproof course and a brick foundation as well as the addition of straw to the [[loam]] mixture of earth and water. In regard to the use of bamboo, progress was made in constructing a layered ceiling of bamboo sticks, bamboo boards and earth, and in building the first floor walls and roof with a frame consisting of beams (four layers of joined bamboo sticks) and vertical and diagonal poles.&lt;ref name=akdnpdf/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2007, the building received the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture|Aga Khan award]]. There was special mention of the way in which "easily available local materials" had been used  "to create a new model for school construction that is beautiful, simple and humane."&lt;ref name=akdn2007/&gt;

In 2009, the [[Curry Stone Design Prize]] was awarded to Anna Heringer for the METI Handmade School and two related projects in Rudrapur. Reference was made to a "new handmade approach to sustainable building" under which local materials are used by local laborers "who learn new construction methods, offering an elegant alternative to the trend toward buildings made from western materials such as [[cement]] and [[steel]]."&lt;ref name=currystone&gt;[http://currystonedesignprize.com/winners/2009/handmade_building 2009 Curry Stone Design Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223232523/http://currystonedesignprize.com/winners/2009/handmade_building |date=2011-12-23 }},   Retrieved 13 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Maldives]] on 17 and 18 April 1952. The new constitution would convert the country from a monarchy to a republic. 

==Background==
After the death of Sultan [[Abdul Majeed Didi]] on 21 February 1952, the members of the country's parliament chose [[Mohamed Amin Didi]] to be the next Sultan. However, he stated that "for the sake of the people of Maldives I would not accept the crown and the throne".

The [[People's Majlis]] voted on 13 April to form a commission with Amin Didi as its chairman to determine the country's future governance structure. Other members included Famuladeyri Kaleygefan, Chief Justice [[Abdullah Jalaludeen]], Majlis Speaker [[Malim Moosa Mafaiy Kilegefan]], Deputy Vazirul-Auzam [[Ibrahim Mohamed Didi]], [[Kolhumadulu Atoll]] MP [[Ibrahim Shihab]], [[Galolhu]] MP [[Bucha Hassan Kaleygefan]] and [[Faadhippolhu Atoll]] chief [[Kaannaa Kaleygefan]].&lt;ref name=MC&gt;[http://www.maldivesculture.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=42 Ameen's Republic] Maldives Culture&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April the People's Majlis affirmed the commission's decision to form a republic, and to hold a referendum on a new constitution over the following two days. However, the referendum would only be held in [[Malé]].&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

==Results==
The results of the referendum were announced at 16:00 on 18 April.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; A large majority had voted in favour, and the new constitution came into force on 1 January 1953. Didi became the country's first [[President of the Maldives|President]] after winning almost 96% of the vote in [[Maldivian presidential election, 1952|an election]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Amir [http://calhoun.nps.edu/public/bitstream/handle/10945/10724/11Dec_Amir.pdf?sequence=1 Islamism and radicalism in the Maldives] Monterey, California.

Following [[Maldivian constitutional referendum, 1953|a referendum]] in the same month, the country reverted to monarchy status on 7 March 1954,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/pages/default.php?ZQE5XDheYQBlEGIOYxc1BTQFZVA= The Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511101340/http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/pages/default.php?ZQE5XDheYQBlEGIOYxc1BTQFZVA= |date=2008-05-11 }} The President's Office&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Muhammad Fareed Didi]] as sultan. 

In 1968 a [[Maldivian constitutional referendum, 1968|third referendum]] on the issue was held, resulting in the country becoming a republic for the second time.

The '''National Association of Drug Court Professionals''' ('''NADCP''') is an [[United States|American]] [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization devoted to furthering the treatment court model and criminal justice reform worldwide. 

==About==
NADCP is the premier training, membership and advocacy organization representing the more than 3,000 drug courts and other treatment courts, including DWI courts and veterans treatment courts across the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndci.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Painting-the-Current-Picture-2016.pdf|title=Painting the Current Picture: A National Report on Drug Courts and other Problem-Solving Courts|last=Marlowe, Hardin, Fox|first=|date=June 2016|website=National Drug Court Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Through its divisions, the National Drug Court Institute, the National Center for DWI Courts and Justice For Vets, NADCP trains and provides technical assistance to thousands of treatment court professionals each year. NADCP regularly publishes evidence-based materials and guides designed to give treatment courts the tools needed for an effective program. In addition, NADCP takes the lead in advocating for treatment courts in the United States Congress and other governmental bodies nationwide.

== Divisions ==
NADCP operates its training and technical support services through three divisions:

The National Drug Court Institute is the division of NADCP charged with administering training and technical assistance to adult drug courts, tribal healing to wellness courts and statewide treatment court conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndci.org/about-ndci/|title=About NDCI - National Drug Court Institute - NDCI.org|work=National Drug Court Institute - NDCI.org|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The National Center for DWI Courts provides training to new and established DWI courts. NCDC also works to promote awareness of DWI courts and impaired driving nationally&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dwicourts.org/about-ncdc/|title=About NCDC - DUI and DWI Courts - NCDC|work=DUI and DWI Courts - NCDC|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Justice For Vets provides training to veterans treatment courts and works to bring awareness to the unique challenges veterans face when returning from service. The division also operates the Justice For Vets National Veteran Mentor Corps, a group of veterans trained to be mentors to fellow veterans participating in a veterans treatment court program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://justiceforvets.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Justice for Vets|work=Justice for Vets|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Adult Drug Court Best Practice Standards ==
In 2013 and 2015 NADCP released volumes I and II of the Adult Drug Court Best Practice Standards. Representing 25 years of empirical study on addiction, pharmacology, behavioral health, and criminal justice, the standards are the foundation upon which all adult drug courts should operate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndci.org/resources/publications/standards/|title=Standards - National Drug Court Institute - NDCI.org|work=National Drug Court Institute - NDCI.org|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

NADCP works at a local, state and federal level to ensure the standards are universally implemented.

The Adult Drug Court Best Practice Standards:

# Target Population
# Historically Disadvantaged Groups
# Roles and Responsibilities of the Judge
# Incentives, Sanctions and Therapeutic Adjustments
# Substance Abuse Treatment
# Complementary Treatment and Social Services
# Drug and Alcohol Testing
# Multidisciplinary Team
# Census and Caseloads
# Monitoring and Evaluation

== Advancing Justice Initiative ==
In July 2017, NADCP launched Advancing Justice, an initiative to lead evidence-based justice reform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://advancejustice.org/|title=Home - ADVANCEJUSTICE|website=ADVANCEJUSTICE|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Advancing Justice seeks to identify and promote the proven and promising solutions for the justice system that are fair, affective and actionable at every intervention point – from entry into the justice system to reentry into society. For its first two projects, the initiative partnered with Sesame Street in Communities to connect their evidence-based tools for children in crisis to justice professionals; and released the inaugural edition of the Journal for Advancing Justice focusing on "Identifying and Rectifying Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Treatment Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://advancejustice.org/announcing-the-journal-for-advancing-justice/|title=Announcing the Journal for Advancing Justice - ADVANCEJUSTICE|date=2018-06-27|work=ADVANCEJUSTICE|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1586">In [[Mechanics lien]] law a ''Notice of Intent to Lien'' (also known as a Notice of Intent, a Notice of Intent to File a Mechanics Lien, an intent notice, an NOI, or a notice of non-payment) is a type of [[preliminary notice]] that warns the property owner, prime contractor, and/or other party on a construction that a mechanics lien or bond claim will be filed unless overdue payments are made within a certain period of time.

A Notice of Intent to Lien is formally required in nine states. In these states, notices of intent must be sent prior to the filing of a mechanics lien claim. These requirements only exist for private projects, there are no notice of intent requirements on state, federal, and other public works projects. The following states require the sending of a Notice of Intent to Lien.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notice of Intent to File a Mechanics Lien|url = http://www.zlien.com/notice-intent-lien/|website = zlien|publisher = =|accessdate = 2015-11-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arkansas
* Colorado
* Connecticut
* Louisiana
* Missouri
* North Dakota
* Pennsylvania
* Wisconsin
* Wyoming

Sending a Notice of Intent is often helpful even if it is not required because it motivates top-of-chain parties to make payment in order to avoid facing a claim of lien. Delayed payment on construction projects often results from a lack of communication, so sending Notices of Intent and other preliminary notices can help inform parties higher up the payment chain of who is working for them and who has not been paid.

[[File:Ombudsman sign.jpg|thumb|right|Sign in [[Banjul]], capital of [[The Gambia]], giving directions to the ombudsman's office]]

An '''ombudsman''', '''ombudsperson''', '''ombud''', or '''public advocate''' is an official who is charged with representing the interests of the [[public]] by investigating and addressing complaints of maladministration or a violation of rights. The ombudsman is usually appointed by the government or by parliament, but with a significant degree of independence. In some countries an [[inspector general]], citizen advocate or other official may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman, and may also be appointed by a legislature. Below the national level an ombudsman may be appointed by a state, local or municipal government. Unofficial ombudsmen may be appointed by, or even work for, a corporation such as a utility supplier, newspaper, NGO, or professional regulatory body.

The typical duties of an ombudsman are to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them, usually through recommendations (binding or not) or [[mediation]]. Ombudsmen sometimes also aim to identify systematic issues leading to poor service or breaches of people's rights. At the national level, most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with the entire public sector, and sometimes also elements of the private sector (for example, contracted service providers). In some cases, there is a more restricted mandate, for example with particular sectors of society. More recent developments have included the creation of specialized [[Children's Ombudsman]] and [[Information Commissioner]] agencies.

In some jurisdictions an ombudsman charged with handling concerns about national government is more formally referred to as the "Parliamentary Commissioner" (e.g. the United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, and the Western Australian state Ombudsman). In many countries where the ombudsman's responsibility includes protecting human rights, the ombudsman is recognized as the [[national human rights institutions|national human rights institution]]. The post of ombudsman had by the end of the 20th century been instituted by most governments and by some intergovernmental organizations such as the [[European Union]].

==Origins and etymology==
A prototype of an ombudsman may have flourished in China during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BC), and in [[Korea]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Korean Preaching, Han, and Narrative (American University Studies. Series VII. Theology and Religion)|last=Park |first=S.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of [[secret royal inspector]], or Amhaeng-eosa (암행어사, 暗行御史) was unique to the Joseon Dynasty, where an undercover official directly appointed by the king was sent to local provinces to monitor government officials and look after the populace while travelling incognito. The [[Tribune|Roman Tribune]] had some similar roles, with power to veto acts that infringed upon the [[Plebs|Plebeians]]. Another precursor to the ombudsman was the Turkish Diwan-al-Mazalim which appears to go back to the second [[caliph]], [[Umar]] (634–644) and the concept of [[Qadi]] al-Qudat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Roots of Ombudsman Systems|first=V.|last=Pickl|journal=The Ombudsman Journal|year=1987|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also attested in Siam, India, the [[Liao dynasty]] (Khitan Empire), Japan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;http://elcrps.uoc.edu/index.php/journal-of-conflictology/article/view/vol2iss2-lang/vol2iss2-lang page 57 http://elcrps.uoc.edu/index.php/journal-of-conflictology/article/view/vol2iss2-lang http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Conflictology/article/viewArticle/251703/0 http://openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/handle/10609/12627&lt;/ref&gt;

An indigenous [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Danish language|Danish]] term, ''ombudsman'' is etymologically rooted in the [[Old Norse]] word ''umboðsmaðr'', essentially meaning "representative" (with the word ''umbud/ombud'' meaning ''proxy'', ''attorney'', that is someone who is authorized to act for someone else, a meaning it still has in the Scandinavian languages). In the Danish [[Jyske Lov|Law of Jutland]] from 1241, the term is ''umbozman'' and means a royal civil servant in a [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]. From 1552, it is also used in the other Scandinavian languages such as the both [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''umboðsmaður'', the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''ombudsmann''/''ombodsmann'' and the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''ombudsman''. The Swedish-speaking minority in Finland uses the Swedish terminology.

Use of the term in modern times began in [[Sweden]], with the [[Parliamentary Ombudsman|Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman]] instituted by the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|Instrument of Government]] of 1809, to safeguard the rights of citizens by establishing a supervisory agency independent of the [[executive branch]].
The predecessor of the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman was the Office of Supreme Ombudsman ("Högste Ombudsmannen"), which was established by the Swedish King, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], in 1713. Charles XII was in exile in [[Turkey]] and needed a representative in Sweden to ensure that judges and civil servants acted in accordance with the laws and with their duties. If they did not do so, the Supreme Ombudsman had the right to prosecute them for negligence. In 1719 the Swedish Office of Supreme Ombudsman became the [[Chancellor of Justice]].&lt;ref name="JO_history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jo.se/Page.aspx?MenuId=20&amp;MainmenuId=12&amp;ObjectClass=DynamX_Documents&amp;Language=sv|title=Historik|first=Riksdagens|last=ombudsmän|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] was established in 1809 by the Swedish [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]], as a parallel institution to the still-present [[Chancellor of Justice]], reflecting the concept of [[separation of powers]] as developed by [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].&lt;ref name="JO_history" /&gt;

The Parliamentary Ombudsman is the institution that the Scandinavian countries subsequently developed into its contemporary form, and which subsequently has been adopted in many other parts of the world. The word ombudsman and its specific meaning have since been adopted in various languages, such as Dutch. The German language uses ''Ombudsmann'', ''Ombudsfrau'' and ''Ombudsleute''. Notable exceptions are French and Finnish, which use translations instead. Modern variations of this term include "ombud," "ombuds," "ombudsperson," or "ombudswoman," and the conventional English plural is ''ombudsmen''. In Nigeria, the ombudsman is known as the ''Public Complaints Commission'' or the ''ombudsman''&lt;ref&gt;The Public Complaint's Commission (Amendment) Act No 21 of 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
In general, an ombudsman is a state official appointed to provide a check on government activity in the interests of the citizen, and to oversee the investigation of complaints of improper government activity against the citizen. If the ombudsman finds a complaint to be substantiated, the problem may get rectified, or an ombudsman report is published making recommendations for change. Further redress depends on the laws of the country concerned, but this typically involves financial compensation. Ombudsmen in most countries do not have the power to initiate legal proceedings or prosecution on the grounds of a complaint. This role is sometimes referred to as a "tribunician" role, and has been traditionally fulfilled by elected representatives&amp;nbsp;– the term refers to the ancient Roman "[[Tribune#Tribune of the Plebs|tribunes of the plebeians]]" (''tribuni plebis''), whose role was to intercede in the political process on behalf of common citizens.

The major advantage of an ombudsman is that he or she examines complaints from outside the offending state institution, thus avoiding the conflicts of interest inherent in self-policing. However, the ombudsman system relies heavily on the selection of an appropriate individual for the office, and on the cooperation of at least some effective official from within the apparatus of the state. The institution has also been criticized: "Ombudsmen are relics of absolutism, designed to iron out the worst excesses of administrative arbitrariness while keeping the power structures intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beyer|first=Jürgen|date=2014|title=The influence of reading room rules on the quality and efficiency of historical research|url=http://kodu.ut.ee/~jbeyer/Reading_room_rules.pdf|journal=Svensk tidskrift för bibliografi|volume=8|issue=3|page=125|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In organizations==
{{Main article|Organizational ombudsman}}
Many private companies, universities, non-profit organisations and government agencies also have an ombudsman (or an ombuds office) to serve internal employees, and managers and/or other constituencies. These ombudsman roles are structured to function independently, by reporting to the CEO or board of directors, and according to International Ombudsman Association (IOA) Standards of Practice they do not have any other role in the organisation. Organisational ombudsmen often receive more complaints than alternative procedures such as anonymous hot-lines.&lt;ref&gt;Charles L. Howard, ''The Organizational Ombudsman: Origins, Roles and Operations, a Legal Guide'', ABA, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, the profession has grown in the United States, and Canada, particularly in corporations, universities and government agencies. The [[organizational ombudsman]] works as a designated neutral party, one who is high-ranking in an organization, but who is not part of executive management. Using an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) or ''appropriate'' dispute resolution approach, an organisational ombudsman can provide options to [[whistleblower]]s or employees and managers  with [[Business ethics|ethical]] concerns; provide coaching, shuttle diplomacy, generic solutions (meaning a solution which protects the identity of one individual by applying to a class of people, rather than just for the one individual) and [[mediation]] for conflicts; track problem areas; and make recommendations for changes to policies or procedures in support of orderly systems change.

==Ombudsman services by country==

===Albania===
The '''People's Advocate''' (Ombudsman) of the [[Republic of Albania]] ({{lang-al|Avokati i Popullit}}) was envisaged in Chapter VI of the Albanian Constitution approved in November 1998 (articles 60–63 and 134). Article 60 states that "The People’s Advocate defends the rights, freedoms and lawful interests of individuals from unlawful or improper actions or failures to act of the organs of public administration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avokatipopullit.gov.al/English/Legal%20Basis.htm|title=Article 60, Albanian Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament passed the Law on the People’s Advocate, Law No. 8454, in February 1999. The People’s Advocate is elected by three-fifths of all members of the Assembly for a five-year period, with the right of re-election. The Law has since been amended by Law No. 8600, of 10 April 2000, and Law No. 9398, of 12 May 2005.

===Belgium===
[[Belgium]] has one federal and four regional statutory ombudsman agencies, all covering the normal range of complaint-handling, investigation and mediation within the respective jurisdictions of their founding legislature.
* The office dealing with complaints against the federal authorities is the '''Federal Ombudsman''' ({{lang-nl|de federale Ombudsman}}, {{lang-fr|le Médiateur fédéral}}, {{lang-de|der föderale Ombudsmann}}). The office was established in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalombudsman.be/|title=le Médiateur fédéral - Frontpage|website=www.federalombudsman.be|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Flemish Ombudsman Service|Vlaamse Ombudsdienst]] (''Vlaamse Ombudsdienst'') was established by the [[Flemish Parliament]] by decree of 7 July 1998 (the ''Ombudsdecreet'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamseombudsdienst.be/|title=Vlaamse Ombudsdienst: welkom op onze site|first=|last=jno|website=www.vlaamseombudsdienst.be|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Walloon Ombudsman''' (''Médiateur de la Région Wallonne''), established by decree of the [[Walloon Parliament]] of 22 December 1994, seeks to help any person, natural or legal, who is experiencing difficulties with the Walloon regional authorities to arrive at a solution without litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediateur.wallonie.be/|title=Walloon Ombudsman website|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''French Community Ombudsman''' (''Médiateur de la Communauté française''), created by the [[Parliament of the French Community]] by decree of 20 June 2002, is responsible for handling complaints of citizens who encounter a problem with any administrative unit of the French Community. Its mission is to promote dialogue between the citizen and the administration concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediateurcf.be/|title=Le Médiateur|website=www.mediateurcf.be|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the smallest linguistic region, the '''Ombudsman of the German-Speaking Community''' (''Ombudsmann der Deutchsprachigen Gemeinschaft'') was created by decree of 26 May 2009. This requires the Ombudsman to mediate between citizens and administrative authorities and seek alternative way to resolve conflicts, to settle disputes and, in some cases, to avoid litigation. In its plenary session of 17 May 2010, the [[Parliament of the German-speaking Community]] appointed Cedric Langer for a term of six years as the first Ombudsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dg-ombudsmann.be/|title=Ombudsfrau|first=Marlene|last=Hardt|date=|website=www.dg-ombudsmann.be|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Belgium also has separate [[Children's Ombudsman#Belgium|children's commissioners]] for the French and Flemish communities.
There is a '''Pensions Ombudsman''' service (''Ombudsdienst Pensioenen'', ''Service de médiation Pensions'', ''Ombudsmann für Pensionen'') at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediateurpensions.be/en/index.htm|title=Pensions Ombudsman|website=www.mediateurpensions.be|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bermuda===
The '''Office of the Ombudsman for Bermuda'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.bm/|title=Bermuda Ombudsman - Welcome|website=www.ombudsman.bm|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[Bermuda]] Constitution and is governed by the Ombudsman Act 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bermudalaws.bm/Laws/Consolidated%20Laws/Ombudsman%20Act%202004.pdf|title=Bermuda Ombudsman Act 2004|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first National Ombudsman for Bermuda, Arlene Brock, was appointed on 1 August 2005 by the Governor after consultation with the Premier who first consulted with the Opposition Leader. The Ombudsman investigates complaints about the administrative actions of Public Authorities, including Government Departments, Boards and Bodies established or funded by the Legislature.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The '''Institution of Human Rights Ombudsman/Ombudsmen''' of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is also the country's UN-accredited [[National human rights institutions|national human rights institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsmen.gov.ba|title=Izbor jezika - Institucija ombudsmena/ombudsmana za ljudska prava Bosne i Hercegovine|first=Dzenan|last=Buzadzic|website=www.ombudsmen.gov.ba|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by law in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsmen.gov.ba/docs/Lawonombudsmanenglish.pdf|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina Ombudsman legislation|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
[[Chile]] remains in 2012 the only country in [[South America]] without a national ombudsman office, although one was envisaged in a constitutional reform proposed in the Senate by the President in 2000.&lt;ref name="atinachile.cl"&gt;http://www.atinachile.cl/node/19760 Spanish, retrieved 30 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://defensorpueblo.blogspot.com/2011/08/el-defensor-del-pueblo-una-solucion-muy.html (Spanish), retrieved 30 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Chile is not listed as having an ombudsman on the website of the Ibero-American Federation of Ombudsmen.&lt;ref&gt;http://portalfio.org/inicio/index.php/pagina-principal/ombudsman-de-tu-pais.html (Spanish), retrieved 25 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; There exists, however, a 'Capítulo Chileno del Ombudsman', or 'Chilean Ombudsman Chapter', an organisation lobbying for the introduction of a national ombudsman.&lt;ref name="atinachile.cl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiserearth.org/organization/view/0b77ba78cd679639082a8f10989ceabe (Spanish), retrieved 30 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other public bodies, such as the '''[[:es:Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos|National Institute of Human Rights]]''' (''Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos'') or the '''[[:es:Consejo para la Transparencia|Transparency Council]]''' (''Consejo para la Transparencia''), have quasi-ombudsman functions, in that their statutes allow them to appeal to the legislature and judiciary for protection and development of fundamental rights. However, unlike many other ombudsman agencies, they do not have constitutional status, but were created by ordinary statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indh.cl/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ley20405.pdf|title=Act 20.405, Organic Act of the National Institute of Human Rights of Chile|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=276363|title=LEY-20285 20-AGO-2008 MINISTERIO SECRETARÍA GENERAL DE LA PRESIDENCIA - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Finland]] --&gt;
In [[Finland]] the office of [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] ({{lang-fi|Eduskunnan oikeusasiamies}}, {{lang-sv|Riksdagens justitieombudsman}}), modelled after the Swedish Ombudsman, was established by the [[Constitution of Finland|Constitution of 1919]]. The Ombudsman is appointed by Parliament, and has the task of ensuring that all government departments and officials follow the law. The Parliamentary Ombudsman shares many duties with the [[Chancellor of Justice]]. The Ombudsman has wide-ranging oversight and investigative powers, has access to all government facilities, documents and information systems and can order a police investigation if necessary. If the Ombudsman determines that a government official has not acted in accordance with the law she or he can advise on the proper application of the law, reprimand the official or in extreme cases order a criminal prosecution. Partly because of the prosecutorial powers, the office enjoys considerable respect and the Ombudsman's legal opinions are usually strictly followed, carrying a lot of weight in the absence of a court precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikeusasiamies.fi/Resource.phx/eoa/english/index.htx|title=The Parliamentary Ombudsman of Finland|website=www.oikeusasiamies.fi|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lokpal====
{{main|Lokpal}}

In India, the Ombudsman is known as the [[Lokpal]] or [[Lokayukta]]. An [[Administrative Reforms Commission]] (ARC) was set up on 5 January 1966 under the Chairmanship of [[Shri]] [[Morarji Desai]]. It recommended a two-tier machinery: Lokpal at the Centre (parliamentary commissioner, as in New Zealand) and one Lokayukta each at the [[States of India|State]] level for redress of people's grievances. However, the jurisdiction of the Lokpal did not extend to the judiciary (as in case of New Zealand). The central Government introduced the first [[Jan Lokpal Bill|Lokpal Bill]], Lokpal and [[Lokayuktas]] Bill in 1968, and further legislation was introduced in 2005. Final bill, after all the amendments, has been passed in Rajya Sabha on 17 December 2013 and passed in Loksabha on 18 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lokpal bill passes|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Lok-Sabha-passes-amended-Lokpal-Bill/articleshow/27580904.cms''[[Times of India]]'' |date=  Dec 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lokayukta====
{{main|Lokayukta}}

The state-level Lokayukta institution has developed gradually. Orissa was the first state to present a bill on establishment of Lokayukta in 1970, but [[Maharashtra Lokayukta|Maharashtra]] was the first to establish the institution, in 1972. Other states followed: Bihar (1974), Uttar Pradesh (1977), Madhya Pradesh (1981), Andhra Pradesh (1983), Himachal Pradesh (1983), Karnataka (1984), Assam (1986), Gujarat (1988), Delhi (1995), Punjab (1996), Kerala (1998), Chhattishgarh (2002), Uttaranchal (2002), West Bengal (2003) and Haryana (2004). The structure of the Lokayukta is not uniform across all the states. Some states have [[UpaLokayukta]] under the Lokayukta and in some states, the Lokayukta does not have ''suo moto'' powers of instigating an enquiry.

Kerala State has an Ombudsman for Local Self Government institutions like Panchayats, Municipalities and Corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decwatch.org/?q=ombudsman|title=Bedava Bonus Veren Bahis - decwatch.org|author=|date=|website=decwatch.org|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He can enquire/investigate into allegations of action, inaction, corruption and maladministration. A retired Judge of the High Court is appointed by the Governor for a term of three years, under the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act.

In the State of Rajasthan, the Lokayukta institution was established in 1973 after the Rajasthan Lokayukta and [[Up-Lokayuktas]] Act, 1973 was passed by the State Legislature.

==== Non-banking financial companies ====

The [[Reserve Bank of India]] launched an "Ombudsman Scheme" for redress of complaints against [[non-bank financial institution|non-banking financial companies]] (NBFCs) free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/rbi-launches-ombudsman-scheme-for-nbfcs/articleshow/63049092.cms|title=RBI launches Ombudsman Scheme for NBFCs|date=2018-02-23|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scheme is applicable to only those NBFCs which:
* Have assets of more than [[Indian rupee|₹]]1,00,00,00,000; AND/OR
* Accept deposits.

The complainant can file the complaint with the NBFC Ombudsman under whose jurisdiction the branch or registered office of the NBFC falls in the following cases:
* If the NBFC does not reply within a period of one month after receipt of the complaint; 
* If the complainant is not satisfied with the reply given by the NBFC;
* If the NBFC rejects, or does not acknowledge the complaint.

It was introduced into the legal system in 2005 by the Law on Ombudsman and confirmed by the Constitution of Serbia in 2006. Ombudsman is elected by the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/index.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311183514/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/index.asp |archivedate=2011-03-11 |website=www.parlament.gov.rs |title=Parliament of the Republic of Serbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a five-year-term and is accountable to the Assembly for his work. The Ombudsman enjoys the same immunity as a member of the parliament.

The first Serbian Ombudsman, [[Saša Janković]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ombudsman.rs/index.php/lang-sr/o-nama/zastitnik-gradjana&lt;/ref&gt; was elected by the National Assembly in July 2007. He has four deputies,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ombudsman.rs/index.php/lang-sr/o-nama/zamenici-zastitnika-gradjana&lt;/ref&gt; who are specialized in several fields, especially the protection of rights of persons deprived of liberty, gender equality, children rights, minority rights and rights of people with disabilities.

The Ombudsman has competence to oversee the work of government agencies, the bodies authorized for legal protection of property rights and interests of the Republic of Serbia and other bodies and organizations, enterprises and institutions which have been delegated public authority. He has no jurisdiction over the National Assembly, the President, the Government, the Constitutional Court, courts and Public Prosecutor’s Office. The Ombudsman initiates proceedings following the complaint of a citizen or on his own initiative. State administration bodies are legally obliged to cooperate with the Ombudsman and to provide him access to their premises and all data in their possession, regardless of the degree of secrecy, when of interest to the investigation in process or the Ombudsman’s preventive actions. As a result of an investigation, the Ombudsman may recommend dismissal of an official considered responsible for violation of the rights of citizens, may initiate disciplinary procedures against public administration employees, and may require initiation of penal, offence or other adequate procedure.

The Ombudsman can also act preemptively, by offering advice and opinion on issues within his competence, to enhance the operation of the administration authorities and strengthen the protection of human liberties and rights. The Ombudsman is entitled to propose laws within its scope of competence, give opinions to the Government and the National Assembly on regulations under preparation and address the Constitutional Court to challenge the constitutionality of laws.

The Ombudsman provides the National Assembly with an annual report on his work and findings as well as with other special reports.

The Ombudsman has full membership in the [[European Ombudsman Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoi.at/|title=EUROPÄISCHES OMBUDSMANN INSTITUT -|website=www.eoi.at|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (EOI), the [[International Ombudsman Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsassociation.org/|title=The International Ombudsman Association - Home|website=www.ombudsassociation.org|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IOA), the [[European Network of Ombudspersons for Children]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crin.org/enoc&lt;/ref&gt; (ENOC) and the [[Association of Mediterranean Ombudsmen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman-med.org/eng/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 October 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415120112/http://www.ombudsman-med.org/eng/ |archive-date=15 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (AMO).

=== Slovakia ===
Ombudsman role was established as a result of the Ombudsman Act (564/2001). National assembly approves candidate to this position with function term 5 years and maximum of two consecutive terms is allowed. Ombudsman provides national assembly with annual report as a minimum. In case of severe violation of fundamental rights or large number of people affected, ombudsman provides special or extraordinary report anytime. This has happened already three times between 2013-2017, but because of "opposition background" of the last but one ombudsman, judge '''[[:sk:Jana_Dubovcová|Jana Dubovcová]]''', her concerns were actually ignored by assembly majority, lot of members of parliament were missing during her speeches and public institutions were allowed to ignore the report, so actually no actions were taken to correct the situation.

The institution of [[the Human Rights Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varuh-rs.si/index.php?L=6|title=Human Rights Ombudsman RS|website=www.varuh-rs.si|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the Slovenian constitutional order through the new Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia, which was adopted in December 1991. The Human Rights Ombudsman is defined in Article 159 of the Constitution, which provides that in order to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in relation to state authorities, local self-government authorities and bearers of public authority, the office of the Ombudsman for the rights of citizens shall be established by law.

[http://www.varuh-rs.si/index.php?L=6 The Human Rights Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia] is a constitutional category that does not fall under the executive, judicial or legislative branch of authority. The Ombudsman is therefore not part of any mechanism of authority, but rather acts as an overseer of authority since as an institution it restricts its capricious encroachment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The Ombudsman is in his work not only limited to handling direct violations defined as human rights and freedoms in the constitution, moreover, he may act in any case whatsoever dealing with a violation of any right of an individual arising from a holder of authority. He can intervene also in the case if unfair and poor state administration in relation to the individual. If the aforementioned is considered, it can have a significant impact on the development and increase in legal and administrative culture between holders of authority and the individual.

Human rights ombudsman is in relation towards the state bodies, autonomous and independent agency.

The Ombudsman can caution violators that they should put right their violation or eliminate irregularities committed, or can even propose compensation. On your behalf, and with your authorisation, he can lodge with the Constitutional Court a request for assessment of the constitutionality and legality of regulations or official documents, or he may submit a constitutional complaint owing to the violation of some right. He may submit to the government or parliament initiatives for the amendment of laws and other regulations. He may also suggest to all bodies that fall within his competence that they improve their dealings and relations with clients.
The Ombudsman may also communicate his opinion to anyone regarding cases that are linked to the violation of rights and freedoms. Here it is not important what kind of procedure is involved, nor the stage of processing it has reached at the body in question.

The Ombudsman cannot perform work or remove violations or irregularities in place of the specific state body, local community body or holder of public authorisation. Those that committed the violation or irregularity are bound also themselves to putting right the violation or
irregularity. Equally, the Ombudsman cannot deal with cases that are subject to court  proceedings, except in exceptional cases.

===Sweden===
The office of the [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] ({{lang-sv|Riksdagens ombudsmän}}, or ''Justitieombudsmannen'') was established with the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|Instrument of Government in 1809]], originally under the title of ''Ombudsmannen för Riksens ständer''.&lt;ref name=JO-JK&gt;{{cite web|title=The Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsmen established in 1809|url=http://www.jo.se/en/About-JO/History/|publisher=JO|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office was modelled after [[Chancellor of Justice]] ({{lang-sv|Justitiekanslern}}), and according to the principle of [[separation of powers]]. The Chancellor of Justice was installed in 1714 as a proxy for King [[Charles XII of Sweden]], to act as a representative for the Royal Government. Today it acts as an ombudsman, mainly to oversee that Swedish authorities comply with laws on behalf of the [[Government of Sweden|Government]], but also to handle [[indemnity]] claims from persons suffered from imprisonment but later acquitted, or other damages caused by authorities.&lt;ref name="JO-JK" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INFORMATION ON THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR OF JUSTICE|url=http://www.jk.se/sv-SE/Languages/English.aspx|publisher=Chancellor of Justice|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] was in turn appointed to represent the parliament; to oversee that all public authorities comply with the laws and decrees. The latter had the specific duty to protect the citizens and as a public attorney prosecute unlawful government or actions by authorities and criticise problematic laws, to ensure equality in the court of law, with inspections and handling of complains.&lt;ref name="JO-JK" /&gt;

With growing attention to discrimination issues in the latter part of the 20th century a number of new anti-discriminatory Ombudsmen was appointed, to later be gathered under one roof, with the establishment of the [[Equality Ombudsman]] ({{lang-sv|Diskrimineringsombudsmannen}}) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Equality Ombudsman|url=http://www.do.se/en/About-the-Equality-Ombudsman-/|publisher=do.se|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ombudsman for Children in Sweden|Ombudsman for Children]] ({{lang-sv|Barnombudsmannen}}) was established in 1993, and is tasked with matters affecting the rights and interests of children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.barnombudsmannen.se/english/about-us/|publisher=Barnombudsmannen|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Director-General]] of the [[Swedish Consumer Agency]] is the designated Consumer Ombudsman ({{lang-sv|Konsumentombudsmannen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swedish Consumer Agency|url=http://www.konsumentverket.se/otherlanguages/English/|publisher=Konsumentverket|accessdate=25 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829004929/http://www.konsumentverket.se/otherlanguages/English/|archivedate=29 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
{{update|section|date=January 2015}}

The '''Office of the Ombudsman Thailand''' ({{lang-th|ผู้ตรวจการแผ่นดินของรัฐสภา}}; {{RTGS|Phu Truat Kan Phaen Din Khong Ratthasapha}}) was created in the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand]] or the "people's constitution". The name was shortened to the '''Ombudsmen''' ({{lang-th|ผู้ตรวจการแผ่นดิน}}; {{RTGS|Phu Truat Kan Phaen Din}}) by the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand]]. The idea for such an office first appeared in the [[Constitution of Thailand|1974 constitution]]. However it was not until 1997 that the concept was acted upon.

Ombudsmen are appointed by the [[King of Thailand]] upon the advice of the [[Senate of Thailand]]. The ombudsmen investigate complaints by the public against public officials and agencies. They have the power to prosecute, but not to enforce judgments.

Ombudsmen are appointed to a six-year non-renewable term. {{asof|March 2017}} Thailand's ombudsmen are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ombudsmans [sic]|url=http://www.ombudsman.go.th/10/eng/3_1.asp|website=Office of the Ombudsman Thailand|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
The Ombudsman's Office was created after the [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2010|constitutional referendum of 2010]] was approved. The Ombudsman's Office is responsible for examining and investigating all manner of administrative acts, actions, attitudes and behavior in terms of respect for human rights and freedoms, conformity with the law and fairness and appropriateness within the framework of the character of the [[Republic of Turkey]] as enshrined in its [[Turkish Constitution|Constitution]]. It performs its functions as part of the Parliament Speaker's Office. The Ombudsman's Office is called the '''Public Monitoring Institution''' (KDK) and has an independent and autonomous budget.

{{Ill|Mehmet Nihat Ömeroğlu|tr}} was elected the first ombudsman of the country on 27 November 2012 by the Parliament, and was sworn in on 5 December. His selection was somewhat controversial since he had been involved, as a judge in the [[Court of Cassation (Turkey)|Court of Cassation]], in upholding the 2006 conviction of the Turkish-Armenian writer [[Hrant Dink]] for the offence of "insulting Turkishness"&amp;nbsp;– a finding subsequently condemned by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], although Dink had in the interim been [[Assassination of Hrant Dink|assassinated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/09/turkey-reconsider-appointment-key-rights-body|title=Turkey: Reconsider Appointment to Key Rights Body|date=9 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
The office of ombudsman, or Commissioner for Human Rights, in Ukraine was instituted in 1998. The first ombudsman was [[Nina Karpachova]] until 2012. [[Valeriya Lutkovska]] was elected to the office for a five-year term by secret ballot in the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] on 24 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ombudsman.gov.ua/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=30&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 55 of the 1996 [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]], "Everyone has the right to appeal for the protection of his her rights to the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights". Article 101 provides "The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights exercises parliamentary control over the observance of constitutional human and citizens’ rights and freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.ua/en|title=Ukrainian Ombudsman website|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal basis of the office, which is also Ukraine's [[National human rights institutions|national human rights institution]], is set out in Law 767/97, which refers to the office as the "Authorised Human Rights Representative" of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ombudsman.kiev.ua/zakon-ue.htm|title=Ukrainian Ombudsman statute 1997|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom a post of Ombudsman is attached to the [[Westminster Parliament]], jurisdiction extending to all departments of the central government and other government institutions. The office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration was created in 1967, covering the activities of central government departments. A separate (National) Health Service ombudsman was subsequently created, but this office has to date always been held by the same person and the two offices are usually referred to as the [[Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman]]. This Ombudsman will usually investigate complaints referred to him or her by a Member of Parliament where there has been evidence of "[[maladministration]]" having occurred which has resulted in an "unremedied injustice". Complaints to the Ombudsman are subject to a "time bar"&amp;nbsp;– this means that the Ombudsman may determine a complaint to be out of jurisdiction if too much time has passed between the event or course of events being complained about and the complaint being received by the Ombudsman.

Separate agencies exist to handle complaints relating to departments and agencies of the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved administrations]]. These are the [[Northern Ireland Ombudsman]], the [[Public Services Ombudsman for Wales]] and the [[Scottish Public Services Ombudsman]], answerable respectively to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[Welsh Assembly]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]].

The [[Local Government Ombudsman]] (formally the Commission for Local Government Administration&amp;nbsp;– there are two Commissioners) for England and Wales was created in 1973, and a similar office for Scotland in 1974; since then, a variety of other public and private sector-specific ombudsmen have been created, along with the [[Northern Ireland Ombudsman]].

The current Authorised Person, appointed by the [[Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan|Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan (''Oliy Majlis'')]], is Ulugbek Muhammadiev. The office was one of the first ombudsmen established in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], and receives technical support from the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ombudsman.uz/|title=Официальный сайт Уполномоченного Олий Мажлиса Республики Узбекистан по правам человека (Омбудсман)|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{For|the Canadian television series|Ombudsman (TV series)}}
In the science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', the arbiters aboard space station ''Babylon 5'' who preside over cases stemming from public complaints are referred to as ''ombuds'' (this is both the singular and plural designation), the gender-neutral title for an ombudsman. Just as with their modern European counterparts, the ombuds only preside over public cases, including robbery, assault, and murder, and do not interpret law as a regular judiciary does.

Opus the penguin was an ombudsman in the strip Bloom County until he was fired.

John Perry, the protagonist of ''[[The Last Colony]]'', written by [[John Scalzi]] starts off the novel as an ombudsman for a newly settled human colony.

The webcomic ''[[PvP]]'' ran a story arc starting at the beginning of March 2009 parodying the comic series and movie ''[[Watchmen]]'' called ''The Ombudsmen.''

'''One share, one vote''' is a standard found in [[corporate law]] and [[corporate governance]], which suggests that each person who invests money in a company has one vote per share of the company they own, equally with other shareholders. Often, shares with one vote each are referred to as [[common stock]]. Most systems of corporate law discourage shares without votes unless they have preferential dividends or liquidation rights, and shares with multiple voting rights are discouraged altogether so as to prevent the concentration of [[corporate power]].

==Countries with a one share, one vote system==

*[[Canada]]
*[[Australia|The Commonwealth of Australia]]
*[[Nigeria|The Federal Republic of Nigeria]]
*[[New Zealand]]
*[[China|The People's Republic of China]]

*[[Ghana]]

==History==
Historically, more corporations followed the rule of [[one person, one vote]], so that the [[corporate power]] of wealthy investors was capped. This practice declined over the late 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, the practice of multiple voting shares, and voteless shares, without any preferential rights became widespread, resulting in the disenfranchisement of many ordinary investors. This was halted by stock exchange regulation and corporate law amendments in most countries.

{{globalize|article discusses law in the United Kingdom|date=February 2014}}

In common law countries such as [[England]], [[Australia ]] and [[New Zealand]], '''passing off''' is a [[common law]] [[tort]] which can be used to enforce unregistered [[trade mark]] rights. The tort of passing off protects the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] of a trader from misrepresentation.

The law of passing off prevents one trader from misrepresenting goods or services as being the goods and services of another, and also prevents a trader from holding out his or her goods or services as having some association or connection with another when this is not true.

==Passing off and trade mark law==
A [[cause of action]] for passing off is a form of [[intellectual property]] enforcement against the unauthorised use of a [[get-up]] (the whole external appearance or look-and-feel of a product, including any marks or other indicia used) which is considered to be similar to that of another party's product, including any registered or unregistered trademarks. Passing off is of particular significance where an action for [[trade mark infringement]] based on a registered trade mark is unlikely to be successful (due to the differences between the registered trade mark and the unregistered mark). Passing off is a common law cause of action, whereas [[statutory law]] such as the [[United Kingdom]] [[Trade Marks Act 1994]] provides for enforcement of registered trademarks through infringement proceedings.

Passing off and the law of registered trade marks deal with overlapping factual situations, but deal with them in different ways. Passing off does not confer monopoly rights to any names, marks, [[get-up]] or other [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]]. It does not recognize them as property in its own right.

Instead, the law of passing off is designed to prevent misrepresentation in the course of trade to the public, for example, that there is some sort of association between the businesses of two traders.

One recent example of its application by the [[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office]] can be found in a Trade Mark Opposition Decision in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/o06001.pdf|title=IN THE MATTER OF APPLICATION NO. 2161647 IN THE NAME OF TREBOR BASSETT LIMITED AND IN THE MATTER OF OPPOSITION NO. 49406 THERETO BY SWIZZELS MATLOW LIMITED|accessdate=25 February 2014|date=21 February 2001|publisher=[[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office]]|work=ipo.gov.uk|last=Jones|first=R. A. (on behalf of the Registrar and Comptroller-General)|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held that two brands of confectionery both named "Refreshers", one made by [[Swizzels Matlow]] and one by [[Trebor Bassett]], which had coexisted since the 1930s, would deceive a consumer as to their source for some items but not for others.  Both coexist in the marketplace.

==Required elements==
When coming to Court, there are three elements, often referred to as the Classic Trinity, in the tort which must be fulfilled. In ''[[Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc]],''&lt;ref&gt;[1990] 1 All ER 873&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosawi|first=Anthony|date=24 March 1995|title=The fire line between trade marks|url=|journal=New Law Journal|volume=145|issue=6688|pages=410|via=Lexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Oliver reduced the five guidelines laid out by Lord Diplock in ''[[Erven Warnink v. Townend &amp; Sons Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1979] AC 731, 742 (HL)&lt;/ref&gt; (the "Advocaat Case") to three elements:

# [[Goodwill (accounting)|Goodwill]] owned by a trader
# Misrepresentation
# Damage to goodwill

The plaintiff has the burden of proving goodwill in its goods or services, get-up of goods, brand, mark or the thing standing for itself.

The plaintiff also has the burden of proof to show false representation (intentional or otherwise) to the public to have them believe that goods/services of the defendant are that of the Plaintiff. There must be some connection between the plaintiff's and defendant's goods, services or trade. They must show likelihood or actual deception or confusion by the public. Deception or confusion, however, does not consider a "[[moron in a hurry]]".&lt;ref name="groves"&gt;{{cite book |date=2011 |accessdate= 25 February 2014 |chapter= Morning Star Cooperative Society v Express Newspapers Limited |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JxczwL7ut3UC&amp;pg=PA202 |last=Peter |first=Groves |title= A Dictionary of Intellectual Property Law |page=202 |publisher= Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn= 978-1-84980-777-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the Court's duty to decide similarity or identity of the marks, goods or services. The criteria are often: aural, visual and conceptual similarity (often applied in trademark infringement cases).

For the element of damage to goodwill, there may be a loss or diversion of trade or dilution of goodwill. The plaintiff need not prove [[damages|actual or special damage]]; real and tangible probability of damage is sufficient. This damage should however be reasonably foreseeable. It is not enough just to show likelihood or actual deception or confusion.

Ultimately, the Court must use common sense in determining the case, based on evidence and judicial discretion, and not witnesses.

Disclaimers may not be enough to avoid passing off or cause of action.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey and Garrard v. WRA (Guns) Ltd [2002] FSR 30. However, this was expressed in the [[obiter dictum|dicta]] of the decision in that case.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended passing off==
One of the instances where passing off is actionable is the '''extended form of passing off''', where a misrepresentation as to the particular ''quality'' of a product or service causes harm to another's goodwill. An example of this is ''[[Erven Warnink v. Townend &amp; Sons Ltd.]]'', in which the makers of [[advocaat]] sued a manufacturer of a drink similar but not identical to advocaat, but which was successfully marketed as being advocaat.

The extended form of passing off is used by celebrities as a means of enforcing their [[personality rights]] in common law jurisdictions. Common law jurisdictions (with the exception of [[Jamaica]]) do not recognise personality rights as rights of [[property]]. Accordingly, celebrities whose images or names have been used can successfully sue if there is a representation that a product or service is being endorsed or sponsored by them or that the use of their likenesses was authorised when this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine v Talksport Ltd [2003] FSR 35, ChD)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse passing off==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Reverse passing off]] --&gt;
Another variety, somewhat rarer is so-called 'reverse passing off'. This occurs where a trader markets another's product or service as being his own (see John Roberts Powers School v Tessensohn [1995] FSR 947). It is usually covered by the same court rulings as straight passing off.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9223">The '''Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces''' (QR&amp;O) are regulations having the force of law for the governance of the [[Canadian Forces]]. They are regarded as the primary document of military law and regulations in Canada &amp;ndash; aside from the [[National Defence Act]].

==Authority==

The QR&amp;O are issued under the authority of Section 12 of the [[National Defence Act]] (NDA), the governing statute of the Canadian Forces. Section 12 provides the Governor in Council (i.e., the [[Governor-General of Canada|Governor-General]] acting on the [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]) and the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] with the power to make ''regulations'' for the "organization, training, discipline, efficiency, administration, and government of the Forces"[https://web.archive.org/web/20050925090027/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/N-5/85073.html#section-12], so long as such regulations are not inconsistent with the NDA, common-law principles of [[natural justice]],&lt;ref&gt;''Joplin v. Vancouver Chief Constable [1982], 144 D.L.R. (3d) 285 (B.C.S.C.), aff’d. [1985],
20 D.L.R. (4th) 314 (B.C.C.A)''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] or the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]];&lt;ref&gt;Post-charter case law including ''MacBain v. Lederman, [1985] 1 F.C. 856 (C.A.)'' and ''Singh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177 at pp. 188-89''.&lt;/ref&gt; it also permits the [[Treasury Board]] to make regulations concerning pay, allowances, forfeitures, deductions, etc.

QR&amp;O 1.23 further authorizes the [[Chief of Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of Defence Staff]] (CDS) to issue ''orders'' and instructions "not inconsistent with the National Defence Act or with any regulations made by the Governor in Council, the Treasury Board or the Minister" in the discharge of his duties or in implementation/explanation of regulations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070706022057/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qr_o/vol1/ch001_e.asp#1.23]

Each regulation or order within the QR&amp;O is, as noted above, issued under the authority of the Governor in Council, the Minister, Treasury Board, or CDS; the issuing authority is indicated by a letter in parentheses following each regulation or order, namely (G), (M), (T), and (C), respectively.

}}'''''R v Dyment''''', [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the  constitutional right to privacy under [[Section Eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 8]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.

==Background==
In April 1982, Brandon Dyment was in an auto accident on a highway. A doctor soon came to the scene, and Dyment was taken to the hospital by a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) officer. At the hospital a blood sample was taken from him for medical purposes while unconscious. When Dyment woke up, and while still suffering from a concussion from the accident, he told the doctor that he had been drinking and had taken antihistamine tablets. The doctor talked with a RCMP officer and handed over the blood sample. Police analysis of the blood found that the alcohol level was above the legal limit and so Dyment was charged with being in care or control of a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the proportion in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood contrary to section 236 of the [[Criminal Code]].

At trial, Dyment was convicted.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether:
# the taking of possession of the blood sample by the police officer amounted to a seizure as contemplated by s. 8 of the Charter;
# taking of the sample was unreasonable and so infringed s. 8;
# in excluding the evidence of the analysis of the blood under s. 24(2) of the Charter on the ground that the admission of this evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

==Reasons of the court==
The Supreme Court upheld the lower court decision that the RCMP's seizing of blood taken for medical purposes was a violation of section 8 of the ''Charter'' and should be excluded under section 24(2).

La Forest, writing concurring reasons, examined the scope of protection provided by section 8. He found that underlying section 8 is a right to privacy, which he described as a constitutionally protected value, stating that:
:''privacy is at the heart of liberty in a modern state...[g]rounded in man's physical and moral autonomy, privacy is essential for the well-being of the individual. For this reason alone, it is worthy of constitutional protection, but it also has profound significance for the public order. The restraints imposed on government to pry into the lives of the citizen go to the essence of a democratic state.'' (pp. 427-28)

The '''Reconstruction Amendments''' are the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] amendments to the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/reconstruction/essays/reconstruction-amendments-official-documents-social-history Foner, Eric.

The last time the Constitution had been amended was with the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] more than 60 years earlier in 1804. The Reconstruction amendments were important in implementing the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] of the [[Southern United States|American South]] after the war. Their proponents saw them as transforming the United States from a country that was (in [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s words) "half [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] and half free" to one in which the constitutionally guaranteed "blessings of liberty" would be extended to the entire populace, including the former slaves and their descendants.

The Thirteenth Amendment (proposed in 1864 and ratified in 1865) abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except for those duly convicted of a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/document.html?doc=9&amp;title.raw=13th+Amendment+to+the+U.S.+Constitution:+Abolition+of+Slavery|title=America's Historical Documents|last=|first=|date=25 January 2016|website=National Archives|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourteenth Amendment (proposed in 1866 and ratified in 1868) addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws for all persons.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Martin.

These amendments were intended to guarantee freedom to former slaves and to establish and prevent discrimination in certain civil rights to former slaves and all citizens of the United States. The promise of these amendments was eroded by state laws and federal court decisions over the course of the 19th century.  In 1876 and later, some states passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that limited the rights of African-Americans. Important Supreme Court decisions that undermined these amendments were the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' in 1873, which prevented rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment's privileges or immunities clause from being extended to rights under state law; and ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' in 1896 which originated the phrase "[[separate but equal]]" and gave federal approval to Jim Crow laws. The full benefits of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments were not realized until the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in 1954 and laws such as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

==Thirteenth Amendment==
{{main article|Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}
[[File:13th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Text of the 13th Amendment]]
The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]], except as punishment for a crime. It was passed by the U.S. Senate on April 8, 1864, and, after one unsuccessful vote and extensive legislative maneuvering by the Lincoln administration, the House followed suit on January 31, 1865. The measure was swiftly ratified by all but three [[Union (Civil War)|Union states]] (the exceptions were Delaware, New Jersey, and Kentucky), and by a sufficient number of border and "reconstructed" Southern states, to be ratified by December 6, 1865. On December 18, 1865, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] [[Promulgation|proclaimed]] it to have been incorporated into the federal Constitution. It became part of the Constitution 61 years after the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. This is the longest interval between constitutional amendments to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11-27|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|work=United States National Archives|publisher=United States National Archives|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the original Constitution through provisions such as Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, commonly known as the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], which detailed how each state's total slave population would be factored into its total population [[United States Census|count]] for the purposes of [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioning]] seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[Direct tax#U.S. constitutional law sense|direct taxes]] among the states. Although many slaves had been declared free by Lincoln's 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]], their legal status after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was uncertain.

{{double image|right|14th Amendment Pg1of2 AC.jpg|190|14th Amendment Pg2of2 AC.jpg|190|The two pages of the Fourteenth Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]}}
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was proposed by Congress on June 13, 1866. By July 9, 1868, it had received ratifications by the legislatures of the required number of states in order to officially become the Fourteenth Amendment. On July 20, 1868, Secretary of State William Seward certified that it had been ratified and added to the federal Constitution. The amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws, and was proposed in response to issues related to treatment of [[freedmen]] following the war. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by Southern states, which were forced to ratify it in order to return their delegations to Congress. The Fourteenth Amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973), regarding abortion, and ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000), regarding the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]].

The second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom, if ever, litigated. The fifth section gives Congress enforcement power. The amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, overruling the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from Africans could not be citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted in such a way that it does very little. While "Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment reduces congressional representation for states that deny suffrage on racial grounds," it was not enforced after southern states [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised blacks]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (see below, at Fifteenth Amendment).&lt;ref name="committee"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/12/21/102438623.pdf|title=Committee at Odds on Reapportionment: Three Reports on the Bill Submitted to the House|last=|first=|date=December 21, 1990|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Northern Congressmen in 1900 raised objections to the inequities of southern states being apportioned seats based on total populations when they excluded blacks, Southern Democratic Party representatives formed such a powerful block that opponents could not gain approval for change of apportionment.&lt;ref name="valelly146-147"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4__EYITWk4C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=Effects+of+southern+black+disfranchisement+on+1912+presidential+election&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F31l2NP4PO&amp;sig=cAQNnWwy2xvEHNUKD-ULjOp0OKo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T6grU6LbDpKCyAGpv4GgCg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Effects%20of%20southern%20black%20disfranchisement%20on%201912%20presidential%20election&amp;f=false|title=The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement|last=Valelly|first=Richard M.|date=2009-10-02|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226845272|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Due Process Clause prohibits state and local government officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]], as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Due process#Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy.

The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause was the basis for the US Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), that [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in public schools was unconstitutional, and its prohibition of laws against interracial marriage, in its ruling in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967).

This amendment was the foundation of elements of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] (this also relied on the 15th Amendment), legislation to end legal segregation in the states and to provide for oversight and enforcement by the federal government of citizens' rights to vote without discrimination. It has also been referred to for many other court decisions rejecting unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.

==Fifteenth Amendment==
{{main article|Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}
[[File:15th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Text of the 15th Amendment]]
The Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the [[suffrage|right to vote]] based on that citizen's "[[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Colored|color]], or previous condition of servitude". It was ratified on February 3, 1870, as the third and last of the Reconstruction Amendments.

By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the narrow election of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black voters was important for the party's future. After rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude on February 26, 1869. The amendment survived a difficult ratification fight and was adopted on March 30, 1870. After blacks gained the vote, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] directed some of their attacks to disrupt their political meetings and intimidate them at the polls, to [[Voter suppression|suppress]] black participation. In the mid-1870s, there was a rise in new insurgent groups, such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]], who acted on behalf of the Democratic Party to violently suppress black voting. While white Democrats regained power in southern state legislatures, through the 1880s and early 1890s, numerous blacks continued to be elected to local offices in many states, as well as to Congress as late as 1894.

From 1890 to 1910, all the states of the former Confederacy passed new constitutions and other laws that incorporated methods to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchise blacks]], such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency rules, and [[literacy tests]] administered by white staff, sometimes with exemptions for whites via [[grandfather clauses]]. When challenges reached the Supreme Court, it interpreted the amendment narrowly, ruling based on the stated intent of the laws rather than their practical effect. The results in voter suppression were dramatic, as voter rolls fells: nearly all blacks, as well as tens of thousands of poor whites in Alabama and other states,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disenfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135&amp;ndash;136&lt;/ref&gt; were forced off the voter registration rolls and out of the political system, effectively excluding millions of people from representation. Democratic state legislatures passed [[racial segregation]] laws for public facilities and other types of [[Jim Crow]] restrictions. During this period of political struggle, the rate of [[lynchings]] in the South reached an all-time high.

In the twentieth century, the Court interpreted the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915). It took a quarter century to finally dismantle the white primary system in the "Texas primary cases" (1927–1953). With the South having become a one-party region after the disfranchisement of blacks, Democratic Party primaries were the only competitive contests in the states. But Southern states reacted rapidly to Supreme Court decisions, often devising new ways to continue to exclude blacks from voter rolls and voting; most blacks in the South did not gain the ability to vote until after passage of the mid-1960s federal civil rights legislation and beginning of federal oversight of voter registration and district boundaries. The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] (1964) forbade the requirement for poll taxes in federal elections; by this time five of the eleven southern states continued to require such taxes. Together with the US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966), which forbade requiring poll taxes in state elections, blacks regained the opportunity to participate in the American political system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3880">'''Robert Edwards''' (died 1762){{cn|date=December 2014}} was a [[Wales|Welsh]] buccaneer given {{convert|77|acre|m2}} of largely unsettled [[Manhattan]] by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] for his services in disrupting Spanish sea lanes. After Edwards' death, the property passed in 1877&lt;!-- 115 years ''after'' he died? --&gt;, via a 99-year lease, to the brothers John and George Cruger, with the understanding that it would revert to his heirs after the lease expired.  Apparently, this never happened.  It is alleged that the Crugers were wardens of [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]], an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]]—today, one of [[New York City]]'s biggest land owners. Maybe everything was tangled in a muddle of colonial Manhattan land giveaways. But, according to family lore, the whole tract wound up in Trinity's hands.

Trinity indeed got a large slice of the land that seems to be described in the Edwards family account. But the church got the last of the ground in 1705, all of it directly from Queen Anne, according to a church pamphlet published in 1955, at a time when Trinity was bedeviled by Edwards family claims.

The legend has since proved persistent, and indeed some high-profile claims of rightful ownership to the fortune, now estimated to be worth around 650 billion dollars.  The most recent of these was a claim from a Cleoma Foore, whose research led to the foundation of the 'Pennsylvania Association of Edwards Heirs', a body funded by donations in a bid to finally prove that they were entitled to the vast fortune through direct ancestry.  This fund attracted around $1.5m at its peak, but no firm evidence was forthcoming. Indeed, the end result was an embezzlement case tried at the federal court in Pittsburgh before Chief Judge [[Donald E. Ziegler]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/headlines/19990907edwards1.asp|accessdate=2013-12-29|title=Old family keeps trying for a slice of old Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, this ancient claim has been the subject of many multimedia productions including books, TV shows and radio reports and a 1998 primetime [[UK]] TV show called '[[Find a Fortune]]' and hosted by [[Carol Vorderman]] amongst others, attempting to shed new light on the topic.

A document held at the [[Glamorgan Archives|Glamorgan Record Office]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], entitled "THE EDWARDS MILLIONS" outlines the case as it stood in 2002, with claims and counter claims further muddying the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glamro.gov.uk/adobe/edwards.pdf "THE EDWARDS MILLIONS"], Glamorgan Record Office entry, April 2002 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014031123/http://www.glamro.gov.uk/adobe/edwards.pdf |date=October 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tales of unscrupulous lawyers and fraudulent claims have also hampered attempts by amateur researchers to get to the truth.  Finally, the introduction of the '[[Statute of Limitations]]' in NY State, which sets a time limit for all claims, to be commenced within fifteen years of the expiration of a lease, appears to have all but buried the claim with the death of Robert Edwards himself.

The only document that could prove the matter would be the original of the 99-year lease signed over to the brothers Cruger, but that would now be statute barred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3844">{{About|the Jewish legal term|the article discussing emissaries of Chabad|Shaliach (Chabad)}}
{{Judaism}}

A '''shaliaḥ''' ({{lang-he-n|שָלִיחַ}}, {{IPA-he|ʃaˈlijaχ|}}; pl. {{Hebrew|שְלִיחִים}}, ''sheliḥim'' {{IPA-he|ʃəliːˈχiːm|}} or ''sheliah'' in [[Halakha]] is a Jewish legal [[wikt:emissary|emissary]] or agent. Accordingly, a shaliaḥ performs an act of legal significance for the benefit of the sender, as opposed to him or herself. It is a comparable Hebrew term of the Greek word ἀπόστολος  (''apostolos'', whence the English "[[apostle]]").

==Biblical sources==
The term does not occur in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Schneemelcher, Robert McLachlan Wilson  ''New Testament Apocrypha: Writings relating to the Apostles''- 2003 - 0664227228 Page 7 
Unfortunately the adjectival noun Απόστολος occurs in LXX only in a single passage, and indeed as a translation of the Hebrew shaluach (passive participle of shalach - 1 Kings 14:6)."&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''shaliaḥ'' inferred in the [[Bible]] is the unnamed servant in Genesis 24 who was sent by [[Abraham]] to find a wife for [[Isaac]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} Although the term is not used and the servant is not named, later rabbinical interpretation interprets this as Eliezer.

==Appointing a shaliaḥ==
The [[Talmud]], or [[Oral Torah]], in tractate [[Gittin]] learns from [[s:Bible, King James, Numbers#Chapter 28|Numbers 28:18]] that any Jewish male or female may appoint an agent, as can servants and maidservants working under a Jew's care. A shaliaḥ however, may only be appointed for a [[mitzvah]] or other halakhic Jewish legal affairs that he or she is obligated in.

==Shaliah in halakhic Jewish legal affairs==
''[[Mitzvot]]'' that are performed on one's own body, such as wearing ''[[tefillin]]'', cannot be performed on one's own behalf by a shaliah.

Many of the halakhic Jewish legal affairs that may be performed through a shaliah:
* A man may appoint a shaliah to betroth a woman on his behalf. A woman may choose to accept betrothal through a shaliah.
* A husband may appoint a shaliah to deliver a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]'' to his wife. A wife may choose to appoint a shaliah to receive it.
* A salesman may appoint a shaliah to purchase or sell merchandise on his or her behalf. Similarly, any act of legal acquisition or transfer of ownership may be effected by a shaliah, such as giving a gift or acquiring a found object.
* A person may appoint a shaliah to separate ''[[Terumat hamaaser|terumot]]'' and ''[[Maaser Rishon|maaserot]]'' on his behalf.
* One who assists in the performance of the rite of Jewish [[circumcision]] by holding the child upon his knees is called a shaliah or [[Godparent|godfather]].&lt;ref name="je-godfather"&gt;"The godfather became known in medieval times by many names in addition to the ancient designation of "sandik." He is called "ba'al berit" (master of the covenant), "ba'al berit ha-milah" (master of the covenant of circumcision), "ṭofes ha-yeld" (holder of the child), "ab sheni" (second father), and also "shaliaḥ" (messenger) (..) Primarily, one who assists in the performance of the rite of circumcision by holding the child upon his knees; secondarily, one who in a measure takes the place of the father, interesting himself in the lad's welfare." {{cite web|title=GODFATHER|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6730-godfather|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One who in a measure takes the place of the father, interesting himself in the child's welfare is called a shaliah.&lt;ref name="je-godfather" /&gt;

A '''shipwreck''' is the remains of a [[ship]] that has wrecked, which are found either beached on land or sunken to the bottom of a body of water. [[Shipwrecking]] may be deliberate or accidental. In January 1999, Angela Croome estimated that there have been about three million shipwrecks worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Angela Croome (January 16, 1999). “[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16121696-000-sinking-fast/ Sinking fast]”, New Scientist, Volume 161, Issue 2169, pp. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; (an estimate rapidly endorsed by [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;“Sinking fast”, [https://open.unido.org/api/documents/4813394/download/MARINE%20INDUSTRIAL%20TECHNOLOGY%201%20AND%202-1999.%20EMERGING%20TECHNOLOGY%20SERIES%20(22293.en) Marine Industrial Technology, 1 and 2/1999], Emerging Technology Series, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, pp. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Iglesias Kuntz (June 12, 2002), “[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3304&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO urges the Americas to join the underwater heritage convention]”, UNESCO Media Services.&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations&lt;ref&gt;“[https://sha.org/publication-links/newsletter/newsletter-archives/ Lisbon Resolution]”, Society for Historical Archaeology Newsletter, Summer 1999, Volume 32, Number 2, pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Historic wrecks are attractive to [[maritime archaeology|maritime archaeologist]]s because they preserve historical information: for example, studying the wreck of {{ship||Mary Rose}} revealed information about seafaring, warfare, and life in the 16th century. Military wrecks, caused by a skirmish at sea, are studied to find details about the historic event; they reveal much about the battle that occurred. Discoveries of [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure ships]], often from the period of European [[colonisation]], which sank in remote locations leaving few living witnesses, such as {{ship||Batavia|ship|2}}, do occur as well.
Some contemporary wrecks, such as the [[Tanker (ship)|oil tankers]] [[Prestige oil spill|''Prestige'']] or {{ship||Erika|tanker|2}}, are of interest primarily because of their potential harm to the environment. Other contemporary wrecks are scuttled in order to spur reef growth, such as {{MV|Adolphus Busch||2}} and ''Ocean Freeze''. Wrecks like ''Adolphus Busch'' and historic wrecks such as {{SS|Thistlegorm||2}} are of interest to [[recreational diving|recreational divers]] that dive to shipwrecks because they are interesting to explore, provide large habitats for many types of marine life, and have an interesting history.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Well known shipwrecks include the catastrophic {{RMS|Titanic||2}}, {{ship|HMHS|Britannic||2}}, {{RMS|Lusitania||2}}, {{MS|Estonia||2}}, {{RMS|Empress of Ireland||2}}, {{SS|Andrea Doria||2}}, or {{ship||Costa Concordia}}. There are also thousands of wrecks that were not lost at sea but have been abandoned or sunk. These abandoned, or derelict ships are typically smaller craft, such as fishing vessels. They may pose a hazard to navigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrecks and Obstructions Database|url=https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/wrecks-and-obstructions.html|website=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be removed by [[port authority|port authorities]].&lt;ref name="ScurvyDeath2007"&gt;{{cite video | title = Scurvy, Death and Cannibalism | medium = internet video | publisher = Shipwreck Central | date = 2007 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/informational/scurvy-death-and-cannibalism.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080306183447/http://www.webcastr.com/videos/informational/scurvy-death-and-cannibalism.html | archivedate = 2008-03-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
{{main|Shipwrecking}}
[[File:Vista Sur.jpg|thumb|right|{{ship||County of Peebles|ship|2}}, used as breakwater in [[Punta Arenas]] at the [[Strait of Magellan]]]]
Poor design, improperly stowed [[cargo]], navigation and other human errors leading to collisions (with another ship, the shoreline, an iceberg, etc.), bad weather, [[fire]], and other causes can lead to accidental sinkings. Intentional reasons for sinking a ship include forming an [[artificial reef]]; due to [[war]]fare, [[piracy]], [[mutiny]] or [[sabotage]]; as part of [[target practice]]; or to remove a menace to navigation. A ship can be also used as [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater structure]].

== State of preservation ==
[[File:The Wasa from the stern.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Vasa|ship|2}} is one of the oldest and best-preserved ships salvaged in the world, owing to the cool temperatures and low salinity of the [[Baltic Sea]]]]

Many factors determine the state of preservation of a wreck:
* the ship's construction materials
* the wreck becoming covered in sand or silt
* the [[salinity]] of the water the wreck is in
* the level of destruction involved in the ship's loss
* whether the components or [[cargo]] of the wreck were [[marine salvage|salvage]]d
* whether the wreck was demolished to clear a navigable channel
* the depth of water at the wreck site
* the strength of [[tide|tidal]] currents or [[wave action]] at the wreck site
* the exposure to surface weather conditions at the wreck site
* the presence of marine animals that consume the ship's fabric
* temperature
* the acidity (or [[pH]]), and other chemical characteristics of the water at the site

The above-mentioned, especially the stratification (silt/sand sediments piled up on the shipwrecks) and the damages caused by marine creatures is better described as "stratification and contamination" of shipwrecks. The stratification not only creates another challenge for marine archaeology but also a challenge to its primary state, the state that it had when it sank.

Stratification includes several different types of sand and silt, as well as tumulus and encrustations. These "sediments" are tightly linked to the type of currents, depth, and the type of water (salinity, pH, etc.), which implies any chemical reactions that would lead to affecting the hypothetical/possible main cargo (such as wine, olive oil, spices, etc.).

Besides this geological phenomenon, wrecks also face the damage of marine creatures that create a home out of them; primarily being octopuses and crustaceans. These creatures affect the primary state because they move, or break, any parts of the shipwreck that are in their way, thereby affecting the original condition of amphorae, for example, or any other hollow places. Finally, in addition to the slight or severe destruction marine animals can create, there are also "external" contaminants, such as modern-day commodities, or contemporary pollution in bodies of water, that as well severely affect shipwrecks by changing the chemical structures, or even destroying or devastating even more of what is left of a specific ship.

All the above offers great challenges to the marine archaeologist when attempting to bind the pieces of a certain shipwreck together. Despite these challenges, if the information retrieved does not appear to be sufficient, or a poor preservation is achieved, authors like J.A. Parker claim that it is the historical value of the shipwreck that counts as well as any slight piece of information or evidence that is acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Parker| first=A.J.| title=Stratification and contamination in ancient Mediterranean shipwrecks.| journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology and Underwater Exploration| volume=10| year=1981| pages=309–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction materials ===
[[File:The Wreck, by Knud-Andreassen Baade c.1835.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The Wreck, by Knud-Andreassen Baade c.1835]]
Exposed [[wood]]en components decay quickly. Often the only wooden parts of ships that remain after a century are those that were buried in [[silt]] or [[sand]] soon after the sinking. An example of this is ''Mary Rose''.

[[Steel]] and [[iron]], depending on their thickness, may retain the ship's structure for decades. As [[corrosion]] takes place, sometimes helped by tides and weather, the structure collapses. Thick ferrous objects such as [[cannon]]s, [[steam]] [[boiler]]s or the [[pressure vessel]] of a [[submarine]] often survive well underwater in spite of corrosion.

[[Propeller]]s, [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s, [[hinge]]s and port holes were often made from non-ferrous metals such as [[brass]] and [[phosphor bronze]], which do not corrode easily.

=== Salinity of water ===

====Freshwater and low saline====
Shipwrecks in some [[freshwater]] lakes, such as the [[Great Lakes]] of North America, have remained intact with little degradation. In some sea areas, most notably in [[Gulf of Bothnia]] and [[Gulf of Finland]], salinity is very low, and centuries-old wrecks have been preserved in reasonable condition. However, [[bacteria]] found in fresh water cause the wood on ships to rot more quickly than in seawater unless it is deprived of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Management Plan|url=http://thunderbay.noaa.gov/pdfs/management%20plan_final.pdf#page=20|website=Thunder Bay  National Marine Sanctuary|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two shipwrecks, {{USS|Hamilton|1809|6}} and {{USS|Scourge|1812|6}}, have been at the bottom of [[Lake Ontario]] since they sunk during a violent storm on August 8, 1813, during the [[War of 1812]]. They are in "remarkably good" condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamilton's War of 1812 shipwrecks 'an archeologist's dream'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-s-war-of-1812-shipwrecks-an-archeologist-s-dream-1.1284755|website=cbc.ca|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seawater====
Wrecks typically decay rapidly when in [[seawater]]. There are several reasons for this:
* [[Iron]]-based metals [[corrosion|corrode]] much more quickly in seawater because of the dissolved [[salt]] present; the sodium and chloride [[ion]]s chemically accelerate the process of metal oxidation which, in the case of ferrous metals, leads to [[rust]]. Such cases are prominent on deep-water shipwrecks, such as RMS ''Titanic'' (which sank in 1912), {{RMS|Lusitania}} (which sank in 1915), and {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}} (which sank in 1941).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, there are some exceptions; RMS ''Empress of Ireland'' lies in the saltwater portion of the [[St. Lawrence River]], but is still in remarkably good condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekdiv.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=56&amp;lang=en|title=Empress of Ireland|author=Dominique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unprotected wood in seawater is rapidly consumed by [[shipworm]]s and small wood-boring sea creatures. Shipworms found in higher salinity waters, such as the [[Caribbean]], are notorious for boring into wooden structures that are immersed in sea water and can completely destroy the hull of a wooden shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilman|first1=Sarah|title=How a Ship-Sinking Clam Conquered the Ocean|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/tunneling-clam-bedeviled-humans-sank-ships-conquered-oceans-180961288/|work=Smithsonian|date=December 5, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loss, salvage, and demolition ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:SS Austria shipwreck.jpg|thumb|The shipwreck of {{SS|Austria}} on 13 September 1858]]
An important factor in the condition of the wreck is the level of destruction at the time of the loss or shortly afterwards due to the nature of the loss, salvage or later demolition.

Examples of severe destruction at the time of loss are:
* Being blown onto a beach, reef, or rocks during a storm, termed "grounding"  (e.g., {{ship||Royal Adelaide|1865|2}})
* Collision with another ship (e.g., {{SS|Andrea Doria||2}})
* Catastrophic explosion (e.g., {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}), steamship boilers often explode when water covers them during the process of sinking
* Fire that burns for a long time before the ship sinks (e.g., {{MS|Achille Lauro||2}})
* Foundering, i.e., taking in so much water that buoyancy is lost and the ship sinks (e.g., RMS ''Titanic'' and HMHS ''Britannic''); some ships with a dense cargo (e.g., iron ore) may break up when sinking quickly and hitting a rocky seabed
* Enemy action from [[aerial bomb]]s or [[torpedo]]es that may cause destruction before sinking (e.g., the {{ship|Italian battleship|Roma|1940|6}} and {{HMS|Barham|04|6}})

After the loss, the vessel's owners may attempt to [[marine salvage|salvage]] valuable parts of the ship and its cargo. This operation can cause further damage.

Shipwrecks in shallow water near busy shipping lanes are often demolished or removed to reduce the danger to other vessels. On charts, some wreck symbols have a line under the symbol with a depth mark, which indicates the water depth above the wreck.

=== Depth, tide and weather ===
On the seabed, wrecks are slowly broken up by the forces of [[wave action]] caused by the weather and currents caused by [[tide]]s. Also more highly oxygenated water, which promotes [[corrosion]], reduces the strength of ferrous structural materials of the ship. Deeper wrecks are likely to be protected by less exposure to water movement and by lower levels of oxygen in water.

=== Temperature ===
Extreme cold (such as in a [[glacier|glacial-fed]] lake, [[Arctic]] waters, the [[Great Lakes]], etc.) slow the degradation of organic ship materials. Decay, corrosion and marine encrustation are inhibited or largely absent in cold waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steere|first1=Mike|title=Superior keeps its shipwrecks fresh Preservation: In the cold, almost sterile water at the bottom of the Great Lake, divers find the remains of marine disasters.|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-05-12/features/1996133022_1_lake-superior-great-lakes-lakes-shipping|website=baltimoresun.com|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salvage ==
{{Main|Marine salvage}}
Often, attempts are made to salvage shipwrecks, particularly those recently wrecked, to recover the whole or part of the ship, its cargo, or its equipment. An example was the salvage of the [[scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow|scuttled German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow]] in the 1920s and 1930s. The unauthorized salvage of wrecks is called [[wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]].

=== Legal aspects ===
{{main|Law of salvage}}
Shipwreck law determines important legal questions regarding wrecks, perhaps the most important question being the question of ownership. Legally wrecks are divided into ''wreccum maris'' (material washed ashore after a shipwreck) and ''adventurae maris'' (material still at sea),&lt;ref&gt;For example, under English law the former were dealt with under rules relating to things found on land, the latter were dealt with under Admiralty jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt; which are treated differently by some, but not all, legal systems.
[[File:Nanking Cargo kijkdag (1986).jpg|thumb|Viewing at [[Christie’s]] auction in Amsterdam for the cargo of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) ship ''Geldermalsen'' (1747)]]
Wrecks are often considered separately from their cargo. For example, in the British case of ''[[RMS Lusitania#1984 British legal action|Lusitania]]'' [1986] QB 384 it was accepted that the remains of the vessel itself were owned by the insurance underwriters who had paid out on the vessel as a total loss by virtue of the law of [[subrogation]] (who subsequently sold their rights), but that the property aboard the wreck still belonged to its original owners or their heirs.

Military wrecks, however, remain under the jurisdiction–and hence protection–of the government that lost the ship, or that government's successor. Hence, a German [[U-boat]] from World War II still technically belongs to the German government, although the [[Third Reich]] (the government of the time) is long-defunct. Many military wrecks are also protected by virtue of there being [[war grave]]s.

However, many legal systems allow the rights of salvors to override the rights of the original owners of a wreck or its cargo. As a general rule, non-historic civilian shipwrecks are considered fair game for salvage. Under international [[maritime law]], for shipwrecks of a certain age, the original owner may have lost all claim to the cargo. Anyone who finds the wreck can then file a salvage claim on it and place a lien on the vessel, and subsequently mount a salvage operation (see [[Finders, keepers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasure Salvage: Finders Keepers?|url=http://www.wcslaw.com/news/2001/10/05/treasure-salvage-finders-keepers/|website=wcslaw.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917131032/http://www.wcslaw.com/news/2001/10/05/treasure-salvage-finders-keepers/|archivedate=2015-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State of North Carolina questionably claims "all photographs, video recordings, or other documentary materials of a derelict vessel or shipwreck or its contents, relics, artifacts, or historic materials in the custody of any agency of North Carolina government or its subdivisions" to be its property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HB 184|url=http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015/Bills/House/PDF/H184v7.pdf|website=ncleg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries assert claims to all wrecks within their territorial waters, irrespective of the interest of the original owner or the salvor.&lt;ref&gt; For example, the US [[Abandoned Shipwrecks Act]] 1987 and the Spanish Estatuto No 60/62, 24 December 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime wrecks have different legal considerations, as they are often considered [[prize (law)|prizes of war]], and therefore owned by the navy that sank them.

[[File:Napolibeached.jpg|thumb|{{ship||MSC Napoli}} beached off Branscombe]]
Some legal systems regard a wreck and its cargo to be abandoned if no attempt is made to salvage them within a certain period of time. English law has usually resisted this notion (encouraged by an extremely large maritime insurance industry, which asserts claims in respect of shipwrecks which it has paid claims on), but it has been accepted to a greater or lesser degree in an Australian case&lt;ref&gt;''Robinson v Western Australian Museum'' (1977) 51 ALJR 806 at 820-821, although significantly the court held that it had not been abandoned despite the fact the ship, the ''Gilt Dragon'', was lost in 1656.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a Norwegian case.&lt;ref&gt;N. Rt. 346 (1970 N.D. 107), per Eckhoff J. ([[Supreme Court of Norway]]), "It is possible that an owner's inactivity over a long period of time, taking into account the circumstances, can be sufficient reason for considering that the proprietary right to the wrecked vessel has been relinquished. ... [But] inactivity over a certain number of years cannot in itself be conclusive."&lt;/ref&gt;

The American courts have been inconsistent between states and at Federal level.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Treasure Salvors Inc. v Unidentified Wreck'' [1978] AMC 1404, [1981] AMC 1857 relating to [[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de Atocha (1620)|the ''Atocha'']] the courts treated the wreck and cargo as abandoned, arguing it would be an "absurd fiction" to regard a centuries-old shipwreck as still owned by the original owner. But in ''Columbus America Discovery Groupo v Unidentified Wreck'' [1990] AMC 2409, (1992) 337 LMNL 1 the courts were prepared to uphold the claims of the original insurers to the cargo subject to their providing the necessary proof, which they were unable to do.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Danish law, all shipwrecks over 150 years old belong to the state if no owner can be found.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In Spain, wrecks vest in the state if not salvaged within 3 years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In Finland, all property on board shipwrecks over 100 years old vests in the state.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The British [[Protection of Wrecks Act 1973|Protection of Wrecks Act]], enacted to protect historic wrecks, controls access to wrecks such as [[Cattewater Wreck]] which can only be visited or investigated under licence. The British [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]] also restricts access to wrecks which are sensitive as [[war grave]]s. The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving; for other wrecks divers may visit provided they do not touch, interfere with or penetrate the wreck. In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the [[Abandoned Shipwrecks Act]] of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks.

Following the beaching of {{ship||MSC Napoli}}, as a result of severe damage incurred during European storm [[Kyrill (storm)|Kyrill]], there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the [[flotsam]] which was washed up on the beaches at [[Branscombe]]. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many [[BMW]] motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable nappies ([[diapers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6450219.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Devon &amp;#124; Napoli 'scavenging' beach to open |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal position under the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995]] is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the [[Receiver of Wreck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-environmental/mcga-dops_row_receiver_of_wreck/mcga-dops_row_report.htm |title=ROW- The reporting process |publisher=Mcga.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225222905/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-environmental/mcga-dops_row_receiver_of_wreck/mcga-dops_row_report.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for [[theft by finding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-environmental/mcga-dops_row_receiver_of_wreck/mcga-dops_row_penalties.htm |title=Wreck and salvage law - Detailed guidance - GOV.UK |publisher=Mcga.gov.uk |date=2012-09-14 |accessdate=2015-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128191037/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-environmental/mcga-dops_row_receiver_of_wreck/mcga-dops_row_penalties.htm |archivedate=2011-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted [[marine salvage|salvors]], established a cordon to prevent access to the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-newsroom/incident/dops_-_hq-napoli_15_february_.htm |title=Structural failure of container vessel MSC Napoli and subsequent beaching Marine Accident Investigation Branch report - GOV.UK |publisher=Mcga.gov.uk |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2015-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018170141/http://mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-newsroom/incident/dops_-_hq-napoli_15_february_.htm |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation occurred after the wreck of {{MV|Cita||2}} in 1997.

Historic wrecks (often but not always defined as being more than 50 years of age) are often protected from pillaging and looting through national laws protecting cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml |title=BBC Radio World Service Broadcast, "What Lies Beneath" First broadcast Friday 22 August 2008 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally they may be protected by a State ratifying the [[Underwater cultural heritage|Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]].

An important international convention aiming at the protection of underwater cultural heritage (including shipwrecks) is the '''Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34114&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080815180246/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34114&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-15 |title=UNESCO 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage represents the international community's response to the increasing looting and destruction of underwater cultural heritage. It forms part of a group of UNESCO standard setting instruments regarding the domain of cultural heritage, encompassing seven conventions adopted by UNESCO Member States, which constitute a coherent and complementary body guaranteeing a complete protection of all forms of cultural heritage.

The UNESCO 2001 Convention is an international treaty aimed exclusively at the protection of underwater cultural heritage and the facilitation of international cooperation in this regard. It does not change sovereignty rights of States or regulate the ownership of wrecks or submerged ruins.

=== Notable salvages ===
In 2011, the most valuable cargo of a sunken shipwreck was identified near the western edge of the [[Celtic Sea]]. This World War II era sinking of {{SS|Gairsoppa||2}} led to a treasure almost three miles deep.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/SS_Gairsoppa_recovery?topic=49523 ''SS Gairsoppa recovery''. Topic ed.P.Saundry. Ed.-in-chief C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. federal court and a panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit have upheld the Spanish claim to the contents of the ship {{ship||Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes}}; Spain took control of the treasure in February 2012. A very small number of coins and effects recovered from the ship were deposited in Gibraltar, because they showed clear signs coherent with an internal explosion on the ship and thus confirmed Spanish claims to the wreck being that of the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes. They were not returned to Spain until 2013, when a court finally ordered Odyssey Marine to return the missing pieces.

Archaeologist [[Valerios Stais]] discovered one of the most notable instruments of time keeping and prediction of celestial events off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera On May 17, 1902. The device, known as the [[Antikythera Mechanism]] is perhaps the earliest account of what would be known as today as an analog computer and the technology it encompasses predates any other recorded description by nearly hundreds and thousands of years.

{{Golden Dawn}}

'''The Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn''' ('''OSOGD''') is an esoteric community of magical practitioners, many of whom come from [[Paganism|pagan]] backgrounds. It is an initiatory teaching Order that draws upon the knowledge, experience, practices and spirit of the system of magical training and attainment developed by the original [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].

==History==
The OSOGD was founded by [[Sam Webster (writer)|Sam Webster]] in 2002 and based on the principles of the [[open-source software]] movement.&lt;ref name="wicker05"&gt;Wicker (2005), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization grew out of a series of workshops on ceremonial magic held by Webster in 2001.&lt;ref name="Kean09"&gt;Kean (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sam Webster,
{{quote|
The Open Source Order is founded on the principle that true spirituality is omnipresent and access to it cannot be owned or controlled by any group or individual. Sufficiently skilled practitioners can and do modify the practices to serve specific purposes or to take advantage of the century-plus development in the craft to improve their effect.&lt;ref name="gasperson"&gt;Gasperson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to ''The Manifesto of the Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn'',&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; the Order has undertaken to revise the teachings of the original [[Victorian era]] Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn system to work more effectively in the 21st century. This redaction of the original rituals has taken on the aspect of a number of principles, listed in the Manifesto as [[Open Source]] Magick, New Aeon, Freedom of Information, [[Thelema]], Duty, [[Universalism]], and Form and Function.&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In temple work, the OSOGD uses [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Enochian]] and [[Thelema|Thelemic]] godforms in preference to the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Archangel]]s typical of the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. According to the Manifesto, OSOGD teaches "a progressively tiered system of spiritual development designed to invoke the [[Holy Guardian Angel|Higher or Divine Genius]] latent in every human being."&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
[[Image:OSOGDseal.jpg|frame|left|The Seal of the OSOGD]]
To actually join the Order, a person must have regular access to its Lodge, which is located in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The Order does not conduct distance initiations, and requires that all initiates attend initiation rituals in person.&lt;ref name="osogd02"&gt;OSOGD (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
The Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn draws heavily from Eastern sources, [[Thelema]], [[Paganism]], and the works of [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name="osogd02"/&gt;

The '''Treaty of Elche''' was an agreement between the [[Crown of Castile|Crowns of Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] signed in 1305. The treaty revised the borders put down by the [[Treaty of Torrellas]] in the previous year. The borders under dispute were those created by the conquests of [[James II of Aragon]] in [[Murcia]] between 1296 and 1300. Murcia was (before 1296) a dependency of Castile. The chief exchange effected by the new treaty of Elche was the important port city of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], which returned to Castile.

'''Trespass to chattels''' is a [[tort]] whereby the infringing party has intentionally (or, in Australia, [[Negligence|negligently]]) interfered with another person's lawful possession of a [[Personal property|chattel]] (movable personal [[property]]). The interference can be any physical contact with the chattel in a quantifiable way, or any dispossession of the chattel (whether by taking it, destroying it, or barring the owner's access to it).  As opposed to the greater wrong of [[Conversion (law)|conversion]], trespass to chattels is argued to be actionable ''per se''.

The origin of the concept comes from the original [[writ]] of [[trespass]] ''de bonis asportatis''. As in most other forms of trespass, [[Legal remedy|remedy]] can only be obtained once it is proven that there was direct interference regardless of damage being done, and the infringing party has failed to disprove either negligence or intent.

In some common-law countries such as the United States and Canada, a remedy for trespass to chattels can only be obtained if the direct interference was sufficiently substantial to amount to dispossession, or alternatively where there had been an injury proximately related to the chattel. (See [[Restatement (Second) of Torts]], 1965.)

==United States law==
The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 217 defines trespass to chattels as "intentionally… dispossessing another of the chattel, or using or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another." Harm to personal property or diminution of its quality, condition or value as a result of a defendant's use can also result in liability under § 218(b) of the Restatement. 

Certain specific circumstances may lend themselves to liability for the action.  The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 218 states further that:

One who commits a trespass to a chattel is subject to liability to the possessor of the chattel if, but only if,
{{quote|
(a) he dispossesses the other of the chattel, or&lt;br/&gt;
(b) the chattel is impaired as to its condition, quality, or value, or&lt;br/&gt;
(c) the possessor is deprived of the use of the chattel for a substantial time, or&lt;br/&gt;
(d) bodily harm is caused to the possessor, or harm is caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a legally  protected interest.}}

The trespass to chattels cause of action, frequently asserted in recent years against Internet advertisers and email spammers, is often included in complaints against spyware companies.  These electronic messaging cases, and their progeny, which have cropped up over the last decade, will typically turn on the situations described in (b) or (d), and, as detailed below, the question of harm caused is a big issue.

In sum, the basic elements of a claim of trespass to chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff's consent to the trespass, 2) interference or intermeddling with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant's actions.  Actual damage is not necessarily a required element of a trespass to chattels claim.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Hawkins v. Hawkins'', 101 N.C. App. 529, 532, 400 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;Marjorie A. Shields, ''Applicability of Common-Law Trespass Actions to Electronic Communications'', 107 A.L.R.5th 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the claim==

; Lack of consent
:A vendor can attempt to dispute a trespass claim on the grounds that the user consented to the terms of the contract. Even if consent was given for certain access, a user may still have a valid trespass to chattels complaint if the vendor has exceeded the contractual terms, if the contract is found to misrepresent the actual functioning of the product, or if the consent has been withdrawn. A vendor can be held liable for "any use exceeding the consent" given.

; Actual harm
: The precise criteria for ascertaining actual harm varies among states.  In California, for instance, an electronic message can be deemed a trespass where the message interferes with the target computer's operation, as long as a plaintiff can demonstrate either actual hardware damage or actual impaired functioning. But the general concept of requiring impaired computer functioning has been adopted consistently and in showing impaired computer functioning, courts have usually emphasized system unavailability.

; Intent
: In clarifying the meaning of intent in the context of a trespass to chattels claim of Torts states that "intention is present when an act is done for the purpose of using or otherwise intermeddling with a chattel or with knowledge that such an intermeddling will, to a [[Substantial certainty doctrine|substantial certainty]], result from the act," and that, furthermore, "[i]t is not necessary that the actor should know or have reason to know that such intermeddling is a violation of the possessory rights of another."

[[Damages]] from a trespass claim are limited to the actual harm sustained by the plaintiff (which can include economic loss consequent on the trespass - e.g. loss of profit on a damaged chattel). In cases of dispossession, the plaintiff is always entitled to damages if they can prove the dispossession occurred, even if no quantifiable harm can be proven.

A related tort is [[conversion (law)|conversion]], which involves an exercise of control over another's [[Personal property|chattel]] justifying restitution of the [[Personal property|chattel's]] full value. Some actions constitute trespass and conversion; in these cases, a plaintiff must choose which claim to make based on what amount of damages they seek to recover.

== In the electronic age ==
{{further|Computer trespass}}

The common law tort of trespass to chattels has been invoked in the modern context of electronic communications to combat the proliferation of unsolicited bulk email, commonly known as [[E-mail spam|spam]].&lt;ref name=Shields /&gt;  In addition, several companies have successfully used the tort to block certain people, usually competitors, from accessing their servers. Though courts initially endorsed a broad application of this legal theory in the electronic context, more recently other jurists have narrowed its scope. As trespass to chattels is extended further to computer networks, some fear that plaintiffs are using this cause of action to quash fair competition and to deter the exercise of free speech; consequently, critics call for the limitation of the tort to instances where the plaintiff can demonstrate actual damages.

=== Rules ===
The trespass to chattels tort punishes anyone who substantially interferes with the use of another's personal property, or chattels. Plaintiffs must show that the offender had intentional physical contact with the chattel and that the contact caused some substantial interference or damage. The courts that imported this common law doctrine into the digital world reasoned that electrical signals traveling across networks and through proprietary servers may constitute the contact necessary to support a trespass claim. Applying this common law action to computer networks, plaintiffs must first prove that they received some type of electronic communication (typically bulk e-mail or spam) that the defendant intentionally sent to interfere with the plaintiff's interest in his or her property and second that this communication caused a quantifiable harm to their tangible property, such as impaired functioning of the computer, network or server.&lt;ref name=eBay&gt;''eBay v. Bidder's Edge'', 100 F.Supp.2d 1058 (N.D. Cal. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early applications of trespass to chattels to computer networks ===

In the late 1990s, when the World Wide Web was in its infancy, courts were more receptive to extending the trespass to chattels tort to the electronic context. In ''[[CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.]]'', a 1997 case that was the first to extend the trespass theory to computer networks, a federal district court held that a marketing company's mass mailing of a high volume of unsolicited advertisement emails to CompuServe subscribers constituted an actionable trespass to chattels.&lt;ref name=CompuServe&gt;''CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.'', 962 F.Supp. 1015 (S.D.Ohio 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  CompuServe customers repeatedly received unwanted advertisements from Cyber Promotions, a company that specialized in sending marketing email in bulk. Cyber Promotions also modified its equipment and falsified other information to circumvent CompuServe's anti-spam measures. Due to the high volume of email, CompuServe claimed damage to its servers as well as money lost dealing with customer complaints and dissatisfaction. CompuServe also extended its damages claim to its subscribers who spent time deleting unwanted email. The court held that Cyber Promotions's intentional use of CompuServe's proprietary server was an actionable trespass to chattels and granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the spammer from sending unsolicited advertisements to any email address maintained by CompuServe. Cyber Promotions' persistence in sending email to CompuServe's servers after receiving notification that CompuServe no longer consented to the use weighed heavily in favor of a finding of trespass. 

A trio of 1998 cases in the Eastern District of Virginia involving America Online more firmly established the use of the trespass to chattels tort as a spam-fighting tool. In ''[[America Online, Inc. v. IMS]]'', the court held that the owner of a marketing company committed trespass to chattels against an [[Internet service provider]]'s (ISP) computer network by sending 60 million unauthorized email advertisements to the ISP's subscribers after being notified that the spam was unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;''America Online, Inc. v. IMS'', 24 F. Supp. 2d 548 (E.D. Va. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court found that the defendant, intentionally and without authorization, caused contact with the plaintiff's computer network by sending the bulk email messages. Such contact injured the plaintiff's business goodwill and diminished the functioning of its computer network. 

Similarly, in ''America Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc.'', a company engaging in pornographic website advertising sent a deluge of spam to AOL's customers, and, in so doing, also forged the AOL domain name in an effort to trick customers into opening the emails.&lt;ref&gt;''America Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc.'', 46 F.Supp.2d 444 (E.D. Va. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court once again held that a website operators' transmission of unsolicited bulk emails to customers of an ISP, using the provider's computers and computer network, constituted trespass to chattels. 

In ''America Online, Inc. v. Prime Data Systems, Inc.'', the defendants sent millions of spam emails to AOL subscribers advertising computer software programs designed to facilitate bulk emailing by allowing users to harvest email addresses from the plaintiff's member directories, chat rooms, and electronic bulletin boards.&lt;ref&gt;''America Online, Inc. v. Prime Data Systems, Inc.'', 1998 WL 34016692 (E.D. Va. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants also used technology designed to avoid AOL's spam filtering mechanisms. The defendants frequently used false and deceptive "headers" in email messages to make it appear as if AOL had sent the messages. The increased demand on AOL's servers resulting from the spam caused substantial delays of up to 24 hours in the delivery of all email to AOL members, forcing AOL to temporarily stop accepting any new messages. As the spam problem grew worse, AOL had to purchase millions of dollars worth of additional equipment to increase the capacity of its servers to handle the volume of email. The court held that this activity constituted a trespass to chattels and awarded injunctive relief, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as well as damages.

=== Beyond spam: screen scraping and data harvesting ===
Since the early spam cases, courts have extended the electronic trespass to chattels theory even further to encompass screen-scraping and other data "harvesting." [[Screen-scraping]] is the practice of taking information from another website, generally through the use of search agent software, and "harvesting" the data for one's own commercial use. For example, travel websites frequently use this tactic to offer a host of options and prices gleaned from various airlines' sites. Because the courts have entertained such litigation, some companies have specifically banned the conduct in their terms and conditions statements.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://www.wawa.com/WawaWeb/Terms.aspx Wawa's] website terms and conditions, which forbids users to employ screen scraping programs.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[eBay v. Bidder's Edge]]'' (2000), eBay successfully used the trespass to chattels tort to prevent Bidder's Edge from employing spiders to cull information about its auctions to display on its own website.&lt;ref name=eBay /&gt; Although Bidder's Edge's robots only consumed a small percentage of eBay's computer resources, the court noted that the plaintiff need not demonstrate current substantial interference as conduct which constituted a use of another's property is enough to sustain a trespass to chattels claim. In light of this, the court found that eBay had demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of future injury to warrant granting a permanent injunction: "If the court were to hold otherwise, it would likely encourage other auction aggregators to crawl the eBay site, potentially to the point of denying effective access to eBay's customers."&lt;ref name=eBay /&gt;

''[[Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.]]'' (2000) is a further example of this temporary trend in which plaintiffs did not have to demonstrate any real interference.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc.]]'', 126 F. Supp. 2d 238 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Register.com, a domain name registry service, sued competitor Verio for using Register.com's proprietary WHOIS look-up service to find potential leads among its customer base. The court found that, by continuing to access Register.com's online customer database after being told to stop, Verio was trespassing on Register.com's WHOIS server. Register.com had specifically withdrawn its consent to Verio's use of search robots to review Register.com's customer list. The court held that Verio caused harm to Register.com's files through the use of these search robots and that the searches improperly taxed Register.com's server capacity. 

These holdings gave the court license to expand the applicability of trespass to chattels to computer networks even further. In ''Oyster Software v. Forms Processing'' (2001), the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]] determined that a plaintiff need not demonstrate any physical interference with a server at all to sustain a trespass to chattels claim and consequently denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, even though there was no evidence of damage to the plaintiff's computer system.&lt;ref name=Oyster&gt;''Oyster Software v. Forms Processing'', 2001 WL 1736382 (N.D.Cal. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Oyster conceded that there was no evidence that the defendant's activities had interfered in any way with the functioning of Oyster's computer system, the court nonetheless denied FPI's motion for summary judgment. According to the court, following the decision in ''eBay'', plaintiffs only need to demonstrate that the defendant's actions "amounted to a 'use' of Plaintiff's computer," and the court determined that copying the metatags amounted to a use.&lt;ref name=Oyster /&gt;

These cases indicate that, at least in California, a plaintiff did not have to demonstrate any kind of actual interference with the computer system to successfully claim trespass to chattels.

=== The backlash against the tort's expansion ===

However, some courts subsequently limited tort claims for electronic trespasses, in that a complaining party may be unable to recover for lack of real harm if the party did not suffer any tangible damage to their property. 

The Supreme Court of California reversed the trend exemplified by ''Oyster'' in the seminal case ''Intel v. Hamidi'' (2003), reaffirming the need for a demonstration either of actual interference with the physical functionality of the computer system or of the likelihood that this would happen in the future.&lt;ref name=Hamidi&gt;''Intel v. Hamidi'', 30 Cal.4th 1342 (Cal. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Intel conceded that Hamidi's emails caused neither physical damage nor any disruption to their computer system, they alleged that the economic productivity lost due to the disruption caused by the emails could sustain a trespass claim. The Supreme Court of California disagreed, holding that the tort does not extend to claims in which the electronic communication involved "neither damages the recipient computer system nor impairs its function."&lt;ref name=Hamidi /&gt; In reaching this conclusion, the court criticized the understanding of ''eBay'' advanced in ''Oyster'', explaining that previous cases in which courts have found trespass to chattels in the electronic setting have involved either "actual or threatened interference with the computers' function."&lt;ref name=Hamidi /&gt; To that effect, the court in ''Oyster'' misconstrued the holding in ''eBay''; trespass requires more than use a use--it requires an actual or threatened interference with the physical functionality of the system. 

Although the vast majority of states have yet to determine the applicability of the trespass to chattels theory, the courts that have addressed the issue have applied ''Intel'' and required that the plaintiff demonstrate damage to the computer system. A [[New York Supreme Court|supreme court in New York]] in [[School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz]] denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the trespass to chattels claim because the plaintiff had alleged actual damage to the functionality of the computer system, which Intel requires; the defendant had sent enough e-mails that it reduced the computer system's functionality and drained the hard drive's memory.&lt;ref&gt;''School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz'', 771 N.Y.S.2d 804 (N.Y. Sup. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Circuit in ''Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc.'' also followed ''Intel'', although this resulted in granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff did not allege any actual damage on its computer system.&lt;ref&gt;''Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc.'', 469 F.3d 348 (4th. Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The court clarified that Oklahoma courts have yet to recognize the validity of a trespass to chattels claim based on an electronic intrusion to a computer system, but if it were to recognize it, the plaintiff would need to allege more than nominal damages, which in this case it had not.

=== Cautions on expanding the tort in the electronic context ===

Although a number of commentators have expressed enthusiasm over the increasing "propertization" of intellectual property (that is to say, the increased application of real property doctrines to intangible property) and the extension of the trespass to chattels doctrine to computer networks,&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., David M. Fritch, "Click Here For Lawsuit – Trespass to Chattels in Cyberspace," 9 J. Tech. L. &amp; Pol'y 31 (June 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; a number of detractors have expressed concern over the ramifications of extending the theory to protect electronic communications that do not actually damage the computer systems in question but only cause nominal damage due to their content.&lt;ref&gt;[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [http://w2.eff.org/spam/Intel_v_Hamidi/20000118_eff_amicus.html Amicus Brief in ''Intel v. Hamidi''] (Jan. 18 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Laura Quilter]], ''[http://lquilter.net/pubs/trespass/Quilter-2002-17BerkeleyTechLJ421.pdf The Continuing Expansion of Cyberspace Trespass to Chattels]'', 17 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 421 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shyamkrishna Balganesh, "Common Law Property Metaphors on the Internet: The Real Problem with the Doctrine of Cybertrespass," 12 Mich. Telecomm. &amp; Tech. L. Rev. 265 (Spring 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lastowka, "Decoding Cyberproperty," 40 Ind. L. Rev. 23 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  Primarily, these critics worry that extending trespass to chattels in this fashion would stifle free speech on the internet because any unwelcome email might constitute a trespass and may subject the sender not only to civil liability under the trespass theory but to criminal liability as well.&lt;ref&gt;EFF Amicus Brief in ''Intel v. Hamidi'' at 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would presumably reduce people's willingness to communicate freely on the Internet and curtail the Internet's ability to function as an open, democratic forum.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in situations where the electronic communication is an email that contains speech that is of importance to the public and the communications do not hamper the functionality of the recipient's computer system, First Amendment free speech protections ought to outweigh the property right in the unharmed computer system.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, critics have also expressed concerns that plaintiffs have employed the doctrine to stifle legitimate competition.&lt;ref&gt;EFF, [http://w2.eff.org/spam/20011218_eff_trespasstc_analysis.php EFF Analysis of Trespass to Chattels Legal Theory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180712/http://w2.eff.org/spam/20011218_eff_trespasstc_analysis.php |date=2008-12-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the screen-scraping cases indicate that courts might interpret trespass to chattels in such a way that allows major corporations to prevent price comparison sites from employing harmless bots to aggregate information that users want in a readily accessible format since it might encourage consumers to look elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/amicus/biddersedge_v_ebay.pdf Law Professors' Amicus Brief in ''eBay v. Bidder's Edge''] at 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the theory's extension to computer networks also note greater theoretical problems with the applicability of a real property theory to intellectual property. In order to explain why real property theories might extend to the Internet, proponents equate "cyberspace" with real land, arguing that owners of computer servers should have the same right of inviolability as owners of land receive to promote greater efficiency in transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Lastowka, "Decoding Cyberproperty" at 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, even if some aspects of cyberspace resemble real space, detractors contend that cyberspace is not like real land at all because "the 'placeness' of cyberspace is a matter of ongoing social construction."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, even if granting property rights might help to avoid problems of inefficiency and under-cultivation in the context of real property, critics note that nothing suggests that the same principles would also be effective in the context of computer networks—especially because the problem of under-cultivation does not tend to occur online.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Colorado Law School''' is one of the professional graduate schools within the [[University of Colorado System]].  It is a public law school, with more than 500 students attending and working toward a [[Juris Doctor]] or [[Master of Laws|Master of Studies in Law]].&lt;ref name="MSL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.edu/law/academics/degrees/msl-degree-program | title = MSL Degree Program | publisher = University of Colorado | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wolf Law Building is located in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and is sited on the south side of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] campus. The law school houses the William A. Wise Law Library, which is a regional archive for federal government materials and is open to the public. [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge]] graduated from the University of Colorado Law School in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/history-of-the-court/associate-justices/wiley-rutledge-1943-1949/ Wiley B. Rutledge, 1943-1949 « The Supreme Court Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Colorado Law School consistently ranks as a tier-1 [[law school]] in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' rankings (ranked 46th as of 2018).&lt;ref name="USNews2017" /&gt; It is renowned for its influence in the 12-state Rocky Mountain region and for the strength of its [[environmental law]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.edu/law/about-colorado-law | title = About Colorado Law | publisher = University of Colorado | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colorado's official 2015 ABA-required disclosures, 74.2% of the Class of 2015 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.&lt;ref name="ABA2015"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.colorado.edu/law/sites/default/files/Class%20of%202015%20ABA%20Employment%20Summary.pdf | title = Employment Summary for 2015 Graduates | publisher = University of Colorado | date = April 7, 2016 | format = PDF | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2015 graduates, the overall employment rate was 96% at 10 months after graduation, including JD-required, JD-advantaged, and other positions.&lt;ref name="ColoradoJobs"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.edu/law/careers/graduates | title = CU Law Graduate Employment Data | publisher = University of Colorado | date = April 7, 2016 | format = PDF | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Established in 1892, the University of Colorado Law School is a charter member in the [[Association of American Law Schools]] and appeared in 1923 on [[American Bar Association]]'s first ever publication of approved law schools.  Although always located on the greater Boulder campus, the law school has occupied five buildings since its founding.  For the first two years of its existence, the school was housed in the Kent building.  From 1894 to 1909 the school occupied the Hale Law Building.  For the next 50 years, until 1959, the school occupied the Guggenheim Law Building.  From 1959 to 2005, the law school occupied the Fleming Law Building.  In the fall of 2006, the law school once again moved and now sits in the Wolf Law Building.

== The Wolf Law Building ==
By the late 1990s, Colorado Law had outgrown its building. In 1997 law students voted to tax themselves with a $1,000 per year tuition differential to help finance the building, but in 2001 the State of Colorado General Assembly rescinded its earmarked funds from the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4303562 | title = CU Students Pay for State Stinginess | last = Spencer | first = Jim | newspaper = The Denver Post | date = September 8, 2006 | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the risk of accreditation loss, law students worked with campus leaders and successfully passed a $400 per year fee on all Boulder students to fund capital construction on the Wolf Law Building and three other campus projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalbar.org/news/releases/release090806.shtml?AID=/20060817/UPDATE/608170449 | title = CU Making History in Legal Education | last = Davis | first = Marthea | publisher = National Bar Association | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928060008/http://www.nationalbar.org/news/releases/release090806.shtml?AID=%2F20060817%2FUPDATE%2F608170449 | archive-date = September 28, 2011 | access-date = June 3, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wolf Law Building was dedicated on September 8, 2006, by [[United States Supreme Court]] justice [[Stephen Breyer]]. The dedication ceremony represented the end of a long and creative funding process for a public law school.

In addition to student funds, over $13&amp;nbsp;million in private gifts were donated to support the construction of the new law building. The Wolf family, in honor of Leon and Dora Wolf, were especially generous in their contribution to the new building that now bears their family name.

The Wolf Law Building was constructed under the United States Green Building Council's LEED certification rating system for environmental sustainability and received a Gold rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usgbc.org/projects/wolf-law-building | title = Wolf Law Building | publisher = United States Green Building Council | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado Law is the second law school to be housed in a certified LEED building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/law/about/wolf-law-building/leed-certified-building&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Wolf Law Building was named the 9th Most Impressive Law School Building in the World by Best Choice Schools.&lt;!--Is this relevant?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bestchoiceschools.com/50-most-impressive-law-school-buildings-in-the-world/ | title = The 50 Most Impressive Law School Buildings in the World | publisher = Best Choice Schools | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissions ==
Admission to the law school is highly competitive. The school received 3,175 applications for the class of 2014 and matriculated 163 students. The 25th and 75th percentile LSAT scores for entering students are 160 and 165, respectively; the median LSAT is 164. The 25th and 75th percentile GPA for entering students are 3.41 and 3.79, with a median of 3.64.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colorado.edu/law/details/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
According to Colorado's official 2015 ABA-required disclosures, 74.2% of the Class of 2015 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.&lt;ref name="ABA2015" /&gt; Colorado's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 8.8%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2015 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.&lt;ref name="LST2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lstscorereports.com/schools/colorado/2015/ |title=University of Colorado Profile | publisher = Law School Transparency | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Colorado for the 2013-2014 academic year is $51,110 for residents and $58,620 for nonresidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/law/admissions/tuition-residency |title=Tuition and Expenses}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $197,814 for residents and $219,168 for nonresidents.&lt;ref name="LST2015" /&gt;

===Controversial 2009 employment statistics===
In October 2009, the journal ''[[Law Week Colorado]]'' stirred controversy when it reported that only 35% of the school's Class of 2009 had jobs at graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby Jones (10/22/09) [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/10/22/absolutely-wretched-one-profs-take-on-legal-ed-in-the-down-market Absolutely Wretched’: One Prof’s Take on the State of Legal Ed] Wall Street Journal.  Retrieved 9-30-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abajournal"&gt;Debra Cassens Weiss (10/28/09) [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/placement_office_scrambles_at_law_school_where_65_of_grads_had_no_jobs Law School Says Stats on Jobless Grads Were Wrong; Publication Differs] ABA Law Journal.  Retrieved 9-30-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials from the school assailed the Law Week Colorado article.  Former Assistant Dean of the Office of Career Development SuSaNi Harris called Law Week Colorado's report the product of a "miscalculation" and "misunderstanding" and claimed Law Week Colorado "confused 'employed' and 'unemployed.'"&lt;ref name="abajournal"/&gt; Later, Associate Dean Dayna Matthew told Law Week Colorado that the numbers released were "premature" and asserted that the National Association of Legal Professionals (NALP) would release more favorable statistics in February 2010.&lt;ref name="abajournal"/&gt; The reason, Matthew said, was that the NALP discounted graduates who did not report their employment status.&lt;ref name="abajournal"/&gt;

For its part, Law Week Colorado stuck to its original statistics and noted that the University of Colorado had not provided any new statistics.&lt;ref name="abajournal"/&gt;

== Ranking ==
In 2008, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranked the University of Colorado Law School 32nd in the nation. In 2010, its ranking fell to 38th. In 2011, the school dropped to 47th, leading ''The Wall Street Journal'' to call the school "among the biggest fallers among the top 50".&lt;ref name="WSJ2011"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/03/15/the-2012-u-s-news-rankings-horns-hook-into-the-top-14/ | title = The 2012 U.S. News Rankings: Horns Hook into the Top 14 | last = Jones | first = Ashby | date = March 15, 2011 | publisher = ''The Wall Street Journal'' | access-date = June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school ranks 36th as of 2016.&lt;ref name="USNews2017" /&gt;

'''Witness tampering''' is the act of attempting to alter or prevent the testimony of witnesses within [[Criminal proceedings|criminal]] or [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil]] proceedings. Laws regarding witness tampering also apply to proceedings before the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], executive departments, and administrative agencies. To be charged with witness tampering in the United States, the attempt to alter or prevent testimony is sufficient. There is no requirement that the intended [[obstruction of justice]] be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1729. Protection of Government Processes—Tampering with Victims, Witnesses, or Informants—18 U.S.C. §  1512|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm01729.htm|publisher=Justice.gov|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In situations where '''intimidation''' or retaliation against witnesses is likely (such as cases involving [[organized crime]]), witnesses may be placed in [[witness protection]] to prevent suspects or their colleagues from intimidating or harming them.

In the [[United Kingdom]], witness intimidation is covered by [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], section 51. Under this act it is an offence to perform an act which is intended to and does intimidate a person who the offender knows or believes to be involved with a criminal case with the intention of disturbing the proceedings.

==United States==
In the United States, the crime of witness tampering in federal cases is defined by statute at {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1512}}, which defines it as "tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant." The punishment for such an offense is up to 20 years if physical force was used, attempted, or threatened. The tampering need not have actually been successful in order for it to be criminal.

One of the better known cases involving Section 1512 is ''[[Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States]]'', decided by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in May 2005.  The Supreme Court ruled that Section 1512 had been misinterpreted by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]], and reversed the decision of the lower court which had found the firm guilty of violating the section. The issue had, to some extent, become [[Mootness|moot]], because in 2002 the firm had all but dissolved as a result of prosecution on this criminal charge.

Examples of witness tampering include American politicians [[Buddy Cianci]], [[Meg Scott Phipps]] and [[Ted Klaudt]], convicted in 2001, 2003 and 2007, respectively.

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales, witness intimidation by unlawful means, such as violence, bribery, threats, or improper pressure, is known as [[Perverting the course of justice]].

Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/51/enacted|title=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the offences of intimidating a witness and taking revenge on a witness.

==By prosecutors==
A current source of controversy is the lack of penalties for prosecutors who commit witness tampering or other forms of prosecutorial misconduct. In the United States, prosecutors have full [[Legal immunity|immunity]] from [[civil liability]] regardless of how egregious their actions may be. However, prosecutors do not have immunity from criminal proceedings and can be professionally censured, but studies demonstrate that this rarely happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Leigh|title=Prosecutorial Misconduct Is Rarely Punished, Says New Study |journal=The National Law Journal|date=October 5, 2010|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202472897418&amp;slreturn=20140107134232}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2003, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled against a man named Shareef Cousin, who filed a lawsuit against New Orleans prosecutors after he was wrongfully convicted of the 1995 murder of Michael Gerardi. A number of examples of witness tampering during the trial were uncovered. In court, a friend of Cousin's was expected to testify for the prosecution that Cousin had confessed to him. Instead, he told jurors that he had been promised leniency in his own trial if he would falsely implicate Cousin for the murder. An eyewitness then testified that she saw Cousin commit the murder. Her original statement to police indicated that she had very poor vision and could not identify the killer. Her statements regarding her vision were not disclosed to the defense. Cousin also accused the state of illegally detaining many of his witnesses to prevent them from testifying in his defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/prosecutorial-misconduct-new-orleans-louisiana_n_3529891.html|title=The Untouchables: America's Misbehaving Prosecutors, And The System That Protects Them|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worst Forms of Hazards faced by Children at Work''' is a provision in the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation|Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation (No. 190)]] adopted by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) in 1999. It sets out the framework for examining and assessing, "work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety, or morals or children" ([[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|C182]], Article 3d).

This effort is an attempt to complement the earlier [[List of the worst forms of child labour (ILO convention)|list of worst forms of child labour]]. According to the ILO, "hazardous" child labour is the largest category of the "worst forms" of child labour. An estimated 115 million children, aged 5–17, work in dangerous conditions in sectors including agriculture, mining, construction, manufacturing, service industries and domestic service. It is found in both industrialised and developing countries. Kids can take on hazardous work at very early ages. The ILO estimates that some 22,000 children are killed at work every year worldwide. The numbers of those injured or made ill because of their work are not known.

== General guidelines ==

The ILO provides the following guidelines for work considered unsafe for children, such as:

* Involving [[toxicity|toxic]] chemicals or fumes, high-powered equipment or vehicles, cutting, pounding or blasting
* Taking place underground, [[underwater|under water]], at heights, in isolation, at night or in direct sunlight
* Involving long hours without [[break (work)|break]]s
* Carrying heavy loads
* In the presence of alcohol, drugs or crime
* In the presence of dangerous animals or insects
* Absent easy access to [[safe water]] or food
* In jobs with high injury rates

== Examples ==

* [[Hurrying|Hauling wagons]] in underground [[mining]]
* Contact with [[solvent]]s and [[glue]]s in the leather industry
* Glassworks (potential [[Lead poisoning]])
* Gold-mining (potential [[Mercury poisoning]])
* Underwater jobs without protective equipment, such as a wetsuit or air supply, in the fishing industry
* Agriculture (potential [[pesticide]] exposure)
* Bearing heavy loads in the [[construction]] industry
* Exposure to [[radioactive]] materials in the [[nuclear power]] plant
