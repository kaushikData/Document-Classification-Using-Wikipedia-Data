[[File:Dudley Peter Allen, by August Reinhold Franzén.jpg|thumb|Founder Dudley Peter Allen ([[August Reinhold Franzén]], 1915)]]
The '''Allen Memorial Art Museum''' (abbreviated "AMAM") is located in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], and is run by [[Oberlin College]].  Founded in 1917, its collection is one of the finest of any college or university museum in the United States, consistently ranking among those of [[harvard university|Harvard]] and [[yale university|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/art-museum/ Art Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The collection contains over 14,000 works of art.

The AMAM is primarily a teaching museum, and it is a vital cultural resource for the students, faculty, and staff of Oberlin College as well as the surrounding community. Notable strengths include seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish art, nineteenth and early twentieth-century European and contemporary American art, and Asian, European, and American works on paper. The collection is housed in an impressive Italian Renaissance-style building designed by [[Cass Gilbert]] and named after its founder, Dr. Dudley Peter Allen (B.A., 1875), a distinguished graduate and trustee of Oberlin College.&lt;ref name= "AMAM: About"/&gt;

The AMAM is also known for its art rental program which enables [[Oberlin College]] students to rent works of art by notable artists such as [[Renoir]], [[Picasso]], and [[Dalí]] for five dollars a semester.

In 1977, [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]] designed an addition that represents one of the earliest and finest examples of [[postmodern architecture]] in the United States. In 2011, the historic museum underwent a two-year retrofit; after which it was awarded with [[USGBC]] [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.oberlin.edu/home/news-media/detail.dot?id=3498088&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
[[File:Allen Memorial Art Museum - Oberlin College - interior 2.jpg|thumb|Allen's Central Rotunda, which contains the [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] art wings.]]
The Allen Memorial Art Museum has an outstanding collection of more than 12,000 objects – including paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, prints, drawings and photographs – that provide a comprehensive overview of the history of art from a variety of cultures.  The collection is particularly strong in European and American paintings and sculpture from the 15th century to today, and has important holdings of Asian paintings, scrolls, sculpture and decorative art, including a large group of [[Ukiyo-e]] prints. High-quality [[ancient art|ancient]] [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[African art|African]] and [[Pre-columbian art|Pre-Columbian]] art is represented. The museum also houses the [[Eva Hesse]] archives, which includes the artist’s notebooks, diaries, photographs and letters, and is proud to oversee, along with the Art Department, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]’s [[Weltzheimer/Johnson House]].

==Art Rental==
At the beginning of every semester students camp out in front of the north gate of the museum to get first pick of original etchings, lithographs and paintings by artists including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Warhol]], [[Dalí]], and [[Picasso]]. For five dollars per semester, students can hang these works on their dorm room walls. The program was started in the 1940s by [[Ellen H. Johnson]], a professor of art at Oberlin, in order to "develop the aesthetic sensibilities of students and encourage ordered thinking and discrimination in other areas of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Sue (September 26, 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1375">In the main type of '''anagram dictionary''', the letters in words or phrases are rearranged in alphabetical order, and these transpositions are themselves then ordered alphabetically within word-length groups, so that any words consisting of this group of letters can be found. This arrangement is designed for use in solving [[word puzzle]]s such as [[crossword]]s, or for playing games such as ''[[Scrabble]]''. The first such [[anagram]] dictionary was ''The Crossword Anagram Dictionary'' by R.J. Edwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=R.J.|title=The Crossword Anagram Dictionary|date=1978|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins|location=London|isbn=978-0214205873}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the other kind of anagram dictionary, words are categorized into equivalence classes that consist of words with the same number of each kind of letter. Thus words will only appear when other words can be made from the same letters.  

Anagram dictionaries were formerly produced by hand, but can now be trivially generated from any machine-readable word list by computer, for example, by the [https://wordsmith.org/anagram/ Internet Anagram Server] and this [https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/scrabble-word-finder/ Scrabble Word Finder], by sorting words in order of their sorted letter-strings.

[[Image:BillyGoldbergNYCAugust2006.JPG|thumb|Goldberg discussing his new book with [[Mark Leyner]] in New York City, August 2006]]

'''Billy Goldberg''' (born April 10, 1966) is a New York City [[emergency medicine]] physician at the [[NYU School of Medicine]] ([[Bellevue Hospital]] and [[New York University]] (NYU) Medical Center), where he is also an Assistant Professor and an Assistant Director in the Department of Emergency Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.nyu.edu/people/wlg2.html#%22NYU%20Medical%20Center%20Physician%20Directory,%22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723234617/http://www.med.nyu.edu/people/wlg2.html |archivedate=2008-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in 1992.

He has collaborated with writer [[Mark Leyner]] on two books of answers to commonly pondered, though discomforting, medical questions.  The two plan on making a third book to be released sometime in 2013. "That is if we're not dead from drinking all of those martinis and whiskey sours" said Mark Leyner when interviewed about the upcoming book.

The books are:
*[[Why Do Men Have Nipples|''Why Do Men Have Nipples? Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini'']] (2005)
*''Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? More Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Whiskey Sour'' (2006).

In September 2005, ''Nipples'' was #1 on the New York Times Bestselling Paperback Advice Books List.

Goldberg and Leyner attempt to answer questions such as, "What causes an ice cream headache?"; "Does it really take seven years to digest gum?"; and, "Why does your pee smell after eating asparagus?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8815628/ "Why does asparagus make my pee stink?"], MSNBC.com, August 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Goldberg posits the philosophy behind the books: "We spend every moment walking around in this incredibly well-constructed but hard-to-figure-out machine that is our bodies. Everything we do — when we think, when we hear, when we smell, when we eat — there are these processes that are happening that we don’t understand. You can’t escape from having these moments thinking, ''how does it work?''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14080457/ "Sex and the sleepy guy"], Jane Weaver, MSNBC.com, August 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Technique''''' is a book first published in 2001, co-authored by [[Renzo Gracie]], [[Royler Gracie]], [[Kid Peligro]] and [[John Danaher (martial artist)|John Danaher]] and illustrated by [[Ricardo Azoury]]. It was written on the request of [[Sheik Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nayan]], creator of the [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship|ADCC]].

The book describes the "[[paradigm shift]] in the [[martial arts]] in favor of [[grappling]] styles" as a result of [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] events, such as [[UFC 1]], in the early 1990s.  It explains the theoretical foundations of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] as a search for a solution to the fundamental problem of the [[Martial arts]], which it defines as "How can one successfully defend oneself against attack by a bigger, stronger, and more aggressive opponent?"

The book traces Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu's lineage to [[Mitsuyo Maeda]], a student of [[Jigoro Kano]], who taught his style of [[Judo]] to [[Carlos Gracie]].  From then, the [[Gracie family|Gracie clan]] further develops Jiu-Jitsu independently from the [[Kodokan]]. The book further explains how Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu differentiates itself from [[Judo]].

The book explains that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu does not have a set standard list of techniques or belt requirements, but that each school informally ranks their students according to actual fighting proficiency.  Nonetheless, the book then sets some guidelines as to what a typical Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu school might expect from a student at each belt rank; Blue, Purple, Brown, and Black.

Finally, the book describes its model of a typical fight and what a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fight looks like.

{{about|the portrait|the historical event|May Revolution}}
[[File:Cabildoabierto-Subercaseaux-edit.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Cabildo abierto del 22 de mayo de 1810''''' ("Open Cabildo of May 22, 1810") is a portrait made by the Chilean artist [[Pedro Subercaseaux]]. It shows the artist's interpretation of the [[Open Cabildo]] that took place in [[Buenos Aires]] on May 22, 1810, in the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]], and which was a turning point of the [[May Revolution]]. 

==Creation==
The portrait was painted in Chile in 1908, as requested by [[Ángel Justiniano Carranza]], for the [[centennial of the May Revolution]] that would take place in 1810. Subercaseaux mailed the following terms:

{{quote|...if, as I hope, it is worthy of the matter, I resolve to undertake this work, warning you that if the conduct to the satisfaction, it will be worth fifteen thousand pesos in national currency, with the dimensions of the box four feet wide by three high.&lt;ref&gt;Explanation printed at the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]] next to the portrait.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to current European historicist, Subercaseaux tried to choose a defining moment, recreate the atmosphere and give the magnificence required. To make lighting and perspective studies he was based on contemporary photos inside the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]], although it had been remodeled and was no longer similar to the colonial period. The moment depicted is the one when [[Juan José Paso]], who is the one that stands out from the crowd on the left, takes his turn to talk. In the crowd right in front, [[Mariano Moreno]] is represented with a grave and worried face.

Currently, the portrait is kept at the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]].

Twin-panel file managers have obligatory connected panels where action in one panel results in reaction in the second. Konqueror supports multiple panels divided horizontally, vertically or both, but these panels do not act as twin panels by default (the user has to mark the panels he wants to act as twin-panels).

==Network protocols==
Information on what networking protocols the file managers support. Note that many of these protocols might be supported, in part or in whole, by software layers below the file manager, rather than by the file manager itself; for example, the {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} Finder doesn't implement those protocols, and the Windows Explorer doesn't implement most of them, they just make ordinary file system calls to access remote files, and Konqueror either uses ordinary file system calls or [[KIO]] slave calls to access remote files.  Some functions, such as browsing for servers or shares, might be implemented in the file manager even if most functions are implemented below the file manager.

==File features==
Information on what basic file features the file managers support.
{| class="wikitable sortable" style="font-size: 85%; text-align: center; width: auto;"
|-
! style="width:12em" | File Manager
! Undo/redo file operation
! File compression 
! File encryption
! Rename busy files
! File preview
! File coloring filter &lt;ref&gt;Files matching certain user defined criteria (e.g. name pattern, attributes) are displayed in another color. Example: Since Windows 2000, the UI guide requires NTFS compressed files and folders displayed in blue, whereas uncompressed ones are black.&lt;/ref&gt; 
! File selection filter
! Paste clipboard as file
! File and folder reports
! ACL ([[Access control list]])
! Mass Rename &lt;ref&gt;Mass Rename is a feature to rename large number of files in a convenient way and including a preview, see the screenshot for an example. Common options are subdirectory inclusion, wildcards, manual mode (offering to edit names as text files in editors), counters, time related fields (e.g. "date created"), path related fields (e.g. "parent directory name"), regular expressions, etc. See also: [[Batch renaming]].&lt;/ref&gt;
! Run executable files

| {{yes}}
| {{yes}} &lt;ref&gt;ACL is dependent on the type and version of file- and operating system. Altap Salamander offers quick access to owner, auditing and permission settings in WinXP with NTFS 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Security protocol}}
'''DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities''' ('''DANE''') is an [[Internet security]] protocol to allow [[X.509]] [[digital certificates]], commonly used for [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS), to be bound to [[domain name]]s using [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ietfjournal.org/dane-taking-tls-authentication-to-the-next-level-using-dnssec/|last=Barnes|first=Richard|title=DANE: Taking TLS Authentication to the Next Level Using DNSSEC|work=[[IETF Journal]]|date=October 6, 2011|access-date=August 5, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is proposed in {{IETF RFC|6698}} as a way to authenticate TLS client and server entities without a certificate authority ([[Certificate authority|CA]]). It is updated with operational and deployment guidance in {{IETF RFC|7671}}. Application specific usage of DANE is defined in {{IETF RFC|7672}} for SMTP and {{IETF RFC|7673}} for using DANE with [[SRV Record|Service (SRV) records]].

== Rationale ==

TLS/SSL encryption is currently based on certificates issued by [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]] (CAs). Within the last few years, a number of CA providers suffered serious [[certificate authority#CA compromise|security breach]]es, allowing the issuance of certificates for well-known domains to those who don't own those domains. Trusting a large number of CAs might be a problem because any breached CA could issue a certificate for any domain name. DANE enables the administrator of a domain name to certify the keys used in that domain's TLS clients or servers by storing them in the Domain Name System (DNS). DANE needs the DNS records to be signed with DNSSEC for its security model to work.

Additionally DANE allows a domain owner to specify which CA is allowed to issue certificates for a particular resource, which solves the problem of any CA being able to issue certificates for any domain.

DANE solves similar problems as:

; [[Certificate Transparency]] : ensuring that rogue CAs cannot issue certificates without the permission of the domain holder without being detected
; [[DNS Certification Authority Authorization]] : limiting which CAs can issue certificates for a given domain

However, unlike DANE, those technologies have wide support from browsers.

== Email encryption ==

Until recently, there has been no widely implemented standard for [[email encryption|encrypted email]] transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postfix.org/TLS_README.html#client_tls_secure |title=Postfix TLS Support - Secure server certificate verification |publisher=Postfix.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sending an email is security agnostic; there is no [[URI]] scheme to designate secure SMTP.&lt;ref name="dane-smtp-berlin"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/87/slides/slides-87-dane-2.pdf | conference=IETF 87 Proceedings |title=DANE for SMTP |last1=Dukhovni |last2=Hardaker |publisher=IETF |date=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, most email that is delivered over TLS uses only [[opportunistic encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.filippo.io/the-sad-state-of-smtp-encryption/ |title=The sad state of SMTP encryption |author=Filippo Valsorda |date=2015-03-31 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since DNSSEC provides authenticated denial of existence (allows a resolver to validate that a certain domain name does not exist), DANE enables an incremental transition to verified, encrypted SMTP without any other external mechanisms, as described by {{IETF RFC|7672}}. A DANE record indicates that the sender must use TLS.&lt;ref name="dane-smtp-berlin"/&gt;

Additionally, a draft exists for applying DANE to [[S/MIME]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |draft=draft-ietf-dane-smime-09 |title=Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names For S/MIME |publisher=[[IETF]] |date=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IETF RFC|7929}} standardises bindings for [[Pretty Good Privacy|OpenPGP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |rfc=7929 |title=DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Bindings for OpenPGP |publisher=[[IETF]] |year=2016 |month=August |last=Wouters |first=P. |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==

=== Applications ===

* [[Google Chrome]] does not support DANE, since Google Chrome wishes to eliminate the use of 1024-bit RSA within the browser&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperialviolet.org/2015/01/17/notdane.html|title=ImperialViolet - Why not DANE in browsers|last=Langley|first=Adam|date=2015-01-17|website=www.imperialviolet.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}{{Self-published source|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DNSSEC previously used a 1024-bit RSA signed root,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Duane Wessels, Verisign |url=https://blog.verisign.com/security/increasing-the-strength-of-the-zone-signing-key-for-the-root-zone/ |title=Increasing the Strength Zone Signing Key for the Root Zone |publisher=Verisign.com |date=2016-05-16 |accessdate=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many zones are still signed with 1024-bit RSA).

== TLSA RR ==

The TLSA RR (Resource Record) for a service is located at a DNS name that specifies certificate constraints should be applied for the services at a certain TCP or UDP port. At least one of the TLSA RRs must provide a validation (path) for the certificate offered by the service at the specified address.

Not all protocols handle Common Name matching the same way. HTTP requires that the Common Name in the X.509 certificate provided by the service matches regardless of the TLSA asserting its validity. SMTP does not require the Common Name matches, if the certificate usage value is 3 (DANE-EE), but otherwise does require a Common Name match. It is important to verify if there are specific instructions for the protocol being used.

=== RR data fields ===

The RR itself has 4 fields of data, describing which level of validation the domain owner provides.

* [[#Certificate usage|the certificate usage field]]
* [[#Selector|the selector field]]
* [[#Matching type|the matching type field]]
* [[#Certificate association data|the certificate association data]]

E.g. &lt;code&gt;_25._tcp.somehost.example.com. TLSA 3 1 1 BASE64==&lt;/code&gt;

==== Certificate usage ====

The first field after the TLSA text in the DNS RR, specifies how to verify the certificate.

* A value of 0 is for what is commonly called ''CA constraint'' (and PKIX-TA). The certificate provided when establishing TLS must be issued by the listed root-CA or one of its intermediate CAs, with a valid certification path to a root-CA already trusted by the application doing the verification. The record may just point to an intermediate CA, in which case the certificate for this service must come via this CA, but the entire chain to a trusted root-CA must still be valid.{{efn|An uncommon example where this could be useful would be if you don't trust the root-CA completely, but many applications do still use it, and you do trust a specific of the intermediate CAs, so you list the intermediate and still get full trust path verification.}}
* A value of 1 is for what is commonly called ''Service certificate constraint'' (and PKIX-EE). The certificate used must match the TLSA record exactly, and it must also pass PKIX [[Certification path validation algorithm|certification path validation]] to a trusted root-CA.
* A value of 2 is for what is commonly called ''Trust Anchor Assertion'' (and DANE-TA). The certificate used has a valid certification path pointing back to the certificate mention in this record, but there is no need for it to pass the PKIX certification path validation to a trusted root-CA.
* A value of 3 is for what is commonly called ''Domain issued certificate'' (and DANE-EE). The services uses a self-signed certificate. It is not signed by anyone else, and is exactly this record.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! RR points&lt;br&gt;to a trust anchor !! RR points to an&lt;br&gt;end entity certificate,&lt;br&gt;i.e. a specific certificate&lt;br&gt;used in the TLS
|-
! '''Require PKIX validation'''   
| 0 || 1
|-
! '''PKIX path validation not required''' 
| 2 || 3
|}

==== Selector ====

When connecting to the service and a certificate is received, the selector field specifies which parts of it should be checked.
* A value of 0 means to select the entire certificate for matching.
* A value of 1 means to select just the public key for certificate matching. Matching the public key is often sufficient, as this is likely to be unique.

==== Matching type ====

* A type of 0 means the entire information selected is present in the [[#Certificate association data|certificate association data]].
* A type of 1 means to do a SHA-256 hash of the selected data.
* A type of 2 means to do a SHA-512 hash of the selected data.

==== Certificate association data ====

The actual data to be matched given the settings of the other fields. This is a long "text string" of BASE64 data.

=== Examples ===

The HTTPS certificate for ''www.ietf.org'' specifies to check the SHA-256 hash of the public key of the certificate provided, ignoring any CA.

 _443._tcp.www.ietf.org. TLSA 3 1 1 0C72AC70B745AC19998811B131D662C9AC69DBDBE7CB23E5B514B56664C5D3D6

Their mail service has the same exact certificate and TLSA.
 ietf.org. MX 0 mail.ietf.org.
 _25._tcp.mail.ietf.org. TLSA 3 1 1 0C72AC70B745AC19998811B131D662C9AC69DBDBE7CB23E5B514B56664C5D3D6

Finally, the following example, does the same as the others, but does the hash calculation over the entire certificate.
 _25._tcp.mail.alice[[.example]]. TLSA 3 0 1 AB9BEB9919729F3239AF08214C1EF6CCA52D2DBAE788BB5BE834C13911292ED9

The '''[[Dečani]] chrysobulls''' ({{lang-sr|Дечанске хрисовуље/Dečanske hrisovulje}}) or '''Dečani charters''' (Дечанске повеље/Dečanske povelje) are [[chrysobull]]s dating to 1321-1331, signed by [[Stefan Uroš III Dečanski of Serbia]], the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian King]], which contains a detailed list of households and villages in what is today [[Metohija]] and northwestern [[Albania]].

King Stefan Dečanski (r. 1321–1331) mentioned that the court dignitaries present at the Dečani assembly were the ''kaznac'', ''tepčija'', ''vojvoda'', ''sluga'' and ''stavilac''.&lt;ref name="Šarkić1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Srđan Šarkić|title=Srednjovekovno srpsko pravo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxQlAQAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Matica srpska|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earl Caddock''' (February 27, 1888 – August 25, 1950) was an American [[professional wrestler]] and [[World Heavyweight Championship (Original)|World Heavyweight Champion]] who was active in the early portion of the twentieth century. As the first man to bill himself as "The Man of 1,000 Holds" (a nickname used many times since), Caddock was one of professional wrestling's biggest stars between the years of 1915 and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Grandson William Caddock&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Earl Caddock was born February 27, 1888 in [[Huron, South Dakota]] to parents of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] heritage.{{ref|HornbakerCaddock}} His family name may have been "Caddach," "Craddock," or "Caddack," but he used the spelling "Caddock" exclusively throughout his wrestling career.{{ref|bio}}

As a child, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and the family moved to [[Chicago]] where he could be treated. Swimming was recommended as part of this treatment and he was given a membership in the local [[YMCA]] to facilitate this. During his time at the YMCA young Earl Caddock was exposed to [[wrestling]]. After his father was killed in a bizarre accident in which he fell down a [[manhole]], Earl Caddock moved to his uncle's farm in [[Anita, Iowa]]. He continued to wrestle and won many local championships.

==Amateur career==
In 1907 Earl Caddock returned to Chicago to enter college. There he received further training from Benny Reubin and joined the Chicago Athletic Association. It was around this time that he met Charlie Cutler and Ernest Kartje, two professional wrestlers. From 1914 to 1915, Earl Caddock won the AAU Lightheavyweight Championship twice, and the AAU Heavyweight Championship once.{{ref|HornbakerCaddock}}{{Ref|bio}}

==Professional career==
Through Cutler and Kartje, Caddock was introduced to [[Frank Gotch]] and [[Martin 'Farmer' Burns]] who began to train him for Professional wrestling. On June 8, 1915 Earl Caddock made his professional debut in a match against Jesse Westergaard. His popularity grew and on April 19, 1917 he defeated [[Joe Stecher]] for the [[List of early world heavyweight champions in professional wrestling|World Heavyweight Championship]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. {{Ref|bio}}

In December 1917 a tournament was held with the winner to be declared World Heavyweight Champion. Caddock walked out of this tournament over promoter [[Jack Curley]]'s refusal to bill him as World Heavyweight Champion.{{Ref|bio}} [[Wladek Zbyszko]] won the tournament and was declared the new World Heavyweight Champion. The appetite for a match between Caddock and Zbyszko was fierce and on February 8, 1918 it happened. The result was predictable with Caddock once again becoming World Heavyweight Champion. {{Ref|bio}} In August of that year his wrestling career was temporarily put on hold for his service in the [[World War I|First World War]].{{ref|HornbakerCaddock}}

Caddock was discharged from the Army on June 1, 1919 and he returned to his career in wrestling. The World Heavyweight Championship had changed hands a few times while he was at war and was once again held by Joe Stecher.{{ref|HornbakerCaddock}} A match between the two was immediately set. On January 30, 1920 fans packed [[Madison Square Garden]] to see Stecher defeat Caddock.{{Ref|bio}} This match was filmed by pioneer cinematographer [[Freeman Harrison Owens]], and is currently the oldest surviving filming of a professional wrestling match. {{YouTube|JQl6mmAtkbE}}

Caddock's career continued successfully for the next few years but he wouldn't be in another World Title match until 1921. In January of that year Caddock faced [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]] for the championship. Caddock's loss to Lewis in this match resulted in a near riot.{{Ref|bio}} Another title match in November against [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]] resulted in another failure to recapture the World Heavyweight Championship.

Earl Caddock's final match took place on June 7, 1922. He lost his last bid to regain the World Heavyweight Title to Ed Lewis.{{Ref|HornbakerCaddock}}

==Retirement from pro wrestling==
After he retired from wrestling Earl Caddock would continue to run his own business which he started while still wrestling. He ran a Ford agency selling cars, tractors and heavy machinery to farmers in [[Walnut, Iowa]].{{ref|HornbakerCaddock}} He would also go on to become President of the United Petroleum Corporation. Earl Caddock died in 1950 after major surgery for a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].{{ref|HornbakerCaddock}}

'''''Eppleton Hall''''' is a [[Paddle steamer|paddlewheel]] [[tugboat]] built in [[England]] in 1914. The only remaining intact example of a [[River Tyne|Tyne-built]] paddle tug, and one of only two surviving British-built paddle tugs (the other being the former Tees Conservancy Commissioners' vessel, {{PS|John H Amos}}),&lt;ref name=SunEcho&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/on-the-waterfront/Eppleton-Hall--end-of.3552743.jp |title=Eppleton Hall - end of an era |newspaper=[[Sunderland Echo]] |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is preserved at the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/safr/historyculture/eppleton-hall.htm |title=Eppleton Hall |work=[[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Eppleton Hall'' was built in 1914 by [[Hepple and Company]] of [[South Shields]], for the [[Lambton Collieries|Lambton and Hetton Collieries]] Ltd,&lt;ref name=Proud/&gt; and named after the house near [[Penshaw]] owned by the Hetton Coal Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eppleton Hall |url=http://www.hettonlocalhistory.org.uk/documents/newslettervol1issue3.pdf |format=pdf |work=Hetton-le-Hole Herald|volume=1 |issue=3 |date=February 2010 |publisher=Hetton Local History Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was designed to tow seagoing [[Collier (ship)|colliers]] from sea to wharf side and back, primarily in the [[River Wear]]&lt;ref name=SunEcho /&gt; and to and from the [[River Tyne]].{{Citation needed|reason=mainly Tyne or mainly Wear?|date=July 2013}} For sailing ships this saved time, while for larger steam and motor vessels it saved navigation and [[pilotage]] costs. She was also used to tow newly built ships out to the [[North Sea]].

She is one of two survivors of a once-numerous type of steam powered paddle tug that began with the 1814 "Tyne Steam Boat", later named ''Perseverance''. One of the last of her type built, ''Eppleton Hall'' was equipped with twin [[Surface condenser|surface condensing]] [[Marine steam engine#Grasshopper|side-lever engines]] of the [[Grasshopper beam engine|"grasshopper"]] or "half-lever" type, totalling {{convert|500|ihp|lk=in}}, also built by Hepple &amp; Company.&lt;ref name=Proud/&gt; Her speed was {{convert|10|kn}},&lt;ref name=Proud/&gt; and her engines could function independently of each other to aid manoeuvrability, enabling her to turn inside her own length.&lt;ref name=Haer&gt;{{cite web |title=Steam Tug Eppleton Hall |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca1500/ca1508/data/ca1508data.pdf |date=c. 1993 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053925/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca1500/ca1508/data/ca1508data.pdf |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |work=[[Historic American Engineering Record]] |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |id=CA-63 |format=pdf |access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tug was operated from 1914 by the [[Lambton Collieries|Lambton &amp; Hetton Collieries Ltd]] which, merged with the Joicey Collieries in 1924 to form the Lambton, Hetton &amp; Joicey Collieries Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLaren |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway |title=The Basic Industries of Great Britain |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/The_Basic_Industries_of_Great_Britain_by_Aberconway |chapter=Chapter X: Northumberland and Durham Coal and Engineering §Lambton Hetton Joicey Collieries |publisher=Ernest Benn |location=London |year=1927 |chapterurl=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/The_Basic_Industries_of_Great_Britain_by_Aberconway:_Chapter_X#Lambton_Hetton_Joicey_Collieries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1945, a little before the collieries themselves were [[nationalization|nationalised]] and vested in the [[National Coal Board]], the towage business was sold to France, Fenwick Tyne and Wear Ltd which, after refurbishment, operated her at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the [[River Wear]] until 1964.&lt;ref name=Proud/&gt; In 1952, the tug was modified slightly to obtain a passenger certificate, so that she could transport officials from newly built ships after they had completed their sea trials.&lt;ref name=Haer /&gt;

In November 1964 France, Fenwick Tyne &amp; Wear disposed of their last paddle tugs, ''Houghton'' (built in 1904, also by Hepple, for the Lambton Collieries, and which was scrapped) and ''Eppleton Hall''. The latter was sold to the [[Seaham]] Harbour Dock Company, where she worked alongside ''Reliant''.&lt;ref name=SunEcho /&gt;&lt;ref name=Haer /&gt;

Sold to shipbreakers Clayton and Davie Ltd for scrap in 1967,&lt;ref name=Proud /&gt;&lt;ref name=SunEcho /&gt; she was left sitting on a mud bank in [[Dunston, Tyne and Wear|Dunston]]. As part of the scrapping process her wooden afterdeck and interior were destroyed by fire prior to being broken up. The tug remained there for two years, deck frames warped, wood burned or rotted, hull part flooded and engines rusty but intact.&lt;ref name=Haer /&gt;

===Preservation===
News of the sale of the last steam paddle tug still in service anywhere in the world, the ''Reliant'', reached Karl Kortum, then director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum. Kortum informed museum trustee [[Scott Newhall]], who proceeded to Newcastle to purchase the ship.{{sfn|Newhall|1971|page=22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memories of Clayton and Davies |url=http://www.webwanderers.org/05_industry/shipbreaking/ |date=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704051709/http://webwanderers.org/05_industry/shipbreaking/ |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |department=Shipbreaking/Ship Repairing/Boat Building |website=Whickham Web Wanderers |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Caen1972&gt;{{cite news |last=Caen |first=Herb |title=Herb Caen |date=October 18, 1972 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |ref=harv |quote=Scott Newhall, guiding spirit of the S.F. Maritime Museum ever since he helped found it in 1948, has submitted his resignation as a trustee, reportedly because 'the cost accountants have taken over.' One good reason for his pique: the ancient tug, Eppleton Hall, which he sailed here from England in a daring exploit and then presented to the Museum, still lies unused along the waterfront because 'the cost accountants' won't lay out the piddling $8600 it would take to turn her into a public museum. Newhall put a quarter of a million dollars and several buckets of blood, sweat and tears into that old ship and at the moment it all seems down the drain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan met with opposition, as the British [[National Maritime Museum]] had prior claim to the 1907 built ''Reliant'', as they planned to scrap the hull and preserve one or both of the Side Lever ( or Grasshopper ) engines and perhaps a paddle wheel. It was suggested that a deal could be done, if the SMM were to buy the Eppleton Hall and pay for the cost of fitting out the display for the NMM in exchange for the operable ''Reliant''.

Despite the fact that ''Eppleton Hall'' was already in a partially scrapped condition and would have been equally suitable to provide either or both of her two engines, attempts to negotiate with the then NMM Curators Mr. [[Basil Greenhill]] and the [[Leslie Runciman, 2nd Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Viscount Runciman of Doxford]] collapsed following six months of deliberations on the part of the NMM. The final communication between the two museums was described by Newhall in his book as being "fatuous, uncooperative or downright insulting", as it seemed to suggest that adapting the identical non-running engines from the scrap tug for display in Greenwich would require "massive re-planning", that ''Reliant'' could not possibly steam intact from Newcastle to San Francisco, and, by implication, that the San Francisco Maritime Museum could not afford to pay for either venture.{{sfn|Newhall|1971|page=28}}

Newhall then attempted to acquire ''Reliant'' by subterfuge, leading a team to Seaham to collect the tug pretending to be representatives of the NMM. This attempt apparently failed when the police were called.{{sfn|Newhall|1971|pages=29–34}}

The day after this Newhall acquired the remains of the derelict ''Eppleton Hall'' from Mr. HW Clayton of Clayton and Davey with the intention of restoring her for return to San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Haer /&gt;

Rebuilt at Bill Quay, near [[Hebburn]] on the river Tyne,&lt;ref name=SunEcho /&gt; during 1969, the tug was modified to enable her to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] under her own steam, requiring the fitting of modern navigational aids, radio, an enclosed wheelhouse and conversion from coal to diesel oil firing. Thus ''Eppleton Hall'' was made to serve as Kortum's "private [[yacht]]" and was re-registered as such. On 18 September 1969 the tug sailed on the first leg of the journey to San Francisco (via the [[Panama Canal]]) to pass under the [[Golden Gate bridge]] by late March, 1970, six months and nine days after setting sail.

Newhall subsequently wrote the book ''The Eppleton Hall'' which tells the story of the discovery and restoration of the ship, the events surrounding ''Reliant'', and the eleven thousand mile journey from the Tyne to San Francisco. The route chosen was determined by the tug's conversion to diesel firing with the resultant limited fuel capacity and her low overall power output. Sailing via Dover, Lisbon, Cape Verde, Georgetown, via Panama and San Diego to name but a few of her scheduled stops; not counting running out of fuel in the Bay of Biscay, vacuum pump failure in mid Atlantic, rescuing a fishing vessel off the coast of Mexico, and nearly foundering in a storm out of San Diego on the final leg to San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Newhall1971&gt;{{cite book |last=Newhall |first=Scott |title=The Eppleton Hall |year=1971 |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=[[Howell-North Books]] |isbn=0-8310-7085-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donated by Kortum to the [[National Park Service]] in 1979, she is now berthed at Hyde Street Pier, San Francisco. She has been restored to resemble her condition post-War 1946, when refurbished for France Fenwick, Tyne and Wear Ltd.

===Present Day===
Not eligible for grants reserved for US built vessels, the ship is visible from and moored to Hyde Street Pier but is not open to the public for boarding. Despite this it is in a superior condition to {{PS|John H Amos||2}}, a similar paddle tug built in Scotland in 1931, currently lying at Chatham awaiting funds for restoration, having been sunk in 1994 and then salvaged some years later.
 
''Reliant'' was dismantled by the National Maritime Museum and sectioned for display in pride of place in the Museum's Neptune Hall, where it remained on display until 2005. The tug was then controversially removed and scrapped as a cost reduction exercise, with only a single engine and a sectioned representation of one paddle wheel remaining on display (as had been originally intended back in 1969). Further controversy followed as members of the public complained to have been told that the tug, having been visited by many during its nearly 25 years on display, had been put into 'storage' when this was not the case.{{citation needed |date=January 2014}}

[[File:2Bio Field Trip Waiake.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Biology students on a field trip to Waiake Beach in [[Torbay, New Zealand]]]]
A '''field trip''' or '''[[excursion]]''' is a journey by a group of people to a place away from their normal environment. When done for students, it is also known as '''school trip''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[New Zealand]], '''school tour''' in the [[Philippines]], '''''Ensoku''''' {{Nihongo|遠足|Ensoku}} ('Excursion') in [[Japan]] and '''Klassenfahrt''' in [[Germany]].

The purpose of the trip is usually ''[[observation]]'' for [[education]], non-experimental [[research]] or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates. The aim of this [[research]] is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples. It is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school, and field trips provide a common ground with more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to have some of the same cultural experiences in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene, Kisida, Bowen|first1=Jay P., Brian, Daniel H.|title=The Educational Value of Field Trips|url=http://educationnext.org/the-educational-value-of-field-trips/|website=Education Next|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field trips are most often done in 3 steps: preparation, activities and follow-up activity. Preparation applies to both the student and the teacher. Teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip. Activities that happen on the field trips often include: [[Lecture|lectures]], [[tours]], [[Worksheet|worksheets]], videos and demonstrations. Follow-up activities are generally discussions that occur in the classroom once the field trip is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bitgood|first1=Stephen|title=School Field Trips: An Overview|date=Summer 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]] people first come across this method during school years when classes are taken on school trips to visit a [[geological]] or [[geographical]] feature of the landscape, for example. Much of the early research into the [[natural sciences]] was of this form. [[Charles Darwin]] is an important example of someone who has contributed to [[science]] through the use of field trips.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Popular field trip sites include [[Zoo|zoos]], [[nature centers]], [[community agencies]] such as fire stations and [[Hospital|hospitals]], [[Government agency|government agencies]], [[Businesses|local businesses]], [[amusement parks]], [[Science museum|science museums]], and [[factories]]. Not only do field trips provide alternative educational opportunities for children, they can also benefit the community if they include some type of community service. Field trips also provide students the opportunity to take a break from their normal routine and experience more hands on learning. Places like zoos and nature centers often have an interactive displays that allow children to touch plants or animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kulas|first1=Michelle|title=What are the Benefits of Field Trips for Children?|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/127612-benefits-field-trips-children/|website=LIVESTRONG.com|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, culturally enriching field trips are in decline. Museums across the country report a steep drop in school tours. For example, the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]] in [[Chicago]] at one time welcomed more than 300,000 students every year. Recently the number is below 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations saw a 30 percent decrease in student attendance. A survey by the [[American Association of School Administrators]] found that more than half of schools eliminated planned field trips in 2010–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Educational Value of Field Trips|url=http://educationnext.org/the-educational-value-of-field-trips/|website=Education Next|publisher=EdNext|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site school ==
A variation on the field trip is the "site-based program" or "site-school" model, where a class temporarily relocates to a non-school location for an entire week to take advantage of the resources on the site.  The approach was first developed at the [[Calgary Zoo]] in Alberta, Canada in 1993, and "Zoo School" was inaugurated in 1994.  The [[Calgary Board of Education]] then approached the [[Glenbow Museum and Archives]] to create a "Museum School" in 1995 followed by the [[Calgary Science Centre]] (1996), the [[University of Calgary]] (1996), [[Canada Olympic Park]] (1997), the [[Inglewood Bird Sanctuary]] (1998), [[Calgary City Hall]] (2000), [[Cross Conservation Area]] (2000), the [[Calgary Stampede]] (2002), the [[Calgary Aero-Space Museum]] (2005), and the [[Fire Training Academy]] (2008).  The model spread across Alberta (with 15 sites in Edmonton alone), throughout Canada and to the United States.  Global coordination of the model is through the "Beyond the Classroom Network".&lt;ref&gt;http://btcn.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

A somewhat similar model in France called ''classe de mer'' (sea class), ''classe de neige'' (snow class), or ''classe verte'' (green class) involving [[outdoor education]] trips that last several days, however these may not involve support from museum or zoo staff as in the Canadian model.

A '''file archiver''' is a [[computer program]] that combines a number of [[computer file|files]] together into one [[archive file]], or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage. File archivers may employ [[lossless data compression]] in their [[archive format]]s to reduce the size of the archive.

Basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives. The archive files need to store [[metadata]], at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible. More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the [[Timestamping (computing)|original timestamps]], [[file attribute]]s or [[access control list]]s.

The process of making an archive file is called ''archiving'' or ''packing''. Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed ''unarchiving'', ''unpacking'' or ''extracting''.

==History==
An early archiver was the [[Multics]] command ''archive'', descended from the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]] command of the same name, which was a basic archiver and performed no compression. Multics also had a "tape_archiver" command, abbreviated ''ta'', which was perhaps the forerunner of unix' ''tar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Vleck|first1=Tom|title=Multics Glossary - A|url=http://www.multicians.org/mga.html|website=multicians.org|accessdate=Jan 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unix archivers==
The [[Unix]] tools ''[[ar (Unix)|ar]]'', ''[[tar (file format)|tar]]'', ''[[cpio]]'' act as archivers but not compressors. Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], or [[xz]], to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file. The [[filename extension]]s are successively added at each step of this process. For example, archiving a collection of files with ''tar'' and then compressing the resulting archive file with ''gzip'' results a file with &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; extension.

This approach has two goals:
#It follows the [[Unix philosophy]] that each program should accomplish a single task to perfection, as opposed to attempting to accomplish everything with one tool. As compression technology progresses, users may use different compression programs without having to modify or abandon their archiver.
#The archives use [[solid compression]]. When the files are combined, the compressor can exploit redundancy across several archived files and achieve better compression than a compressor that compresses each files individually.

This approach, however, has disadvantages too:
#Extracting or modifying one file is difficult. Extracting one file requires decompressing an entire archive, which can be time- and space-consuming. Modifying one means the file needs to be put back into archive and the archive recompressed again. This operation requires additional time and disk space.
#The archive becomes damage-prone. If the area holding shared data for several files is damaged, all those files are lost.
#It's impossible to take advantage of redundancy between files unless the compression window is larger than the size of an individual file. For example, gzip uses [[DEFLATE]], which typically operates with a 32768 byte window, whereas bzip2 uses a [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]] roughly 27 times bigger. xz defaults to 8 MiB but supports significantly larger windows.

==Windows archivers==
The built-in archiver of [[Microsoft Windows]] as well as third-party archiving software, such as [[WinRAR]] and [[7-zip]], often use a [[graphical user interface]]. They also offer an optional [[command-line interface]], while Windows itself does not. Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression. [[Solid compression]] may or may not be offered, depending on the product: Windows itself does not support it; WinRAR and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Guinness Book of Astronomy''''' is a book ({{ISBN|0-85112-375-9}}) by the British astronomer [[Patrick Moore]], first published in 1979, and running to seven editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Moore|title=The Data Book of Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDDpBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP8|date=1 January 2000|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-1-4200-3344-1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the book is written like a ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', with paragraphs like "the most luminous [[star]]", "the farthest star", and so on. [[Solar system]] objects are explained in detail.

The second part is a detailed sky atlas for amateur [[astronomy]] observations: for each [[constellation]], a list of bright and dim stars, [[deep sky object|deep sky]] and other notable objects is given to the reader. The object tables are so complete that this book alone is enough for months of observations with small telescopes.

[[File:Harold James Ruthven Murray.jpg|thumb|H. J. R. Murray]]
'''Harold James Ruthven Murray''' (24 June 1868 – 16 May 1955) was an English educationalist, [[inspector of schools]], and prominent [[chess historian]]. His book, ''[[A History of Chess]]'', is widely regarded as the most authoritative and most comprehensive history of the game.&lt;ref name="Eales2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eales, Richard|title=Chess: The History of a Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwoJAAAACAAJ|publisher=Hardinge Simpole Publishing|isbn=9780951375730|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Murray, the eldest of eleven children, was born near Peckham Rye in [[Peckham]], [[London]].   The son of [[James Murray (lexicographer)|Sir James Murray]], the first editor of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', he attended school at [[Mill Hill]] and during his spare time helped his father produce the first edition of the OED. By the time Harold had finished school and was preparing to leave for university, he had been responsible for over 27,000 quotations that later appeared in the OED.

He won a place at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] where in 1890 he graduated with a first class degree in Mathematics. He became an assistant master at [[Queen's College, Taunton]] where he learned to play chess.  Later he was assistant master at [[Carlisle Grammar School]] and in 1896 he became headmaster of [[Ormskirk Grammar School]] in Lancashire.  On 4 January 1897 he married Miss [[Kate Maitland Crosthwaite]]. In 1901, he was appointed a school inspector and in 1928 he became a member of the [[board of education]].

Murray was a champion of the [[left-handed]], defending children against the attempts of schools to make them conform by using their right hand.&lt;ref name="Brewer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oed.hertford.ox.ac.uk/main/content/view/262/345/#Appendix|title=Katherine Maud Elisabeth Murray (1909-98)|last=Brewer|first=Charlotte|work=Examining the OED|publisher=Charlotte Brewer|accessdate=30 May 2011|location=Hertford College, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of chess==
In 1897 he was encouraged by [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa|Baron von der Lasa]] (who had just completed his book on the history of European chess) to research into the further past of chess.  Murray gained access to the largest chess library in the world, that of [[John G. White]]  of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and also used the collection of J. W. Rimington Wilson in England.  The White collection contained some Arabic manuscripts, so Murray learnt [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (in addition to his native [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]) and examined many historical chess documents.  The research took him 13 years, and he contributed articles on aspects of chess history to the ''[[British Chess Magazine]]'' and the ''Deutsches Wochenschach'' in this time.  In 1913 he published his most significant work, ''[[A History of Chess]]'', proposing the theory that chess originated in India.  This remains the most widely accepted theory today.  (See [[Origins of chess]].)

In 1952 Murray published ''A History of Board Games other than Chess''.  Although ''A History of Chess'' was recognised as the standard reference on the subject, its scholarly approach and great length (900 pages) made it inaccessible to most chess players.  Murray began a shorter work on chess history written in a more popular style.  Although begun many years earlier this work was unfinished at his death.  It was completed by B. Goulding Brown and [[Harry Golombek]] and published in 1963 as ''A Short History of Chess''.

Murray was the father of the archaeologist [[Kenneth Murray (archaeologist)|Kenneth Murray]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3949">The '''Howland will forgery trial''' was a [[United States|U.S.]] court case in 1868 to decide [[Henrietta Howland Robinson]]'s contest of the [[Will (law)|will]] of Sylvia Ann Howland. It is famous for the [[forensic]] use of [[mathematics]] by [[Benjamin Peirce]] as an [[expert witness]].

==History==
Sylvia Ann Howland died in 1865, leaving roughly half her fortune of some 2 million [[USD|dollars]] ({{Inflation|US|2000000|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) to various legatees, with the residue to be held in [[Trust law|trust]] for the benefit of Robinson, Howland's niece. The remaining principal was to be distributed to various beneficiaries on Robinson's death.

Robinson produced an earlier will, leaving her the whole estate outright. To the will was attached a second and separate page, putatively seeking to invalidate any subsequent wills. Howland's [[executor]], Thomas Mandell, rejected Robinson's claim, insisting that the second page was a forgery, and Robinson sued.

In the ensuing case of ''Robinson v. Mandell'', [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] testified that he had made pairwise comparisons of 42 examples of Howland's signature, overlaying them and counting the number of [[Ballistic stroke|downstrokes]] that overlapped. Each signature featured 30 downstrokes and he concluded that, on average, 6 of the 30 overlapped, 1 in 5. [[Benjamin Peirce]] showed that the number of overlapping downstrokes between two signatures also closely followed the [[binomial distribution]], the expected distribution if each downstroke was an independent event. When the admittedly genuine signature on the first page of the contested will was compared with that on the second, all 30 downstrokes coincided, suggesting that the second signature was a tracing of the first.

[[Benjamin Peirce]], Charles' father, then took the stand and asserted that, given the independence of each downstroke, the [[probability]] that all 30 downstrokes should coincide in two genuine signatures was &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2.666 \times 10^{21}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;"one in 2,666,000,000,000,000,000,000", that is, in the [[order of magnitude]] of sextillions&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to observe

&lt;blockquote&gt;So vast improbability is practically an impossibility.  Such evanescent shadows of probability cannot belong to actual life.  They are unimaginably less than those least things which the law cares not for. ... The coincidence which has occurred here must have had its origin in an intention to produce it.  It is utterly repugnant to sound reason to attribute this coincidence to any cause but design.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The court ruled that Robinson's testimony in support of Howland's signature was inadmissible as she was a party to the will (see [[conflict of interest]]). The statistical evidence was not called upon in judgment.

The case is one of a series of attempts to introduce mathematical reasoning into the courts. ''[[People v. Collins]]'' is a more recent example.

'''IBM Redbooks''' are technical content developed and published by [[IBM]]'s International Technical Support Organization (ITSO).

IBM Redbooks are ITSO's core product. They typically provide positioning and value guidance, installation and implementation experiences, typical [[solution]] [[scenario]]s, and step-by-step "how-to" guides. They often include sample code and other support materials that are also available as downloads. Among the media options available are [[hard copy]] books, in IBM Redbooks [[CD-ROM]] collections, and on the [[Internet]]. IBM says that Redbooks publications are downloaded and viewed approximately 1.75M per quarter, on average&lt;ref&gt;

Redbooks are created through the ITSO residency process and are generally published 60–90 days after residency completion.

Draft Redbooks are Redbooks under development. The objective of making the draft versions available is to speed up access to books that are not yet published. Usually they are technically complete but are less polished and have not undergone the formal review that takes place for completed IBM Redbooks.

Redpapers are shorter technical documents that are only Web-published. They can be the result of ITSO residencies and may also be contributed from other sources. They reflect working experiences on the specific topic.

== History ==

When IBM initially moved into the Data Processing world, each computer was a stand-alone machine with limited stored program capability with little interaction with other devices or software. The only support documentation was a manual of operation outlining the basic capabilities of the computer. The technical specifications were restricted in their distribution and rarely available to users. With the advent of System/360 in 1964 with their connectability to various I/O components and their associated software, their installation and their very usage rapidly became a challenge. Hands-on training  was no longer just for the installation and maintenance professionals (Customer Engineers) but a necessity for the IBM System Engineers who ran and coded the systems. While the system engineers in the US Company had some access to the technical skills available in the Poughkeepsie Plant where the systems were built, the World Trade Division (the 131 countries outside of the US where IBM did business) had no such fall-back capability. 

To provide hands-on training in the usage of these systems, a center was established in Poughkeepsie NY – the World Trade System Center (WTSC, later changed to the International Technical Support Center – ITSO) where a few SE's from around the world could come for a short period to work on various computer systems that were “borrowed” from the assembly line for short periods before being shipped to their designated customers. In the early 1970s, as the IBM product line both expanded and specialized, under a new manager (M.Turin) the WTSC hands-on training concept was cloned, with WTSCs being set up in Endicott (mid-range systems), San Jose (storage systems), Boca Raton (System 3), Stuttgart (small systems), Raleigh (communication systems), Rochester (printers) and Palo Alto (database systems). While extremely successful, this hands-on training concept was still limited in the number of System Engineers that could be cycled through any of these locations. 

In 1974, the manager of the San Jose center (G. Radmall) came up with a major improvement to the concept. Instead of merely encouraging the various countries to send individuals to the centers for a week or two at Country expense for ad hoc training by WTSC personnel, the WTSC would propose specific training  projects related to newly announced systems and software and accept assignees for a 3-month “residency” period at WTSC expense. In return for absorbing the associated costs, before returning to their home country at the conclusion of their training, the  WTSC required these residents to document their training and experience for publication and distribution throughout WTC (and almost immediately throughout all of IBM).. The first of these document to be written was sent back to the Poughkeepsie Center to be printed. It happened that in the Center storeroom was a pallet of red oak tag that had been previously ordered to be made into various posters to hang around the center. Without much thought, this heavier red paper was stapled on as a protective cover to the document, printed with the WTSC logo (a series of circles representing the world that one of the SE's had sketched out) and the first of the IBM Redbooks was born. 

All the WTSCs used the red oak tag as covers, although sometime later when IBM-US also began producing such documents, they used a different cover color. Another distinguishing factor was that from the get-go, the WTSC, to acknowledge their contribution, printed the authoring SE's names and Home Country inside the Redbooks where they remain to this day. Shortly after the Redbooks became available, IBM-US informed the WTSC that it violated US policy to identify the author by name in any IBM publications. The WTSC responded by suspending distribution of their Redbooks in the US and the policy was rapidly changed. The value of the Redbooks was immediately apparent throughout both IBM and the customer world. Printing and distribution of the Redbooks grew exponentially and  within a few months it became necessary to turn over this activity to the formal IBM printing and distribution facility in Mechanicsburg.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

In the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], '''Jethro''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|θ|r|oʊ}}; {{lang-he-n|יִתְרוֹ}}, [[Hebrew language#Modern Hebrew|Standard]] ''Yitro'' [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] ''Yiṯerô''; "His Excellence/Posterity"; [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|شعيب}} ''[[Shuayb (prophet)|Shu-ayb]]'') or '''Reuel''' was [[Moses]]' father-in-law, a [[Kenite]] shepherd and priest of [[Midian]].&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible.

==In Exodus==
[[File:Jan Victors 003.jpg|thumb|right|330px|''Moses takes his leave of Jethro'' by [[Jan Victors]], c. 1635, from the incident in {{bibleverse||Exodus|4:18|NIV}}. Jethro is seated on the left, in red.]]

Jethro is called a [[priest]] of [[Midian]] and  became father-in-law of [[Moses]] after he gave his daughter, [[Zipporah]], in marriage to Moses. He is introduced in {{bibleverse||Exodus|2:18|NIV}}.

Jethro is recorded as living in Midian, a territory stretching along the eastern edge of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], northwestern Arabia. Some believe Midian is within the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. Biblical maps from antiquity show Midian on both locations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Jethro's daughter, Zipporah (Rohaya), became Moses's wife after Moses had fled [[Egypt]], having killed an Egyptian who was beating a [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[slavery|slave]]. Having fled to Midian, Moses intervened in a water-access dispute between Jethro's seven daughters and the local shepherds; Jethro consequently invited Moses into his home and offered him hospitality. However, Moses remained conscious that he was a stranger in exile, naming his first son (Jethro's grandson) "[[Gershom]]", meaning "stranger there".

Moses is said to have worked as a [[shepherd]] for Jethro for 40 years before returning to Egypt to lead the Hebrews to [[Canaan]], the "promised land". After the Battle at [[Rephidim]] against the [[Amalekites]], word reached Jethro that under Moses' leadership the Israelites had been delivered out of Egypt, so he set out to meet with Moses. They met in the wilderness at the "Mountain of God";&lt;ref&gt;Exod 18:5&lt;/ref&gt; Moses recounted to Jethro all that had taken place, and then, according to Exodus 18:9–12a:

{{quote|Jethro rejoiced for all the good which the Lord had done for Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

And Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all the gods; for in the very thing in which they behaved proudly, He was above them.”

Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and other sacrifices to offer to God.&lt;ref&gt;Exod: 18:9–12a NKJV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following this event, it was Jethro who encouraged Moses to appoint others to share in the burden of ministry to the nation Israel by allowing others to help in the judgment of smaller matters coming before him.

These events take place in the Torah portion [[Yitro (parsha)|Yitro]] (Exodus 18:1–20:23).

==Names==

There is some disagreement over the name(s) of Moses' father-in-law. In the [[King James Version|KJV]] translation of {{bibleverse||Judges|4:11|KJV}}, a man named Hobab appears as Moses' father-in-law, while {{bibleverse||Numbers|10:29|KJV}} makes him "the son of Raguel [Reuel] the Midianite, Moses' father in law". Reuel is noted {{bibleverse||Exodus|2:16|NIV}}, as "a priest of Midian" who had seven daughters. {{bibleverse||Exodus|2:18|NIV}} "the girls returned to Reuel their father". Reuel becomes Moses' father in law in {{bibleverse||Exodus|2:21|NIV}} "Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage."

In Numbers 10:29, the Hebrew for the name Raguel is the same as the Hebrew for Reuel. The reason for the difference is that the Hebrew character ע ([[ayin]]) in רעואל is sometimes used merely as a vowel and sometimes as "g", "ng", and "gn", because of the difficulty of its pronunciation by European speakers. Re-u-el, with the first syllable strong accented, is nearer to the true pronunciation. Some suppose he was father to Hobab, who was also called Jethro, a likely possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Adam, ''Commentary on The Holy Bible'', Abingdon Press, Nashville, vol. 1, pp. 300–301.&lt;/ref&gt;

It became, however, generally accepted that he had seven names: "Reuel", "[[Jether]]", "Jethro", "Hobab", "[[Heber the Kenite|Heber]]", "[[Kenite|Keni]]" (comp. Judges i. 16, iv. 11), and "[[Putiel]]"; [[Eleazar]]'s father-in-law (Ex. vi. 25) being identified with Jethro by interpreting his name either as "he who abandoned idolatry" or as "who fattened calves for the sake of sacrifices to the idol".&lt;ref&gt;Ex. R. xxvii. 7; Mek., Yitro, 'Amaleḳ, 1; Tan., Shemot, 11; comp. Targ. pseudo-Jonathan to Ex. vi. 25 and Soṭah 44a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=258&amp;letter=J&amp;search=Jethro#1035 JewishEncyclopedia.com – JETHRO&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Jolly Toper''''' is an oil painting by [[Judith Leyster]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] that is on long term loan to the [[Frans Hals Museum]] since 1959.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter&gt;Judith Leyster: A Woman Painter in Holland's Golden Age, by Frima Fox Hofrichter, Doornspijk, 1989, Davaco Publishers, {{ISBN|90-70288-62-1}}, catalog #5&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by the museum as a painting by [[Frans Hals]] and was attributed to Leyster by the researcher Juliane Harms in 1927.

==Provenance==
The painting was sold in Hotel Drouot in Paris in 1890 as by Hals or a son to Schiff and was bought by the Rijksmuseum in 1897 from [[Frans Kleinberger|F. Kleinberger]] of Paris.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt; The painting is signed and dated on the back wall above the tankard.

According to Hofrichter, the scene shows the popular [[Peeckelhaeringh]] figure in 17th-century comic plays.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt; The Peeckelhaeringh or Pekelharing character is often shown as a "Kannenkijker", or jug-looker. This is a signal that the mug is empty and the show is over. The figure in this painting bears a resemblance to another, similar painting, also by Leyster, but less finished.

A '''letterhead''', or '''letterheaded paper''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kperogi, Farooq|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/sunday/index.php/politics-of-grammar/15779-qa|title=Q and A on the grammar of food, usage and Nigerian English|publisher=''[[Media Trust|Daily Trust]]''|date=2014-01-26|accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the heading at the top of a sheet of [[Paper size|letter paper]] ([[stationery]]). That heading usually consists of a name and an address, and a [[logo]] or [[corporate design]], and sometimes a background pattern. The term "letterhead" is often used to refer to the whole sheet imprinted with such a heading.

==Overview==
Many companies and individuals prefer to create a letterhead template in a word processor or other software application.  This generally includes the same information as pre-printed stationery, but at lower cost.  Letterhead can then be printed on stationery (or plain paper) as needed on a local output device or sent electronically.

Letterheads are generally printed by either the [[Offset printing|offset]] or [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]] methods.  In most countries outside North America, company letterheads are printed [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] in size (210&amp;nbsp;mm x 297&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neenahpaper.com/Resources/AboutPaper/InternationalSizes|title=International Paper Sizes {{!}} Neenah Paper|website=www.neenahpaper.com|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In North America, the [[Letter (paper size)|letter size]] is typically 8.5 x 11 inches (215 x 280&amp;nbsp;mm).

Although modern technology makes letterheads very easy to imitate, they continue to be used as evidence of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence and the Advocate: A Contextual Approach to Learning Evidence, Christopher W. Behan. LexisNexis, 2014. {{ISBN|0327175044}}, 9780327175049&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal Evidence Review, Editor's blog, 2009. http://federalevidence.com/blog/2009/august/documents-produced-discovery-were-“authentic-se”-during-summary-judgment-proceeding&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lost Adams Diggings''' is a Southwestern treasure story that refers to the existence of a canyon rich in gold deposits somewhere in western '''New Mexico''' in the early 1860s.

== Legend ==
Adams, for whom the legend became known and whose first name forever has been lost to history, was born in Rochester, NY July 10, 1829.&lt;ref&gt;''Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver,'' Dobie, J. Frank, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1939, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1864 he was journeying in his wagon from Los Angeles to Tucson.&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; After Apaches set his wagon on fire, Adams drove a dozen saved horses towards [[Sacaton, Arizona]], with the hope to sell them. In Sacaton, Adams met a group of twenty one miners led by John Brewer traveling together in search of the gold fields.  The party also accounted the Pima-Mexican guide who promised the prospectors to lead them to the valley of gold :“I know a place where canyon walls cry tears of [gold] every day! And those tears are larger than your coins!” Supposedly, In 1862, the young Pima-Mexican had gone on an expedition with the Apaches when those attacked Pueblo Indians in western New Mexico.  While on the expedition he had seen gold nuggets that were larger than oak nuts. The young man had appreciation for works made out of silver and turquoise but had no knowledge of gold value. The miners made a bargain with the guide who only asked for a horse, a saddle, a weapon and some of the gold in exchange. The group was badly in need of horses, and when by fate Adams appeared in Sacaton with his twelve head, Brewer struck a deal with Adams on the terms that Adams would share leadership with him in exchange for donating his horses.

Twenty-two men set out on August 20.&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, pg 11&lt;/ref&gt; Along with their guide the group followed [[White River (Arizona)|White River]] and its east fork into the [[White Mountains (Arizona)|White Mountains]] and entered western New Mexico. The guide paused and pointed to two mountains that were shaped like sugar loaves. “The gold canyon lies at the foot of those peaks,” the guide said. According to Adams, from that mountain lookout the miners were able to observe [[San Francisco Mountains]]. Adams thought that this mountain range was located on [[Mount Ord (Apache County, Arizona)|Mt. Ord]], or on one of the mountaintops nearby. The miners entered a canyon with a fantastic gold deposit through 'the Little Door', as Adams referred to it. He said that the passageway was so narrow that the riders had to enter it one by one. They descended a canyon via a Z-shaped trail. At the bottom of the canyon was a spring with a low falls above it.&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few days the group collected a fortune of gold nuggets that they hid in a corn-grinding basin left by ancient Indians. The young guide left the miners on the first night after the discovery and after being paid. Before leaving the guide issued a warning. He told the group not to stay long in the canyon that was a campsite for Apaches. Apache Chief Nana and 30 warriors appeared the second day. The chief told them not to go above the falls. Some of the men started construction of a cabin. A cache of the gold was hidden under the cabin's hearth stone.&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, pgs 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; The miners continued to mine the gold until they ran out of supplies. The party decided to send Brewer and five others to buy more supplies at [[Fort Wingate|Old Fort Wingate]], west of modern [[Grants, New Mexico|Grants]].

After Brewer's party left, some of the men began secretly searching above the falls. They returned to camp with large nuggets. Adams warned them against it but the nuggets were kept.&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, pg 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine days after the provisions party did not return, Adams became concerned about their safety. Along with another miner named Davidson, Adams climbed out of the canyon to discover five bodies on the trail, Brewer was not among them. They raced back towards camp, but it was too late. A large party of Indians had reached the camp and killed the remaining miners. The cabin had been set on fire, making the hearth stone too hot to move.&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, pg 24&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later, Adams and Davidson were found by a military patrol out of Fort Apache, AZ.&lt;ref&gt;Dobie, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon recovery Adams settled in California and when the [[Apache Wars]] ended, he led several expeditions to find the canyon and the basin filled with gold. Adams must have had a terrible sense of direction, after so many years of searching his quest proved hopeless. But in his search he inspired others to joint the hunt.

In July 1949, 83-year-old Robert W. "Bob" Lewis, who said he had known Adams when he had been a [[cowpuncher]] and law officer in [[Socorro County, New Mexico]], stated that he and Adams searched for the gold together in 1889 twenty five years after the massacre in 1864. But it was not until 1918, that he claimed to have single-handedly found the skeletons and Adam's cabin at the mouth of a canyon 35 miles northwest of [[Magdalena, New Mexico]]. Lewis said that everything was there just as Adams had described except for the gold. He said he later found out the missing gold had been found by a Magdelena Sheepherder who received $20,000 for it with which he bought a ranch in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19490703&amp;id=aRsrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g50FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1881,661787&amp;hl=en|title=Old-Time Blasts Gold Myth Of Storied Adams Diggings|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|date= July 3, 1949|accessdate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible locations ==
For decades the [[Zuni Mountains]] were considered the most plausible location of the diggings. Thousands of prospectors, [[ranch]]-hands, and men-of-fortune searched this area and the rest of southwestern [[New Mexico]] prior to World War II, as the Adams diggings became the most sought-for gold in the country.  Only [[Frank Dobie]]'s 1939 book ''[[Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver]]'' adequately describes how renowned the Adams legend had become.  The combination of the [[Great depression|depression]] and the deregulation of the gold market prompted the most unlikely people to search for the diggings.  Between 1895 and 1930 several large logging communities flourished in the [[Zuni Mountains]], several with schools and post offices; wide-gauge railroads crisscrossed the mountains.  The loggers were well aware of the Adams legend, as it had become a nationally known story.  Between running logs nothing was more common than prospecting except for drinking.  Rumors of gold in the Zunis had become so common that the U.S. government ordered several geological expeditions in the years between World War I and World War II to verify whether this claim could be supported. The geologists found nothing.  In the 1950s the area was thoroughly re-explored for uranium during the [[uranium boom]] around [[Grants, New Mexico]]. Eventually the obsession with the Zuni Mountains as a host for the Adams diggings faded.  It was also around the mid-century that the popularity of the Adams legend began to diminish and the [[Lost Dutchman Mine]] became America's most sought-for [[Lost mines|lost gold mine]].  The Adams diggings were beginning to seem a hoax or a mine unlikely to ever be found.

Geologically, the Adams diggings could only be in the southwestern quadrant of the state.  Adams himself spent most of the remainder of his life searching the areas in and around [[Reserve, New Mexico]].  This area was the largest gold producing area in the state, and hosted several small mining booms, including the rich strikes at [[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]] and [[Pinos Altos, New Mexico|Pinos Altos]].  The areas that could conceivably host the diggings in this region (containing several large mountain ranges that remain sparsely inhabited) are numerous, as minerals and evidence of previous mining can be found throughout the area.  Local folklore will tell you that the gold is at the headwaters of either the Black River, the Gila River, or the Prieto River. Spanish Lore will tell you to look to the Blue Mountains. Dozens of mining camps in this region of New Mexico were thought to be the Adams diggings for brief periods, until each proved itself to be less rich than at first indicated: egregious hopes followed by rapid disappointment. That seems to be the story of gold in the desert southwest.

The Datils and Gallinas Mountains and the basins to the north of these mountains were considered possible locations for the diggings that increased in popularity as the other locations lost appeal.  Dick French, in his book ''Four Days from Fort Wingate'',&lt;ref&gt;French, Richard, "Four Days From Fort Wingate", Caxon Press, Caldwell, ID, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; places the diggings in this area.  It has become known as "Dick French’s area," although his location was known to have been found by others in the 1950s, if not earlier.  A follow-on work by Dick French, ''Return to the Lost Adams Diggings: The Paul A. Hale Story''&lt;ref&gt;French, Richard U., "Return to the Lost Adams Diggings: The Paul A. Hale Story", 2014&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2014 uses historical, artifactual, geographical, and geological data to demonstrate the viability of the location in [http://lostadamsgold.com the new book] as the locality of the Lost Adams Diggings.  The new book demonstrates the presence of significant gold mineralization, adds a wrinkle to the story by presenting evidence of colonial Spanish activity in the area dated to the 1600s, and identifies and locates every critical landmark.  The new book contains maps, pictures of artifacts, assay reports, and is written in a conversational format with Dick interviewing the re-discoverers Paul Hale and Ronald Schade.

A similar but geographically less plausible location was found in eastern Arizona by Don Fingado near [[Clifton, Arizona|Clifton]].  The site contains features described by Adams much like the area favored by Dick French; however, the gold remained undiscovered.

In some minds the gold was to be found on either the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] or [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] reservations, but the laws preventing the acquisition of mineral rights in these regions have discouraged searching.

There are other sites, but the leading candidates in the popular imagination are mentioned above.  If it really exists, its traditional location remains within "Apacheria" or the southwest quadrant of [[New Mexico]] and bordering areas in Arizona.  The complexity of the story is detailed in Jack Purcell's definitive book on the subject, ''The Lost Adams Diggings: Myth, Mystery, and Madness.''  This work, unlike its predecessors, is a serious attempt to give historical perspective supported by [[Citation|cited]] research.  Purcell believes that the gold exists and is perhaps somewhere in the mountains just south of [[Quemado, New Mexico]].  Perhaps gold will be found someday, but in the minds of most, the legend is fading away among the other items in the forgotten annals of American lore.

== Legacy ==
The many stories arising or deriving from the lost diggings have inspired many to search for lost Apache gold ever since. Its legend has supplied many folk tales, stories and books with ample fuel for fantasies of lost treasures, hidden canyons, Apache secrets and gold "somewhere out there" in the wilds. Another supposed Indian name for the mine was "Sno-Ta-Hay," which supposedly means "there it lies" i.e. the gold is on the ground and can be picked up or panned as a [[placer mine]]. Chief Nana supposedly called it that when he first warned the Adams party before the attack. As previously mentioned, [[J. Frank Dobie]] devoted half of his book "Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver" (now in its ninth printing) to the story of the Lost Adams Diggings and considered it to be the greatest "lost mine" story of US history. The amount of mail being sent to western New Mexico during the 1930s prompted the government to create a new post office in the area affectionately named "Lost Adams Diggings, NM;" the post office has since closed.

The 1963 novel ''MacKenna's Gold'' by [[Heck Allen]] is loosely based on the Adams legend. The novel was made into a film in 1969 with the title ''[[Mackenna's Gold]].'' Numerous other books about, or based on, the diggings have been written.

The '''National Museum of Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|Народни музеј Србије}}, {{lang|sr-Latn|Narodni muzej Srbije}}) is the largest and oldest museum in [[Serbia]] and former [[Yugoslavia]]. It is located in the central zone of Belgrade on a square plot between the [[Republic Square (Belgrade)|Republic Square]], formerly Theatre Square, and three streets: Čika Ljubina, [[Vasa Čarapić|Vasina]] and Laze Pačua. Its main facade is on the Republic Square and the official address ia 1a Republic Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Tamara Marinković-Radošević | title = Beograd - plan i vodič |date = 2007 |publisher = Geokarta | location = Belgrade |isbn = 86-459-0006-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Beograd - plan grada | date = 2006 | publisher = M@gic M@p | location = Smedrevska Palanka | isbn = 86-83501-53-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.narodnimuzej.rs/stari-sajt/en/contact/ | title = National Museum - contact | date = 2018 | publisher = National Museum of Serbia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was established on 10 May 1844. It moved into the present building in 1950, with the grand opening of the venue on 23 May 1952. Since its founding, the museum's collection has grown to over 400,000 objects, including many foreign masterpieces.&lt;ref name=dodatak&gt;{{cite news | author = Marija Đorđević| title = Како смо могли без музеј | trans-title = How we managed through without a museum | newspaper = Politika-Kulturni dodatak, Year LXII, No. 11 | pages = 01–02 | language = Serbian | date = 23 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Museum of Serbia building was declared a [[Monuments of Culture of Great Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Culture of Great Importance]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{CHS-SANU|Link=723|Name=Зграда управе фондова / Building of Fund Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before erection of the building of the National Museum on this place was famous tavern called "Dardanelles", meeting point of cultural and artistic elite of the time. Demolition of the old tavern signified the beginning of the transformation of The Republic Square. The building which housed the most important museum of Republic of Serbia today, originally was built from 1902 to 1903, for the purpose of Fund Mortgage Bank, one of the oldest banking institution of Belgrade. Building has constructed according to design of architects Andra Stevanović and Nikola Nestorović after a competition on which they received the first prize. It was one of the first building in which was used some form of reinforced concrete for the foundation. Actually during the digging foundation trenches, the various pits, wells and basements were encountered because of the proximity of the former [[Republic Square (Belgrade)#Stambol Gate|Stambol Gate]]. Newly built two-storeyed building was a real palace of its time. Its volume conception designed in the form of a long solid block with domes over the central and lateral rizalites and academic façade shape were based on the principles of neo-Renaissance style with neo-baroque elements on the domes. The greatest attention was given to the monumental staircase and the hall with bank windows which as the basic premises of a bank was given a secondary importance. Almost three decades later, an increased development of Mortgage Bank, influenced a need for a reconstruction of the building. The extension was made without competition by architect Vojin Petrović, who designed the added wing and [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] facing the street Laze Paču. The new part of the building contained the same elements of interior as the old part, and in the final image the building got two monumental staircases and two halls with bank windows while only the upper floors form the continuous line of offices. During World War II Mortgage Bank building was bombed and the central part with the dome was destroyed. After the war, the building got a completely new purpose when one of the most important national cultural institution moved in.

Since its establishing during the Constitutionalist, until the end of the Second World War the National Museum changed location for several times. At a beginning, it was placed in [[Captain Miša's Mansion|Captain Miša’s building]] (1863) and soon after it was moved into two adjacent buildings which were destroyed during World War I. At the same time the museum art collections were seized and looted by the invaders. During the interwar period the Museum didn’t get its own building. The museum was located in a rented private house at 58 [[Kneza Miloša street]]. In 1935 the New Royal Palacе became the residence of the museum and named the Royal Museum. Subsequently, it was renamed into the Museum of Prince Paul which consisted of Historical Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art (founded in 1929), which merged in 1935.&lt;ref name=dodatak/&gt; In 1948 the New Palace was restored and became administrative seat of the Republic. For that purpose the Museum was transferred into a building of the former Stock Exchange on the Student Square, and partly to Palace of Princess Ljubica.

The first architectural competition for the proper National Museum building, planned to be on Tašmajdan was announced the following year.

The author of the design was an architect Miladin Prljevic but the Cominiform disapproved this idea. Then the museum was transferred into the building of Mortgage Bank. After the World War II, the first renovation of bank building was done by architect Dobroslav Pavlovic in 1950 but the overall reconstruction of the building was made 1965-1966 by architects [[Aleksandar Deroko|Alexander Deroko]], Petar Anagnosti and Zoran Petrović. The central dome was restored and the central tract with offices and workspaces was lifted. After an adaptation the original hall with bank windows was converted into a library. The originally main and monumental three-way staircase entrance from the Republic Square received an internal character while the other entrance from Vasina street became the main entrance to the Museum, which is connected directly to the other hall with bank windows was. In a functional arrangement, the building underwent upgrading doubling space and communications, while in terms of design, maintained the characteristic elements of 1902 and in terms of art as an integral unity. Interior renovation from the sixties of the 20th century was done in such manner that it is not visible from the outside and it doesn’t disturb the communications inside the museum.

=== 2003-2018 reconstruction ===

In 2003, the permanent exhibition was dismantled and the building was closed for the impending reconstruction, but the process dragged on for years, including the gaps when nothing have been done at all, and by January 2018 the museum was still not open.&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{ cite news | title = Brešković: Ljudi su skeptični, ne veruju da ćemo muzej zaista otvoriti | trans-title = Brešković: people are skeptical, they don't believe we will really open the museum | newspaper = [[Politika]] | page = 15 | language = Serbian | date = 4 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2012, after ten years of the National Museum in Belgrade being closed to the public, Vladimir Bogdanović of the leading Serbian newspaper/website ''Press'' wrote an article called ''A decade of cultural genocide against the Serbs'', commenting on the need and importance of a working national museum. He also criticised the preservation of the art in the museum.&lt;ref name="Decenija kulturnog genocida nad Srbima"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/Nedeljnik/story/199756/Decenija+kulturnog+genocida+nad+Srbima.html |author=Vladimir Bogdanović of ''Press'' |title=Decenija kulturnog genocida nad Srbima |accessdate=2012-01-27 |date=2012-01-25 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The façade was finished in 2015 and had to be reconstructed to its original look as the building is under the state protection. In the mid-2016 the works on the interiors began. The entrance into the museum from the ''Vasina'' Street will remain the main entry point, while the exit doors that lead to the Square of the Republic, with its architectural staircase, will be adapted to be the exit point.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

The new permanent exhibit will represent the cultural development in this part of Europe from prehistory to the 20th century, with an emphasis on the Serbian cultural heritage. The 18th and 19th centuries art will be exhibited on the first floor, so as the 20th century Yugoslav art. In the atrium of the building there are vaults, left from the period when the venue served as a bank, which will be adapted into the exhibition depots. The look of the vault will be preserved and will serve for the presentation of the museum numismatic collection, from the beginning of the coin minting to the 20th century. In addition, a collection of the medallion art will be exhibited here, too.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;
[[File:Svečano_otvaranje_Narodnog_muzeja_Srbije,_06.jpg|thumb|right|National Museum of Serbia has opened its doors on 28 June 2018, scenes from the opening]]

The construction works should be finished by March 2018, when the preparation and setting of the collections should start.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

On 18 June 2018, 10 days before the scheduled opening, reporters from the daily [[Politika]] visited the museum. They reported that the venue doesn’t look like something to be open in several days, and the employees confirmed that it would take at least six more months to complete everything, but that the museum will be open as scheduled. The reporters were not allowed to photograph everything. Even though the reconstruction projects, by architects Milan Rakočević and Vladimir Lojanica, envisioned several major changes (including the reconstruction of the glass roof and a dome destroyed during the heavy [[Allied bombing of Yugoslavia in World War II|1944 Allied Easter bombing of Belgrade]]), nothing was actually changed so after 15 years the building wasn’t thoroughly reconstructed as announced, but only refurbished. This way the capacity of the exhibition space wasn’t enlarged, so the permanent exhibition will have 3,000 pieces, out of 400,000.&lt;ref name=dodatak/&gt;

The large [[mural]] by Mladen Josić, painted in the 1930s and located on the wall of the [[mezzanine]], was preserved. Josić painted another mural, close to the former dome, but was destroyed in the 1944 bombing.  One of the remnants of the 1966 reconstruction, when museum was managed by Lazar Trifunović,  is a window decorated with the [[wrought iron]]. The window was originally facing outside until 1933 when the annex was added to the building.&lt;ref name=dodatak/&gt;

=== Re-opening ===

The National Museum was officially re-opened on 28 June 2018.&lt;ref name="Turistički svet"&gt;https://www.turistickisvet.com/news/tourism/otvaranje-narodnog-muzeja-u-beogradu-28-juna-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; The grand re-opening ceremony included projections on the buildings facade, as well as a promotional video featuring famous Ukrainian ballet dancer Sergei Polunin.

=== Today ===
The National Museum of Serbia is a representative public building, monumental in size and volume, as well as its external shape and style. That is especially visible in the entrance area with twin columns and magnificent dome. All the facades characterized with polychrome ornaments neo-Renaissance origin. Monumentality is also reflected in the interior with rich decoration done by famous artists of the time: [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131358/http://www.mpus.org.rs/mpus/licnost.php?id=66 Andrea Domenico] (also known as a painter of decorative wall painting that is in the interior of the building of the [http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=1331 Old Palace]), Franz Valdman and Bora Kovacevic.

Because of its architectural and cultural, urban and historical value building of the National Museum of Serbia is established for the cultural heritage monument of great importance for the Republic of Serbia.

== Collections ==
The Museum has 34 archeological, numismatic, artistic and historical collections today.

=== Archeological collections ===
The main collection consists of sculptures from [[Vinca]] (6th–5th millennium BC) such as [[Lady of Vinča]] and [[Lepenski Vir]] (7th millennium BC).
There are also numerous sculptures, weapons, helmets and other items from [[ancient Rome]], 1005 items from [[ancient Greece]] and various items of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin. The most valuable pieces from that period are ''Dupljaja Chariot'' (16th-13th century BC), golden masks from [[Trebenište]] (6th century BC), household sets from Jabučje (1st century AD), the Belgrade Cameo (4th century) and a ''Silver belt with swastika (5th century BC)''.
There is also a collection from ancient [[Egypt]]. The most famous piece is a rare gold [[sarcophagus]] and [[mummy]] of the Egyptian priest [[Nesmin]].

The Collection of Drawings and Prints of International Artists has 2,446 items and the Yugoslav Art Collection has more than 6,000 items, including 1,700 paintings of Serbian authors from 18th to 19th century and 3,000 paintings from the 20th century. This does not include the Serbian Medieval Art Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narodnimuzej.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=100 The collections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419194829/http://www.narodnimuzej.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=100 |date=2011-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum includes Serbian medieval, French, Dutch, Flemish, Italian, Russian, German, Japanese, Chinese (from 1644-1978), English, Spanish, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Yugoslav and miscellaneous art collections. In total the collection numbers some 16,000 paintings, graphics, drawings, icons and prints, plus over 900 sculptures.

The French masters collection is the National Museum's most significant holding. It comprises extremely rare pieces from [[Matisse]], [[Picasso]], [[Renoir]], [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]], [[Degas]], [[Cézanne]] and others. Most of these paintings were collected and donated by [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia]]. [[Erih Šlomović]], a young Belgrader born at the turn of the 20th century, became in his youth the protégé of the world's biggest art merchant, Ambroise Vollard. The connection led him to develop his own collection, comprising a total of 600 pieces by 1941. The Slomovic Collection is the largest and richest collection of French art in the Balkans, as well as one of the most beautiful in the world.

==== Italian art collection ====

'''Nationalmuseum''' (or '''National Museum of Fine Arts''')  is the [[national gallery]] of Sweden, located on the peninsula [[Blasieholmen]] in central [[Stockholm]].

== History ==
The museum's benefactors include King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] and [[Carl Gustaf Tessin]].  The museum was founded in 1792 as ''Kungliga Museet'' ("Royal Museum"). The present building was opened in 1866, when it was renamed the ''Nationalmuseum'', and used as one of the buildings to hold the 1866 [[General Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1866)|General Industrial Exposition of Stockholm]].

The current building, built between 1844 and 1866, was inspired by North Italian [[Renaissance architecture]].  It is the design of the German architect [[Friedrich August Stüler]], who also designed the [[Neues Museum]] in [[Berlin]]. The relatively closed exterior, save for the central entrance, gives no hint of the spacious interior dominated by the huge flight of stairs leading up to the topmost galleries.  The museum was enlarged in 1961 to accommodate the museum workshops. The present restaurant was instated in 1996. The museum building closed for renovation in 2013 and reopened on 13 October 2018.

== Collections ==
The museum collection consists of about half a million drawings from the [[Middle Ages]] to 1900, a prominent 17th-century collection of Rembrandt and other Dutch painters, and a collection of porcelain items, paintings, sculptures, and modern art as well.  The museum also has an art library, open to the public and academics.

They operate in northern Paraguay, with most incidents occurring in [[Concepción Department (Paraguay)|Concepción Department]], as well as the neighboring departments of [[Canindeyú Department|Canindeyú]] and [[San Pedro Department, Paraguay|San Pedro]].  The EPP are believed to number 50-80 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Infosurhoy.com |url=http://infosurhoy.com/en_GB/articles/saii/features/main/2013/11/26/feature-01 |title=Paraguay: Government increases presence to combat EPP |publisher=Infosurhoy |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2012, the group was suspected of carrying out 27 separate operations, with more than half of them occurring after January 2011. These incidents resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people — 9 civilians and 7 police officers.&lt;ref name="ramsey"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsey|first=Geoffrey|title=Tracking the Rise of Paraguay's Rebel Army|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/tracking-the-rise-of-paraguays-rebel-army|newspaper=In Sight Crime|date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2013, the insurgency resulted in killing of at least 33 civilians and police officers,&lt;ref name=fox08122013&gt;"The EPP has now killed 33 people, including police officers and civilians, since 2005, the government said."

==Origins==
The EPP began as an offshoot of another radical fringe group, the Free Homeland Party ([[Partido Patria Libre]] – PPL). After the PPL was taken apart by police in 2005, several members decided to form a new group with which to continue the armed struggle.&lt;ref name="diaz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Díaz|first=Natalia Ruiz|title=Paraguay: Controversy Over Troop Deployment|url=http://www.soaw.org/presente/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=298&amp;Itemid=74|date=May 4, 2010|newspaper=¡Presente!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
[[File:EPP Commandant.jpg|thumb|Alcides Oviedo Brítez, current EPP leader.|alt=]]
{{main article|Insurgency in Paraguay}}
By December 2013, the insurgency resulted in killing of at least 33 civilians and police officers,&lt;ref name=fox08122013/&gt; with an unknown number of killed EPP operatives. Two EPP operatives were killed in early April 2014, including the third in command in EPP; one Paraguayan soldier was also killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/paraguay-lauds-heavy-blow-to-epp-after-leaders-death |title=Paraguay Lauds Heavy Blow to EPP After Leader's Killing - InSight Crime &amp;#124; Organized Crime in the Americas |publisher=InSight Crime |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2016, the insurgents ambushed a mobile patrol of the Paraguayan army with a roadside bomb and automatic weapons, killing one officer and eight [[non-commissioned officer]]s. The guerrillas stole their [[M4 carbine|M-4 carbines]] and a light machine gun, along with 1,500 round of ammunitions. The incident took place near the village of Arroyito, east of [[Concepción, Paraguay|Concepción]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/notas/el-atentado-mas-cruel-del-epp-en-19-anos-1513026.html|title=El atentado más cruel del EPP en 19 años - Edicion Impresa - ABC Color|last=Color|first=ABC|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPP criticized the government of [[Fernando Lugo]], saying that he ignored the country's social problems and would not implement real [[land reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivo.abc.com.py/2008-11-12/articulos/468967/anuncian-ocupaciones-violentas-en-nombre-del-ejercito-del-pueblo-paraguayo|title=Anuncian ocupaciones violentas en nombre del Ejército del Pueblo Paraguayo|work=ABC Digital|first=Freddy|last=Rojas|date=November 12, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403091217/http://archivo.abc.com.py/2008-11-12/articulos/468967/anuncian-ocupaciones-violentas-en-nombre-del-ejercito-del-pueblo-paraguayo|archivedate=April 3, 2012|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the EPP declared war on [[Federico Franco]]'s cabinet, describing the [[Impeachment of Fernando Lugo]] as a "white collar theft". The Paraguayan state describes the group as a terrorist organization.

==Links with other organizations==
It is known that at least one key [[FARC]] leader, Orley Jurado Palomino, has gone to Paraguay to provide training, advice and operational leadership to the insurgent group.&lt;ref name="escurra"&gt;{{cite news|last=Escurra|first=Marta|title=Paraguayan guerrillas were trained by the FARC|url=http://infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/en_GB/features/saii/features/main/2010/03/16/feature-01|newspaper=infosurhoy.com|date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unclear if the EPP has ties with some major Brazilian [[drug trafficking]] organizations, like the First Capital Command ([[Primeiro Comando da Capital]] – PCC) and Red Command or [[Comando Vermelho]] which are known to have a significant presence in northern Paraguay.&lt;ref name="barrios"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrios|first=Hugo|title=Paraguay ups counter-narcotics effort on border with Brazil|url=http://infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/en_GB/features/saii/features/main/2011/04/12/feature-03|newspaper=infosurhoy.com|date=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnappings===
Along with armed raids, arson attacks and bombings, the group has also been accused of the kidnapping and murder of [[Cecilia Cubas]], the daughter of former [[President of Paraguay]] [[Raúl Cubas Grau]], as well as the abduction of Fidel Zavala, who was freed on January 17, 2010, after 94 days in captivity.&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words''''' was first published in 1972 by [[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy Press]] and distributed by [[Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.|Simon &amp; Schuster]]. Written by [[Robert Anton Wilson]], it is sub-titled '''''A liberated dictionary of improper English, containing over 700 uninhibited definitions of [[erotica|erotic]] and [[Scatology|scatological]] terms'''''. The paperback edition's cover featured [[Mercy Rooney]]. It is a collection of 'items' from "Abbess" to "Zoophilia Erotica".
 
Interviewed by ''Common Ground'', Vancouver (July 1999 Issue), Wilson talked about how he'd been tinkering with ''Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words,'' which he considered his best book—worst, that is, after the editors at ''Playboy'' did to the book "what the Roman Army did to the [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Sabine women]]". Claiming ignorance and inexperience, he had not objected at the time. If he had later rewritten the book the way he had wanted it to be the first time, he would have called it ''Robert Anton Wilson's Book of Black Magick and Curses''. He aimed to include all the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] and [[Neuro-linguistic programming|neurolinguistic]] theorems that ''Playboy'' removed.
Portions of this work are reprinted (reedited by Wilson with an added explanation of his problem with ''Playboy'') in his 1988 work ''Coincidance''.

The '''Royal Commission on the British Museum''' ('''RCBM''') was set up to review the activities of the [[British Museum]] particularly in relation to its [[British Library|Library]].

The Commission was set up following an approach made by a number of eminent scientists to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] sent on 10 March 1847.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Sir Anthony Panizzi'', Volume 1, by [[Louis Alexander Fagan]], p256&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1847 the original Commission was set up with eleven members and a quorum of five. Having met three times by the end of the year, it was found that the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary events]] on the continent of [[Europe]] provided a distraction, and the commission failed to meet its quorum on occasions. On 5 May 1848 the commission was re-established with fourteen members and a quorum of three.&lt;ref name=r257&gt;''The Life of Sir Anthony Panizzi'', Volume 1, by Louis Alexander Fagan, p257&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The Commission was headed by [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Ellesmere]]. Other active members included [[Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset|Lord Seymour]], [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]], [[Roderick Murchison]], [[Andrew Rutherfurd, Lord Rutherfurd|Lord Rutherfurd]]. [[John Payne Collier]] acted as secretary (which was before his activities as [[forger]] had come to light).&lt;ref name=r257/&gt;

==British Museum Library Catalogue==
A major part of the RCBM was concerned with the British Museum Library Catalogue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">'''Sheffield Local Studies Library''' (located in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]]) collects and preserves printed material relating to Sheffield and the surrounding area, and makes it available for study and research. The collection of over 30,000 volumes includes books, pamphlets, journals and reports on all aspects of the city's history and development and the lives of its people. Information on present day Sheffield includes statistics and special files on current issues.

The Local Studies Library is a joint service with [[Sheffield Archives]].  They are part of the Sheffield Libraries Archives and Information Service delivered by [[Sheffield City Council]].The Local Studies Library is situated on the first floor of [[Sheffield Central Library]].

== Materials in the collections ==

=== Electoral registers ===

Registers of electors from 1841 to the present.

Before the Second World War maps were produced as a ‘County Series’ at a scale of 6 inches to 1 mile (1:10,560) and 1:2,500 (25 inches to 1 mile). As Sheffield lies on the boundary of Yorkshire and Derbyshire and has extended its boundaries at various times, this sometimes leads to confusion.

Yorkshire:&lt;br /&gt;six-inch maps for this area were first published 1853-55.&lt;br /&gt; 1:2,500 maps were published in 1890 and revised in about 1905, 1923 and 1935.

Derbyshire:&lt;br /&gt;six-inch and 1:2,500 maps were first published in 1876 and revised in about 1898, 1923 and 1938.
 
There are also town plans of Sheffield (these do not cover the whole of the present city):&lt;br /&gt;
1853 at 1:1056 scale&lt;br /&gt;
1890-93/1903 at 1:500 scale
 
The National Grid survey began in 1949 and continues to the present day. Maps are available at 1:10,000, 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales. Coverage at the largest scales is restricted to Sheffield.

=== Illustrations ===

Over 60,000 illustrations, mainly black and white photographs, of people, places and events in the Sheffield area.

=== Ephemera ===

Includes many miscellaneous printed items such as publicity leaflets, posters, trade literature, playbills and property sale plans.

=== Sound recordings ===

Recordings of local interest include all types of music and the spoken word. There is also a collection of oral history recordings in which Sheffield people talk about their lives. 

=== Film and video ===

An important collection of archive film shows scenes of life in Sheffield.

'''''The Beginner's Guide to Computers''''' is a book about [[microcomputer]]s and general [[computing]]. It was published in 1982 as an accompaniment to the [[BBC Computer Literacy Project]]&lt;ref name="nyt sandberg-diment 1982"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/science/personal-computers-primers-in-old-fashioned-printers.html Personal computers; primers-in old fashioned printers], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 16 November 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Computer Programme]]''.&lt;ref name="wyoe 1983"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Yearbook of Education 1982/83: Computers and Education|year=1983|pages=250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxJGyptzaGEC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its content covers the basics of the [[history of computing]], [[programming language]]s, [[debugging]], [[logic programming]], [[semiconductor memory]], [[computer printing|printing]], [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]s/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]]s, [[flowchart]]s, as well as some technologies only found in Britain (such as [[Prestel]], [[Ceefax]], [[ORACLE (teletext)|ORACLE]]).&lt;ref name="nyt sandberg-diment 1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wyoe 1983" /&gt; The possibilities of [[computer network|network]]s, [[robotics]], [[electronic office]]s and [[desktop publishing|publishing]] are also considered, with particular reference to the [[BBC Micro]].&lt;ref name="wyoe 1983" /&gt;

== Reception ==

The book's square shape was described in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "clumsy", although this does not stop it from being a "quite decent introduction" which is "easy to read". Those interested in actually using [[personal computer]]s to "do something" were advised to look elsewhere.&lt;ref name="nyt sandberg-diment 1982" /&gt; The ''World Yearbook of Education 1982/83: Computers and Education'' described it as "lucidly written and well laid out with profuse illustrations", noting the use of "appealing cartoons".&lt;ref name="wyoe 1983" /&gt;

'''Ghulam Mohammad Baksh''' (22 May 1878 – 23 May 1960), better known by the [[ring name]] '''The Great Gama''', was a [[Pehlwani|wrestler]] from the [[British Raj]] who then moved to [[Lahore]],[[Pakistan]] post-partition where he lived for the rest of his days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/01/05/the-great-gama-and-lahore/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toi1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banerjee|first1=Sarnath|authorlink1=Sarnath Banerjee|title=Gamanamah: The story of a strongman|url=http://www.timescrest.com/society/gamanamah-the-story-of-a-strongman-7471|accessdate=11 July 2017|work=The Times of India|date=10 March 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131014144633/http://www.timescrest.com/society/gamanamah-the-story-of-a-strongman-7471|archivedate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hornbaker|first1=Tim|title=Legends of Pro Wrestling: 150 Years of Headlocks, Body Slams, and Piledrivers|date=2017|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|isbn=9781613218754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuGLDAAAQBAJ|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Amritsar]] village Jabbowal, then in the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] of [[British India]], in 1878, he was awarded the Indian version of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|World Heavyweight Championship]] on 15 October 1910, and went on to defeat grappling champions across the world. Undefeated in a career spanning more than 52 years, he is considered one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The culture and crisis of kushti|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/sainath/the-culture-and-crisis-of-kushti/article5297790.ece?homepage=true|newspaper=The Hindu|date=31 October 2013|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ghulam Mohammad Baksh was born in the city of [[Amritsar]] village Jabbowal into an ethnic [[Kashmiri Muslim]] family of wrestlers in the [[Punjab region]] of [[British India]].&lt;ref name="bio1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lentz III|first1=Harris M.|title=Biographical Dictionary of Professional Wrestling|date=2003|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|isbn=9780786417544|page=118|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyiSCgAAQBAJ|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Here's The Story Of Gama 'The Undefeated' Pehalwan And How He Saved Hindus During 1947 Riots |url=https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/here-s-the-story-of-gama-the-undefeated-pehalwan-and-how-he-saved-hindus-during-1947-riots-321745.html |work=[[India Times]] |date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pakistantoday"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Great Gama and Lahore |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/01/05/the-great-gama-and-lahore/ |work=[[Pakistan Today]] |date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a wrestling family which was known to produce world-class wrestlers.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Gama had two wives: one in Pakistan and the other in [[Vadodara|Baroda]], [[Gujarat]], India.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

After the death of his father Muhammad Aziz Baksh when he was six, Gama was put under the care of his maternal grandfather Nun Pahalwan.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Following his death, Gama was taken care of by his uncle Ida, another wrestler, who also began training Gama in wrestling.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} He was first noticed at the age of ten, in 1888, when he entered a [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] competition held in [[Jodhpur]], which included many gruelling exercises such as squats. The contest was attended by more than four hundred wrestlers and Gama was among the last fifteen, and was named winner by the Maharaja of Jodhpur due to his young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy|title=Nation at Play: A History of Sport in India|date=2015|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231539937|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5mACgAAQBAJ|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gama was subsequently taken into training by the Maharaja of [[Datia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/26954-the-great-gama-story-of-the-greatest-pehelwan-to-ever-walk-on-indian-soil.html|title=The Great Gama: Story Of The Greatest 'Buffer' To Ever Walk On Indian Soil|last=Prasher|first=Shantanu|newspaper=www.mensxp.com|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and diet==
[[File:Squat, baithak, Hindu squat, possibly 'The Great Gamma'.png|thumb|Gama performing a baithak]]
[[File:Dand, Dund, Hindu push-up.png|thumb|Gama performing a dand]]
Gama's daily training consisted of grappling with forty of his fellow wrestlers in the court ([[Akhada]]). He used to do minimum five thousand Baithaks ([[Hindu Squats]]) and three thousand Dands ([[Hindu Pushups]]) in a day and even sometime more within 30 to 45 minutes each by wearing a doughnut-shaped wrestling apparatus called Hasli of 200 pounds.&lt;ref name="The Great Gama"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legendarystrength.com/great-gama/|title=The Great Gama -|website=Legendary Strength|language=en-US|access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gama's daily diet was 
# 2 gallons (10 liters) of milk,&lt;ref name="The Great Gama"/&gt;
# one and a half pounds of crushed almond paste made into a tonic drink  
# fruit juice,
# six desi chickens,
# a half liter of ghee,
# six pounds of butter,
# three buckets of seasonal fruits,
# two desi muttons and other ingredients to promote good digestion and recovery, although this high-protein and high-energy diet helped him accumulate muscle mass.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

==Career==
===First encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala===
Fame came to Gama in 1895, at the age of 17 when he challenged then-Indian Wrestling Champion, middle-aged Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala, another ethnic Kashmiri wrestler from [[Gujranwala]], now in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], Pakistan.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} At about 7 feet tall, with a very impressive win-loss record, Raheem was expected to easily defeat the 5'7" Gama. Raheem's only drawback was his age as he was much older than Gama, and near the end of his career. The bout continued for hours and eventually ended in a draw.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} The contest with Raheem was the turning point in Gama's career. After that, he was looked upon as the next contender for the ''Indian Wrestling Championship''. In the first bout Gama remained defensive, but in the second bout, Gama went on the offensive. Despite severe bleeding from his nose and ears, he managed to deal out a great deal of damage to Raheem Bakhsh.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

By 1910, Gama had defeated all the prominent Indian wrestlers who faced him except the champion, Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala. At this time, he focused his attention on the rest of the world. Accompanied by his younger brother [[Imam Baksh Pahalwan|Imam Bakhsh]], Gama sailed to England to compete with the Western wrestlers but could not gain instant entry, because of his lower height.&lt;ref name=alter&gt;{{cite book|last=Alter|first=Joseph S.|title=The wrestler's body identity and ideology in North India|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520912175|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMu1xKEWBt4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tournament in London===
In London, Gama issued a challenge that he could throw any three wrestlers in thirty minutes of any weight class. This announcement however was seen as a bluff by the wrestlers and their wrestling promoter R. B. Benjamin.&lt;ref name="toi1"/&gt; For a long time no one came forward to accept the challenge. To break the ice, Gama presented another challenge to specific heavy weight wrestlers. He challenged [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]] and [[Frank Gotch]], either he would beat them or pay them the prize money and go home. The first professional wrestler to take his challenge was the American [[Ben Roller|Benjamin Roller]]. In the bout, Gama pinned Roller in 1 minute 40 seconds the first time, and in 9 minutes 10 seconds the other. On the second day, he defeated 12 wrestlers and thus gained entry to official tournament.&lt;ref name=alter/&gt;

===Match with Stanislaus Zbyszko===
He was pitted against world champion [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]]&lt;ref name=alter/&gt; and the date of bout was set as 10 September 1910. Zbyszko was now regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world; and he would then take on the mammoth challenge of India's feared Great Gama, an undefeated champion who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure Frank Gotch into a match. And so, on September 10, 1910, Zbyszko faced the Great Gama in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} The match was £250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. Within a minute, Zbyszko was taken down and remained in that position for the remaining 2 hours and 35 minutes of the match. There were a few brief moments when Zbyszko would get up, but he just ended back down in his previous position. Crafting a defensive strategy of hugging the mat in order to nullify Great Gama’s greatest strengths, Zbyszko wrestled the Indian legend to a draw after nearly three hours of grappling, though Zbyszko’s lack of tenacity angered many of the fans in attendance. {{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}
The two men were set to face each other again but Zbyszko didn't show up and Gama was announced victor. &lt;div class="mw-diff-inline-deleted"&gt;&lt;del&gt; &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mw-diff-inline-deleted"&gt;

===Bouts against American and European champions===
During this tour Gama defeated some of the most respected grapplers in the world, "Doc" [[Benjamin Roller]] of the United States, Maurice Deriaz of Switzerland, Johann Lemm (the European Champion) of Switzerland, and [[Jesse Peterson]] (World Champion) from Sweden. In the match against Roller, Gama threw "Doc" 13 times in the 15-minute match.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Gama now issued a challenge to the rest of those who laid claim to the World Champion's Title, including Japanese [[Judo]] champion [[Taro Miyake]], [[George Hackenschmidt]] of Russia and [[Frank Gotch]] of the United States – each declined his invitation to enter the ring to face him. At one point, to face some type of competition, Gama offered to fight twenty English wrestlers, one after another. He announced that he would defeat all of them or pay out prize money, but still no one would take up his challenge.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

===Final encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala===

Shortly after his return from England, Gama faced Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala in [[Allahabad]]. This bout eventually ended the long struggle between the two pillars of Indian wrestling of that time in favour of Gama and he won the title of ''Rustam-e-Hind'' or Champion of India. Later in his life when asked about who was his strongest opponent, Gama replied, "Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala".{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

===Rematch with Zbyszko===

After beating Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala, Gama faced Pandit Biddu{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}, who was one of the best wrestlers in [[India]] of that time (1916), and beat him.

In 1922, during a visit to India, the [[Prince of Wales]] presented Gama with a silver [[Ceremonial mace|mace]].

Gama did not have any opponents until 1927, when it was announced that Gama and Zbyszko would face each other again. They met in [[Patiala]] in January 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Wrestling Championship: Indian's Victory Over Pole|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepressb19280214-1.2.15|publisher=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertise|accessdate=9 May 2017|page=4|date=14 February 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the bout, Zbyszko "showed a strong build of body and muscle" and Gama, it was reported "looked thinner usual". However, he managed to overpower the former easily and won the bout inside a minute, winning the Indian version of the [[World Wrestling Championship]]. Following the bout, Zbyszko praised him calling him a "tiger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Wrestling Championship: Gama Beats Zbyszko|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepressb19280303-1.2.36|accessdate=9 May 2017|work=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser|date=3 March 1928|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;At forty-eight years old he was now known as the "Great wrestler" of India.&lt;ref name="toi1"/&gt;

===Fight with Balram Heeraman Singh Yadav===
After defeating Zbyszko, Gama beat Jesse Petersen in February 1929. The bout lasted only one and a half minutes. This was the last bout that Gama fought during his career.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In the 1940s he was invited by the Nizam of Hyderabad and defeated all his fighters. The Nizam then sent him to face the wrestler Balram Heeraman Singh Yadav, who was never defeated in his life. The fight was very long. Gama was unable to defeat Heeraman and eventually neither wrestler won. Heeraman was one of the toughest wrestlers for Gama to face.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

After the independence and [[Partition of India|partition of India]] in 1947, Gama moved to [[Pakistan]]. During the Hindu-Muslim riots that broke out at the time of partition, the [[Muslim]] Gama saved hundreds of [[Hindus]] from mobs in [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name="indiatimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pakistantoday"/&gt; Although Gama did not retire until 1952, he failed to find any other opponents. After his retirement, he trained his nephew Bholu Pahalwan, who held the Pakistani wrestling championship for almost 20 years.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}

==Death==
The Great Gama died in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] on 23 May 1960 after a period of illness. He was given land by the government but he still struggled to pay for treatment for his heart and [[asthma]]. Therefore, [[Ghanshyam Das Birla|G. D. Birla]], an Indian industrialist and wrestling fan, donated Rs. 2,000 and a monthly pension of Rs. 300, and the [[Government of Pakistan]] also increased the pension to Gama and supported his medical expenses until his death.

Today, a doughnut-shaped exercise disc called Hasli weighing 95&amp;nbsp;kg, used by him for squats, is housed at the [[National Institute of Sports]] (NIS) Museum at [[Patiala, India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20011124/windows/main5.htm A rare museum] ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'', Published 24 November 2001, Retrieved 2 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other==
[[Bruce Lee]] was an avid follower of Gama's training routine. Lee read articles about Gama and how he employed his exercises to build his legendary strength for wrestling, and Lee quickly incorporated them into his own routine. The training routines Lee used included "[[Push-up|the cat stretch]]", "the squat" (known as "baithak"), and also known as the "deep-knee bend."&lt;ref&gt;Little, John, ''Bruce Lee – The Art of Expressing The Human Body'' (Tuttle Publishing, 1998), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''Immaculate Infatuation'' was established in 2009 by Stang and Steinthal with the aim of providing honest restaurant reviews without accepting invitations from restaurants or announcing their presence to a wait staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They later shortened the company name to The Infatuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insights.newscred.com/infatuationcommunity-food-lovers/|title=How The Infatuation Built a Passionate Community of Millions of Food Lovers|date=2017-05-03|work=Insights|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zagat Acquisition ===
On March 5, 2018, ''The Infatuation'' acquired Zagat's brand and assets from Google. They did not disclose the amount.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They will reportedly operate as two distinct brands, with ''The Infatuation'' retaining its editorial-first focus and Zagat will expand user surveys and develop a new tech-driven platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-05/restaurant-review-platform-the-infatuation-buys-zagat|title=Restaurant Review Platform The Infatuation Buys Zagat|date=2018-03-05|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== #EEEEEATS ==
''In 2012, The Infatuation'' started to use #EEEEEATS as a way to tag their food photos on [[Instagram]]. The 5 E's are explained as a way to make "[what we do] feel fun" and "[to not] take things too seriously."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The hashtag was quickly adopted by the food community and now has grown to over 10 million tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/eeeeeats/?hl=en|title=#eeeeeats • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also operates 22 different Instagram handles including the main @infatuation account, one for each of their operating cities, and food-specific accounts like @pizza, @avocadotoast, and @burger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-food-blog-the-infatuation-uses-instagram-2017-5|title=How Instagram helped the founders of The Infatuation quit their jobs and work full-time on food reviews|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underfinger ==
In May 2014, ''The Infatuation'' published a satirical review of a faux restaurant by the name of ''Underfinger'', featuring "farm to finger" foods like seahorse sashimi and charcuterie gloves. The fictional restaurant was later brought to life in a pop-up event hosted by Brooklyn restaurant ''Do or Dine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2014/06/underfinger-the-real-fake-restaurant-thats-confusing-us-all/|title=Underfinger, the Real Fake Restaurant That’s Confusing Us All|date=2014-06-03|work=Observer|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short-form documentary was created from the pop-up and later earned the company a James Beard Foundation Journalism Award nomination in the Humor category.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== EEEEEATSCON ==
On May 20, 2017, ''The Infatuation'' organized and hosted their inaugural food and music festival EEEEEATSCON at the [[Santa Monica Airport|Barker Hangar]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica, CA]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The event was described as a "Music Festival Catered Towards Food" and included restaurant vendors with speaking engagements featuring talent manager [[Shep Gordon]] and baker [[Nancy Silverton]], and live music performances by rapper [[Lizzo]] and electronic music duo [[The Knocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/lifestyle/7809431/the-infatuation-food-fest-music-festival-santa-monica-eeeeeatscon|title=The Infatuation's Debut EEEEEATSCON Is a 'Music Festival Catered Towards Food'|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Top 10 of Everything''''' is an internationally distributed illustrated reference book of quantifiable Top 10 lists on a diverse variety of subjects, written by [[Russell Ash]] until his death in 2010, by [[Caroline Ash]] from 2010-present, and [[Paul Terry (author)|Paul Terry]] (2014 'Top 10 for Boys') and published annually since 1989. Facts and statistics about animals, geography, music, films, business, transport, sport and many other subjects are presented. The lists – totalling 700 or more in each volume – often also provide supplementary data about entries outside the Top 10 as well as additional information. ''Top 10 of Everything'' focuses on practical facts and occasional offbeat entries, from the most densely populated countries and the most expensive paintings to the tallest skyscrapers and the most common names around the world. The latest UK edition is the first to include a DVD featuring an interactive quiz based on the book.

Formerly published by [[Dorling Kindersley]], ''Top 10 of Everything'' has been published by [[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]] since 2006 and in other English-language editions. It also appears in a number of translations including, to date, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Gujarati, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Slovakian and Swedish.

''Top 10 of Everything'' was the basis of a children’s TV series broadcast on ITV in 1998–2001.
Related books including ''The Top 10 of Sport'', ''The Top 10 of Music'', ''The Top 10 of Film'', ''Top 10 for Men'', ''Top 10 of Britain'' and (forthcoming) ''Top 10 of Football'' and ''Top 10 of Ireland''. Quiz books, calendars, diaries and other products, have been also issued at intervals.

'''''The World Atlas of Wine''''' by [[Hugh Johnson (wine)|Hugh Johnson]] and (since 2003) [[Jancis Robinson]], [[Master of Wine|MW]], is an [[atlas]] and reference work on the world of [[wine]], published by [[Mitchell Beazley]]. It pioneered the use of  wine-specific [[cartography]] to give wine a sense of place, and has since the first edition published in 1971 sold 4 million copies in 14 languages.&lt;ref name=jrbooks&gt;{{Cite web |last= Robinson |first= Jancis, jancisrobinson.com |url= http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/books |title= Books |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080808143754/http://jancisrobinson.com/articles/books |archivedate= 2008-08-08 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered among the most significant wine publications to date,&lt;ref name=wbr/&gt; and it remains one of the most popular books on wine, with the most recent seventh edition published in October 2013.&lt;ref name=decawaw&gt;{{cite web| last = Rosen |first= Maggie, ''Decanter.com''| title = Hugh Johnson, Jancis Robinson release new 'World Atlas of Wine' | url = http://www.decanter.com/news/148005.html| date= October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Essay-like|date=July 2008}}
Prior to its publication in 1971, no work of wine literature contained high quality, wine-specific cartography. Some single-subject wine literature contained simple line-drawn maps, but not detailed, colour cartography with precise boundaries, and no book attempting to cover the world of wine had maps for every country. It was therefore not possible to open a bottle, open a book, and see precisely where the wine came from. This sense of place for wine is taken for granted today, but in 1971 it was revolutionary, and Johnson’s timing was impeccable.

Until the [[World War II]], wine was the preserve of the upper classes in western Europe, and virtually non-existent in the U.S. due to Prohibition, but servicemen returning home from the European theatre brought with them the newly acquired habit of wine drinking. With the emergence of mass tourism in the 1950s and the greater spending power of the 1960s, a whole new generation visited France, Italy and Spain, bringing back the continental culture of wine.

America's taste for wine also began to develop in the early 1960s. The majority of these new wine drinkers were young, well-traveled, and relatively affluent and, as the [[Baby boom|Baby Boom]] generation came of age, so the ranks of wine drinkers increased. Never before, and never since, have there been so many new wine consumers without any knowledge of the wines they were encountering, and in 1971 ''The World Atlas of Wine'' was uniquely placed to satisfy that demand. With mass tourism on the increase throughout the 1970s, the demand for ''The World Atlas of Wine'' continued to grow, as there was no real competition until 1988, when ''The Sotheby's World Wine Encyclopedia'' (now ''[[The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia]]'') was published.

The [[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine]], a French governmental organisation that avoids comment on commercial ventures, was moved to describe ''The World Atlas of Wine'' upon publication as "a major landmark in the literature of wine".&lt;ref name=wbr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winebookreview.com/wine-book-review-johnson-robinson-the-world-atlas-of-wine/ |title=Wine Book Review - The World Atlas of Wine - Hugh Johnson, Jancis Robinson |work=WineBookReview.com |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intowine.com/shop/0332-4.html IntoWine: The World Atlas of Wine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jrwho&gt;{{Cite web|last=Robinson |first=Jancis, jancisrobinson.com |url=http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20070106_1 |title=Who on earth are we? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214050732/http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20070106_1 |archivedate=February 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive maps for the First Edition of the Atlas were drawn by Fairey Surveys Ltd Cartographic office in Maidenhead, UK.  Although many maps have been added in later editions many of the original maps of the classic wine areas are still used in the current edition.

==iPad Edition==
The seventh edition was simultaneously released as hardcover print book and ebook for the iPad using Apple's [[iBooks Author]] format (referred to as 'Made for iBooks' in [[iBooks]]). In December 2013 it was announced that the ebook was a finalist for a Digital Book Award.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Book World website (Jan 2014) http://conference.digitalbookworld.com/ehome/70445/digital%20book%20awards/?&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; The ebook was also featured in the Best of 2013 promotion in iBooks.

==Background==
Born in [[San Bernardino, California]], West grew up in  a log cabin in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/1998/marapr/articles/west.html "A Warrior in Washington" ''Stanford Magazine''] (Retrieved 17 Jun 12)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the son of Maribelle McCrea West, a Baptist minister's daughter of Scottish-American background and the late [[Dick West|Walter Richard West Sr.]] (1912–1996).&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; His father, "Dick" West, was a well-respected Cheyenne painter, who chaired the art department at [[Bacone College]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ruthe Blalock.

He also represented clients before several executive departments of the [[U.S. Federal Government]] and the [[U.S. Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name=doi/&gt;

West was the subject of controversy after the ''[[Washington Post]]'' exposed lavish travel expenses and a gala farewell celebration during his tenure in the Smithsonian.&lt;ref&gt;Grimaldi, James V.

West has stated that the travel was for museum business and approved by supervisors.  After conducting an investigation at the request of the United States Congress,  the Smithsonian Institution's inspector general found that West "should have exercised better judgment."  West has agreed to reimburse the Smithsonian $9,700.&lt;ref&gt;Former Director to pay Smithsonian, New York Times, Oct. 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian Office of the Inspector General, A.

The '''Yugoslav Film Archive''' ({{lang-sr|Југословенска кинотека / Jugoslovenska kinoteka}}) is a [[Cinematheque|film archive]] located in [[Belgrade]], now in [[Serbia]]. It is a founding member of the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] and was the national film library of the [[former Yugoslavia]] and currently of the [[Republic of Serbia]].{{fact|date=August 2014}} It was founded in 1949.

The film collection contains over 95 thousand film prints of various national productions, of all genres, silent and sound, black &amp; white and color, both nitrate and acetate.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Around 85% of the entire film collection consists of foreign film material, including some previously considered lost, which makes the archive particularly interesting for film archivists and researchers from all over the world.

The Yugoslav Film Fund saved the most important archive material and documentaries related to the territory of former Yugoslavia, starting from the oldest extant film in the country ''Coronation of King Peter the First'' from 1904 until its restoration in 1992.{{fact|date=August 2014}} The collection of [[Yugoslav film]]s includes more than 90% of production since the [[Second World War]]. Most of the films have a copy protection (two copies per title). The film collection is constantly increasing deposit of films made and the placed in the country, sharing with other film archives, and through purchase and gifts from individuals and institutions.

The archival photographic collection contains approximately 250,000 identified (and as much unprocessed) images from local or foreign film productions, portraits of film workers and other participants in the film industry.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Collection of documents and written film material contains all types of documents, letters, contracts, original scripts and other material relevant to the history and study of national cinema.

The archival collection contains posters of films (domestic and foreign productions) and movie festivals. The Archive has processed about 15,000 posters and about 200,000 of unidentified and untreated material. Priority task is the protection of posters related to domestic films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinoteka.org.yu/eng1.htm|title=Yugoslav Film Archive|publisher=Yugoslav Film Archive|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
