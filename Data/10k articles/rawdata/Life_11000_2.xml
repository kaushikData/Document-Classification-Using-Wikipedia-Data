'''Alan Abel''' (born 1928) is an American [[percussionist]], music teacher and inventor of musical instruments. A graduate of the [[Eastman School of Music]], he performed with various orchestras, most notably for 38 years with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] from 1959 to 1997. 

In addition to his musical career, Abel is also since 1972 a teacher of music at [[Temple University]]. Abel is also credited with inventing the "Alan Abel [[triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]" and the "suspended" bass drum stand, a drum stand that allows the [[bass drum]] to be suspended and swiveled, both of which have since been in use by many professional classical musicians and most American [[orchestra|symphonic orchestras]].

==Career==
Abel was born in [[Hobart, Indiana]], in 1928.&lt;ref name="stowkowski"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stokowski.org/Philadelphia_Orchestra_Musicians_List.htm|title=Philadelphia Orchestra Musicians List|last=Huffman|first=Larry|date=|website=www.stokowski.org|publisher=The Stokowski Legacy|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; At the age of seven, he started percussion lessons. He studied with Clarence Carlson at the Roy Knapp School and then with Haskell Harr and William Street at the [[Eastman School of Music]] from 1947 to 1951, where he earned a performance degree and played part-time with the [[Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="barnhart"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=KyQKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Alan+Abel%22+percussion&amp;dq=%22Alan+Abel%22+percussion|title=Percussionists: A Biographical Dictionary|last=Barnhart|first=Stephen L.|date=|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|year=2000|isbn=9780313296277|location=|page=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After enlisting and playing in the [[United States Air Force Band]] from 1951 to 1953,&lt;ref name="stowkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barnhart" /&gt; he performed with the [[Oklahoma City Philharmonic]] from 1953 to 1959.&lt;ref name="stowkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; In 1959 he became a member of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] with which he performed until the end of his career in 1997.&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; He was named Associate Principal Percussionist of that orchestra in 1972.&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt;

In 1998 he was inducted into the [[Percussive Arts Society]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barnhart" /&gt; In 2012, he was awarded an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] by the [[New England Conservatory of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://necmusic.edu/honorary-doctor-music|title=Honorary Doctor of Music|last=|first=|date=|website=New England Conservatory of Music|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abel has also been a teacher at [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref name="Colaneri" /&gt; [[Rowan University]],&lt;ref name="Colaneri" /&gt; and [[Temple University]], at the latter since 1972.&lt;ref name="pas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Mahoney|first1=Terry|title=PAS Hall of Fame: Alan Abel|url=http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/AbelAlan.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329231739/http://www.pas.org/About/the-society/halloffame/AbelAlan.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 March 2015|publisher=Percussive Arts Society|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wrti.org/post/master-percussionist-nurturing-next-generation|title=A Master Percussionist Nurturing the Next Generation|last=Lewis|first=Susan|date=17 June 2014|work=[[WRTI]]|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical instruments==
Abel's predecessor at the Philadelphia Orchestra, Jim Valerio, had a custom-made [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] which was coveted by his peers.&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; After lending it to Abel for the first two years, Abel devised a way to recreate the sound and created the "Alan Abel [[triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]", which uses a piece of chromed brass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=DniXmlvb-6YC&amp;pg=PA133|title=Le percussioni|last=Facchin|first=Guido|date=|publisher=EDT srl|year=2000|isbn=9788870632514|location=|page=133|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used because of its [[overtone]]-rich sound,&lt;ref name="triblive"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triblive.com/aande/music/6196752-74/reamer-drum-pittsburgh|title=Percussion trifecta: PSO's Reamer plays, teaches, makes drums|last=Kanny|first=Mark|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Triangle has been manufactured since 1963.&lt;ref name="wrti"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wrti.org/post/where-music-lives-percussionist-alan-abels-house|title=Where Music Lives: At Percussionist Alan Abel's House|last=Lewis|first=Susan|date=4 February 2013|work=[[WRTI]]|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colaneri"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JPSACgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146|title=Modern Etudes and Studies for the Total Percussionist|last=Colaneri|first=Chris|date=|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780199389148|location=|page=126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abel also invented the "suspended" bass drum stand in the early 1960s, which he manufactured himself until 2013, when he handed manufacturing to Andy Reamer, who had previously supplied the drums.&lt;ref name="triblive" /&gt; The stand allows the [[bass drum]] to be suspended on a ring that swivels.&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt; The suspended bass drum stand is used by most American [[Symphonic orchestra|symphonic orchestras]] and the concept has been copied and imitated by multiple drum hardware manufacturers worldwide.&lt;ref name="pas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wrti" /&gt;

'''Alexander Slidell Mackenzie''' (April 6, 1803 – September 13, 1848), born '''Alexander Slidell''', was a US naval officer, most famous for his 1842 decision to execute three suspected mutineers aboard a ship under his command, the ''USS Somers''.  Mackenzie was also an accomplished man of letters, producing several volumes of travel writing and biographies of early important US naval figures, some of whom he knew personally.

Mackenzie was the brother of Senator [[John Slidell]] of [[Louisiana]], who was later involved in the [[American Civil War]]'s [[Trent Affair]].

Mackenzie was the captain of the [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']] when it became the only US Navy ship to undergo a mutiny, which led to executions, including [[Philip Spencer]], the 19-year-old son of the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John Canfield Spencer|John C. Spencer]].

Mackenzie's handling of the ''Somers'' Affair, including its lack of a lawful court martial, was controversial; the incident inspired the novella ''[[Billy Budd]]'' by American author [[Herman Melville]]. The ''Somers'' Affair also led to the founding of the [[United States Naval Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Review of William Leeman's Naval Academy history, ''The Long Road to Annapolis'' |first=John |last=Lehman |authorlink=John Lehman  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080602819.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=August 8, 2010 |page=B6 |accessdate=2010-08-08 |quote=In 1842, midshipman Philip Spencer, who happened to be the son of the secretary of war, was hanged aboard the training brig Somers by his captain on suspicion of conspiracy to mutiny. In 1845, [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[George Bancroft]] seized on the Somers affair as a reason finally to establish a naval academy at Annapolis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Mackenzie (then Slidell) was born April 6, 1803, in New York City, to Margery [also spelled Marjorie] (Mackenzie) and John Slidell.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie, Alexander Slidell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McFarland|first1=Philip S.|title=Mackenzie, Alexander Slidell|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/03/03-00298.html?a=1&amp;n=mackenzie&amp;d=10&amp;ss=1&amp;q=7|website=American National Biography Online|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander was one of a large family of children.  His older siblings included [[Thomas Slidell]] (later chief justice of Louisiana's state supreme court),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating 200 Years: The Louisiana Supreme Court, 1813-2013|url=http://www.lasc.org/Bicentennial/justices/Slidell_Thomas.aspx|website=The Louisiana Supreme Court|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Slidell]] (later US Senator from Louisiana), and Jane Slidell (later the wife of Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]).  Jane's marriage to M.C. Perry was to have a particularly profound influence on her younger brother's life, bringing him into close contact with one of the nation's leading naval families, which included Matthew's heroic older brother, Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]], and members of Commodore John Rodgers' family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Emery |first1=George W. |title=Vice Admiral, USN (retired) |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/special/rodgers_collection.htm |website=The Rodgers Family Collection at the Navy Department Library |accessdate=30 August 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212210604/http://www.history.navy.mil/library/special/rodgers_collection.htm|archivedate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom the Perrys intermarried.

In 1837–38, Alexander Slidell petitioned the New York State legislature and obtained the right to change his name to Mackenzie, reputedly as a condition of claiming the inheritance of a maternal uncle.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie, Alexander Slidell"/&gt;

Mackenzie was the father of General [[Ranald S. Mackenzie|Ranald Slidell Mackenzie]], who, after a successful Civil War career, commanded the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-4cav.htm&lt;/ref&gt; securing the line of settlement in Texas and throughout the West. Ranald Mackenzie was arguably the best Indian fighter of the American West. Another son was Lt. Commander [[Alexander Slidell MacKenzie (Civil War)|Alexander Slidell MacKenzie]].

==Naval service==
Mackenzie entered the U.S. Navy as a midshipman in 1815.  A contemporary of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and a personal friend of [[Washington Irving]], he published a number of books, including ''A Year in Spain'', ''Life of John Paul Jones'', ''Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur'', and ''Life of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'' (his late brother-in-law). He was promoted to Lieutenant on January 13, 1825 and to Commander on September 8, 1841.

[[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']] was launched by the New York Navy Yard on April 16, 1842, and was commissioned on 12 May 1842, with Mackenzie in command. After completing a shakedown cruise Puerto Rico and back, the new brig sailed out of New York harbor on September 13, 1842 with orders to head for the Atlantic coast of Africa with dispatches for the frigate ''Vandalia''. ''Somers'' was also acting as an experimental schoolship for naval apprentices on this voyage; the ''Somers'' crew was mostly inexperienced sailors and seamen.

After looking for ''Vandalia'' at Madeira, Tenerife, and Porto Praia, ''Somers'' arrived at Monrovia, Liberia, on November 10, only to discover that the frigate had already sailed for home. The next day, Mackenzie set sail for the Virgin Islands hoping to meet up with the ''Vandalia'' at St. Thomas before the return journey back to New York.

==''Somers'' mutiny==
On the passage to the West Indies, some of the ''Somers'' officers noticed a steady worsening of morale among the crew. On November 26, 1842, Mackenzie arrested Midshipman [[Philip Spencer]], the son of Secretary of War [[John Canfield Spencer]], for inciting mutiny.&lt;ref name="Somers, MacKenzie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s15/somers-ii.htm |title=Somers |publisher=Naval History &amp; Heritage Command, Department of the Navy |accessdate=3 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608085027/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s15/somers-ii.htm |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two young sailors arrested with Spencer were [[Elisha Small]] and [[Samuel Cromwell]].{{clear}}

A council of officers, not a court martial, concluded that the three sailors were guilty and recommended their immediate execution, which took place at sea on December 1, 1842. Only 13 days later, ''Somers'' arrived in New York, where a naval court of inquiry was immediately ordered to investigate the affair.

Although Mackenzie was completely exonerated at the court of inquiry and at a subsequent [[court martial]] by a split vote, the controversial incident colored the remainder of his life. It was customary then to commend officers cleared at a court/martial, but Mackenzie's court-martial made very clear that it was not commending him. The entire affair resulted in a great sensation, and Mackenzie's conduct was as severely criticized by his opponents as it was ardently defended by his supporters.

==Naval historian and author==
Mackenzie was also an accomplished author and naval historian.  While his tours of duty in the navy were broadening, he also used several extended leaves to travel in Europe, where he mingled with other literary Americans including [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and fellow New Yorker [[Washington Irving]], a lifelong friend.  Mackenzie's first work, ''A Year in Spain, by a Young American'' (1829), made him known in America as well as in England.  Other works followed: ''Popular Essays on Naval Subjects'' (1833), ''The American in England'' (1835), ''Spain Revisited'' (1836), ''Life of John Paul Jones'' (1841), ''Life of Commodore Oliver H. Perry'' (1841), and ''Life of Commodore Stephen Decatur'' (1846).  Mackenzie's interpretations of recent naval history and his role in the ''Somers'' affair made him the subject of spirited attacks from [[James Fenimore Cooper]].

Mackenzie also wrote a manuscript, ''A Journal of a Tour in Ireland, The Case of the 'Seiners'''; "Defence of A. S. Mackenzie", 1843.

==Death==
According to a letter written by Capt. D.W. Knox, U.S.N. (ret.) on July 1, 1938 in response to a query to the [[Department of the Navy]], "Commander MacKenzie died suddenly September 13, 1848, at his residence, near [[Tarrytown]], N.Y., of heart disease. The Department was notified of his death on September 14, by Captain Isaac McKeever, [[Commandant]] at New York, who stated that he had been informed of it by [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry]]." &lt;ref name="refname6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Commander Alexander Slidell MacKenzie |website=Naval History and Heritage Command |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/bios/mackenzie-alexander.html |access-date=2 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704201848/http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/bios/mackenzie-alexander.html |archivedate=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a resident of [[Scarborough, New York]].&lt;ref name="1952history"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[:File:1952history Briarcliff Manor.pdf|Our Village: Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. 1902 to 1952]]|publisher=Historical Committee of the Semi–Centennial|page=68|year=1952|lccn=83238400|oclc=24569093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infanta Beatrice of Portugal''' ({{IPA-pt|biɐˈtɾiʃ}}); {{Lang-pt|Beatriz}}) (31 December 1504 &amp;ndash; 8 January 1538) was Duchess of Savoy by marriage to [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy]]. She was the Sovereign Countess of Asti from 1531 to 1538.

==Life==
She was the second daughter of [[Manuel I of Portugal]] (1469–1521) and his second wife, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]] (1482–1517). Her siblings included King [[John III of Portugal]] and [[Isabella of Portugal|Holy Roman Empress Isabella]]. She was educated under the supervision of her governess [[Elvira de Mendoza]].

In [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] on 8 April 1521, Beatrice married [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy]]. He had succeeded as the Duke of Savoy since 1504, making Beatrice Duchess consort at the moment of her wedding.

Beatrice is described as beautiful,{{sfn|Cartwright Ady|1913|p=87}} brilliant and ambitious. In 1531, she received as a [[fiefdom]], from her cousin and brother-in-law, the emperor [[Charles I of Spain|Charles V]], the [[County of Asti]] which, on her death, was inherited by her son and permanently included on the [[House of Savoy|Savoy's]] heritage.

In 1534, she welcomed [[Christina of Denmark]], a ward of her brother-in-law the Emperor, on her way to her marriage with the [[Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Cartwright Ady|1913|p=87}} When Christina was widowed in 1535, the Milanese [[Count Stampa]] suggested a marriage between Christina and the eldest son of Beatrice, Louis, the heir of Savoy, in an attempt to protect Milan from Imperial sovereignty.{{sfn|Cartwright Ady|1913|p=}} Beatrice supported the plan, and when Louis died, she suggested that her next son could replace him.{{sfn|Cartwright Ady|1913|p=}} Nothing more was heard of this, however. In April 1536, Beatrice fled from the French conquest of Savoy to Christina in [[Milan]] in the company of two of her two eldest surviving children and the [[Holy Shroud of St. Joseph of Arimathea]] from [[Chambéry]].{{sfn|Cartwright Ady|1913|pp=117–118}} In May, she was able to visit the Emperor with Christina in [[Pavia]], but without any political result.{{sfn|Cartwright Ady|1913|pp=116–117}} She then lived as a guest with Christina in Milan, with whom she was good friends. In November 1537, Beatrice was escorted by the Imperial viceroy of Milan to the Emperor in [[Genova]], but again, the meeting was without any result. She continued to [[Nice]], where she reunited with her spouse. She died in Nice in January 1538.{{sfn|Cartwright Ady|1913|p=119}}
===Marriage and children===

In [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] on 8 April 1521, Beatrice married [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy]]. He had succeeded as the Duke of Savoy since 1504, making Beatrice Duchess consort at the moment of her wedding. They had nine children:

*Adrian John Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont (19 November 1522 – 10 January 1523).
*Louis, Prince of Piedmont (4 December 1523 – Madrid, 25 November 1536).
*[[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emmanuel Philibert]] (Chambéry, 8 July 1528 – Turin, 30 August 1580); only surviving child and later Duke of Savoy.
*Catherine (25 November 1529 – May 1536).
*Marie (12 January 1530 – 1531).
*Isabella (May 1532 – 24 September 1533).
*Emmanuel (born and died May 1533).
*Emmanuel (born and died May 1534).
*John (3 December 1537 – 8 January 1538).

After the death of the childless [[Sebastian of Portugal]] (her grand-nephew), her son fought for his rights to become [[King of Portugal]], however he failed and the throne was given to Isabella's son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]].

'''Beta Ray Bill''' is a [[fictional]] superhero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Thor WHO? It's Beta Ray Bill!|first=J.C.|last=Maçek III is|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/176291-thor-who-its-beta-ray-bill/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], the character was initially intended to be a surprise as an apparent monster who unexpectedly proves to be a great hero. As such, Bill becomes the first being outside the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Norse pantheon]] to be deemed worthy to wield Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. After an initial rivalry for possession of the weapon, the alien warrior was granted a [[war hammer]] of his own, called Stormbreaker, and the two reconciled as staunch allies.

Beta Ray Bill has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products, such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and merchandise.

==Publication history==
Beta Ray Bill debuted in ''[[The Mighty Thor]]'' #337 (November 1983), being established as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Korbinite]] race. Bill was created by [[Walt Simonson]] as a new concept for the title ''Thor''. Simonson said,

{{blockquote|I wanted to start fresh, and I thought a new character would be the way to go on that. My thinking was that comics are a short form, and one of the things that's mostly true about comics characters are what they look like ... I designed Bill deliberately as a monster, because I knew that people would look at it and go, "Oh my God, it's this evil guy." I deliberately wrote them so you weren't sure in the beginning if he was a good guy or a bad guy ... I chose the name for its alliterative qualities. Originally I was going to call him 'Beta Ray Jones' because I really wanted a common name. My feeling was Bill was [[Everyman]] for this alien race ... I deleted 'Jones' because ... there were too many Joneses floating around the Marvel Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, John B. (June 2004) "Walt Simonson Interviewed", ''Jack Kirby Collector'' #14, collected in ''Collected Jack Kirby Collector Volume 3'', {{ISBN|1-893905-02-0}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During a "Thor Spotlight" panel at the Baltimore Comic Con, August 28, 2010, Simonson further stated:

{{blockquote|One of the cool things about Thor was the enchantment around Mjolnir and the original inscription on it. So I thought, well that means someone else can pick up this hammer and get this power, if they're worthy! So since then, some other big characters, people's favorites, have picked up the hammer, Captain America, Superman, whoever. But at this point, no one had ever picked up the hammer. I liked the idea of Cap walking to the bathroom and seeing it, and grabbing and just tugging, not being able to. So this had to be someone new. This is the most powerful weapon of the Norse gods. This hammer is a killing weapon. It's used to kill Frost Giants and others. So, Superman couldn't pick it up, cause he's never going to kill anyone, and the hammer knows that. Captain America, he's too patriotic. He's too much a symbol of America to be chosen by this Norse artifact. So he couldn't get it. So I created Bill because he's noble, and he's designed to kill. He's got a great purpose as a warrior, and also the noble ability. That makes him "worthy" whatever that may be.

As far as appearance, back then, comics were these self-contained stories. So for Bill, I had to do this in short form. This was a four-issue story, and that was my longest on my entire run on Thor. We had to take him, make him into a character that the Hammer would recognize. So I wanted for Bill, I wanted him to have a "monstrous" look as a visual, so that everyone would think he's a bad guy, and I got letters after the first issue that said "What on earth? Why is this monster picking up the hammer, what's wrong with you?" and I said "I got it!" So I basically started with a skull, and then I made him a bit like a horse, with the gap behind the teeth. But horses are beautiful creatures. So what I was aiming for is a sense of death, a sense of monster, underlined by beauty. His costume was the same so that the minute you see that image, when he strikes the stick and becomes "Beta Ray Thor" or whatever, you know: OK, that guy has the powers of Thor. So that's why Bill had the monstrous face, that's why that stuff was done the way it was done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/news/wsimonson_brbill "Thor Spotlight" panel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903191120/http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/news/wsimonson_brbill |date=September 3, 2010 }}; Baltimore Comic Con; August 28, 2010. As related by "Cosmic Book News".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The character's introduction continued in ''Thor'' vol 1 #338–340. He continued to make appearances in ''Thor'' sporadically. He appeared in the "[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]" crossover in January 2001 and the ''Secret Invasion'' crossover in 2008.  He starred in the 6-issue miniseries ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' and its two follow-ups, the one-shot ''Beta Ray Bill: The Green of Eden'' and 3-issue ''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter''.

==Fictional character biography==

===1980s===
Spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] detected an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] fleet passing through Earth's solar system, with Director [[Nick Fury]] asking Thor to investigate. When Thor finds the advance ship, it scans Thor and perceives him to be a threat.  Unable to stop Thor, the sentient ship—called ''Skuttlebutt''—revives Beta Ray Bill, who is in [[suspended animation]]. Bill battles Thor to a standstill, until the ship reaches Earth's orbit, where one of the mystical enchantments of Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] comes into effect, which means that Thor will revert to his mortal persona of Donald Blake if separated from the hammer for more than 60 seconds. When that happens, Blake is knocked unconscious by Bill, who examines Blake's cane (Mjolnir's "shell" when Thor is in Blake's form) and on striking the cane receives Thor's power and costume.

Once ''Skuttlebutt'' arrives on Earth, Bill easily defeats an approaching S.H.I.E.L.D. team and is then transported to Asgard by the King of the Norse gods, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], who mistakes Bill for Thor. After some initial confusion, Odin returns Thor to Asgard, and Bill's origin is revealed. Bill's race, the Korbinites, were almost rendered [[extinct]] when their galaxy exploded. The remnants of the Korbinite race fled in a fleet of warships, guarded by a [[sentient]] ship called ''Skuttlebutt'' and a dedicated champion, Beta Ray Bill. Via Korbinite science, Bill was physically augmented and given the attributes of an [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] wild beast (a process that killed all of Bill's predecessors). ''Skuttlebutt'' attacked Thor because the ship recognized the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] magic as similar to that of the previous global threat, and assumed the Korbinites were being threatened once again.

On discovering that Bill was worthy enough to lift Mjolnir, Odin proposes a battle to the death in the fiery Asgardian realm of Skartheim to decide who will wield the hammer. Bill and Thor render each other [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Bill's resistance to heat allows him to recover first, however, and he is deemed the winner—but he also saves Thor from falling into lava, believing he is too worthy an opponent to die, but he feels he needs the hammer to protect his people. After Bill reconsiders his claim to the hammer, Odin orders the making of a new hammer for Bill: Stormbreaker, equal in power to Mjolnir and created from the same dwarf star. Odin also transfers an enchantment from Mjolnir to Stormbreaker, so that Bill can return to his original Korbinite form by striking Stormbreaker upon the ground—and Thor can no longer become Donald Blake. After learning that the mishap that killed most of Bill's people was caused by the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], one of Asgard's most powerful enemies, Bill agrees to join the Asgardians in a war to stop Surtur and his armies.&lt;ref name="Thor337"&gt;''Thor'' #337–340 (November 1983 – February 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/21/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-202/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 202 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill leads many of Earth's heroes against Surtur's forces on Earth while Thor, Odin, and Thor's adopted brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] confront Surtur in Asgard. Surtur is eventually defeated, but apparently kills Odin when they both fall through a mystic portal.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' #341-353 (December 1983 – December 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Bill remains on Earth, aiding the [[Spaceknights|spaceknight]] [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] against the threat of the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s &lt;ref&gt;''Rom'' #65 (April 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and foes such as [[Iron Man]] opponent [[Titanium Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' #354 (April 1985); #357–358 (July – August 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Forming an attachment with the Asgardian goddess [[Sif (comics)|Sif]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' #359 (Sep. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Bill aids Thor against the Dark Elf [[Kurse]] in a two-part storyline&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' #363 (Jan. 1986);''[[Power Pack]]'' #19 (Feb. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; before returning to his people.

===1990s===
Bill remains a staunch ally of Thor and Asgard&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' Annual #16 (January 1991); ''Thor'' #439 (November 1991); #442 (January 1992); #454 (November 1992); ''Thor'' Annual #18 (January 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; before featuring in a storyline involving a creation of Galactus, [[Tyrant (Marvel Comics)|Tyrant]].&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #79 (April 1993); #81–82 (June–July 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Bill also features in the storyline "Blood and Thunder", attempting alongside [[Adam Warlock]], [[Thanos]] and others to deal with the "warrior madness" of Thor in which he is trying to destroy the universe, although at one point he is struck with enough force to destroy a planet.&lt;ref&gt;''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #86–87 (November – December 1993); ''Warlock Chronicles'' #7-8 (Jan.-Feb. 1994); ''Warlock and the Infinity Watch #25 (Feb. 1994); ''Thor'' #461 (April 1993); #468 (November 1983); #470–471 (January – February 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Thor, Bill joins with other versions of the Thunder God in the ''Thor Corps'' against the entity Demonstaff.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor Corps'' #1–4 (September – December 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and has several cosmic adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmic Powers Unlimited'' #1–5 (May 1995 – May 1996); ''Star Masters'' #1–3 (December 1995 – February 1996); ''Thor'' #492–493 (November – December 1995); ''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #111 (December 1995); #122 (November 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Bill also participates in a battle between the heroes of Earth and several alien races such as the [[Kree]], [[Shi'ar]], and [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Z|Z'Nox]].&lt;ref&gt;''Maximum Security'' #1–2 (December 2000); #3 (January 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and after several adventures with Thor &lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' #30–33 (December 2000 – March 2001); #39–41 (September – November 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; guest starring in the final storyline, when Thor—determined to end the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth the Asgardians are trapped in—brings about [[Ragnarök]] (in [[Norse mythology]] this event means the end of Asgard and its gods, as they die in battle against the armies of evil). Although Bill attempts to aid the Asgardians, Thor [[Teleportation|teleport]]s Bill away as it is not his destiny to die in Ragnarök.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' vol. 2, #83 - 85 (Oct. - Dec. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill visits his people's new homeworld, where he is attacked by his insane predecessor, ''Alpha Ray'', defeating him just as the [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] and his herald [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]] arrive. Despite Bill's efforts, Galactus consumes the world and almost kills him, with Bill drifting in space until recovered by ''Skuttlebutt''. After finding an orb containing the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of many of the Korbinites, Bill revisits a desolate Asgard, and joins forces with Stardust to battle a new demonic menace named ''Asteroth''.

Although victorious, Bill is mortally wounded, and while near death is healed by an unknown entity that also claims the remaining souls in the orb. Placed in the recently deceased body of a [[war veteran]] named ''Simon Walters'' (a reference to his creator, Walt Simonson) on Earth, Bill has a brief encounter with the villain ''Boar'' and the hero [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Berman (w), [[Michael Oeming]] (w), [[Andrea Di Vito]] (p), ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Bill eventually finds and joins [[Canadians|Canadian]] superhero team ''[[Omega Flight]]'' against the supervillain team the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], who release the [[supernatural]] [[Great Beasts]]. The battle ends with Bill and the Beasts trapped in an alternate dimension.&lt;ref&gt;''Omega Flight'' #1-5 (April-Aug. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/29/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-210/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 210 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline,&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #1-8 (June 2008 - Jan. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Bill is wounded and captured by the alien [[Skrull]]s, who bestow his hammer Stormbreaker on a warrior [[Super-Skrull]] called the ''Godkiller''. Thor rescues Bill, although Loki starts a rumor that Bill may be a Skrull, causing some Asgardians to go against him despite Balder telling them to stop. Thor throws Mjolnir at Bill, who catches it, proving he really is Bill. After being nursed back to health, the character retrieves his hammer. Although the Godkiller defeats him, with Thor's help, he tricks the Godkiller, causing Asgard to fall onto it, killing the Skrull. Thor and Bill then raise the city again.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #1–3 (October – December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill decides to hunt the cosmic entity [[Galactus]], to avenge the destruction of the Korbinites' second homeworld, and the seeming eradication of his species. After a brief confrontation with the herald, Stardust, Bill is intercepted by the [[Silver Surfer]], who is puzzled by the Korbinite's apparently futile quest to destroy Galactus. During a brief battle, Bill explains that while he understands he cannot hope to destroy Galactus with his power alone, he intends to destroy Galactus by annihilating any and all worlds Galactus seeks to feed from, thus starving him to death. The character's obsession with stopping Galactus eventually results in him being unable to lift his own enchanted weapon, an object that can only be wielded by the worthy. Equipped with alien weapons, Bill finds Galactus  but discovers the entity already under attack by another race. In a moment of conscience, Bill saves Galactus. The grateful entity rewards Bill by creating a Korbinite mate for him, with Bill also regaining the ability to wield Stormbreaker.&lt;ref&gt;''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1–3 (August – October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
When the universe is invaded during ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' storyline, Beta Ray Bill joins Nova's select group to travel across the Fault and into the Cancerverse.&lt;ref&gt;''The Thanos Imperative'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Bill is recruited by [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Cosmo]] to join the [[Annihilators (Marvel Comics)|Annihilators]], a new super-group intended to replace the fallen [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Thanos Imperative: Devastation'' #1, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Annihilators defend [[Spaceknights|Galador]] from the [[Dire Wraith]]s, resulting in a peace between the two groups who have been at war for generations. Later, when trying to end a conflict between warring factions of the [[Universal Church of Truth]], the Annihilators are transported to a Church base on Earth and come into conflict with the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Annihilators: Earthfall'' #1 (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Death of the Inhumans]]" miniseries, Medusa and the surviving Inhuman Royal Family members ask for Beta Ray Bill to help to confront the Kree and their Super-Inhuman Vox as well as rescuing Black Bolt from them.&lt;ref&gt;''Death of the Inhumans'' #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Beta Ray Bill agreed to help them. When they reach the location where Black Bolt is being attacked by Vox, Beta Ray Bill helps Black Bolt, and takes down Vox, who is revealed to be a brainwashed Maximus. He and the Inhuman Royal Family witness something on the Vox costume teleport Crystal away while also killing Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;''Death of the Inhumans'' #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Beta Ray Bill's life force and consciousness were transferred by scientists of his race into the body of an alien carnivorous equine-like beast that had been bionically restructured into a cyborg. Courtesy of highly advanced genetic engineering, the character possesses vast superhuman strength, speed, stamina and durability, and a highly extended lifespan. Beta Ray Bill is also a superior hand-to-hand combatant. His combat prowess is such that he was able to fight [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], noted as one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the Marvel Universe, to a standstill.&lt;ref name="Thor337"/&gt;

Beta Ray Bill's weapon, Stormbreaker, also has the same properties as Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], and includes the ability to transform into a cane when struck upon the ground and return Bill to his unaltered Korbinite form. Bill also possesses the advanced and sentient warship ''Skuttlebutt''.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Beta Ray Bill debuts in the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' episode "Innervisions", voiced by [[Karl Pruner]]. This version of the character along with the rest of his species shared a group dream using a special "dream weaver" from Zenn-La. When the Surfer came to alert them that [[Thanos]] was approaching, he convinced Beta Ray Bill to end the group dream and save the planet using all of the dream weaver's power to trick Thanos into believing he had succeeded in destroying the planet.

After proving heroism in saving Thor from the villain and an expert usage of Mjolnir, the hammer then forged Bill's own hammer out of a toilet brush, after which Bill chooses from names such as "Windbreaker" before finally settling on "Stormbreaker." It is then that Bill's friends are freed from the Stranger's mind control, and an alliance between the two hammer wielders is forged, with Bill promising to use his friends' technology to get Thor back to his own universe.

When Surtur's Fire Demons attack the Skuttlebutt, Beta Ray Bill has the Skuttlebutt take refuge in an asteroid field. His presence was detected by Heimdall  as Thor sets out to investigate. When Thor makes his way into the Skuttlebutt, he is ambushed by Beta Ray Bill (who mistakens Thor for a Fire Demon) and manages to pin him down. Beta Ray Bill successfully lifts Mjolnir and attacks Thor with it. Beta Ray Bill is then teleported to Asgard by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] (who was trying to teleport Thor back) where Beta Ray Bill mistakens the Asgardians as Fire Demons and attacks [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], [[Sif (comics)|Sif]], and the [[Warriors Three]] before being subdued by Odin and finally realizes his error due to Odin's genuine concern and love for his son. Thor is teleported back to Asgard by Odin. When Beta Ray Bill reveals his people's plight and demands to wield Mjolnir to fight the Fire Demons, Sif offers to assist him in the battle and Thor offers Mjolnir. Odin denies the offer made by Thor and says he has an idea. After Thor convinces Eitri to help, Beta Ray Bill receives Stormbreaker (which was made from the remaining Uru following Surtur's raid) and uses it to help Thor and Sif fight the Fire Demons in order to keep them from harming the Korbinites. While Sif and the Skuttlebutt's defenses fight the Fire Demons, Thor and Beta Ray Bill fight [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] who has been converted into Surtur's mind-controlled pawn. After Thor and Beta Ray Bill defeat Enchantress which causes the Fire Demons to disappear, Surtur speaks through her telling Thor and Beta Ray Bill that Enchantress is now under his control. Beta Ray Bill then leaves with Skuttlebutt in order to find a safe place for the Korbinites to settle down and repopulate, but he promises to aid Thor in his battle with Surtur, the Fire Demon Lord of Muspelheim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11155">The '''Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica''' was the library of the [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish community]] of [[Rome]], Italy. Established in the early 20th century, it housed approximately 7,000 rare or unique books and manuscripts dating back to at least the 16th century. According to the [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe|Central Registry of Looted Art]], it was the most important Jewish library in Italy and one of the most important in the world. The contents of the library were looted by Nazi Germany shortly after the [[Raid of the Ghetto of Rome]] in October 1943, and have never been recovered. Two months later, the contents of the ''Collegio Rabbinico Italiano'', the Italian Rabbinical College's library located in the same building, were also looted; only part of the contents of the latter library have been recovered.

==Contents==
The Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica was set up in the early 20th century in rooms above the [[Great Synagogue of Rome]] at [[Lungotevere De' Cenci]]. Its contents consisted of publications that had previously been held at one of the five synagogues of the Roman Ghetto or other locations in the Jewish community of Rome.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; The library of the Italian Rabbinical College, housed in the same building, had been transferred from [[Florence]] to Rome in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The latter was a teaching library of almost 10,000 volumes.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica contained many rare or unique books and manuscripts, dating back to at least the 16th century. No complete catalogue exists, but visiting scholars compiled some specific lists during visits before the war.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; It is estimated that the library contained a quarter of all the work of the [[Soncino family (printers)|Sconcinos]], Jewish Italian printers from the 16th century who later worked in [[Salonica]] and [[Constantinople]], as well as 16th-century works by [[Daniel Bomberg]], [[Alvise Bragadin]], and Nicollet. The library contained approximately 7,000 volumes in all.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; A partial catalogue was compiled by Jewish Italian historian [[Isaiah Sonne]] in 1935, who classified the contents into texts printed by the Sconcinos, manuscripts, incunabula, 16th-century oriental copies printed in Constantinople, and special specimens.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; Sonne, however, complained that he was allowed to see only the second-best items in the library.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; The lack of a proper catalogue may have been inspired in part by a desire to protect the contents from destruction by the Catholic church which, historically, had done so before to Jewish publications.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe|Central Registry of Looted Art]] quoted an expert, Attilio Milano, who stated in a letter that "no other Italian Jewish library had so many priceless books and very few outside Italy exceeded it".&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

==Looting==
With the [[Armistice of Cassibile|surrender of Italy]] on 8 September 1943, Germany occupied northern and central Italy, including the Italian capital, [[Rome]]. The libraries of the Jewish community in Rome soon attracted German attention. According to an eyewitness, two uniformed men visited the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica and the Italian Rabbinical College library, located in the same building, on 30 September and 1 October 1943. One of the two introduced himself as a teacher of Hebrew at an institute in [[Berlin]], most likely Johannes Pohl from the [[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question]], who had fulfilled a similar role at the Jewish libraries in [[Amsterdam]].{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=168}}

Attempts were made to receive support from the Fascist Italian government to retain the contents of the libraries in Italy, but these received no sympathy there.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=168}}

On 14 October 1943, two days before the raid on the Roman Ghetto, the contents of the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica and parts of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken away. The remainder of the contents of the Rabbinical College library were taken on 23 and 24 December 1943.&lt;ref name="Report" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lootedart.com/MJ1UB9290391 |title=Activity Report of the Commission for the Recovery of the Bibliographic Heritage of the Jewish Community in Rome, looted in 1943 |date= |website= |publisher=The Central Register of Information on Looted Cultural Property|access-date=30 September 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few isolated books and prints survived the looting either by being hidden by members of the community or overlooked by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

Under the control of the German military administration, the contents of the library were loaded onto two railway cars by an Italian company and sent to Germany via Switzerland. A letter by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] (ERR) from 21 January 1944, most likely referring to the second load of loot, stated that it had been delivered to an institute in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; The priceless contents of the community library were of special interest to the Rosenberg organisation,&lt;ref name="Ghettorom" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gedenkorte-europa.eu/de_de/ghetto-rom.html |title=Ghetto Rom |publisher=Gedenkorte Europa 1939–1945 |date= |website= |access-date=30 September 2018 |language=German |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it had set up a special organisation, the ''Sonderkommando Italien'', for their activities in the country.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=167}}

The records of the correspondence of the ERR were destroyed by a bombing raid on Berlin in November 1943. The Italian commission trying to locate the library contents came to the conclusion that the first train in October did not go to Frankfurt but to Berlin, which would explain why some of the contents of the second train were found after the war.  None of the contents of the first train were ever recovered.{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=171}}

==Fate of the contents==
Only part of the contents of the Rabbinical College library was recovered in 1947, consisting of 20 [[Incunable|incunabula]]. None of the material taken from the Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica was ever recovered.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

The most likely theory as to the fate of the library contents is that they were stored during the war in an area that became part of the postwar Occupation Zone of the Soviet Union. From there the contents were taken to the Soviet Union and could now possibly be located within the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; Theories that the contents of the library were either destroyed during a bombing raid on the train transporting it to Germany, or in Germany itself, have been considered but discounted as less likely.&lt;ref name="Mystery" &gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Frank|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/194543/missing-jewish-books-of-rome |title=The Mystery of the Missing Jewish Books of Rome |date= |publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|website= |access-date=3 October 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Italian government established a special commission to pursue the recovery of the contents of the library, carrying out research in a number of European countries. The commission looked into the possibility that the missing contents either went to Frankfurt, Berlin, or Frankfurt via Berlin. The Frankfurt option was seen as the less likely one as much of the looted books that had been stored there or at another deposit, at [[Hungen]], also in [[Hesse]], had fallen into the hands of American forces after the war and been returned, including prints from the Rabbinical College.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt; It is estimated that that Nazi Germany looted up to 3 million books during World War II, of which 1.2 million were found at the end of the war at Hungen alone.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;

The more likely option was that the contents went to Berlin and either remained there or were evacuated to Ratibor, [[Silesia]] (now [[Racibórz]], Poland), where, at either place, they would eventually have come under control of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" &gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date= |title=Activity Report on the activities of the commission for the recovery of the bibliographic patrimony of the Jewish community in Rome stolen in 1943 |url=http://presidenza.governo.it/USRI/confessioni/doc/rapporto_finale_eng.pdf |publisher=[[Government of Italy]] – [[Presidency of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|Presidency of the Council of Ministers]]|page= |docket= |access-date=3 October 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission's research was complicated by the fact that two competing organisations existed in Nazi Germany which acquired looted Jewish publications with the aim of creating a library, the ''Amt Rosenberg'' (the ERR) and the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (the SS), the latter with the aim of using it as a source of information on their perceived enemy. As no records for the first transport of the loot are known to have survived, there is no certainty which of the two organisations received the two rail cars from October 1943. The commission's research in Russia was also hampered by the fact that certain archives were closed to it, such as the archive of the Russian [[Federal Security Service]].&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;

The lack of a proper catalogue has greatly hampered the recovery of the contents, as it is almost impossible to know what the library actually contained.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; In 1965, two Hebrew manuscripts with the stamp of the library were acquired by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary Library]] in New York, both of which were listed in the catalogue Sonne compiled in the 1930s. It is unclear how the manuscripts reached the United States and at what point after their cataloguing by Sonne in 1935 they were removed from the library.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; No details on the history of the two manuscripts between 1935 and 1965 could be established.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;

The ultimate fate of the library's contents remain a mystery, however, as all investigations, including that of the Italian government commission, have been inconclusive.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" /&gt;{{sfn|Rydell|2017|p=172}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13248">'''Loss of biodiversity''' or '''biodiversity loss''' is the [[extinction]] of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain [[habitat]].

The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the [[environmental degradation]] that leads to the loss is reversible through [[ecological restoration]] / [[ecological resilience]] or effectively permanent (e.g. through [[land loss]]). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.

Even though permanent [[global biodiversity|global]] [[species loss]] is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in [[species composition]], even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the [[food web]] and the [[food chain]] insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain ([[coextinction]]), leading to an overall reduction in [[biodiversity]], possible [[alternative stable states]] of an ecosystem notwithstanding. [[Ecological effects of biodiversity]] are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced [[ecosystem services]] and eventually poses an immediate danger for [[food security]], also for humankind.&lt;ref name=cardinale2012/&gt;

{{See also|Diversity–function debate}}
[[File:Extinction Rebellion-2.jpg|thumb|Demonstrator against biodiversity loss, at [[:en:Extinction Rebellion|Extinction Rebellion]] (2018).]]

The current [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of ''global'' diversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 times higher than the (naturally occurring) [[background extinction rate]] and expected to still grow in the upcoming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/sciadv.1400253 | title=Accelerated modern human–induced species losses: Entering the sixth mass extinction | year=2015 | last1=Ceballos | first1=Gerardo | journal=Science Advances | volume=1 | issue=5| display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/cobi.12380 | title=Estimating the normal background rate of species extinction | year=2015 | last1=De Vos | first1= Jurriaan | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=29 | pages=452–462|issue=2| display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally bounded loss rates can be [[measurement|measured]] using [[species richness]] and its variation [[time series|over time]]. Raw [[Count data|count]]s may not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute [[Abundance (ecology)|abundances]]. Taking into account the [[relative frequencies]], a considerable number of [[biodiversity index]]es has been developed. Besides richness, evenness and heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.&lt;ref name=cardinale2012&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature11148 | title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity | year=2012 | last1=Cardinale | first1=Bradley | journal=Nature | volume=486 | pages=59–67|bibcode = 2012Natur.486...59C | pmid=22678280 | issue=7401|display-authors=etal|quote=...at the first [[Earth Summit]], the vast majority of the world’s nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth’s ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity
of the subject increases and the associated spatial and temporal scales widen.&lt;ref name=tagliapietra&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological diversity and habitat diversity: a matter of Science and perception|url=http://www.unige.ch/sciences/near/pdf/Tagliapietra%20and%20Sigovini%202010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split up into various scales (e.g. [[ecosystem diversity]] vs. [[habitat]] diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat diversity&lt;ref name=tagliapietra/&gt;) or different subcategories (e.g. [[phylogenetic diversity]], [[species diversity]], [[genetic diversity]], [[nucleotide diversity]]). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ecology|year=2016 |volume=97|issue=8|pages=1949–1960|doi=10.1890/15-1759.1|title=Estimating local biodiversity change: a critique of papers claiming no net loss of local diversity.|quote=two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Overlooked local biodiversity loss (letter and response)|author=Bradley Cardinale|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6188/1098.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To compare rates between different geographic regions [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]] should also be considered.

[[Capital punishment]] in the Republic of Ireland was abolished in [[statute law]] in 1990, having been abolished in 1964 for most offences including ordinary [[murder]]. The last to be executed was [[Michael Manning (murderer)|Michael Manning]], hanged for murder in 1954. All subsequent death sentences, the last handed down in 1985, were commuted by the [[President of Ireland|President]], on the advice of the [[Government of Ireland|Government]], to terms of imprisonment of up to 40 years. The [[Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Twenty-first Amendment]] of the constitution, passed by referendum in 2001, prohibits the reintroduction of the death penalty, even during a [[state of emergency]] or war.  Capital punishment is also forbidden by several human rights treaties to which the state is a party.

==Early history==
[[Early Irish law]] discouraged capital punishment. Murder was usually punished with two types of fine: a fixed ''[[éraic]]'' and a variable ''Log nEnech''; a murderer was only killed if he and his relatives could not pay the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Fergus |title=A Guide to Early Irish Law|series=Early Irish Law |year=1988 |publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|isbn=978-1-85500-214-2|pages=125–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Senchas Már]]'''s description of the execution of the murderer of [[Saint Patrick]]'s charioteer [[Odran (disciple of Saint Patrick)|Odran]] has been interpreted as a failed attempt to replace pagan [[restorative justice]] with Christian [[retributive justice]].&lt;ref name="Bury2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bury|first=J. B.|title=Life of St. Patrick and His Place in History|url=https://archive.org/stream/lifeofstpatrickh00buryuoft#page/357/mode/1up |year=1905 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |accessdate=6 November 2010|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bracken|first=Damian|title=Immortality and capital punishment: patristic concepts in Irish law|journal=Peritia|volume=1995|issue=9|pages=167–186|issn=0332-1592|doi=10.1484/J.Peri.3.247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Capital punishment in the United Kingdom}}
After the [[Norman conquest of Ireland]], [[English law]] provided the model for Irish law. This originally mandated a death sentence for any [[felony]], a class of crimes established by [[common law]] but extended by various [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]];&lt;ref name="lrcsentencing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/cpSentencing.htm|title=The Evolution of Judicial Sentencing Discretion|date=March 1993|work=Consultation paper on sentencing|publisher=[[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission]]|pages=72–3|accessdate=22 August 2011|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a situation later dubbed the "[[Bloody Code]]". The [[gallows speech]] was a popular genre of [[Street literature|broadside]] from the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite revolution]] through the eighteenth century, feeding into popular ballads of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ó Ciardha|first=Éamonn|date=Winter 2001|title=Review: ''Gallows Speeches from Eighteenth-Century Ireland'' by James Kelly|journal=History Ireland|volume=9|issue=4|url=http://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/gallows-speeches-from-eighteenth-century-ireland/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Criminal Law Act 1827]] allowed judges to sentence to [[penal transportation|transportation]] for many hitherto capital crimes.&lt;ref name="lrcsentencing"/&gt; For more, [[Peel's Acts]] in 1828 replaced the death penalty with [[penal servitude]]. The Capital Punishment (Ireland) Act 1842&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V6hKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 5 &amp; 6 Vict c.28]&lt;/ref&gt; brought the law in Ireland closer to that of England by reducing the penalties for numerous offences, and abolishing the capital crime of serving in the [[French Armed Forces|army or navy of France]]. The [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]] reduced the number of capital crimes from over two hundred to just three: murder, treason and [[piracy]] with violence.&lt;ref name="haughey1963"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1963110600038?opendocument|title=Criminal Justice Bill, 1963— Second Stage.|last=Haughey|first=Charles|date=6 November 1963|work=Dáil Éireann debates|pages=Vol. 205 No. 7 p.38 c.999|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death was a [[mandatory sentence]] for murder, though it was often commuted.&lt;ref&gt;LRC Report 108 §2.59&lt;/ref&gt; The last public hanging in Ireland was in 1868; after the [[Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868]] executions were carried out behind prison walls. Irish doctor [[Samuel Haughton]] developed the humane [[Hanging#Standard drop|"Standard Drop"]] method of hanging that came into use in 1866. The last peacetime execution while Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was of William Scanlan in 1911 for murdering his sister-in-law.&lt;ref name="cpuk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/ireland.html |title=20th century executions in the Irish Republic (Eire) |work=capitalpunishmentuk |first=Richard |last=Clark |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Execution of [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] created political [[martyr]]s, such as the "[[Manchester Martyrs]]" of 1867. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act, 1882, was enacted during the [[Land War]] and introduced on the day of the funeral of [[Lord Frederick Cavendish]], one of the [[Phoenix Park murders|Phoenix Park murder]] victims.&lt;ref name="Jackson2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Patrick|title=Harcourt and son: a political biography of Sir William Harcourt, 1827-1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3f2twWl-jMC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=2 November 2010|year=2004|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-4036-4|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encouraged non-jury trials to impose death sentences, prompting [[Francis Alexander FitzGerald]] to resign in protest as [[baron of the exchequer]].&lt;ref name="Heritage4"/&gt; In fact no death sentence was passed under the provisions of that Act.&lt;ref name="Heritage4"&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Bench: The O’Briens &amp; the Fitzgeralds|journal=Heritage Series|publisher=Courts Service of Ireland|issue=4|issn=1649-3850|url=http://courts.ie/Courts.ie/library3.nsf/(WebFiles)/60DB04323CA5F2A2802577910039A611/$FILE/Heritage%20series%20O%20Brien%20and%20Fitzgerald.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-proclaimed [[Irish Republic]], which fought the 1919–21 War against the British authorities, established [[Dáil Courts|its own republican courts]]. In summer 1920, when a [[County Meath]] republican court sentenced a man to death for murder, the sentence was referred to the [[Government of the 1st Dáil#2nd Ministry|Dáil ministry]], which decided to uphold it, although [[Constance Markievicz]] was reluctant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Doyle |first1=David |last2=O’Callaghan |first2=Liam |title=Capital Crime: 1916 and Death Penalty Discourse in Independent Ireland {{!}} |url=https://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/1916-and-death-penalty-discourse-in-independent-ireland |website=Century Ireland |publisher=RTÉ |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Republican Army]] was empowered by the [[First Dáil]] to [[court-martial]] and execute pro-unionist civilians for such crimes as "spying" and [[Collaborationism|collaboration]]. The procedures at such trials depended on the local IRA leadership; many were [[kangaroo court]]s imposing summary justice. Besides executions, IRA members also carried out combat operations, assassinations, extra-judicial killings, and personally motivated murders, with varying levels of sanction from the republican leadership; historians have commented that the dividing lines between these categories can be blurred and contentious; an example being the 1922 [[Dunmanway killings]].&lt;ref name="Cottrell2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cottrell|first=Peter|title=The Anglo-Irish War: The Troubles of 1913-1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMpGh8UyICgC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=31 October 2010|date=28 March 2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-023-9|pages=70–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ex220848"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/matters-of-life-and-death-220848.html|title=Matters of life and death|last=Dwyer|first=Ryle|date=28 January 2013|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal developments==
The 1922 "Special Powers Act" was replaced after the Civil War by a series of Public Safety Acts promoted by [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] governments to counter residual republican paramilitary activity.

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Haughey said, "Very shortly after becoming minister for justice, I went up to Mountjoy to see the condemned cell and I was so revolted by the whole atmosphere that I resolved to do away with the death penalty."&lt;ref name="ex220848"/&gt;  The Criminal Justice Act 1964 abolished the death penalty for piracy, some military crimes, and most murders.

The Extradition Act, 1965 prevented [[extradition]] where the prisoner could be sentenced to death for a crime not punishable by death in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extradition Act, 1965|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0017/sec0019.html|series=Irish Statute Book|volume=1965, No. 19|date=19 July 1965|page=§19|nopp=Y|chapter=Capital punishment. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of "capital murder" under the 1964 act was elucidated by the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] in the 1977 case of [[Noel and Marie Murray]], convicted of capital murder after the 1975 shooting of a Garda, who was off duty and not in uniform, giving chase after they had robbed a bank. The court held that "capital murder" was a new offence, not merely a subtype of the existing [[Common law|common-law]] offence of murder; and that the Garda was acting "in the course of his duty", despite not being on duty; but that, as he was in plain clothes, the Murrays did not know he was a Garda; and so, while there was intent (''[[mens rea]]'') to commit murder, there was no intent to commit capital murder.&lt;ref&gt;People (DPP) v Murray [1977] IR 360; {{cite journal |title=Capital Murder and the Supreme Court |first=Paul |last=O'Connor |journal=Irish Jurist |volume=New series, Vol. 14 |number=2 |date=Winter 1979 |pages=329–333 |jstor=44027413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commuted death sentences==
From 1923 to 1964, 40 death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; three condemned were found insane, and three died awaiting execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0205/D.0205.196310240098.html |series=Dáil Éireann debates |volume=204 |date=24 October 1963 |title=Questions.

Death sentences were passed on 11 people after the 1964 Act, for 5 different incidents involving the capital murder of a total of 6 Gardaí (police). All were imposed by the [[Special Criminal Court]]. The murders of several other gardaí, and of British ambassador [[Christopher Ewart-Biggs]] in 1976, might also have constituted capital crimes had any prosecution been brought. Of the 11 sentenced to death, 2 had the conviction for capital murder quashed on appeal, and were convicted instead of ordinary murder.&lt;ref name="burke1990"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0399/D.0399.199006010003.html |series=Dáil Éireann debates |volume=399 |date=1 June 1990 |title=Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1990: Second Stage. |accessdate=14 July 2010 |pages=col.1194 |nopp=Y |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607205736/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0399/D.0399.199006010003.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The death sentences of the other 9 were commuted by the President on the advice of the government, to 40 years' imprisonment without [[parole]].&lt;ref name="burke1990"/&gt; One conviction was overturned in 1995. The 40-year sentences were controversial, both because they had no statutory basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/D/0337/D.0337.198206300010.html |series=Dáil Éireann debates |volume=337 |date=30 June 1982 |title=Ceisteanna—Questions.

The [[Court of Criminal Appeal (Ireland)|Court of Criminal Appeal]] has upheld the sentences as the extra-judicial procedure is in step with the Irish Constitution's provision for commuting sentences.

Four convicts were released in 1998 under the amnesty of political prisoners under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. The remaining four protested that they were also eligible for the amnesty, but were not released under its provisions. The state refused to grant the standard remission of sentences due for good behaviour, which would make them eligible for parole after 30 years.&lt;ref name="ind29657572"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/two-garda-killers-who-faced-death-penalty-have-been-freed-from-prison-29657572.html|title=Two garda killers who faced death penalty have been freed from prison|last=Brady|first=Tom|date=14 October 2013|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the four, Noel Callan, took a court case that he was entitled to emission, which was rejected by the High Court in 2011,&lt;ref name="iehc2011_190" /&gt; but upheld by the Supreme Court in 2013.&lt;ref name="ind29657572"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants= Callan -v- Ireland &amp; anor |court=IESC |year=2013 |num=35 |date=2013-07-18 |courtname=Supreme Court |juris=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the four, who had already served over thirty years, were released straight away, while Callan and the fourth were released in December 2015 upon reaching 30 years.&lt;ref name="ind29657572"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it2451758"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/garda-murderers-freed-from-jail-after-three-decades-1.2451758|title=Garda murderers freed from jail after three decades|last=Lally|first=Conor|date=2 December 2015|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A 1986 [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] briefing made public in 2017 said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/death-penalty-state-papers-3135198-Jan2017/|title=Ireland's death penalty was a 'quaint throwback' but not everyone wanted to get rid of it|last=Duffy|first=Rónán|date=1 January 2017|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The death penalty in this country is largely a quaint throwback to the days when everyone else had one. As we no longer have a hangman, and almost the only country in the world in a position to train one is [[Apartheid South Africa|South Africa]], there is no immediate prospect of execution in this jurisdiction. That being said, the abolition of the death penalty would represent a strong political minus in the eyes of certain right-wing groupings, including the gardaí, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]]. While the step would be practically meaningless, it could be used in a politically damaging way.

In 1988, the [[Progressive Democrats]] (PDs) produced an aspirational  "Constitution for a New Republic", which included a prohibition on capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/docs/pd/Progressive%20Democrats%20Constitution%201988.pdf#page=3|title=Constitution for a New Republic|date=January 1988|work=Irish Election Manifesto Archive|publisher=Michael Pidgeon|page=4|accessdate=22 August 2011 |quote=The State shall not make lawful the taking of life as punishment for any offence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's 1989 [[ratification]] of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), effective 8 March 1990, made a [[reservation (law)|reservation]] to Article 6(5). The Article reads "Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age and shall not be carried out on pregnant women."&lt;ref&gt;
Art 6(5), [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm#part3 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |date= 5 July 2008 }}. [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]
&lt;/ref&gt;  The Irish government's declaration read "Pending the introduction of further legislation to give full effect to the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 6, should a case arise which is not covered by the provisions of existing law, the Government of Ireland will have regard to its obligations under the Covenant in the exercise of its power to advise commutation of the sentence of death."&lt;ref name="unts1551"&gt;

:I appreciate that there is support for the abolition of the death penalty and, in more normal times, I accept that there would be merit in a full and open debate on the pros and cons of such a move. However, times are not normal and there are armed subversive groups inimical to the institutions of the State. In such circumstances my primary concern — and that of the Minister for Justice — is to provide the maximum protection possible for those who defend our democratic institutions. I am concerned that a move to abolish the death penalty at present could give the wrong signal. It would remove the additional protection which the death penalty provides for members of the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service, who are especially at risk from violent criminals, some of whom have been murdered in the execution of their duty.

After the [[Irish general election, 1989|June 1989 general election]], Fianna Fáil formed a coalition with the PDs;&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Government of the 26th Dáil]]&lt;/ref&gt; the agreed programme for government included abolishing the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/docs/pfgs/PfG%201989%20-%201993%20-%20FF-PD.pdf#page=16|title=Agreed programme for Government 1989–1993|last=Progressive Democrats|date=July 1989|work=Irish Election Manifesto Archive|publisher=Michael Pidgeon|page=32|quote=new laws, removing the death penalty; changing the libel laws; and governing telephone tapping will be introduced.|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was abolished for all offences by the Criminal Justice Act 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0016/print.html Criminal Justice Act 1990] Irish Statute Book, Acts of the Oireachtas&lt;/ref&gt; which made [[Life imprisonment in Ireland|life imprisonment]] the penalty for what had been capital crimes, and all except the military crimes had a minimum term of not less than forty years; remission rules are stricter than for other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;LRC 108, §§2.66–2.67&lt;/ref&gt; The Child Care Bill 1988 was still pending, so the section relating to the death penalty was removed as superfluous.&lt;ref name="dailv403c2635"&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1990/12/13/00021.asp#N444 Dáil debates, Vol.403 c.2635]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the then [[Tánaiste]], [[Dick Spring]], said in Vienna that the 1990 abolition should be made irreversible, which [[Taoiseach]] [[Albert Reynolds]] later confirmed was government policy and would involve a constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;

:Prohibit the re-introduction of the death penalty. If this is not deemed desirable, Article 40.4.5° should be retained. If it is prohibited, Article 28.3.3° will require amendment so that the death penalty cannot be imposed in any circumstances.
Article 40.4.5° prescribed the treatment of those under sentence of death; Article 28.3.3° deals with the suspension of rights during a [[state of emergency]]. On 7 June 2001, the [[Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] was one of three proposed amendments put to referendums. It added Article 15.5.2°, which prohibits the death penalty; deleted as redundant Article 40.4.5° and several other references to "capital crimes"; and amended Article 28.3.3° to prevent the death penalty being imposed during an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' has been abolished in [[Turkey]] as of 2004, and Turkey has not executed any prisoners since October 1984.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/07/tayyip-erdogan-hints-at-return-of-death-penalty-in-turkey/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1984, executions would usually happen after military interventions. [[Adnan Menderes]], who served as Prime Minister was hanged on 17 September 1961 following the [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960 coup d'état]], along with two other cabinet members, [[Fatin Rüştü Zorlu]] and [[Hasan Polatkan]]. The student leaders [[Deniz Gezmiş]], Hüseyin İnan and Yusuf Aslan were hanged on 6 May 1972 after the [[1971 Turkish military memorandum|1971 military memorandum]]. Following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980 coup d'état]], between 1980 and 1984, a total of 50 men, including 27 political activists, were executed by Turkish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.belgenet.com/12eylul/12eylidam.html complete list of all executed people] (in Turkish), accessed on 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-four articles of the 1926 Turkish Penal Code (Law 765) provided for a mandatory death penalty, 19 of them for crimes against the state, the government, the [[Constitution]] and military, and a further ten for criminal offenses like [[murder]] and rape. These 24 articles defined a total of 29 offenses.&lt;ref name="AI1990"&gt;Amnesty International [http://ob.nubati.net/wiki/Illustrated_Reports_of_Amnesty_International Injustice leads to the gallows], February 1990; the relevant page as an image can be found athttp://ob.nubati.net/wiki/File:Dp199002.png&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 12 of Law 765, death sentences were to be carried out by hanging after being approved by act of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (''Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi''), or the TBMM. Within TBMM they were reviewed by the Judicial Committee before being voted on by parliament as a whole. This decision had to be ratified by the President, who had the power to commute death sentences on grounds of age or ill-health.&lt;ref name="AI1990" /&gt;

By Law 4771 of 9 August 2002 (the 3rd Package for [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Harmonization with the European Union]]) the death penalty was abolished for peace time offences. Law 5218 of 14 July 2004 abolished the death penalty for all times.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3384667.stm Turkey agrees death penalty ban]," ''[[BBC News]]''. The gradual abolition of capital punishment in Turkey went as follows: 2002 for peacetime offences, 2004 for wartime offences.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey [[ratification|ratified]] [[European Convention on Human Rights#Protocol 13 - complete abolition of death penalty|Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights]], overseen by the [[Council of Europe]], in February 2006.

After the failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état|2016 coup d'état]], some politicians are talking about restoring the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-coup-erdogan-government-death-penalty-restore-attempted-istanbul-ankara-latest-dead-a7140391.html Turkey Coup: Erdogan government could restore death penalty, deputy leader warns]," ''[[The Independent]]''. Hashtag #Idamistiyorum ('I want death penalty') becomes the top trend on Turkish Twitter&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdogan]], [[President of Turkey]] since 2014, has announced (29 October 2016) that the Government (PM [[Binali Yıldırım]], [[Yıldırım Cabinet]]) will present a draft law restoring the death penalty  to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish Parliament]] ("and I will countersign it").&lt;ref&gt;spiegel.de 29 October 2016: [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/tuerkei-erdogan-laesst-parlament-ueber-todesstrafe-abstimmen-a-1118858.html Erdogan lässt Parlament über Todesstrafe abstimmen]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19th March 2017, Erdogan said he would immediately approve the reinstatement of capital punishment after the upcoming constitutional referendum. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2017/03/19/514877/turkey-erdogan-referendum-death-penalty&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has not yet happened.

==Alternatives==
The death sentence was replaced by aggravated life imprisonment (''ağırlaştırılmış müebbet hapis cezası''). According to Article 9 of Law 5275 on the Execution of Sentences&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5275.html online edition of Law 5275] (in Turkish on pages of the Turkish Government); accessed on 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; these prisoners are held in [[Solitary confinement|individual cells]] in [[Supermax|high security prisons]] and are allowed to exercise in a neighbouring yard one hour per day.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11362">'''Carrion insects''' are those insects associated with decomposing remains.  The processes of [[decomposition]] begin within a few minutes of death.&lt;ref name= Vass&gt;{{cite journal|author= Vass A.A.|author2= Barshick S.A.|author3= Sega G.|author4= Caton J.|author5= Skeen J.T.|author6= Love J.C.|author7= Synstelien J.A.|title= Decomposition chemistry of human remains: A new methodology for determining the postmortem interval|journal= Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume= 47|issue= 3|pages= 542–553|year= 2002|doi=10.1520/JFS15294J|pmid=12051334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decomposing remains offer a temporary, changing site of concentrated resources which are exploited by a wide range of organisms, of which [[arthropod]]s are often the first to arrive and the predominant exploitive group.  However, not all arthropods found on or near decomposing remains will have an active role in the decay process.&lt;ref name= Goff&gt;{{cite journal|last= Goff|first= M.L.|title= Estimation of postmortem interval using arthropod development and successional patterns|journal= Forensic Science Review|volume= 5|issue= 2|pages= 81–94|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological roles==

Carrion insects are commonly described based on their ecological role.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;&lt;ref name= Smith&gt;{{cite book|last= Smith|first= K.G.V.|title= A manual of forensic entomology|publisher= British Museum (Natural History &amp; Cornell University Press)|isbn= 0-565-00990-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four commonly described roles are:
# [[Scavenger|Necrophagous]] species
# Predators and [[Parasitism|parasites]] of necrophagous species
# [[Omnivore|Omnivorous]] species
# Adventive species

===Necrophagous species===
[[File:Protophormia terraenovae.jpg|thumb|Necrophagous ''Protophormia terraenovae'' (Robineau-Desvoidy).|right]]
[[File:Decomposition01.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Calliphoridae]], [[Sarcophagidae]] and [[Muscidae]] on fresh porcupine corpse]]
[[File:Decomposition00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Larvae of blowflies and flies on 5-day old porcupine corpse]]
Necrophagous species are insects/arthropods that feed directly on remains, or the fluids released from remains during the decomposition process.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;  This ecological classification includes many species of the order [[Fly|Diptera]] (true flies) from the families [[Calliphoridae]] (blowflies)and [[Flesh-fly|Sarcophagidae]] (flesh flies), and some species of the order [[Beetle|Coleoptera]] (beetles).  Although specific arthropod species present at remains will vary by geographic location, some examples of common blowflies are ''[[Calliphora vicina]]'', ''[[Phormia regina]]'', ''[[Protophormia terraenovae]]'' and [[Common green bottle fly|''Lucilia sericata'']]

Necrophagous blowfly species are often the first to arrive and colonize at a site of decomposing remains.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;  These species develop from eggs laid directly on the carcass and complete their life cycle on or near the remains.  Because of this, necrophagous species are considered to be the most important for post-mortem interval estimations.&lt;ref name= Watson&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Watson E.J. |author2=Carlton C.E. |title= Spring succession of necrophilous insects on wildlife carcasses in Louisiana|journal= Journal of Medical Entomology|volume= 40|issue= 3|pages= 338–347|year= 2003|doi=10.1603/0022-2585-40.3.338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Tabor&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tabor K.L. |author2=Fell R.D. |author3=Brewster C.C. |title= Insect fauna visiting carrion in Southwest Virginia|journal= Forensic Science International|volume= 150|pages= 73–80|year= 2005|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.06.041 |pmid=15837010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial colonizers of greatest importance are those of the family Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae and [[Muscidae]] (house flies), as these are typically the first insects to lay eggs at remains.&lt;ref name= Tabor/&gt;

The fresh stage of decomposition is characterized by the arrival of necrophagous blowflies and flesh flies.  These blowflies are also strongly attracted during the bloat stage of decomposition.&lt;ref name=Goff/&gt;  Many Dipterans, especially their larval forms, are involved in removal of material from the carcass, though not in an appreciable amount.&lt;ref name= Putman&gt;{{cite journal|last= Putman|first= R.J.|title= The role of carrion-frequenting arthropods in the decay process|journal= Ecological Entomology|volume= 3|pages= 133–139|year= 1978|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1978.tb00911.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Necrophagous species of Coleoptera are most strongly attracted during the active stage of decomposition.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;

===Predators and parasites of necrophagous species===
[[File:Thanatophilus lapponicus.jpg|thumb|''Thanatophilus lapponicus'' (Herbst), Family Silphidae.|left]]

This role includes those insects which feed on, or act as parasites of, necrophagous species.  These insects do not feed directly on the decomposing remains or its fluids, but are considered to be the second most forensically important ecological role.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name= Payne&gt;{{cite journal|last= Payne|first= J.A.|title= A summer carrion study of the baby pig sus scrofa Linnaeus|journal= Ecology|volume= 46|pages= 592–602|year= 1965|doi=10.2307/1934999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Predators of necrophagous insects include species from the Coleoptera families [[Silphidae]] (carrion beetles) and [[Rove beetle|Staphylinidae]] (rove beetles).&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;  Parasites may include species of parasitic wasps, from the order [[Hymenoptera]] (family [[Braconidae]]).

Some species of blowflies may begin their larval development in the necrophagous role, feeding directly on remains, but become predaceous during later larval stages.  These species are listed as being schizophagous, and are included in the predators and parasites ecological role.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;

The majority of beetles present at remains are there as predators of blowfly larvae, and are not directly concerned with the removal of carcass materials.&lt;ref name= Putman/&gt;  Predaceous beetles may arrive at a site of remains as early as the bloat stage of decomposition, when there is a strong attraction of their necrophagous prey.  Some of these species may also remain during active decay.  During the advanced stage of decay there is an increase in those insects which are predaceous and/or parasitic on necrophagous beetles.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;

===Omnivorous species===
Omnivorous species feed on both the decomposing remains as well as other carrion associated insects, usually necrophagous species.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;  Large numbers of omnivorous insects can slow the rate at which carcass materials are removed by depleting the number of necrophagous larvae.&lt;ref name= Early&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Early M. |author2=Goff M.L. |title= Arthropod succession patterns in exposed carrion on the island of O'ahu, Hawaiian Islands, USA|journal= Journal of Medical Entomology|volume= 23|issue= 5|pages= 520–531|year= 1986|doi=10.1093/jmedent/23.5.520}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This category includes species of [[ant]]s, [[wasp]]s, and some species of carrion beetles.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;

===Adventive species===
Adventive species may or may not play a significant role in the decomposition of remains.  Arthropods in this ecological role are not necessarily attracted to decaying remains, but use it as an extension of their natural habitats.  Adventive species originate within the vegetation and soils surrounding decomposing remains.  These insects may visit remains from time to time, or use them for concealment,&lt;ref name= Campobasso&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Campobasso C.P. |author2=Di Vella G. |author3=Introna F. |title= Factors affecting decomposition and Diptera colonization|journal= Forensic Science International|volume= 120|pages= 18–27|year= 2001|doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00411-X|pmid=11457604}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their presence can only be accounted for by chance.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;  They may also become predators of necrophagous species found at remains.&lt;ref name= Campobasso/&gt;  Adventive species include [[springtail]]s, [[centipede]]s and [[spider]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;

The diagram below shows the relationship between each ecological role and a site of decaying remains.
[[File:Carrion insect trophic relationships.png|thumb|Trophic level relationships between ecological roles of carrion insects. Image adapted from Smith (1986).|centre]]

==Condensed ecological roles==

The ecological roles described above can further be condensed into two broad, general classifications:&lt;ref name= Marchenko&gt;{{cite journal|last= Marchenko|first= M.I.|title= Medicolegal relevance of cadaver entomofauna for the determination of the time of death|journal= Forensic Science International|volume= 120|pages= 89–109|year= 2001|doi=10.1016/s0379-0738(01)00416-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Properly cadaveric entomofauna
# Arbitrary entomofauna of a cadaver

===Properly cadaveric entomofauna===
This classification consists of necrobiont insects which use decaying remains as a permanent environment necessary for their life and development.  Necrobiont insects includes necrophagous and entomophagous trophic specializations,&lt;ref name= Marchenko/&gt; or necrophagous, predaceous/parasitic and omnivorous species.

===Arbitrary entomofauna of a cadaver===
Some insects or arthropods visit sites of carrion, but do not colonize them.&lt;ref name= Tabor/&gt;  This classification consists of those insects for which decomposing remains are not a permanent feature for development.&lt;ref name= Marchenko/&gt;  The adventive trophic specialization falls into this category.

==Forensic relevance==
{{See also|Forensic entomological decomposition}}

Each group or species of insect will be attracted to decomposing remains at different stages of decomposition, as changes within the remains result in the availability of different resources.  The predictable order in which the above described insect groups are attracted to and observed on remains is referred to as a succession pattern, and can be used in forensic investigations to estimate the [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI) or time since death.&lt;ref name= Anderson&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anderson G.S. |author2=VanLaerhoven S.L. |title= Initial studies on insect succession on carrion in southwestern British Columbia|journal= Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 617–625|year= 1996|doi=10.1520/JFS13964J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of PMI estimation is most useful in the later stages of decomposition.&lt;ref name= Tabor1&gt;{{cite journal|author= Tabor, K.L.|author2= Brewster, C.C.|author3= Fell, R.D.|last-author-amp= yes|title= Analysis of the successional patterns of insects on carrion in Southwest Virginia|journal= Journal of Medical Entomology|volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 785–795|year= 2004|doi=10.1603/0022-2585-41.4.785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second method of PMI determination, in early stages of decomposition, by insect evidence utilizes the development rate of colonizing arthropods.  This method is usually applied to necrophagous blowflies, as they are often the first to colonize and are associated with remains for the longest period.  Development rates are only useful in forensic investigations until the first new generation has completed development and left the remains.&lt;ref name= Goff/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6873">'''Computational genomics''' (often referred to as Computational Genetics) refers to the use of computational and statistical analysis to decipher biology from [[genome sequence]]s and related data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV | title = Computational genomics | journal = Current Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = R155–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11267880 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00081-1 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960-9822(01)00081-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] sequence as well as other "post-genomic" data (i.e., experimental data obtained with technologies that require the genome sequence, such as genomic [[DNA microarrays]]). These, in combination with computational and statistical approaches to understanding the function of the genes and statistical association analysis, this field is also often referred to as [[Computational and Statistical Genetics]]/genomics. As such, computational genomics may be regarded as a subset of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], but with a focus on using whole genomes (rather than individual genes) to understand the principles of how the DNA of a species controls its biology at the molecular level and beyond.  With the current abundance of massive biological datasets, computational studies have become one of the most important means to biological discovery.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://www.eecs.mit.edu/bioeecs/CompGenProt.html Computational Genomics and Proteomics at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The roots of computational genomics are shared with those of [[bioinformatics]]. During the 1960s, [[Margaret Dayhoff]] and others at the National Biomedical Research Foundation assembled databases of homologous protein sequences for evolutionary study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mount |first=David | name-list-format = vanc |title=Bioinformatics, Sequence and Genome Analysis |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-87969-597-2 |pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their research developed a [[phylogenetic tree]] that determined the evolutionary changes that were required for a particular protein to change into another protein based on the underlying [[amino acid]] sequences.  This led them to create a scoring matrix that assessed the likelihood of one protein being related to another.

Beginning in the 1980s, databases of genome sequences began to be recorded, but this presented new challenges in the form of searching and comparing the databases of gene information.  Unlike text-searching algorithms that are used on websites such as Google or Wikipedia, searching for sections of genetic similarity requires one to find strings that are not simply identical, but similar.  This led to the development of the [[Needleman-Wunsch algorithm]], which is a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm for comparing sets of amino acid sequences with each other by using scoring matrices derived from the earlier research by Dayhoff.  Later, the [[BLAST]] algorithm was developed for performing fast, optimized searches of gene sequence databases.  BLAST and its derivatives are probably the most widely used algorithms for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors = Brown TA |title=Genomes |publisher=Wiley |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-31618-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the phrase "computational genomics" coincides with the availability of complete sequenced genomes in the mid-to-late 1990s. The first meeting of the Annual Conference on Computational Genomics was organized by scientists from [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) in 1998, providing a forum for this speciality and effectively distinguishing this area of science from the more general fields of [[Genomics]] or [[Computational Biology]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}  The first use of this term in scientific literature, according to [[MEDLINE]] abstracts, was just one year earlier in [[Nucleic Acids Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner A | title = A computational genomics approach to the identification of gene networks | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 18 | pages = 3594–604 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9278479 | pmc = 146952 | doi = 10.1093/nar/25.18.3594 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/18/3594.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final Computational Genomics conference was held in 2006, featuring a keynote talk by Nobel Laureate [[Barry Marshall]], co-discoverer of the link between [[Helicobacter pylori]] and stomach ulcers.  As of 2014, the leading conferences in the field include [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB) and [[Research in Computational Molecular Biology]] (RECOMB).

The development of computer-assisted mathematics (using products such as [[Mathematica]] or [[Matlab]]) has helped engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists to start operating in this domain, and a public collection 
of case studies and demonstrations is growing, ranging from whole genome comparisons to [[gene expression]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Cristianini N, Hahn M |title=Introduction to Computational Genomics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-67191-0 |url=http://www.computational-genomics.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has increased the introduction of different ideas, including concepts from systems and control, information theory, strings analysis and data mining. It is anticipated that computational approaches will become and remain a standard topic for research and teaching, while students fluent in both topics start being formed in the multiple courses created in the past few years.

'''Ambrose 'Jay' Ball''', a father from London, went missing in January 2015 after his car was involved in a road traffic collision. Despite an extensive police search, no trace of him was found until three months later, when his body was found in the [[River Lea]] in [[Tottenham]], London. A Facebook campaign, launched to encourage witnesses to come forward, received threats from people warning his family and friends to stop asking questions. Despite the threats, along with a report made at [[Colindale]] police station in north London, the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] have never followed these reports up.

An inquest into Ball's death commenced in April 2015 and was adjourned, "on grounds a person may be charged with homicide and to allow police to continue their investigations", after police told the coroner Ball's death was, "unexplained". The inquest is due to resume on 24 August 2015.&lt;ref now the inquest has been put back until January 2016 so the ipcc can finish the 2 parts that may interferes with the inquest to be solved by December with a pre inquest before the inquest to begin in January with two weeks put aside for the trial as the 1 day that originally was set was far to underestimated for what now is two weeks due to the family and the witnesses they know were there on the night in question.  name=InquestCoroner&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambrose Ball did not die of natural causes|publisher=''Tottenham and Wood Green Independent''|url=http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/12924903.Ambrose_Ball_did_not_die_of_natural_causes/|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Ambrose Ball (also known as Jay) was a 30-year-old father of two children. He went out with a friend to The Fox public house in Green Lanes, [[Palmers Green]] in north London, and was allegedly involved in a fight at the pub.&lt;ref name="Daily Star – dailystar.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/487377/Missing-tattoo-Ambrose-Ball-inquest|accessdate=1 August 2017|title='I don't trust them' Mum tells inquest son's death was 'staged'|date=13 January 2016|work=Daily Star – dailystar.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His car was seen being driven along from the pub towards Tottenham. Shortly after 3am on Saturday 24 January 2015, a member of the public reported seeing Ball's BMW collide with a [[Median strip|central reservation]]. The car lost one of its front wheels in the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police have released information about a number of drivers they would like to speak with ten weeks after a father-of-two from Tottenham went missing on the Walthamstow border|publisher=''Waltham Forest Guardian''|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/11999722.Police_hunt_for_drivers_ten_weeks_after_father_s_disappearance/?ref=ar|date=31 March 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disappearance and search ==
Following the road traffic collision, the driver was seen leaving the car by a witness. Ambrose Ball was not seen again by his family, friends or police until his body was found in the River Lea, three months later. In February 2015, police conducted a fruitless, three-day marine and finger-tip search of the area, including the River Lea and Walthamstow Wetlands, looking for Ball. Air units, dog teams and ground officers took part in the search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police have carried out a fingertip and marine search of an area between Tottenham and Walthamstow in an attempt to find a missing man|publisher=''Waltham Forest Guardian''|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/11785165.Large_scale_police_hunt_for_missing_man_in_wetlands_area/|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body found ==
On 22 April 2015, a body was discovered in the River Lea and later recovered by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Body found in river could be missing Ambrose Ball|publisher=[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]|url=http://voice-online.co.uk/article/body-found-river-could-be-missing-ambrose-ball|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 2015, the body was confirmed to be that of missing Ambrose Ball. His body was so badly decomposed that an initial [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] was inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Body found in River Lea confirmed as missing father Ambrose Ball|publisher=''Tottenham and Wood Green Independent''|url=http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/12915117.Body_found_in_River_Lea_confirmed_as_missing_father_Ambrose_Ball/|date=27 April 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BallMirror&gt;{{cite news|title=Body found in river was man who disappeared three months ago after serious road crash|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/body-found-river-man-who-5589071|date=26 April 2015|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball's aunt, Alexandria Harrison, claimed that his body was discovered by police the day after officers working on Ball's disappearance visited someone in prison.&lt;ref name="BallMirror"/&gt;

== Inquest (adjourned) ==
At the end of April 2015, the inquest into Ball's death began. The police asked the coroner, [[Andrew Walker (barrister)|Andrew Walker]], for an adjournment saying they could not rule out third-party involvement in Ball's "unexplained" death and they also needed time to perform [[CT scans]] and [[diatom]] analysis (used when bodies have lain in water for some time). The coroner agreed to adjourn the inquest until 24 August 2015 on the "grounds a person may be charged with homicide and to allow police to continue their investigations". The coroner assured Ball's concerned family saying, "I can assure you we are independent of the police in this matter".&lt;ref name=InquestCoroner&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambrose Ball did not die of natural causes|publisher=''Tottenham and Wood Green Independent''|url=http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/12924903.Ambrose_Ball_did_not_die_of_natural_causes/|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the adjournment the coroner released Ambrose Ball's body to his family who had commissioned an independent autopsy.&lt;ref name="InquestCoroner"/&gt; After the adjournment, Ball's mother Ruth Lovell said, "His body was dumped in that river, I am sure of that".&lt;ref name="InquestCoroner"/&gt;

At an inquest hearing in January 2016, an expert witness testified that the presence of diatoms made it most likely that Ball had drowned.

'''Derek Humphry''' (born 29 April 1930) is a [[Great Britain|British]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Journalism|journalist]] and [[author]] notable as a proponent of legal [[Assisted suicide|assisted]] [[suicide]] and the [[right to die]] [[philosophy]].  In 1980, he co-founded the [[Hemlock Society]] and, in 2004, after that organization dissolved, he co-founded the [[Final Exit Network]].  From 1988 to 1990, he was president of the [[World Federation of Right to Die Societies]] and is the current president of the Euthanasia Research &amp; Guidance Organization (ERGO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalexit.org/final-exit-digital-edition-sample.pdf "About the author"], ''Extract from FINAL EXIT'' – Digital edition 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author several related books, including ''[[Jean's Way]]'' (1978), ''The Right to Die: Understanding Euthanasia'' (1986), and ''[[Final Exit|Final Exit: The Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying]]'' (1991).

Since 1978, Derek Humphry has lived in the [[United States]].

==Early years==
Born to a British father and an Irish mother, he was raised in Somerset. His education was slender because of a broken home followed by World War II, when many English schools were in chaos, finally leaving at the age of 15, when he became a messenger boy for the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]''. In a 30-year journalistic career Humphry worked and wrote for the ''Bristol Evening World'', the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' and, lastly, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Good Life, Good Death" Chapter 1, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
His first wife, Jean Humphry, ended her life on 29 March 1975, in [[The Cotswolds]] with her husband at her side, with an intentional overdose of medication; she was suffering from terminal breast cancer. He told that story from his perspective in the best-selling ''Jean's Way''. Derek and Jean Humphry had three sons, the youngest one an adoptee.

Humphry wrote the 1991 suicide handbook, ''[[Final Exit]]''. From 1993 onwards Humphry has been president of the Euthanasia Research &amp; Guidance Organization (ERGO), and chairs the advisory board of the new [[Final Exit Network]] (formed 2004 to replace the Hemlock Society dissolved the previous year in mergers).

His marriage to his next wife, Ann Wickett, an American and a co-founder of the [[Hemlock Society]], ended in 1989 when she filed for divorce; they had no children. Ann Wickett committed suicide, at the age of 49 on 2 October 1991, during a recurrence of depression and Borderline Personality Disorder. She had been battling breast cancer, but the cancer was in remission and she was not considered "terminally ill". In her suicide note, she claimed that Humphry was a "killer" and that his first wife, Jean, had died of suffocation.&lt;ref&gt;''Good Life, Good Death: Memoir of an Investigative Reporter and Pro-choice Advocate'', Chapter 12, p. 244 ("Breaking up").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/magazine/a-fight-to-the-death.html?sec=health ''New York Times'' report on Derek and Ann Humphry]&lt;/ref&gt; He denied these allegations as groundless.&lt;ref&gt;''Good Life, Good Death'', Chapter 16, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1990 Humphry married Gretchen Crocker, youngest daughter of an Oregon farming family.&lt;ref&gt;''Good Life, Good Death: Memoir of an Investigative Reporter and Pro-choice Advocate'', Chapter 18, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
Humphry is an advisor to the [[World Federation of Right to Die Societies]] by virtue of his past presidency and in appreciation of his 26 years of involvement with that organization. Since it was founded in 2004, Humphry has been an adviser to the [[Final Exit Network]]. After four members of the organization were accused in Georgia of assisting a suicide&lt;ref&gt;Final Exit Network newsletter, Spring 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- what was the result in Georgia? --&gt;he launched the Final Exit Liberty Fund which paid most of their legal costs.

In 2014 Derek Humphry was given  the World Federation of Right To Die Societies "Lifetime Achievement Award" for 'contributing so much, so long and so courageously to our right to a peaceful death.  The award was presented by world president Faye Girsh at the 20th international conference in Chicago on 9/19/2014.  It is the first time this award has been made.&lt;ref&gt;World Right to Die Newsletter, Spring, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and publications==
Humphry was newsletter editor for the [[World Federation of Right to Die Societies]] for a number of years.

As of 2016, the paperback ''Final Exit'' was in print in English, Spanish and Italian. It has sold more than one million copies in twelve languages since 1991. In April 2007 the editors and book critics of ''[[USA Today]]'' selected ''Final Exit'' as one of the most memorable 25 books of the last quarter century.&lt;ref name="25books"&gt;{{cite news|title=25 Books That Leave A Legacy|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/top25-books.htm|date=9 April 2007|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017 he published his life story, ''Good Life, Good Death: The Memoir of a Right To Die Pioneer'' (Carrel Books, New York. {{ISBN|978-1631440663}})

[[Image:Yyjpg.svg|thumb|Dialectical Monism]]

'''Dialectical monism''', also known as '''dualistic monism''', is an [[ontology|ontological]] position that holds that reality is ultimately a unified whole, distinguishing itself from [[monism]] by asserting that this whole necessarily expresses itself in [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DANIELS_2011|Daniels 2011]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANPyln0ogD4C&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage p.260]&lt;/ref&gt; For the dialectical monist, the essential unity is that of complementary polarities, which, while opposed in the realm of experience and perception, are co-substantial in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] sense.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

== Principles ==

To establish its premises, dialectical monism may posit a [[Universal Dialectic]], which is seen as the fundamental principle of [[existence]]. The concept is similar to that of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] or "Supreme Ultimate" in Taoism, the "Purusha-Prakriti" in [[Samkhya]], and duality-in-unity of Shiva-Shakti in [[Tantra]]. Advocates assert that [[Taoism]] as well as some forms of [[Buddhism]] are based on an approach [[consistent]] with or identical to dialectical monism.

Ideas relating to "[[teleology|teleological]] evolution" are important in some [[progressivism|progressive]] interpretations of dialectical monism. However, this element has not always been present historically, and is generally not present in contemporary dialectical monisms such as Taoism. It is important to note that teleological tendencies in dialectical monism can significantly differ from other variants of teleology if dialectical progression is linked to [[materialism]], because such an interpretation is a [[Philosophical naturalism|naturalistic]] progression rather than a result of [[Intelligent design|design]] or [[consciousness]]. However, non-materialistic philosophies exist that also are dialectical monisms, such as [[Actual Idealism]].

Some variants of dialectical monism adhere to the view that all conditions exist at all times in unity, and our consciousness separates them into dualistic forms. Other views maintain that the nature of dialectical synthesis dictates that the flow of change will tend toward a "spiral-shaped progression" rather than a perpetual non-progressive (repetitive) circling of history. For these dialectical monists, this explains the fact of physical [[self-organization]] in Nature, as well as the observed tendency for human societies to achieve gradual "progress" over time. These teleological variants may be referred to as "progressive dialectical monism."

As a [[monism]], dialectical monism is opposed to traditional [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] despite its emphasis on "twoness." In dialectical monism, the appearance of duality is seen as arising from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one but can only be ''experienced'' in terms of division.

Furthermore, dialectical monism might also be termed "plural monism," for it recognizes the [[dependent origination|dependently originated]] existence of a multiplicity of entities, which Taoism calls "the ten thousand things." Dialectical monism does not deny that the plurality of things in existence are "real," but points out that physical reality itself is mind-dependent. (see [[Taoism]] and [[Zen]]).

== History ==

Dialectical monism has been mentioned in Western literature, although infrequently. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] used the term on at least one occasion. Sartre may have used the term "dialectical monism" to when inferring what he saw as absurd in the dogma of a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] non-dualistic interpretation of the dialectic, in which any oppositional view point was claimed to be non-dialectical rather than part of the dialectic itself.

Although the term has never been used outside the West, advocates maintain {{who|date=May 2012}} that dialectical monism has a much greater presence in Eastern traditions. A wide number of Taoist sources are cited, especially those that relate to the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] or [[yin and yang]] concepts. In addition, several Buddhist works are seen as containing strong elements of dialectical monism.

=== Buddhist influences ===

The [[Heart Sutra]] provides a notable expression of dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form. Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, it is sometimes held that the Buddhist elements of dialectical monism are more accurately characterized as [[nondualism|non-dualistic]] since they deny any fundamental sort of creative principle or "one thing," such as that posited by dialectical monism. See the Buddhist philosophy of [[Shunyata|emptiness]].

In response, dialectical monists might reply that theirs is a "positive expression of nondualism," as opposed to the "negative" expression implied by the qualifier ''non'' in nondualism.

[[Nagarjuna]], principal developer of the emptiness doctrine in Buddhism, had a perspective consistent with a broad dialectical monism that was based on the following statement attributed to the Buddha:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one."
 - Saṃyutta Nikāya 12:15&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Western influences ===
==== Pre-Socratic ====

[[Heraclitus]] is a notable early exception to the Eastern monopoly on dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By cosmic rule, as day yields night, so winter summer, war peace, plenty famine. All things change. Fire penetrates the lump of myrrh, until the joining bodies die and rise again in smoke called incense." (fragment 36) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Men do not know how that which is drawn in different directions harmonises with itself. The harmonious structure of the world depends upon opposite tension like that of the bow and the lyre."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Post-Socratic ====
&lt;blockquote&gt;One must realize that war is shared and Conflict is Justice, and that all things come to pass in accordance with conflict.&lt;br /&gt;— Cited by [[Origen]], ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' VI.28 ''(Diels-Kranz fragment 80)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The way up and down are the same.&lt;br /&gt;— Cited by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''[[Refutatio Omnium Haeresium]]'' IX.10.4 ''(Diels-Kranz fragment 60)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is wise, not listening to me but to the report (λόγος), to agree that all things are one.&lt;br /&gt;— Cited by Hippolytus, ''Refutatio'' IX.9.1 ''(Diels-Kranz fragment 50)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Parallels in Aztec philosophy ===

In its article on [[Aztec philosophy]], the ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' describes Aztec ([[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]) metaphysics as a form of dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although essentially processive and devoid of any permanent order, the ceaseless becoming of the cosmos is nevertheless characterized by an overarching balance, rhythm, and regularity: one provided by and constituted by ''teotl''... Dialectical polar monism holds that: (1) the cosmos and its contents are substantively and formally identical with ''teotl''; and (2) ''teotl'' presents itself primarily as the ceaseless, cyclical oscillation of polar yet complementary opposites.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Teotl's'' process presents itself in multiple aspects, preeminent among which is duality. This duality takes the form of the endless opposition of contrary yet mutually interdependent and mutually complementary polarities that divide, alternately dominate, and explain the diversity, movement, and momentary arrangement of the universe. These include: being and not-being, order and disorder, life and death, light and darkness, masculine and feminine, dry and wet, hot and cold, and active and passive. Life and death, for example, are mutually arising, interdependent, and complementary aspects of one and the same process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/|title=Aztec Philosophy|author=James Maffie|publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|issn=2161-0002|date=2005-03-20|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Dao De Jing'' references ===

Chapter 42 of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Dao De Jing]]'' outlines a number-based cosmology that may be consistent with dialectical monism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased."&lt;ref&gt;[[#TSE_2008|Lao-Tse 2008]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=MyRXWwGgb0IC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage p.42] (alternately from the [[Wikisource]] edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several other chapters (including Chapter 1) make reference to concepts consistent with dialectical monism.

== Contemporary references ==

=== Eastern Philosophy ===


&lt;blockquote&gt;"Really, the fundamental, ultimate mystery - the only thing you need to know to understand the deepest metaphysical secrets - is this: that for every outside there is an inside and for every inside there is an outside, and although they are different, they go together."&lt;ref name=ref_Watts_1999_10&gt;[[#WATTS_1999|Watts 1999]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=GLLFHGoHPJwC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=%22Really,+the+fundamental,+ultimate+mystery+-+the+only+thing+you+need+to+know+to+understand+the+deepest+metaphysical+secrets+-+is+this:+that+for+every%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=palDUb_BOcjVqQHf54HACw&amp;ved=0CDMQuwUwAA p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; 
— [[Alan Watts]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so." 
— [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Hamlet]]''. Act II, scene ii 245&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Shakespeare in several places [[Biblical allusions in Shakespeare|borrows directly from the Bible]], he may have been paraphrasing [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean." Romans 14:14&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Thelema ===

In a more contemporary area, the idea of dialectical monism is expressed in the central book of [[Thelema]], ''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"None... and two. For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all."
— ''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]'', ch. 1, verses 28-30&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The world exists as two, for only so can there be known the Joy of Love, whereby are Two made One. Aught that is One is alone, and has little pain in making itself two, that it may know itself, and love itself, and rejoice therein."
— [[Aleister Crowley]], "The Comment Called D"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Thelema, the transcendent unity is often referred to as "None" or "Nothing":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By Light shall ye look upon yourselves, and behold All Things that are in Truth One Thing only, whose name hath been called No Thing..."
—[[Aleister Crowley]], ''De Lege Libellum''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"... let it be ever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous!"
—''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]'', ch. 1, verse 27&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sartre on Marxism ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"'''It is dualist because it is monist'''. Marx’s ontological monism consisted in affirming the irreducibility of Being to thought, and, at the same time, in reintegrating thoughts with the real as a particular form of human activity."&lt;ref&gt;[[#SARTRE_2004|Sartre 2004]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uIvcQ0EmYpwC&amp;pg=PR22#v=onepage p.xxii]&lt;/ref&gt; 

—Jean-Paul Sartre, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', Vol. 1. Theory of Practical Ensembles&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Sartre's seminal work, the ''Critique of Dialectical Reason'', it is shown how the essential dualism of Marx corresponds to a heightened synthesis, referring to totality, which is the monism that grounds the theses and antitheses of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SARTRE_2004|Sartre 2004]]: pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=uIvcQ0EmYpwC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage 15-18] (Chapter 1 ''The Dogmatic Dialectic and the Critical Dialectic'', subsection ''Dualistic Monism'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native American ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Universe, which controls all life, has a female and male balance that prevalent throughout our Sacred Grandmother, the Earth. This balance has to be acknowledged and become the determining factor in all of one’s decisions, be they spiritual, social, healthful, educational or economical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Means|first=Russell|title=Autobiography|url=http://www.russellmeansfreedom.com/about/|accessdate=15 March 2013|authorlink=Russell Means}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Jim Thompson (designer)|James Harrison Wilson "Jim" Thompson]]''' (born 21 March 1906) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]] who helped revitalise the [[Thai silk]] industry in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BUSINESS ABROAD: The Silk King, ''Time'', Monday, 21 April 1958|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded the Thai Silk Company in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Thai Silk Company Founded in 1948, |publisher=The Jim Thompson House |year= |accessdate=19 June 2016 |url=http://jimthompsonhouse.com/life/company.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306080303/http://www.jimthompsonhouse.com/life/company.asp |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of a prominent [[Delaware]] family, Thompson graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1928 and studied architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Thompson, the Thai Silk King|work= Penn Museum|url=https://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/53-1/from%20the%20archives.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1931 to 1940, he worked as an architect in [[New York City]], designing homes for [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] high society. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOLDEN New York Stories/Jim Thompson|work= Holden - Jim Thompson Fabrics|url=http://www.jimthompsonfabrics.com/products/holden/8555/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Thompson quit his job and enlisted with the [[Delaware National Guard]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Architect Who Changed the Thai Silk Industry and Then Disappeared|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://time.com/4319751/jim-thompson-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as an operative in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (the forerunner of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) during [[World War II]]. After the war, he was assigned to the U.S. legation in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. He embarked on his silk weaving career after leaving the military in 1946. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Thai Silk Company Founded in 1948, |publisher=The Jim Thompson House |year= |accessdate=19 June 2016 |url=http://jimthompsonhouse.com/life/company.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306080303/http://www.jimthompsonhouse.com/life/company.asp |archivedate= 6 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Disappearance==
Thompson disappeared from [[Malaysia]]'s [[Cameron Highlands District|Cameron Highlands]] while going for a walk on Sunday, 26 March 1967. Prior to his disappearance, he left [[Bangkok]] to spend a day in [[Penang]] with Constance "Connie" Mangskau, his long-time acquaintance. On Friday, 24 March, they headed for the Highlands to holiday at the ”Moonlight” [[bungalow]] (now the Jim Thompson cottage). Their hosts were Dr. Ling Tien Gi, a [[Singapore]]an-[[Chinese people|Chinese]] chemist, and Mrs. Helen Ling (née Dalling), his Caucasian American-born wife.

[[File:Moonlight bungalow.jpg|thumb|left|280px|'''"Moonlight" bungalow:''' The cottage is located at A47 Kamunting Road ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Jalan Kamunting''). The mock Tudor-styled home is still a draw for the many who have had an interest in the life and disappearance of Jim Thompson.]]

On Sunday, all four got up early to attend the morning services at [[All Souls' Church, Cameron Highlands|All Souls’ Church]]. While the rest were preparing themselves for the service, Thompson informed them he would be taking a walk down ''Jalan Kamunting'', the bungalow's access road.

This was the first time he was alone for approximately 20 minutes. Later, he met up with the others and they all drove on to church.

[[File:Lutheran Mission bungalow.JPG|left|thumb|280px|'''Lutheran Mission bungalow''': The chalet is located at A45 Kamunting Road ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Jalan Kamunting''). It is about 1.5 kilometres from the ”Moonlight” bungalow.]]

The [[Easter]] services lasted for more than an hour. When it ended at noon, the group returned to ”Moonlight” for lunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Souza |first=Edward Roy |title=SOLVED!

Before leaving, he waved goodbye to Mrs. Ling and Mrs. Mangskau. They saw him depart the estate via the only access road, Jalan Kamunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE HUNT (“8th day”) CONTINUES, ''Eastern Sun'', Monday, 3 April 1967|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Souza |first=Edward Roy |title=SOLVED!

Thompson was in the "Kamunting" precinct for more than two hours. At around 4 pm, a cook from the Lutheran Mission bungalow ({{Coord|4.491320|101.376287}}) saw him when he visited the chalet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Cook: I saw millionaire the day he vanished, ''[[The Straits Times]]'', Thursday, 30 March 1967|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Spy who vanished, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Sunday, 15 February 1987|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Souza |first=Edward Roy |title=SOLVED!

An intense search was conducted after the police declared he was lost. More than 500 people were involved in the hunt. They included the army, the Malaysian police field force, [[Orang Asli]] trekkers, [[Gurkhas]], reward hunters, tourists, residents, mystics, scouts, [[Missionary|missionaries]], adventure seekers, American school students and British servicemen convalescing at the resort. At the end of the hunt, Thompson was not to be found, and no clues were unearthed. The official search lasted for 11 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Souza |first=Edward Roy |title=SOLVED! The "Mysterious" Disappearance of Jim Thompson, the Legendary Thai Silk King (2nd ed)|publisher= Word Association Publishers |year=2010 |pages=45|isbn=978-1-59571-505-0 |lccn=2009944204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sporadic additional searching went on for months.

The case generated worldwide publicity and intense speculation, with most press reports and analysts contending that Thompson had been kidnapped (although no ransom note was forthcoming); had been murdered (although no body was ever found); had voluntarily left to do secret work in resolving the [[Vietnam]] conflict (although no evidence was presented); or was eliminated by business rivals (although no evidence on this emerged).

==Recent information==
One researcher believes the clue to Thompson's mystery may lie in some bone fragments that were found at the Cameron Highlands in 1985.

{{Quote box |quoted=|bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=&lt;center&gt;'''PLANNED DISAPPEARANCE'''&lt;/center&gt;

I still insist, like others who know far more about the affair than I do, that he [[Jim Thompson (designer)|(Thompson)]] disappeared by his own choice and will, and not by force.|source=&lt;center&gt;'''[[Richard Hughes (journalist)|Richard Hughes]]''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where Is Flamboyant Silk King, ''[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]'', Saturday, 26 March 1977|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;|align=right|width=26%}}

The remains, without the skull, were discovered by [[Orang Asli]] settlers in a grave at the edge of a vegetable plot off the main road in [[Brinchang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Researcher: DNA may help unravel the mysterious disappearance of "Thai Silk King", [[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']], Wednesday, 31 March 2010|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bones May Cast Some Light to Jim Thompson's Mystery, ''Ipoh Echo'', Thursday, 1 April 2010|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Philip J. Rivers, a [[master mariner]], said he learned of the discovery from a health officer while researching Thompson's disappearance in 2007. The police collected the fragments but no connection was made to Thompson's disappearance in [[Tanah Rata]], as they were found in [[Brinchang]].

"The probability is that his body lay undiscovered in the thick under bush, hidden in an unmarked grave after a hit-and-run accident. A [[DNA]] on the bones might possibly provide a fuller answer," said Rivers at a lecture organised by the Perak Academy in [[Ipoh]], [[Perak]], [[Peninsular Malaysia|West Malaysia]] on Friday, 26 March 2010.

To date, there has been no confirmation that the bones belong to Thompson. According to Rivers, however, “the bones are presently kept in a safe and secure place".

== Search-and-rescue analysis ==
In 2015 an analysis, report and four news articles were done (by Llewellyn ("Lew") Toulmin, see news articles and external links, below) of the 1967 search for Jim Thompson from a search and rescue (SAR) and scientific point of view.  This analysis drew on interviews with a leader of and participants in the search; on interviews with other actors; on principles and mathematical formulae developed by the US [[National Association for Search and Rescue]] (NASAR); on reviews of FBI, CIA and US Department of State material on the case and on Thompson; and on various other sources.

This analysis concluded that:

# The 1967 search delivered about 1448 person-days of searching, a substantial number, but likely not enough to cover all the 17.7 square miles that were estimated in 1967 to be the target segment in the Cameron Highlands area.
# The "probability of success" (as defined by NASAR) of the 1967 search, calculated by the "probability of area" (likelihood that Thompson was in the searched segment vs. some other nearby segment) times the "probability of detection" (likelihood of finding the subject in the searched segment) was in the range of 43 to 30 percent or less, meaning that there was a fairly high chance that the search missed Thompson's body, if it was in fact present in the general search area.
# Various possible, likely or certain errors in search tactics and execution reduced the quality of the search effort; and the massive nature of the search made it almost certain (and even arguably provable mathematically) that just because it was the "biggest land search in Malaysian history," it was almost certainly not the "best search in Malaysian history".
# Three bloodhound type dogs searched the Moonlight Bungalow (the "last known point" or LKP) for scent trails of Thompson, and did not find any going down the only access road or into the jungle, and this led the Malaysian Police early on to conclude that Thompson left the area in a car, thus breaking the scent trail (this bloodhound search detailed information was not revealed previously); but this evidence is not conclusive.
# A possible sighting of Thompson in Tahiti did take place several months after the disappearance, but this sighting is not certain.
# The "bones of Jim Thompson" did exist, in that some unknown bones were at one time in the Tanah Rata District Medical Office, but the bones were never proved to be human, were not probably connected to the Thompson case, and have since disappeared in an office move.
# Of the 25 possible causes for the disappearance cited by the press in 1967, about half can be eliminated as not credible.
# Of the "eyewitnesses" who may have seen Thompson after he left the LKP, two can be impeached as being too far (as measured on Google Earth) from Thompson to be credible, and the rest are of fairly low to very low credibility.
# The literature on the decomposition of bodies in various climates shows that if Thompson's remains are in the jungle, they are likely to be spread over 1 to 4 square miles, due to predation.

The Toulmin report concludes that the probability (but not certainty) is that Thompson's remains are still in the Cameron Highlands, and that a possible way to move the case forward is to use proven SAR techniques of detailed scenario development, "Mattson voting," and human remains detection (HRD) or "cadaver" dogs.  (Mattson voting is a standard SAR technique in which SAR field staff (and/or experts on a case) rank search segments (areas to be searched, developed in the scenario development phase) using a secret ballot, in priority order.  These individual rankings are then summed and the group results used to allocate SAR resources.)

The Toulmin analysis also reviewed the brutal, still unsolved murder of Jim Thompson's sister, in Chester County, PA, just a few months after Thompson disappeared.  The analysis drew on an interview with the Pennsylvania State Police cold case officer; on a review of the wills and estate administrations of Thompson, his sister, and his sister's son; on interviews with neighbours and residents; and on contemporary (1967) news sources.  The analysis concluded there is no provable link between the Jim Thompson disappearance and the murder of his sister; that the two cases are unlikely to be related; and that several persons of interest (POIs) can be named but there is no proof against any of them.

The Toulmin report (see External Links below) contains over 500 pages of primary source material on the Jim Thompson disappearance and the murder of his sister; this is the only such compilation available. The material includes CIA, OSS, FBI and US Department of State material, maps of the search area, 200 pages of previously unpublished letters from Thompson to a former lover and fellow art collector, detailed interviews with various actors, photos and exact lat/longs of all the key locations (including possible witness locations), and other items.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">'''Edward Buncombe''' (1742–1778) was a plantation owner from the [[Province of North Carolina]] who served as a colonel in the [[Continental Army]] (the army of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] side) in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He is the namesake of [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]] in western North Carolina. In 1820, his surname (in its status as the name of that county) became the source of the derogatory American slang term, "[[wikt:bunkum|bunkum]]" and its shortened form, "[[wikt:bunk|bunk]]" in consequence of the U.S. representative for the county, [[Felix Walker (American politician)|Felix Walker]], invoking the county during a poorly received speech delivered on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bunkum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Buncombe was born in 1742 on the [[West Indies]] island of St. Christopher (today [[St. Kitts]]).&lt;ref name=WNCH-Bunc-bio&gt;WNC Heritage - A Collaborative Database. Col. Edward Buncombe. Web page.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up there and in England. He immigrated to North Carolina in 1768 and settled at a plantation he had inherited&lt;ref name=WNCH-Bunc-bio/&gt; near the shore of Albemarle Sound on the Atlantic coast, in what is now [[Washington County, North Carolina|Washington County]].&lt;ref&gt;Waymark for Buncombe Hall&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, as the independence movement of the Thirteen Colonies gathered steam, he took a leading role in convening proindependence meetings, especially the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress|First Provincial Congress]],&lt;ref name=WNCH-Bunc-bio/&gt; which is reportedly the first assembly anywhere in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to defy a royal governor.&lt;ref name=killough&gt;Killough, Patrick. Colonel Edward Buncombe, 1742-1778. Web page&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a local militia, the [[List of United States militia units in the American Revolutionary War|Tyrrell militia]]. The "[[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Fourth Provincial Congress|Halifax Assembly]]" elected him colonel of the 5th North Carolina Regiment&lt;ref&gt;NCGenWeb. North Carolina in the Revolutionary War. Roster of the 5th Regiment.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Continental Army]] on April 15, 1776{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} (three days after it had passed the historic [[Halifax Resolves]]). He was wounded and captured on October 4, 1777 at the [[Battle of Germantown]], fought several miles outside of the rebel capital of [[Philadelphia]], which the British had recently seized. The British army [[Parole#Prisoners of war|paroled]] him to that city. The following May 1778, Col. Buncombe fell down some stairs while sleepwalking and his wounds reopened, causing him to bleed to death.&lt;ref name=WNCH-Bunc-bio/&gt; He is buried in [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;good-times.webshots.com. Photo of Edward Buncombe's gravestone.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax records of 1782 say that his estate included {{convert|2250|acre|km2}} of land and 10 Negroes.&lt;ref name=killough/&gt;

In 1791, the State of North Carolina created a new county from parts of two other counties and named it for Col. Buncombe. The present [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]] is a combination of parts of the original one with parts of neighboring counties.

'''Elysium Health''' is a company founded in 2014 by [[biologist]] [[Leonard Guarente]], Dan Alminana, and Eric Marcotulli to market [[dietary supplement]]s.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;  The next year, the company started selling a dietary supplement called Basis that packages two supplements, [[nicotinamide riboside]] (NR), a form of B vitamin found in yeast, and [[pterostilbene]], a polyphenol found in blueberries, into one capsule.&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weintraub|first1=Karen|title=The anti-aging pill|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/534636/the-anti-aging-pill/|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=February 3, 2015|publisher=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company says that these two ingredients help cells make [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) and that they stimulate [[sirtuins]].&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;  The company is widely described as being in the [[anti-aging]] field and similar to [[Sirtris Pharmaceuticals]] which was developing [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stipp|first1=David|title=Beyond resveratrol: the anti-aging NAD fad|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/beyond-resveratrol-the-anti-aging-nad-fad/|work=Scientific American Blog|date=March 11, 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elysium has tried to [[Product differentiation|differentiate]] the product within the dietary supplement industry as being more scientific and exclusive, by means of the product's minimalist packaging, by not selling the product in drug stores but rather only through its website, and by getting several Nobel prize winners to join its scientific advisory board.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;&lt;ref name=criticsblast&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weintraub|first1=Karen|title=Critics blast star-studded advisory board of anti-aging company|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603199/critics-blast-star-studded-advisory-board-of-anti-aging-company/|work=MIT Technology Review|date=January 6, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clinicaltrial&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vinluan|first1=Frank|title=First clinical trial done, Elysium lands $20M for health supplements |url=https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2016/12/06/first-clinical-trial-done-elysium-lands-20m-for-health-supplements/?single_page=true|work=Xconomy|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been criticized for using this advisory board to lend credibility to its product.&lt;ref name=criticsblast/&gt; Like other companies in the supplement industry, Elysium marketed the product heavily on social media.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=An MIT scientist claims that this pill is the fountain of youth|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/08/is-elysium-healths-basis-the-fountain-of-youth.html|work=New York Magazine|language=en|date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zhang|first1=Sarah|title=The weird business behind a trendy "anti-aging" pill|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/confused-elysiums-anti-aging-drug-yeah-fda/|work=Wired|date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elysium originally bought the ingredients in Basis from [[ChromaDex]], which as of December 2016, sold the two ingredients to other supplement companies that also marketed products containing them.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|title=Subtle changes can be yours, for fifty dollars a month |url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/04/25/subtle-changes-can-be-yours-for-fifty-dollars-a-month|work=In the Pipeline|date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crunch2016/&gt; The two companies had an agreement under which Elysium Health didn't have to acknowledge ChromaDex as the source of the ingredients, but then after Elysium recruited the head of business development from Chromadex and allegedly stopped paying Chromadex, Chromadex sued Elysium and the information became public.&lt;ref name=TC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buhr|first1=Sarah|title=A new lawsuit alleges anti-aging startup Elysium Health hasn’t paid its sole supplier|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/16/a-new-lawsuit-alleges-anti-aging-startup-elysium-health-hasnt-paid-its-supplier-and-is-in-breach-of-agreement/|work=TechCrunch|date=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deathmatch/&gt; In September 2018, [[Dartmouth College]] and ChromaDex sued Elysium for infringement of two issued patents&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Nicotinamide riboside kinase compositions and methods for using the same|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8197807B2/en|date=2006-04-20|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Nicotinamide riboside kinase compositions and methods for using the same|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8383086B2/en|date=2012-04-12|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; exclusively licensed by ChromaDex on use of NR to increase NAD that were invented by [[Charles Brenner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/chromadex-and-dartmouth-college-file-patent-infringement-lawsuit-against-elysium-health-20180918-00254|title=ChromaDex and Dartmouth College File Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against Elysium Health - NASDAQ.com|work=NASDAQ.com|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61355">{{short description| Loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoxia towards the end of a breath-hold dive }}
'''Freediving blackout''', '''breath-hold blackout'''&lt;ref name="Boyd et al 2015"/&gt; or '''apnea blackout''' is a class of '''hypoxic blackout''', a [[Unconsciousness|loss of consciousness]] caused by [[cerebral hypoxia]] towards the end of a breath-hold ([[freedive]] or dynamic [[apnea]]) dive, when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to breathe and has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it. It can be provoked by [[hyperventilation|hyperventilating]] just before a dive, or as a consequence of the pressure reduction on ascent, or a combination of these. Victims are often established practitioners of breath-hold diving, are fit, strong swimmers and have not experienced problems before.&lt;ref name=Brubakk /&gt;&lt;ref name=dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=shallow1968 /&gt; Blackout may also be referred to as a [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] or [[fainting]].

Divers and swimmers who blackout or [[Greyout (medical)|grey out]] underwater during a dive will usually [[Drowning|drown]] unless rescued and resuscitated within a short time.&lt;ref name="Lane 2017" /&gt; Freediving blackout has a high fatality rate, and mostly involves males younger than 40 years, but is generally avoidable. Risk cannot be quantified, but is clearly increased by any level of hyperventilation.&lt;ref name="Pearn et al 2015" /&gt;

[[Freediving]] blackout can occur on any dive profile: at constant depth, on an ascent from depth, or at the surface following ascent from depth and may be described by a number of terms depending on the dive profile and depth at which consciousness is lost. Blackout during a shallow dive differs from blackout during ascent from a deep dive in that deep water blackout is precipitated by depressurisation on ascent from depth while shallow water blackout is a consequence of hypocapnia following hyperventilation.&lt;ref name=shallow1968 /&gt;&lt;ref name=deep1996 /&gt;

==Terminology==
Different types of freediving blackout have become known under a variety of names; these include:
{{glossary}}
{{term|1= Ascent blackout}} 
{{term|1= Blackout on ascent|multi=yes}}
{{defn|1= Loss of consciousness which occurs as the surface is approached, or even at the surface, following a deep breath-hold dive (generally over ten metres) and typically involves free-divers practicing dynamic [[apnea]] depth diving, usually at sea.&lt;ref name=deep1996/&gt; The mechanism of deep water blackout is hypoxia, arising from the rapid drop in the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs on ascent as the ambient pressure drops and the gas in the lungs expands to surface volume.}}

{{term|1= Constant depth blackout}}
{{term|1= Constant pressure blackout|multi=yes}}
{{term|1= Isobaric blackout|multi=yes}}
{{defn|1= This refers to a specific form of hypoxic blackout which occurs where all phases of the dive have taken place in shallow water; hence, depressurisation is not a significant factor. This is often referred to by breath-hold divers as shallow water blackout.&lt;ref name=shallow1968/&gt; The mechanism for this type of blackout is hypoxia expedited by [[hypocapnia]] caused by voluntary hyperventilation before the dive. These blackouts typically occur in swimming pools and are probably driven only by excessive hyperventilation, with no significant influence of pressure change.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt; }}

{{term|1= Deep water blackout}}
{{defn|1= This is an alternative term for blackout on ascent when used by free divers. As it is also used for other purposes, ascent blackout is the less ambiguous option.}}

{{term|1= Hyperventilation-induced blackout}}
{{defn|1= This is a recommended term for cases where hyperventilation is known or suspected to have been a contributing factor in either shallow water blackout or deep water blackout.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt;}}

{{term|1= Latent hypoxia}}
{{defn|1= This describes the precursor to blackout on ascent where the partial pressure of oxygen remains sufficient to maintain consciousness, but only at depth, under pressure, and is already insufficient to maintain consciousness at the shallower depths that must be encountered on ascent.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;}}

{{term|1=Shallow water blackout}}
{{defn|1= This refers to loss of consciousness during a dive associated with blackout at a shallow depth. The term is used for several different mechanisms, depending on context; therefore, this term may often lead to confusion.}}
{{defn|2=1|1= Blackout which occurs when all phases of the dive have taken place in shallow water (i.e., where depressurisation is not a significant factor) and typically involves dynamic [[apnea]] distance swimmers, usually in a swimming pool.&lt;ref name=shallow1968/&gt; The mechanism for this type of shallow water blackout is hypoxia expedited by [[hypocapnia]] caused by voluntary hyperventilation before the dive. Blackouts which occur in swimming pools are probably driven only by excessive hyperventilation, with no significant influence of pressure change.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt; This can also be described as constant pressure blackout or isobaric blackout.}} 
{{defn|2=2|1=The term shallow water blackout has also been used in the scientific literature over many years to refer to loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoxia at the end of a deep breath-hold dive during the latter part of the ascent or immediately after surfacing due to lowered oxygen partial pressure caused by reduction in ambient pressure.

In this article ''constant pressure blackout'' and ''shallow water blackout'' refers to blackouts in shallow water following hyperventilation and ''ascent blackout'' and ''deep water blackout'' refers to blackout on ascent from depth. Some free divers consider blackout on ascent to be a special condition or subset of shallow water blackout but the primary underlying mechanisms differ. This confusion is exacerbated by the fact that in the case of blackout on ascent, hyperventilation induced [[hypocapnia]] also may be a contributory factor even if depressurisation on ascent is the actual precipitator.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;

Some scuba diving curricula may apply the terms ''shallow-water blackout'' and ''deep-water blackout'' differently; deep-water blackout being applied to the final stage of [[nitrogen narcosis]] while shallow water blackout may be applied to a blackout from a deep free dive.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt;  Nitrogen narcosis does not normally apply to freediving as free-divers start and finish the dive with only a single lungful of air and it has long been assumed that free divers are not exposed to the necessary pressure for long enough to absorb sufficient nitrogen.&lt;ref name="dan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt;  Where these terms are used in this manner there is usually little or no discussion of the phenomenon of blackouts not involving depressurisation and the cause may be variously attributed to either depressurisation or [[hypocapnia]] or both.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt; This problem may stem from the origin of the term ''latent hypoxia'' in the context of a string of fatal, shallow water accidents with early military, closed-circuit [[rebreather]] apparatus prior to the development of effective [[electro-galvanic oxygen sensor|oxygen partial pressure measurement]].&lt;ref name=shallow1968 /&gt; In the very different context of dynamic [[apnea]] sports careful consideration of terms is needed to avoid potentially dangerous confusion between two phenomena that actually have different characteristics, mechanisms and prevention measures. The application of the term ''shallow water blackout'' to deep dives and its subsequent association with extreme sports has tended to mislead many practitioners of static apnea and dynamic apnea distance diving into thinking that it does not apply to them even though isobaric shallow water blackout kills swimmers every year, often in shallow swimming pools.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;!-- Uncontroversial, but should be referenced --&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has identified a consistent set of voluntary behaviors associated with unintentional drowning, known as dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors; these are intentional hyperventilation, [[static apnea]], and [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology#hypoxic training|hypoxic training]].&lt;ref name="Boyd et al 2015" /&gt;

Other terms generally associated with freediving blackout include:

{{glossary}}
{{term|1=Hyperventilation}}
{{defn|1=Hyperventilation is breathing more gas than is necessary to compensate for metabolic consumption. There is a continuum between normal breathing and hyperventilation: "deep breathing", "cleansing breaths", or "workup breaths" are just different names for hyperventilation.&lt;ref name="McCafferty 2016" /&gt; Some effects of hyperventilation develop early in this process. There is a difference between filling the lungs with a deep breath to maximize available gas just before the dive, versus taking deep breaths in succession; the latter will deplete carbon dioxide, without much effect on oxygen supply.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2006" /&gt; This effect is illustrated in the graphs in section [[#Shallow water blackout|Shallow water blackout]]}}

{{term|1=Recovery breathing}}
{{defn|1=Also known as '''hook breathing'''. This is a technique used by free divers on surfacing to reduce the risk of surface blackout. A partial exhalation is made, followed by a quick inhalation; then the diver closes the airway and pressurises for a few seconds as if about to cough. This behavior is repeated a few times over the first 30 seconds or so on the surface. The aim is to keep thoracic pressure slightly raised to artificially raise arterial oxygen partial pressure or prevent it from dropping in the critical seconds until newly oxygenated blood can reach the brain and thereby prevent surface blackout. This is the same technique used by pilots during high-g maneuvers, as well as by mountaineers at high altitude.&lt;ref name="Krack et al 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soltis" /&gt;}}

{{term|1=Lung packing}}
{{defn|1=Technically known as {{diving term|glossopharyngeal insufflation}}, lung packing or buccal pumping is a technique for inflating the lungs beyond their normal isobaric [[Lung volume|total capacity]], which is used to delay the compression of the lungs at by hydrostatic pressure, allowing a greater depth to be reached, and provide a slightly larger reserve of oxygen for the dive. After full normal inspiration, the diver fills the mouth with air, with the glottis closed, then opens the glottis and forces the air from the mouth into the lung, then closes the glottis to hold in the air. This is repeated several times. Lung packing can increase the volume of air in the lungs by up to 50% of vital capacity. The pressure induced will reduce the volume of blood in the chest, which will increase the space available for air. The gas in the lungs is also compressed. Pressures of about {{convert|75|mmHg|mbar}} have been reported.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006b" /&gt; Lung packing has been associated with short-term haemodynamic instabilities, which might contribute toward triggering blackout.&lt;ref name="Potkin et al 2007" /&gt;}}

{{term|1=Laryngospasm}}
{{defn|1={{main|Laryngospasm}}
Laryngospasm is an involuntary muscular contraction (spasm) of the vocal folds. The condition typically lasts less than 60 seconds, but in some cases may last 20-30 minutes and causes a partial blocking of inspiration of breath, while expiration of breath remains easier. It is a protective reflex against pulmonary aspiration; this reflex may be triggered when the vocal cords or the area of the trachea below the vocal folds detects the entry of water, mucus, blood, or other substance. In conscious subjects, there is some voluntary control, which allows relatively quick recovery of the airway.&lt;ref name="Gavel and Walker 2013" /&gt;

Laryngospasm will relax with increased hypoxia, but the blood oxygen partial pressure at which this will occur is unknown (2006) and is probably variable. Laryngospasm itself is not usually fatal if sufficient oxygen is available when the spasm relaxes.&lt;ref name="Duecker 2006" /&gt;}}
{{glossary end}}

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Oxygen-Haemoglobin dissociation curves.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Oxygen-Haemoglobin dissociation curves]]
The minimum tissue and venous partial pressure of oxygen which will maintain consciousness is about {{convert|20|mmHg|mbar}}.&lt;ref name="Stec and Hull 2010" /&gt; This is equivalent to approximately {{convert|30|mmHg|mbar}} in the lungs.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt; Approximately 46&amp;nbsp;ml/min oxygen is required for brain function. This equates to a minimum arterial ppO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of {{convert|29|mmHg|mbar}} at 868&amp;nbsp;ml/min cerebral flow.&lt;ref name="Stec and Hull 2010" /&gt;

Hyperventilation depletes the blood of carbon dioxide (hypocapnia), which causes respiratory alkylosis (increased pH), and causes a leftward shift in the [[oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve]]. This results in a lower venous partial pressure of oxygen, which worsens hypoxia.&lt;ref name="Stec and Hull 2010" /&gt; A normally ventilated breath-hold usually breaks (from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with over 90% saturation which is far from hypoxia.  Hypoxia produces a respiratory drive but not as strong as the hypercapnic respiratory drive.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2006" /&gt; This has been studied in altitude medicine, where hypoxia occurs without hypercapnia due to the low ambient pressure.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt; The balance between the hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory drives has genetic variability and can be modified by hypoxic training. These variations imply that predictive risk cannot be reliably estimated, but pre-dive hyperventilation carries definite risks.&lt;ref name="Pearn et al 2015" /&gt;

There are three different mechanisms behind blackouts in freediving:&lt;ref name="Johnson 2015" /&gt;

# '''Duration-induced hypoxia''' occurs when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster or hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood which in turn may:
#* increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity thus reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue towards the end of the dive ([[Bohr effect]]), 
#* suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2015" /&gt;
# '''Ischaemic hypoxia''' is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain arising from cerebral vasoconstriction brought on by low carbon dioxide following hyperventilation, or increased pressure on the heart as a consequence of {{diving term|glossopharangeal insufflation}} (lung packing) which can reduce blood circulation in general, or both. If the brain used more oxygen than is available in the blood supply, the cerebral oxygen partial pressure may drop below the level required to sustain consciousness. This type of blackout is likely to occur early in the dive.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNS clinic" /&gt;
# '''Ascent-induced hypoxia''' is caused by a drop in oxygen partial pressure as ambient pressure is reduced on ascent. The oxygen partial pressure at depth, under pressure, may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that depth and not at the reduced pressures in the shallower waters above or at the surface.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNS clinic" /&gt;

The mechanism for blackout on ascent differs from hyperventilation induced hypocapnia expedited blackouts and does not necessarily follow hyperventilation.&lt;ref name=shallow1968/&gt;&lt;ref name=deep1996/&gt; However, hyperventilation will exacerbate the risk and there is no clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following hyperventilation and [[apnoea]] but the effect becomes much more dangerous in the ascent stage of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms ''shallow'' and ''deep'' water blackout and they have been used to refer to different things, or be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Red Cross" /&gt; For the purposes of this article there are two separate phenomena ''Shallow water blackout'' and ''Blackout on ascent'' as follows:

===Shallow water blackout===
[[File:Shallow Water Blackout.jpg|thumb|Staged image showing how victims may black out quietly underwater, often going unnoticed.]]

Otherwise unexplained blackouts underwater have been associated with the practice of [[hyperventilation]].&lt;ref name=Brubakk/&gt;&lt;ref name=dan/&gt;&lt;ref name=shallow1968/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17274316 /&gt; Survivors of shallow water blackouts often report using hyperventilation as a technique to increase the time they can spend underwater. Hyperventilation, or over-breathing, involves breathing faster and/or deeper than the body naturally demands and is often used by divers in the mistaken belief that this will increase oxygen saturation. Although this appears true intuitively, under normal circumstances the breathing rate dictated by the body alone already leads to 98–99% oxygen saturation of the arterial [[blood]] and the effect of over-breathing on the oxygen intake is minor. What is really happening differs from divers' understanding; these divers are extending their dive by postponing the body's natural breathing mechanism, not by increasing oxygen load.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;  The mechanism is as follows:

The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels in the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=pmid17274316/&gt; Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized and it needs to be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing.&lt;ref name=pmid17274316/&gt; Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called [[hypocapnia]]. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allowing the delay of breathing and leaving the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. For most healthy people, the first sign of low oxygen levels is a [[greyout]] or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;

Significantly, victims drown quietly underwater without alerting anyone to the fact that there is a problem and are typically found on the bottom as shown in the staged image at the right. Survivors of shallow water blackout are typically puzzled as to why they blacked out. Pool lifesavers are trained to scan the bottom for the situation shown.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Breath-hold divers who hyperventilate before a dive increase their risk of drowning.  Many drownings unattributed to any other cause result from shallow water blackout and could be avoided if this mechanism was properly understood and the practice eliminated. Shallow water blackout can be avoided by ensuring that carbon dioxide levels in the body are normally balanced prior to diving and that appropriate safety measures are in place.&lt;ref name="Boyd et al 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane 2017" /&gt;

A high level of hypocapnia is readily identifiable as it causes dizziness and tingling of the fingers. These extreme symptoms are caused by the increase of blood pH ([[alkalosis]]) following the reduction of carbon dioxide, which is required to maintain the acidity of the blood. The absence of any symptoms of hypocapnia is not an indication that the diver’s carbon dioxide is within safe limits and cannot be taken as an indication that it is therefore safe to dive. Conservative breath-hold divers who hyperventilate but stop doing so before the onset of these symptoms are likely to be already hypocapnic without knowing it.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2006" /&gt;

Note that the urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood and not by the reduction of oxygen.  The body can actually detect low levels of oxygen but this is not normally perceptible prior to blackout.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;  Persistently elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, [[hypercapnia]] (the opposite to [[hypocapnia]]), tend to desensitise the body to carbon dioxide, in which case the body may come to rely on the oxygen level in the blood to maintain respiratory drive. This is illustrated in the scenario of type II [[respiratory failure]]. However, in a normal healthy person there is no subjective awareness of low oxygen levels.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2006" /&gt;

===Ascent blackout {{anchor|Blackout on ascent}}===
[[File:Diver about to surface (seen from below).jpg|right|thumb|Latent hypoxia hits on ascent]]

An ascent blackout, or deep water blackout, is a loss of consciousness caused by [[cerebral hypoxia]] on ascending from a deep freedive or breath-hold dive, typically of ten metres or more when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to breathe and has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it.&lt;ref name=Brubakk /&gt;&lt;ref name=dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=deep1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;  Victims typically black out close to the surface, usually within the top three metres, sometimes even as they break surface and have often been seen to approach the surface without apparent distress only to sink away.  It is quite rare for blackouts to occur while at the bottom or in the early stages of ascent; divers who [[drown]] in these stages are usually found to have inhaled water, indicating that they were conscious and succumbed to an uncontrollable urge to breathe rather than blacking out.  Victims are usually established practitioners of deep breath-hold diving, are fit, strong swimmers and have not experienced problems before. Blackout by this mechanism may occur even after surfacing from depth and breathing has commenced if the inhaled oxygen has not yet reached the brain and may be referred to as a '''surface blackout'''.&lt;ref name="Lane 2017" /&gt;

The partial pressure of oxygen in the air in the lungs controls the oxygen loading of blood. A critical pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of {{convert|30|mmHg|mbar}} in the lungs will sustain consciousness when breathing is resumed after a breath-hold dive. This is about 4% oxygen in the lungs and 45% oxygen saturation of the arterial blood. At 30&amp;nbsp;msw (4 bar), 2% by volume oxygen in the lung gas gives a pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of {{convert|60|mmHg|mbar}}. At 10&amp;nbsp;msw (2 bar), for the same 2% oxygen, the pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be {{convert|30|mmHg|mbar}}, i.e. marginal. At the surface the same 2% oxygen drops to {{convert|15|mmHg|mbar}}, ignoring metabolic use.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt;

Three factors are thought to be involved: Voluntary suppression of breathing and rapid depressurisation are necessarily present, and self-induced hypocapnia by hyperventilation is known to be present in many cases. Depressurisation on ascent is an explanation for the shallow depth of ascent blackouts but does not fully explain all cases unless accompanied by an underlying suppression of the urge to breathe through self-induced hypocapnia via hyperventilation.
#'''Voluntary suppression of breathing.'''  Deep water blackout is sometimes attributed simply to the practiced diver’s ability through training to suppress the urge to breathe.  If surviving divers are aware that they have heavily suppressed the urge to breathe towards the end of the dive there is a tendency to look no further for an explanation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  However, there are two problems with this as an explanation:  
## Even with a high level of training the hypercapnic urge to breathe is almost impossible to overcome; swimmers typically suffer an uncontrollable, violent, deep inhalation of water even when, intellectually, they know that to do so is fatal. This is a simple case of running out of air and [[drowning]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Victims of ascent blackout, if they have any water in the lungs at all will have a limited amount in the [[bronchi]] consistent with natural ingress after death.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;!-- Uncontroversial, but should be referenced --&gt;
## Victims of deep water blackout closely observed from both below and above water do not exhibit the signs of distress associated with an uncontrollable urge to breathe and those that have survived a blackout report no such distress.  Many blackout events have been closely observed and even filmed because deep dynamic apnoea dives are a competitive event and very deep dives require a considerable support crew both above and below water.  Anecdotal accounts of healthy divers holding their breath to the point of unconsciousness without hyperventilation are difficult to substantiate and the ability, if it exists, is certainly extremely rare.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
#'''Rapid depressurisation.'''  Because ascent blackout occurs as the diver approaches the surface from a deep dive, depressurisation is clearly present. Consciousness depends on a minimum [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in the brain not on the absolute quantity of the gas in the system.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt; At the surface, the air in the lungs is under 1 atmosphere of pressure; at 10 metres, the water pressure doubles the pressure of air in the lungs to 2 atmospheres.&lt;ref name="NOAA Diving Manual 1979" /&gt;  Recreational breath-hold dives can often go below 20 metres, competitive divers can go much deeper, and the "No limits" [[free-diving|free-dive record]] exceeds 200 metres since 2007.&lt;ref name="AIDA Records" /&gt; Ten metres is easily achievable by a reasonably fit and competent swimmer.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Most people lose consciousness when the partial pressure of oxygen in their lungs, normally {{convert|105|mmHg|mbar}} falls below about {{convert|30|mmHg|mbar}}.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt; A ppO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of {{convert|45|mmHg|mbar}} at ten metres will be tolerable to the diver while at that depth, but is likely to result in a blackout between four metres and the surface when the ambient pressure reduction brings the partial pressure of oxygen below the limit.  S.Miles termed this latent hypoxia.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;  Although quite comfortable at the bottom the diver may actually be trapped by latent hypoxia, and unaware that it is now no longer possible to ascend safely, but is likely to black out without warning just as he or she approaches the surface.&lt;ref name="Lindholm 2006" /&gt;
#'''Self-induced hypocapnia.'''  Hyperventilation leading to [[hypocapnia]] and subsequent loss of an appropriate urge to breathe is the mechanism behind shallow water blackout.  Many practitioners of deep water breath-hold diving use hyperventilation with the intention of extending their bottom time, so this mechanism is also relevant to deep water blackouts in those cases.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;!-- Uncontroversial, but should get a reference --&gt; If the diver has hyperventilated, the mechanism is essentially that for shallow water blackout but hypoxia is delayed by pressure at depth and sets in only when the pressure drops while surfacing.  This explains why divers who black out like this do so very close to the surface on their way up and why they may not have felt any urgency to breathe at all; fit, free-divers ascending from deep dives can black out without any warning.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;!-- Uncontroversial, but should get a reference --&gt;

===Surface blackout===
Surface blackout occurs just after the diver exhales on the surface, and may happen before, during or after inhalation of the first breath. When the diver exhales, there is usually a reduction of intrathoracic pressure, which is exacerbated by the effort of inhalation, which can further compromise the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar capillaries, and after a small time lag, the oxygen supply to the brain. The exhalation also reduces the buoyancy of the diver and increases the risk of sinking as a consequence of blackout. The drop in intrathoracic pressure may also reduce cardiac output for this period and thereby further compromise the cerebral oxygen supply.&lt;ref name="Maas 2006" /&gt; The delay between breathing and the oxygenated blood reaching the brain can exceed 15 seconds. Competitive freediving safety monitors watch the diver for at least 30 seconds after surfacing. Recovery breathing may reduce the risk of surface blackout during the critical period after surfacing.&lt;ref name="Krack et al 2006" /&gt;

==Consequences==
{{see also|Drowning#Pathophysiology}}
The usual consequence of blackout, if the diver's airway is not protected, is drowning. A diver who has blacked out and has been promptly returned to the surface will usually regain consciousness within seconds. While the diver is still unconscious underwater, they are at high risk of drowning. The time between loss of consciousness and death varies considerably depending on a number of factors but can be as little as {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes.&lt;ref name="Craig 1976" /&gt;

An unconscious diver loses voluntary bodily control, but still has protective reflexes that protect the airway. One of these is [[laryngospasm]], which closes the [[larynx]] to prevent water from entering the lungs. After some time a laryngospasm will relax and the airway will open. If the diver has reached the surface and the diver's face is kept above water, when the laryngospasm relaxes spontaneous breathing will often resume.&lt;ref name="Etzel 2001" /&gt;

If the diver is still underwater when the laryngospasm relaxes, then water will enter the airway and may reach the lungs, which will cause complications even if resuscitation is successful. [[Secondary drowning]] may occur as a result.&lt;ref name="Etzel 2001" /&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==
The sudden and unexpected death of a swimmer, with no involuntary drowning sequence, can be difficult to ascribe to a specific cause. The possibilities may include pre-existing organic cardiac disease, pre-existing cardiac electrical abnormalities, epilepsy, hypoxic blackout, homicide and suicide. The diagnosis may have significant legal consequences.&lt;ref name="Pearn et al 2015" /&gt;

Careful recording of observed events can improve the chances of correct diagnosis. The victim of hypoxic blackout may have been seen to be hyperventilating before the dive, and typically the blackout will have occurred some time after immersion, often without surfacing, and usually close to the surface. The victim subsequently found unconscious or dead at the bottom of the water. Accounts of witnesses may be useful in diagnosing the cause and in the resuscitation and treatment of survivors.&lt;ref name="Pearn et al 2015" /&gt;

==Risk==
The risk of freediving blackout is not known as there are currently no rigorous data on freediving blackouts. However, the estimated, average, annual fatalities attributed to freediver blackout over a period of ten years in a population of approximately 135,000 divers in nine countries was 53 per year, or one in 2,547.&lt;ref name="Maas 2006" /&gt;  The total number of fatalities appears to have remained unchanged in recent years but it is not possible to calculate the fatality rate because variables such as the number of dives or the diver population are not known.&lt;ref name="Pearn et al 2015" /&gt;
The risk also differs across diving cultures and practices.  For example, approximately 70% of Italian divers who regularly compete in national and international spearfishing competitions have had at least one blackout whereas Japanese [[Ama (diving)|Ama]] divers have a low rate of blackout as they follow a conservative dive profile, limiting dive duration to one minute, resting between dives and making several short dives rather than fewer long ones.&lt;ref name="Maas and Sipperly 1998" /&gt;

Experienced free-divers are at particular risk because of their practiced ability to suppress the carbon dioxide induced urge to breathe. Some argue that the highest risk may be to intermediate skilled divers who are training hard and have not recognised their limits.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas 1997" /&gt;

Where deep breath-hold divers are observed to use hyperventilation timely and informed advice may save their lives but experience suggests that divers are reluctant to change their practice unless they have a very clear understanding of the mechanics of the process.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Management==

===Avoidance and prevention===
Breath-hold divers who hyperventilate before a dive increase their risk of drowning.  Many drownings unattributed to any other cause result from shallow water blackout and could be avoided if this mechanism was properly understood and the practice controlled or eliminated. Increased advocacy to improve public awareness of the risk is one of the few available ways to attempt to reduce the incidence of this problem.&lt;ref name="Pearn et al 2015" /&gt;

Shallow water blackout can be avoided by ensuring that carbon dioxide levels in the body are normally balanced prior to diving and that appropriate safety measures are in place. The following precautions are recommended by several organisations:&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedive safely" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott 2005" /&gt;
# The diver should be weighted to provide positive buoyancy at the surface even after exhalation. Weights should be ditched if in trouble.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedive safely" /&gt;
# Before a dive, the diver should relax and allow blood oxygen and carbon dioxide to reach equilibrium. The diver should breathe normally in preparation for a dive, and allow the normal breathing triggers to dictate the rate of breathing to make sure the carbon dioxide levels are within safe limits. The final pre-dive breath should be to full inspiratory capacity.
# If excited or anxious about the dive, the diver should take extra care to remain calm and breathe naturally as adrenaline ([[epinephrine]]) can cause hyperventilation without the diver noticing.
# When the urge to breathe comes on near the end of the dive, the diver should surface immediately and breathe. {{diving term#hook breathing|Recovery breathing}} should not be necessary, but is unlikely to be harmful.
# Divers should never free dive alone. Diving in buddy pairs, one to observe, one to dive, allows the observer to attempt a rescue in the event of a blackout.&lt;ref name="Freedive safely" /&gt; The safety diver should always be well ventilated and ready to go to the rescue at immediate notice.&lt;ref name="Etzel 2001" /&gt; 
# Dives should be within the depth capability of both divers.&lt;ref name="Freedive safely" /&gt; However, this still relies on the buddy noticing a problem in time, and being able to reach the distressed diver, under the stress of an emergency.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2006" /&gt;
# After surfacing, the condition of the diver should be monitored for at least 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="Freedive safely" /&gt;
# Buddy pairs should both know how to recognize and manage a blackout.&lt;ref name="Freedive safely" /&gt;

A high level of hypocapnia is readily recognized as it causes dizziness and tingling of the fingers. These extreme symptoms are caused by the increase of blood pH ([[alkalosis]]) following the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is required to maintain the acidity of the blood. The absence of any symptoms of hypocapnia is not an indication that the diver’s carbon dioxide level is within safe limits and cannot be taken as an indication that it is therefore safe to dive. Conservative breath-hold divers who hyperventilate but stop doing so before the onset of these symptoms are likely to be hypocapnic already without knowing it.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--Uncontroversial but needs reference for GA--&gt;

Outright banning of hyperventilation and breath-hold training at swimming pools may reduce or prevent instances of blackout at those pools, but may result in the activity being done at other places where there may be less supervision and a higher risk of fatality. Supervision by a person not involved in the activity and familiar with the risks and management of blackouts is a preferred option.&lt;ref name="Lane 2017" /&gt;

An analysis of incidents suggests that lifeguards at swimming pools could prevent most accidents by watching out for young male swimmers who are practicing hyperventilation and underwater swimming.&lt;ref name="Craig 1976" /&gt;

===Recognition===
Recognition of the problem in time to help is critical; the diver will not notice any symptoms and is dependent on a dive buddy or surface support team for recognition.  Indicators of blackout to look for in a diver include:&lt;ref name="Etzel 2001" /&gt;
* Stops swimming for no apparent reason.
* Begins to sink.
* Arms or legs go limp.
* Eyes roll back or close. 
* Head falls forward.
* Body twitches or spasms.

===Rescue===
Rescue requires a competent diver on site to recover the unconscious diver to the surface, or prevent them from sinking in the case of a surface blackout. This requires that the safety diver is aware of the status of the diver in time to react effectively. The unconscious freediver should be brought to the surface with minimum delay. There is no risk of lung over-pressure injury, and the [[airway]] should be secured if possible to prevent aspiration. The mask is adequate protection of the nasal passages if in place, and a hand can be used to cover the mouth and hold it closed.&lt;ref name="Etzel 2001" /&gt;

Once surfaced, ensure an open airway. The mask may be removed at this point. The diver may spontaneously resume breathing. Typical response time after shallow dives is 3 to 10 seconds, increasing to 10 to 30 seconds for deep dives. If the diver starts breathing and regains consciousness spontaneously, they should be continuously monitored until out of the water.&lt;ref name="Etzel 2001" /&gt;

If the diver does not spontaneously resume breathing, [[rescue breathing]] (artificial ventilation) is indicated. The casualty should be removed from the water expeditiously and [[basic life support]] provided until expert assistance is available.&lt;ref name="Etzel 2001" /&gt;

===First aid and medical treatment===
{{see|Drowning#Management}}
When first aid and medical treatment are necessary, it is for [[drowning]].

Initial resuscitation follows the standard procedure for drowning. The checks for responsiveness and breathing are carried out with the person horizontally supine. If unconscious but breathing, the [[recovery position]] is appropriate. If not breathing, rescue ventilation is necessary. Drowning can produce a gasping pattern of apnea while the heart is still beating, and ventilation alone may be sufficient, as the heart may be basically healthy, but hypoxic. The airway-breathing-circulation sequence should be followed, not starting with compressions, as the basic problem is lack of oxygen. Five initial breaths are recommended, as the initial ventilation may be difficult because of water in the airways which can interfere with effective alveolar inflation. Thereafter a sequence of two breaths and 30 [[chest compressions]] is recommended, repeated until vital signs are re-established, the rescuers are unable to continue, or [[advanced life support]] is available.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

Attempts to actively expel water from the airway by abdominal thrusts or positioning head downwards should be avoided as they delay the start of ventilation and increase the risk of vomiting, with a significantly increased risk of death, as aspiration of stomach contents is a common complication of resuscitation efforts. Administration of oxygen at 15 litres per minute by face mask or [[bag mask]] is often sufficient, but [[tracheal intubation]] with [[mechanical ventilation]] may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against the need for oxygenisation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. [[Positive end-expiratory pressure]] will generally improve oxygenation.&lt;ref name="Szpilman et al 2012" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6795">There are many references to '''ghosts in [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]]''' – the religions of [[Sumer]], [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]] and other early states in [[Mesopotamia]]. Traces of these beliefs survive in the later [[Abrahamic religions]] that came to dominate the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The treasures of darkness: a history of Mesopotamian religion
|author=Thorkild Jacobsen |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1978 |ISBN=0-300-02291-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[ghost]]s or spirits in Mesopotamia is comparable to the [[shade (mythology)|shades]] of the deceased in the [[Underworld]] in the mythology of [[classical antiquity]]. The shades or spirits of the deceased were known as ''{{lang|sux|gidim}}'' ({{smallcaps|gidim}} {{script|Xsux|𒄇}}) in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], which was borrowed as ''{{lang|akk|eṭemmu}}'' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. The Sumerian word is analyzed as a compound of either ''gig'' "to be sick" and ''dim''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; "a demon", or ''gi''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; "black" + ''dim''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; "to approach".&lt;ref&gt;John A. Halloran, ''Sumerian Lexicon''  Version 3.0, [http://www.sumerian.org/sumerlex.htm sumerian.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gidim'' were thought to be created at time of death, taking on the memory and personality of the dead person. They traveled to the netherworld, [[Irkalla]], where they were assigned a position, and led an existence similar in some ways to that of the living. Relatives of the dead were expected to make offerings of food and drink to the dead to ease their conditions. If they did not, the ghosts could inflict misfortune and illness on the living. 
Traditional healing practices ascribed a variety of illnesses to the action of ghosts, while others were caused by gods or demons.&lt;ref name=black&gt;{{cite book |title=Gods, demons, and symbols of ancient Mesopotamia: an illustrated dictionary |author1=Jeremy A. Black |author2=Jeremy Black |author3=Anthony Green |author4=Tessa Rickards |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1992 |ISBN=0-292-70794-0}} s.v. "gidim".&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} say the spirit was "inherited from the slain god whose body was used in creating man".{{dubious|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref name=nejat&gt;{{cite book |title=Daily life in ancient Mesopotamia |author=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1998 |ISBN=0-313-29497-6 |pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netherworld==
{{main article|ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Afterlife#Ancient_religions}}
[[File:Queen of the Night (Babylon).jpg|thumb|The [[Burney Relief]] (c. 1792 - 1750 BC), representing an ancient Babylonian goddess, possibly [[Inanna]] or Ereshkigal]]
In Mesopotamian religion, Irkalla, the [[ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]], is ruled by the goddess [[Ereshkigal]] and her consort [[Nergal]] or Ninazu. Ghosts spent some time traveling to the netherworld, often having to overcome obstacles along the way.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; The [[Anunnaki]], the court of the netherworld, welcomed each ghost and received their offerings. The court explained the rules and assigned the ghost his fate or place.

Another court was presided over by the sun god [[Utu]], who visited the netherworlds on his daily round, Shamash might punish ghosts who harassed the living, and might award a share of funerary offerings to forgotten ghosts.&lt;ref name=nejat/&gt;

The Babylonian netherworld was populated by an array of monsters and demons. However, within the netherworld the ghosts existed in a manner similar to the living. They had houses and could meet with deceased family members and associates.&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' revolves around a relationship between the hero-king Gilgamesh and his close companion, [[Enkidu]]. It may loosely refer to a real king of the [[27th century BC]]E. Part of the story relates Enkidu's death, the adventures of his ghost in the underworld, and the eventual return to the world when Gilgamesh breaks a hole in the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dalley, Stephanie, trans. |authorlink=Stephanie Dalley |title=Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=England |year=1991 |isbn=0-19-281789-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction with the living==
The Babylonians believed that life in the underworld could be made more tolerable if the surviving relatives regularly [[veneration of the dead|made offerings of food and drink]]. The ghosts of people without children to make these offerings would suffer more, while people who died in fire or whose body lies in the desert would have no ghost at all. If the relatives failed to make offerings, the ghost could become restless and visit sickness and misfortune on them.&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

Physical ailments resulting from hearing or seeing a ghost included headaches, eye and ear problems, various intestinal pains, shortness of breath and dizziness, fever and neurological and mental disorders. Cures involved ritual performances with use of  offerings, libations, figurines, ritual burial and dispatch, encirclement, amulets, fumigants, bandages, salves, potions, washes, and suppositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=JoAnn Scurlock |title=Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-Induced Illnesses in Ancient Mesopotamia  |publisher=Brill/Styx |year=2006 |ISBN=90-04-12397-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other Mesopotamian diseases were blamed on gods or ghosts, each causing a particular sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/ancient_medicine_mesopotamia_iran.php |title=History of ancient Medicine in Mesopotamia &amp; Iran |author=Massoume Price |date=October 2001 |work=Iran Chamber Society |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blason ville fr Cluses.svg|thumb|300px|right|Arms of the Amboise family.]]
'''Jacques d'Amboise''' (between 1440 and 1450 – 27 December 1516) was a French religious dignitary and patron of medieval France. He was abbot of [[Abbaye de Jumièges|Jumièges]] then of [[Abbaye de Cluny|Cluny]], and [[bishop of Clermont]]. He was a member of the [[House of Amboise]], an old noble family.

==Life==
He was the son of Anne de Bueil and [[Pierre d'Amboise]], lord of [[Chaumont-sur-Loire|Chaumont]], as their seventh of eighteen children. Entering the [[Benedictine]] order he was elected abbot of Jumièges in January 1474, replacing his brother Louis on his appointment as [[bishop of Albi]]. Jacques took his oath of loyalty as abbot on 20 February 1474 and took possession of the abbey on 28 May.

In 1485 he succeeded a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] as abbot of Cluny, rebuilding the Cluny abbots' hôtel in Paris as well as its now-lost chapel and collège. Located beside the Gallo-Roman ruins, the [[hôtel de Cluny]] hosted several royal visits and would be inhabited by cardinal [[Jules Mazarin|Mazarin]] in 1634. He also built the abbatial palace of [[Paray-le-Monial]].

[[Image:ClermontAmboiseBrunnen.jpg|right|300 px|thumb|The fontaine d'Amboise at Clermont-Ferrand]]
The bishopric of Clermont had been left vacant at the end of 1504, and [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] appointed Jacques d'Amboise to it – he held the post from 1505 until his death. He completed the diocese's cathedral and replaced its tiles with a lead roof, as well as richly adding to its library and creating a tapestry in the choir of which four pieces are now in [[St Petersburg]]. In 1515 he built the fountain that bears his arms and name in [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]].

Like his brothers Louis and [[Georges d'Amboise|Georges]], he had a great sense of family : he appointed several of his nephews to church posts, adorned all his works with his family arms in or palé de gules and even inserted prayers for his family name in the eucharistic prayer, when this was actually only allowed to sites of the apostolic college.

'''''I-15''''' was a Japanese [[B1 type submarine]].  She was completed at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure Navy Yard]] on September 30, 1940, whereupon she entered into service with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].  Her first and only commanding officer was Commander Nobuo Ishikawa.  ''I-15'' operated off the north coast of [[Oahu]] during the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|raid on Pearl Harbor]].  Her second wartime patrol, in May and June 1942, took her to the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]], where she conducted reconnaissance of several islands.  ''I-15''{{'}}s third and final patrol took place from August to November 1942, when she operated in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the South Pacific, supporting the Japanese efforts to hold [[Guadalcanal]].  One source (Morison) suggests that ''I-15'' hit the battleship {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|6}} with a torpedo on September 15, 1942.  More recent authorities (Hackett &amp; Kingsepp) maintain that the torpedo came from another submarine operating in the area, {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-19||2}}, which was also responsible for the sinking of {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|6}}, which ''I-15'' duly observed and reported. On November 10, 1942, a U.S. ex-destroyer (modified to a fast minesweeper), {{USS|Southard|DMS-10|6}}, sank ''I-15'' at Cape Recherche, [[Makira|San Cristóbal]], with all hands lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-15.htm | title=Imperial submarines I-15 | publisher=Combinedfleet.com | accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Commander Ishikawa was promoted to the rank of Captain posthumously. On December 14, 1942, more than one month after ''I-15'' was sunk, {{USS|Wahoo|SS-238|6}} sank an unknown submarine which it misidentified as the ''I-15''.{{sfn|O'Kane|1987|pp=96–98}}

'''Johnny D. Bright''' (June 11, 1930 &amp;ndash; December 14, 1983) was a professional [[Canadian football]] player in the [[Canadian Football League]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Drake University]]. He is a member of the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]], the [[National Football Foundation]]'s [[College Football Hall of Fame]], the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Hall of Fame, the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] [[Edmonton Eskimos#Wall of Honour|Wall of Honour]], the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame, and the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'s'' Iowa Sports Hall of Fame.

In 1951, Bright was named a First Team [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]], and was awarded the [[Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Award|Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Sportsmanship Award]]. In 1969, Bright was named Drake University's greatest football player of all time. Bright is the only Drake football player to have his jersey number (No.&amp;nbsp;43) retired by the school, and in June 2006, received honorable mention from ''[[ESPN]].com'' senior writer Ivan Maisel as one of the best college football players to ever wear No.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/newsstory.php?nid=1151679923 |accessdate=2006-07-08 |title=Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized |publisher=DrakeBulldogs.org |date=2006-06-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060711061727/http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/newsstory.php?nid=1151679923 |archivedate = 2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, the football field at [[Drake Stadium (Drake University)|Drake Stadium]], in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa – Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcci.com/sports/7374962/detail.html?rss=des&amp;psp=sports |accessdate=2006-08-12 |title=KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa – Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions |publisher=KCCI.com |date=2006-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307063552/http://www.kcci.com/sports/7374962/detail.html?rss=des&amp;psp=sports |archivedate=2006-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Bright was voted one of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s [[TSN Top 50 CFL Players|Top 50 players]] (No.&amp;nbsp;19) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].&lt;ref name="TSN Top 50 CFL Players"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/feature/?fid=10866 |accessdate=2007-04-28 |title=TSN Top 50 CFL Players |publisher=TSN.ca |date=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his outstanding professional and college football careers, Bright is perhaps best known for his role as the victim of an intentional, most likely racially motivated, on-field assault by an opposing college football player from Oklahoma A&amp;M (now [[Oklahoma State University – Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]]) on October 20, 1951, that was captured in a widely disseminated and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning photo sequence, and eventually came to be known as the "[[Johnny Bright incident]]."

==Early life==
Born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] on June 11, 1930, Bright was the second oldest of five brothers. Bright lived with his  mother and step father Daniel Bates, brothers, Homer Bright, the eldest, Alfred, Milton, and Nate Bates, in a [[working class]], predominantly [[African-American]] neighborhood in Fort Wayne.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett | first=Warrick |quote= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WG8JAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=johnny+bright+champion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FoTlTeSMHMbQiALM-9XkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |title=Johnny Bright, Champion |year=1996 |publisher=toExcel |location= |isbn=978-0-595-09704-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–14, 52}}

Bright was a three-sport ([[High school football|football]], [[High school basketball|basketball]], [[track and field]]) star at Fort Wayne's Central High School.  Bright, who also was an accomplished [[Fastpitch softball|softball]] pitcher and [[Boxing|boxer]], led Central High's football team to a City title in 1945, and helped the basketball team to two state tournament Final Four appearances.&lt;ref name="Go, Johnny, Go:  Johnny Bright could do it all"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwnextweb1.fortwayne.com/ns/sports/top50/bright.php |accessdate=2011-04-25 |author=Sebring, Blake |title=Go, Johnny, Go:  Johnny Bright could do it all |publisher=''Fort Wayne News-Sentinel'' |date=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003221245/http://fwnextweb1.fortwayne.com/ns/sports/top50/bright.php |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of college football career==
Following his graduation from Central High in 1947, Bright initially accepted a football scholarship at [[Michigan State University]], but, apparently unhappy with the direction of the [[Michigan State Spartans football|Spartans football]] program, transferred to [[Drake University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], where he accepted a track and field scholarship that allowed him to try out for the football and [[College basketball|basketball]] squads.&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt;{{rp|52}}&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright, Drake University, 1970"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19700324/SPORTS11/50623029/Johnny-Bright-Drake-University-1970 |accessdate=2011-04-25 |author=Turnbull, Buck |title=Johnny Bright, Drake University, 1970 |publisher=''Des Moines Register'' |date=1970-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121183721/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/19700324/SPORTS11/50623029/Johnny-Bright-Drake-University-1970 |archivedate=2013-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright eventually lettered in [[College football|football]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[College basketball|basketball]], during his collegiate career at Drake.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright, Drake University, 1970"/&gt;

Following a mandatory freshman [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] year, Bright began his collegiate football career in 1949, rushing for 975 yards and throwing for another 975 to lead the nation in total offense during his sophomore year, as the [[Drake Bulldogs football|Drake Bulldogs]] finished their season at 6–2–1.&lt;ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright – Drake's Greatest Football Player"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |accessdate=2006-08-12 |title=2005 Drake Bulldogs Football Media Guide: The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player |publisher=Drake University |year=2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226033209/http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bright's junior year, the [[Running back|halfback]]/[[quarterback]] rushed for 1,232 yards and passed for 1,168 yards, setting an [[NCAA]] record for total offense (2,400 yards) in 1950, and again led the Bulldogs to a 6–2–1 record.&lt;ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright – Drake's Greatest Football Player"/&gt;

Bright's senior year began with great promise. Bright was considered a pre-season [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate, and was leading the nation in both rushing and total offense with 821 and 1,349 yards respectively, when the Drake Bulldogs, winners of their previous five games, faced [[Missouri Valley Conference]] foe [[Oklahoma State Cowboys|Oklahoma A&amp;M]] at Lewis Field (now [[Boone Pickens Stadium]]) in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], on October 20, 1951.

=="Johnny Bright Incident"==
[[File:Johnny Bright Incident.jpg|thumb|left|Johnny Bright Incident – Oct. 21, 1951 ''Des Moines Register'' newspaper cover showing Robinson and Ultang photo sequence&lt;ref name="Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=40&amp;REC=8 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |first=John |last=Robinson |author2=Don Ultang |title=Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14 |publisher=Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') |date=1951-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main|Johnny Bright incident}}
Bright's participation as a halfback/quarterback in Drake's game against Oklahoma A&amp;M on October 20, 1951, was controversial, as it marked the first time that such a prominent [[African-American]] athlete, with national notoriety (Bright was a pre-season [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate and led the nation in total offense going into the game) and of critical importance to the success of his team (Drake was undefeated and carried a five-game winning streak into the contest, due in large part to his rushing and passing), had played against Oklahoma A&amp;M in a home game at [[Lewis Field]], in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]].&lt;ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=26&amp;REC=2 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |author=White, Maury |title=Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14 |publisher=Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') |date=1951-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first seven minutes of the game, Bright had been knocked unconscious three times by blows from Oklahoma A&amp;M [[defensive tackle]] [[Johnny Bright Incident#Wilbanks Smith|Wilbanks Smith]]. While the final, elbow blow from Smith broke Bright's jaw, Bright was able to complete a 61-yard touchdown pass to halfback Jim Pilkington a few plays later before the injury finally forced Bright to leave the game. Bright finished the game with 75 yards (14 yards rushing and 61 yards passing), the first time he had finished a game with less than 100 yards in his three-year collegiate career at Drake. Oklahoma A&amp;M eventually won the game 27-14.&lt;ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14"/&gt;

A photographic sequence by ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' cameramen [[Don Ultang]] and John Robinson clearly showed that Smith's jaw breaking blow to Bright had occurred well after Bright had handed off the ball to [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] Gene Macomber, and that the blow was delivered well behind the play.&lt;ref name="Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14"/&gt;  Years later, Ultang said that he and Robinson were lucky to capture the incident when they did; they'd only planned to stay through the first quarter so they could get the film developed in time for the next day's edition.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/sports/football/27ultang.html "Don Ultang, Pioneer in Aerial Photography, Dies at 91"], ''The New York Times'', September 27, 2008. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been an open secret before the game that A&amp;M was planning to target Bright.  Even though A&amp;M had integrated two years earlier, the [[Jim Crow]] spirit was still very much alive in Stillwater.  Both Oklahoma A&amp;M's student newspaper, ''[[The Daily O'Collegian]]'', and the local newspaper, ''[[NewsPress|The News Press]]'', reported that Bright was a marked man, and several A&amp;M students were openly claiming that Bright "would not be around at the end of the game."  Ultang and Robinson had actually set up their camera after rumors of Bright being targeted became too loud to ignore.&lt;ref name="Schmidly closes door on Johnny Bright disgrace"/&gt;

When it became apparent that neither Oklahoma A&amp;M nor the MVC would take any disciplinary action against Smith, Drake withdrew from the MVC in protest and stayed out until 1956 (though it didn't return for football until 1971).  Fellow member [[Bradley University]] pulled out of the league as well in solidarity with Drake; while it returned for non-football sports in 1955, Bradley never played another down of football in the MVC (it dropped football in 1970).&lt;ref name="1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=37&amp;REC=1 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Moorhead, Jim | title = 1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1964-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Johnny Bright Incident", as it became widely known, eventually provoked changes in [[NCAA]] football rules regarding illegal blocking, and mandated the use of more protective helmets with face guards.&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter: Blow helped clean up sports"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&amp;CISOPTR=36&amp;REC=4 |accessdate=2006-08-12 |author=Hanson, Dave |title=Bright not bitter: Blow helped clean up sports |publisher=Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') |date=1980-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalling the incident without apparent bitterness in a 1980 ''Des Moines Register'' interview three years before his death, Bright commented: "There's no way it couldn't have been racially motivated... . ..What I like about the whole deal now, and what I'm smug enough to say, is that getting a broken jaw has somehow made college athletics better. It made the NCAA take a hard look and clean up some things that were bad."&lt;ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports"/&gt;

==Post-injury and end of college football career==
Bright's jaw injury limited his effectiveness for the remainder of his senior season at Drake, but he finished his college career with 5,983 yards in total offense, averaging better than 236 yards per game in total offense, and scored 384 points in 25 games.&lt;ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright – Drake's Greatest Football Player"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |accessdate=2006-08-12 |title=2005 Drake Bulldogs Football Media Guide: The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player |publisher=Drake University |year=2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226033209/http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a senior, Bright earned 70 percent of the yards Drake gained and scored 70 percent of the [[Drake Bulldogs football|Bulldogs]]' points, despite missing the better part of the final three games of the season.

Following his final football season at Drake (1951), Bright was named a First Team [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]] and finished fifth in the balloting for the 1951 [[Heisman Trophy]].  Bright was also awarded the [[Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Award|Nils V. "Swede" Nelson Sportsmanship Award]], and played in both the post-season [[East–West Shrine Game]] and the [[Hula Bowl]].

In 1969, Bright was named Drake University's greatest football player of all time. He is also the only Drake football player to have his jersey number (No.&amp;nbsp;43) retired by the school.  In June 2006, Bright received honorable mention from ''[[ESPN]].com'' senior writer Ivan Maisel as one of the best college football players to ever wear No.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;ref name="Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized"/&gt;

==Professional football career==
Bright was the first pick of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the first round of the [[1952 NFL Draft|1952 National Football League draft]]. Bright spurned the NFL, electing to play for the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]], the precursor to the [[Canadian Football League West Division|West Division of the Canadian Football League]]. Bright later commented: 

{{quote|I would have been their (the Eagles') first [[African American|Negro]] player. There was a tremendous influx of [[Southern United States|Southern]] players into the NFL at that time, and I didn't know what kind of treatment I could expect.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"&gt;{{cite web |last=Soutar |first=Ted |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_legends_bright |title=CFL Legend: Johnny Bright |publisher=CFL.ca |accessdate=August 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922191450/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_legends_bright |archive-date=2008-09-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bright joined the Calgary Stampeders as a [[fullback (American football)|fullback]]/[[linebacker]] in [[1952 in Canadian football|1952]], leading the Stampeders and the WIFU in rushing with 815 yards his rookie season.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; Bright played fullback/linebacker with the Stampeders for the 1952, [[1953 in Canadian football|1953]], and part of the [[1954 in Canadian football|1954]] seasons. In 1954, the Calgary Stampeders traded him to the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] in mid-season. He would enjoy the most success of his professional football career as a member of the Eskimos.

Though Bright played strictly defense as a linebacker in his first year with the Eskimos, he played both offense (as a fullback) and defense for two seasons ([[1955 in Canadian football|1955]]–[[1956 in Canadian football|1956]]), and played offense permanently after that ([[1957 in Canadian football|1957]]–[[1964 CFL season|1964]]). He, along with teammates [[Rollie Miles]], [[Normie Kwong]], and [[Jackie Parker]], helped lead the Eskimos to successive [[Grey Cup]] titles in [[42nd Grey Cup|1954]], [[43rd Grey Cup|1955]], and [[44th Grey Cup|1956]] (where Bright rushed for a then Grey Cup record of 171 yards in a 50–27 win over the [[Montreal Alouettes]]).&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; In 1957, he rushed for eight consecutive 100-yard games, finishing the season with 1,679 yards. In [[1958 CFL season|1958]], he rushed for 1,722 yards.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; In [[1959 CFL season|1959]], following his third straight season as the Canadian pro rushing leader with 1,340 yards, Bright won the [[CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award]], the first [[African-American]] or [[African-Canadian]] athlete to be so honored.

Bright was approached several times during his Canadian career by NFL teams about playing in the United States, but in the days before the blockbuster salaries of today's NFL players, it was common for CFL players such as him to hold regular jobs in addition to football, and he had already started a [[teacher|teaching]] career in 1957, the year he moved his family to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. 

{{quote|I'd established a home and Canada had been good to me. I might have been interested, if the offers could have matched what I was making from both football and teaching.&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt;}}

Bright retired in [[1964 CFL season|1964]] as the CFL's all-time leading rusher ([[Mike Pringle (football)|Mike Pringle]] and [[George Reed (Canadian football)|George Reed]] have since surpassed him). Bright rushed for 10,909 yards in 13 seasons, had five consecutive 1,000 yard seasons, and led the CFL in rushing four times. While Bright is currently 15th on the All-Pro Rushing list, his career average of 5.5 yards per carry is the highest among 10,000+ yard rushers ([[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r [[Jim Brown]] is second at 5.2 yards per carry).&lt;ref name="CFL Legend: Johnny Bright"/&gt; At the time of his retirement, Bright had a then-CFL record thirty-six 100-plus-yard games, carrying the ball 200 or more times for five straight seasons. Bright led the [[Canadian Football League West Division|CFL Western Conference]] in rushing four times, winning the [[Eddie James Memorial Trophy]] in the process, and was a CFL Western Conference All-Star five straight seasons from [[1957 in Canadian football|1957]] to [[1961 CFL season#CFL All Stars|1961]]. Bright played in 197 consecutive CFL games as a fullback/linebacker. Bright's No.&amp;nbsp;24 jersey was added to the Edmonton Eskimos' [[Edmonton Eskimos#Wall of Honour|Wall of Honour]] at the Eskimos' [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]] in 1983. Bright was inducted into the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] on November 26, 1970.

==Legacy==
Despite irrefutable evidence of the incident, Oklahoma A&amp;M officials denied anything had happened.  Indeed, Oklahoma A&amp;M/State refused to make any further official comment on the incident for over half a century.  This was the case even when Drake's former dean of men, [[Robert B. Kamm]], became president of OSU in 1966; years later, he said that the determination to gloss over the affair was so strong that he knew he could not even discuss it.  Finally, on September 28, 2005, Oklahoma State President [[David J. Schmidly]] wrote a letter to Drake President [[David Maxwell (academic)|David Maxwell]] formally apologizing for the incident, calling it "an ugly mark on Oklahoma State University and college football." The apology came twenty-two years after Bright's death.&lt;ref name="Schmidly closes door on Johnny Bright disgrace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocolly.com/2005/11/14/schmidly-closes-door-on-johnny-bright-disgrace/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080925022028/http://ocolly.com/2005/11/14/schmidly-closes-door-on-johnny-bright-disgrace/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2008-03-22 |author=Darcy, Bob |title=Schmidly closes door on Johnny Bright disgrace |publisher=Oklahoma State University ''The Daily O'Collegian'' |date=2005-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drake will name field for Bright: Oklahoma State has apologized for a 1951 incident that injured the football player"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060223/SPORTS020402/602230404/1001/NEWS |accessdate=2006-08-12 |author=Witosky, Tom |title=Drake will name field for Bright: Oklahoma State has apologized for a 1951 incident that injured the football player |work=Des Moines Register |date=2006-02-23 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lee S. Tillotson was born on December 8, 1874 in [[Bakersfield, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;Vermont, Vital Records, 1720-1908, birth entry for Lee S. Tillotson, retrieved December 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Tillotson attended local schools, and graduated from Brigham Academy in 1890. He then joined the [[Central Vermont Railway]] in [[St. Albans (city), Vermont|St. Albans]], working as a clerk in its main office from 1890 to 1899.&lt;ref&gt;The Tyler-Keystone magazine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aSznAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=tillotson+%22brigham+academy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7MV48h2omU&amp;sig=1RbnRd-_HX_h_RrUccTeXMS7QwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B_6cUsqiGZHNsQSH2oH4DA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tillotson%20%22brigham%20academy%22&amp;f=false Craft Movement in Vermont], October 20, 1909, pages 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical activities==
During his life Tillotson continued to pursue his musical interests. He sang in and directed choirs in St. Albans, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], and also served as Treasurer of the [[Handel and Haydn Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sandusky Star-Journal'', "Elaborate Holy Week Programs to be Broadcast by NBC Chains," March 31, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, ''Successful Vermonters'', pages 319–321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Start of legal career==
[[File:Lee S. Tillotson 1.jpg|thumb|Tillotson as a captain in 1907.]]
Following the Spanish–American War Tillotson resigned from the Central Vermont Railroad to pursue legal studies. He attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1902 and began a practice in St. Albans.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Nelson Marquis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5jk1AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1068&amp;dq=%22tillotson+lee+stephen%22+admitted+bar+1902&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcadUvfLA7W-sQS9soC4DA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tillotson%20lee%20stephen%22%20admitted%20bar%201902&amp;f=false ''Who's Who in New England''], 1915, page 1068&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Tillotson served as Judge of the St. Albans Municipal Court from 1904 to 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Auditor of Accounts, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wQcrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22lee+s+tillotson%22+judge+st.+albans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-MadUriMJdDMsQT-lYCYAw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lee%20s%20tillotson%22%20judge%20st.%20albans&amp;f=false Biennial report], 1908, page 60&lt;/ref&gt; Tillotson was also involved in other business and government activities, including serving as a member of the board of directors for the [[gas lighting]] company in St. Albans and a member of the Vermont Commission on [[Probation]].&lt;ref&gt;National Probation Association, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uOVMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22lee+s+tillotson%22+probation+commission&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dMedUtC6DK7gsASW-IDADw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lee%20s%20tillotson%22%20probation%20commission&amp;f=false Yearbook], Volume 8, 1916, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Public Service Commission, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u94SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA794&amp;dq=%22lee+s+tillotson%22+gaslight&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yMedUsb7PLawsAT0poC4Bw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lee%20s%20tillotson%22%20gaslight&amp;f=false Biennial Report], Volume 13, 1912, page 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjutant General==
In 1910 Tillotson was appointed Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard with the rank of brigadier general, filling the position following the death of [[William H.

Haraty, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=4cidUujxHZPNsQTExYGIBA&amp;id=H8UDAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22lee+s+tillotson%22+adjutant+general+gilmore&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22lee+s+tillotson%22  Put the Vermonters Ahead: A History of the Vermont National Guard, 1764-1978], 1978, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;  Tillotson’s appointment was a generational break, because he was the first Vermont Adjutant General since the [[American Civil War]] who was not a veteran of that conflict.
Tillotson won reelection every two years, and continued to serve as Adjutant General until the start of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Vermont General Assembly, [http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/gov/govinaug/farewells/pdf/Graham1919.pdf Farewell address of Governor Horace F. Graham], 1919, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; (Since 1865 the Adjutant General is selected for a two-year term by a secret ballot of the Vermont General Assembly.

Upon returning to the United States, Tillotson served as assistant adjutant of [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Camp Meade]], [[Maryland]], responsible for out processing and discharging soldiers returning from the war.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Adjutant General, The World War Roster, 1919, page 1274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Phillips Gibbons, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CcoLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA410&amp;dq=tillotson+%2293rd+division%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J_2VUrG6ELjNsQT15YGgDQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tillotson%20%2293rd%20division%22&amp;f=false And They Thought We Wouldn't Fight], 1918, page 410&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-World War I==
Tillotson returned to Vermont in 1919 and ran unsuccessfully for the adjutant general’s position, losing to [[Herbert Thomas Johnson|Herbert T. Johnson]], who had acted as adjutant general during Tillotson’s wartime service.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'', "Loses Office on Return from War," January 24, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Tillotson then continued his service in the regular Army.

He also authored [https://archive.org/stream/ancientcraftmas00tillgoog#page/n6/mode/2up ''History of Ancient Craft Masonry in Vermont''] and ''Digest of Masonic Law in Vermont''.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Richard Cutter]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=NdAUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1643&amp;dq=tillotson+vermont+%22grand+master%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QNWdUtPGMOqssQSZyIDwAw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=tillotson%20vermont%20%22grand%20master%22&amp;f=false New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial], Volume 3, 1914, page 1643&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Tillotson returned to Vermont after retiring from the army.  Initially he resided in [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield]] and practiced law with [[Alban J. Parker]], who went on to serve as [[Vermont Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Vermont Bar Association, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

He later lived in retirement, first in [[Northfield, Vermont|Northfield]], and later in [[Newfane, Vermont|Newfane]]. Tillotson remained active, including serving on Newfane's [[Board of Selectmen]] and authoring numerous articles on American history and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Tillotson Ragsdale, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LmAbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=tillotson,+lee+s+newfane+selectman&amp;dq=tillotson,+lee+s+newfane+selectman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vRyfUuu6A5HIsATt6YKYCg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA Tillotson, Tillison, and Tillitson: Descendants of John Tillotson, Immigrant to the American Colonies from the West Riding, Yorkshire, England], Volume 1, 1998, page 773&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
Tillotson died at the hospital in [[Townshend, Vermont]] on July 18, 1957, as the result of complications from a fall that left him with a fractured hip.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Death Records, 1909-2008, entry for Lee Stephen Tillotson, retrieved December 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in Newfane’s Parish Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Findagrave|14614777}}, retrieved December 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Headstone Applications for Military Veterans, 1925-1963, entry for Lee Stephen Tillotson, retrieved December 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michel Guimond''' (December 26, 1953 – January 19, 2015) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician. From 1987 to 1993 he served as a city councillor in [[Boischatel, Quebec]]. After this, he ran in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]] for the [[Bloc Québécois]]. He was elected into the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as the member from [[Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans]]. He was re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal elections]] (in the riding of [[Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans]]) and in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] (in the riding of [[Charlevoix—Montmorency]]). In the 2004 and 2008 elections, he won in [[Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord]] before being defeated in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]]. A lawyer, he has served as the Bloc critic of Parliamentary Affairs, Transport and to the Auditor General. He then served as whip and deputy whip of the Bloc Québécois, and was also the vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.

In the [[Quebec general election, 2014|2014 provincial election]], he ran unsuccessfully for the [[Parti Québécois]] to represent the riding of [[Montmorency (provincial electoral district)|Montmorency]].

Guimond died of heart failure on January 19, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/michel-guimond-ex-bloc-mp-dies-of-heart-failure-at-61-1.2918085|title=Michel Guimond, ex-Bloc MP, dies of heart failure at 61|publisher=cbc.ca|date=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhammad III''' was the third [[Layzanshah]] (king of [[Layzan]], r. 917-948) and the seventh [[Shirvanshah]] (king of [[Shirvan]], r. 948-956). He was the son of [[Abu Tahir Yazid]].

== Biography ==
Muhammad III is first mentioned in 917, when he was appointed as the ruler of Layzan and [[Tabasaransky District|Tabarsaran]] by his father Abu Tahir ibn Yazid. When Muhammad's father died in 948, he succeeded him as the ruler of Shirvan, and appointed his son [[Ahmad of Shirvan|Ahmad]] as the ruler of Layzan, while his other son Haytham ibn Muhammad was appointed as the ruler of Tabarsaran.{{sfn|Minorsky|1958|p=28}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=246}} From 948 to 956, Muhammad constantly raided the territories of the non-Muslims, who are called "[[infidel]]s" in Muslim sources.

On 4 June 956, Muhammad died of [[small-pox]]. However, according to another source, he was poisoned by his ''[[vizier]]'' [[Ibn al-Maraghi]]. The reason for that was because, when Muhammad was suffering from small-pox, Ibn al-Maraghi used the opportunity to kill the imprisoned brother of Muhammad and had his body hidden. When Muhammad miraculously survived the illness, he ordered the release of his brother. Ibn al-Maraghi, who feared that his life was in danger, had Muhammad poisoned.{{sfn|Minorsky|1958|p=28}} [[Ahmad of Shirvan|Ahmad]] then succeeded Muhammad as the ruler of Shirvan.

'''Multiple Layered Plasmonics''' use electronically responsive media to change and manipulate the [[Plasmonic metamaterials|plasmonic properties]] of [[plasmon]]s. The properties typically being manipulated can include the directed scattering of light and light absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6030/702|title=Photodetection with Active Optical Antennas|first1=Mark W.|last1=Knight|first2=Heidar|last2=Sobhani|first3=Peter|last3=Nordlander|first4=Naomi J.|last4=Halas|date=6 May 2011|journal=Science|volume=332|issue=6030|pages=702–704|via=www.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.1203056|pmid=21551059|bibcode=2011Sci...332..702K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Orientation-Preserving Transfer and Directional Light Scattering from Individual Light-Bending Nanoparticles|first1=Yu|last1=Zhang|first2=Aoune|last2=Barhoumi|first3=J.

Under these new manipulations, such as multiple layers that respond to different resonant frequencies, their new functions were designed to accomplish multiple objectives in a single application.

== Overview ==
This article provides an overview of current developing medical usage of multiple layered plasmonics, more specifically those developed by the Halas Group at Rice University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halas.rice.edu|title=Halas Research Group|website=halas.rice.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the bio-medical applications purposed, several other uses will be briefly described below.

==Bio-medical Applications==
Gold shelled nanoparticles, which are spherical nanoparticles with silica cores and gold shells, are used in cancer therapy and bio imaging enhancement.
[[Predictive Medicine|Theranostic probes]] – capable of detection and treatment of cancer in a single treatment - are [[nanoparticle]]s that have binding sites on their shell that allow them to attach to a desired location (typically cancerous cells) then can be imaged through [[Preclinical imaging|dual modality imagery]] (an imaging strategy that uses x-rays and [[Nuclear medicine|radionuclide imaging]]) and through near-infrared fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/smll.200800405 | pmid=18819167 | volume=4 | issue=10 | title=Nanoscale Control of Near-Infrared Fluorescence Enhancement Using Au Nanoshells | journal=Small | pages=1716–1722 | last1 = Bardhan | first1 = Rizia| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason gold nanoparticles are used is due to their vivid optical properties which are controlled by their size, geometry, and their surface plasmons. Gold nanoparticles (such as AuNPs) have the benefit of being biocompatible and the flexibility to have multiple different molecules and fundamental materials, attached to their shell (almost anything that can normally be attached to gold can be attached to the gold nano-shell, helping in identifying and treating cancer). The treatment of cancer is possible only because of the scattering and absorption that occurs for [[Surface plasmon|plasmonics]]. Under scattering, the gold plated nanoparticles become visible to imaging processes that are tuned to the correct wavelength which is dependent upon the size and geometry of the particles. Under absorption, [[Photothermal therapy|photothermal ablation]] occurs, which heats the nanoparticles and their immediate surroundings to temperatures capable of killing the surrounding cells. Additionally, these nanoparticles can be made to release antisense DNA oligonucleotides when under photo-activation. These oligonucleotides are used in conjunction with the photo-thermal ablation treatments to perform gene-therapy. This is accomplished because nanoparticle complexes are delivered inside of cells then undergo light induced release of DNA from their surface. This will allow for the internal manipulation of a cell and provide a means for monitoring a group cells return to equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Theranostic Nanoshells: From Probe Design to Imaging and Treatment of Cancer|first1=Rizia|last1=Bardhan|first2=Surbhi|last2=Lal|first3=Amit|last3=Joshi|first4=Naomi J.|last4=Halas|date=18 October 2011|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=44|issue=10|pages=936–946|doi=10.1021/ar200023x|pmid=21612199|pmc=3888233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of multiple layered plasmonics involves placing drugs inside of the nanoparticle and using it as a vehicle to deliver toxic drugs to cancerous sites only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061115085736.htm|title=Nanoparticles Used To Target Brain Cancer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by coating the outside of a nanoparticle with iron oxide (allowing for easy tracking with an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI machine]]) then once the area of the tumor is coated with the drug filled nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be activated using resonant light waves to release the drug.

==Other Applications==

Multiple layered plasmonics can be coated in nanoparticles to modify or drive a reaction near a metallic surface when properly excited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Light-Induced Release of DNA from Gold Nanoparticles: Nanoshells and Nanorods|first1=Ryan|last1=Huschka|first2=Jorge|last2=Zuloaga|first3=Mark W.|last3=Knight|first4=Lisa V.|last4=Brown|first5=Peter|last5=Nordlander|first6=Naomi J.|last6=Halas|date=10 August 2011|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=133|issue=31|pages=12247–12255|doi=10.1021/ja204578e|pmid=21736347|pmc=4108302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the scattering of light from these plasmonics can be controlled and even directed based on the surface particles, geometry, and size.

===Energy Applications===
Multiple layered plasmonics can be used in harvesting solar radiation for energy applications. This is accomplished by redirecting incident light into the waveguide and evanescent surface modes of thin film photovoltaic devices.
 
Using multiple layered plasmons to purify water is also being investigated.

The '''murder of Francesca Bimpson''' occurred on 2 December 2008 in the [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton]] district of [[Liverpool]]. Shortly after midnight, the Bimpson family's home was set on fire in what investigators determined to be [[arson]]. Francesca's mother, father, brother, and two sisters were able to escape from the burning home, but three-year-old Francesca was trapped in a bedroom and later rescued by [[firefighter]]s. She died in a hospital on 23 December.&lt;ref name=Echo20090107&gt;{{cite news|last=Traynor|first=Luke|title=Francesca Bimpson: Her final terrifying moments|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2009/01/07/francesca-bimpson-her-final-terrifying-moments-100252-22628967/|accessdate=13 February 2012|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|date=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities later arrested Graham Heaps in conjunction with the arson, alleging that the arson was an act of retaliation against the family after Francesca's aunt ended a romantic relationship with him between 4–5 months earlier.&lt;ref name=LDP20091208&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffiths|first=Chloe|title=Arsonist Graham Heaps convicted of murdering Liverpool 3-year-old Francesca Bimpson |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/12/08/arsonist-graham-heaps-convicted-of-murdering-liverpool-3-year-old-francesca-bimpson-92534-25342836/2/|accessdate=2012-02-13|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 7 December 2009 Heaps was [[conviction|convicted]] of Francesca Bimpson's murder and [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to [[life imprisonment]]. He will be eligible for parole after serving 28 years.

'''Philip Ambrose Lawrence''', [[Queen's Gallantry Medal|QGM]] (21 August 1947 — 8 December 1995) was a school headmaster who was stabbed to death outside the gates of his school in London, England, when he went to the aid of a pupil who was being attacked by a gang.

==Biography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Lawrence was born in [[Dublin]], Ireland, the son of a retired [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] [[colonel]], and brought up in [[County Wicklow]]. He attended [[Ampleforth College]] and won an [[exhibitioner|exhibition]] to read English at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], being awarded his BA in 1969 and his MA in 1970.

In the 1970s, he taught English at [[St Benedict's School, Ealing|St. Benedict's School]] at [[Ealing Abbey]], a Roman Catholic [[independent school (UK)|independent school]]. On 10 February 1973, he married Frances Huntley, a fellow teacher at the school; they had three daughters and a son.

Lawrence later became the Head of English at [[Gunnersbury Boys' School]] in [[Brentford]], Deputy Headmaster at St. Mark's R.C. School, [[Hounslow]], and later was named Headmaster of the [[Dick Sheppard School]], a [[Lambeth]] [[comprehensive school]]. In 1993, he was appointed headmaster of [[St. George's Roman Catholic School]], [[Maida Vale]], regarded as a troubled school with poor exam results. He improved the academic reputation of the school, but problems with violence continued - often occurring when pupils were targeted by people from outside the school.

==Murder==
The [[Wo Shing Wo]] gang, which was mainly [[Filipino people|Filipino]], aspired to be a junior version of the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]]. Twelve of the gang's members, led by 15-year-old Learco Chindamo,&lt;!-- [[Learco Chindamo]] redirects to this article --&gt; who was a pupil at [[Quintin Kynaston Community Academy|another school]] and claimed to be a Triad member, went to St. George's school on 8 December 1995, to "punish" 13-year-old [[black people|black]] pupil William Njoh, who had earlier quarrelled with a Filipino pupil. Lawrence saw them attack the boy with an iron bar and went outside to remonstrate with the gang. Chindamo punched Lawrence, then stabbed him in the chest; he died in hospital that evening. Chindamo was convicted of murder at the [[Old Bailey]] in October 1996, after a unanimous decision by the jury, and jailed indefinitely (as he was a juvenile at the time). The trial judge recommended that a minimum of 12 years should be served.&lt;ref name="n1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6955071.stm Lawrence killer to remain in UK], BBC News, 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chindamo had for years claimed that he was the victim of mistaken identity, and that the real killer was another boy who had borrowed his jacket, although he does not deny that he was present. During the trial it was shown that Chindamo's claim of links to Chinese Triad society was untruthful. On 10 October 1997, he lost his appeal. He was also a suspect in the non-fatal stabbing of a man named John Mills during a [[robbery|mugging]] in [[Camden Town|Camden]] several months before Lawrence's murder. Chindamo was born in [[Italy]] to a father from Italy and a mother from the [[Philippines]]. Chindamo and his mother moved to the UK when he was six.&lt;ref name="Tel cleared"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8719964/Philip-Lawrence-killer-cleared-of-street-robbery.html Philip Lawrence killer cleared of street robbery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The case increased the level of concern expressed about levels of violence involving school-age youths, and the safety of pupils and staff while in school, which were beginning to become public issues in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s. This followed the fatal stabbing of 12-year-old Nikki Conroy by a mentally ill intruder at her [[Middlesbrough]] school in March 1994. Just three months after the murder of Philip Lawrence, 16 young children and their teacher were [[Dunblane school massacre|shot dead]] by intruder Thomas Hamilton at their school in [[Dunblane]], [[Scotland]]. Shortly afterwards, nursery nurse Lisa Potts and several toddlers were wounded by machete-welding intruder Horrett Campbell at a nursery school in [[Wolverhampton]]. These incidents all contributed to major improvements in security at schools across Britain, particularly in areas with high crime rates.

Philip Lawrence was posthumously awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]] (QGM) on 14 June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?webType=0&amp;PageDuplicate=b%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;issueNumber=54795&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;SearchFor=george%20medal&amp;selMedalType=&amp;selHonourType= ''London Gazette''], 13 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Philip Lawrence Awards]]'' were instituted by the then [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]] in Lawrence's honour, and were first presented on 15 March 1997. They honour outstanding achievement by young people aged between 11 and 20. Lawrence's widow Frances was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 2009 [[Birthday Honours]] for services to charity, for her role in setting up the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59090|date=13 June 2009|page=19 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chindamo deportation controversy==
In August 2007, an [[Asylum and Immigration Tribunal]] ruled that Chindamo could not be [[deportation|deported]] to his home country of [[Italy]] on completion of his prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6958638.stm Q&amp;A: Chindamo deportation case], BBC News, 22 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He had resided in the UK for 19 years, long enough to make him a permanent resident under EU law after discounting 10 years spent in jail. As such, only 'serious grounds of...public security' could justify his expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Free Movement Directive, 2004/38/EC, Articles 16 and 28(2) (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal disagreed with the Home Office's argument that this threshold was reached in Chindamo's case. The tribunal found that even if the EU law argument had failed, he would have a right to stay under human rights law. In the exceptional circumstances of his having lived in England since age 6, an Article 8 right to "family life" was found in relation to his mother and siblings.&lt;ref name="ukhumanrightsblog.com"&gt;http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/11/29/failure-to-deport-philip-lawrence-killer-was-not-about-human-rights/&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was severely criticised by Frances Lawrence, Philip Lawrence's widow.&lt;ref name="n1"/&gt; [[David Cameron]], as leader of the opposition, argued that the case showed the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] 'has to go' and be replaced by a "British Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1560975/David-Cameron-Scrap-the-Human-Rights-Act.html David Cameron: Scrap the Human Rights Act], 24 August 2007, ''Daily Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
In July 2010, after a parole board recommended his release, Chindamo made a statement saying "I did a terrible thing when I killed Mr Lawrence... I have been rightly punished and I have always understood that I should not be released until I had changed and was no longer dangerous... I know that some people will not be able to accept that I have changed or that I should be allowed my freedom. I also know that I will spend the rest of my life atoning for my crime, and mean to do so by living quietly and decently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/08/philip-lawrence-killer-release |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Adam | last=Gabbatt | title=Philip Lawrence murderer plans 'quiet, decent' life after release | date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was freed shortly afterwards, after serving 14 years of his life sentence.

On 24 November 2010, just four months after being paroled, Chindamo was arrested in [[Catford]] and detained by police for questioning in connection with a mugging. He is alleged to have threatened to kill a man before robbing him of a wallet and mobile phone in Camden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Lawrence's killer held over alleged robbery|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/24/philip-lawrence-learco-chindamo|publisher=Press Association|date=24 November 2010|accessdate=24 November 2010|location=London|first=David|last=Batty}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his arrest and remand in custody Chindamo was recalled to custody under the terms of the life licence which comes with his original life sentence. On 24 August 2011, Chindamo and his two co-defendants were acquitted of robbery. He remained in custody under the terms of his life license as he was adjudged to present a risk. On 2 May 2014, the Parole Board announced its approval of Chindamo's re-release from custody after serving three-and-a-half years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/01/learco-chindamo-philip-lawrence-released-prison&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yaseen Ege''' was a seven-year-old Asian Muslim boy killed by his mother, Sara Ege, at their home in [[Cardiff]] in the [[United Kingdom]] on 12 July, 2010,&lt;ref name="bbctrial"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-17916367 | title=Yaseen Ali Ege death: Yaseen Ali Ege murder trial: Sara Ege 'beat son to death' | publisher=BBC | accessdate=January 18, 2017 | date=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for failing to memorise the [[Quran]]. In the months preceding his death, Yaseen was routinely beaten. On the day he died, Yaseen had severe abdominal injuries and multiple fractures. Ms. Ege burnt her son's body in an attempt to destroy the evidence and was later arrested and convicted of murder, for which she received a [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|life sentence]].&lt;ref name="devoted"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9785714/Devoted-mother-beat-son-to-death-for-failing-to-learn-Koran.html | title=Devoted' mother beat son to death for failing to learn Koran | publisher=Telegraph | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Alleyne | date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-20920649 | title=Sara Ege: Life jail for son's murder over Koran studies | publisher=BBC | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/objview.asp?Object_ID=24724 | title=A Serious Case Review | publisher=Cardiff Local Safeguarding Children Board | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prolonged abuse==

Yaseen's parents wanted him to become a [[Hafiz (Quran)|hafiz]] to increase the family's standing in the local community,&lt;ref name="honour"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-20415188 | title=Yaseen Ali Ege death: Mother beat son for 'slow' Koran study | publisher=BBC | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his mother became frustrated with her son's inability to memorise the Quran.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/07/mother-beating-son-death-quran | title=Mother jailed for beating son to death for failing to memorise Qur'an | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | location=London | first=Steven | last=Morris | date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2258444/Mother-jailed-minimum-17-years-beating-seven-year-old-son-death-stick-recite-Koran.html | title='This was a dreadful crime': Judge blasts mother as he jails her for life for beating son, 7, to death over Koran recitals | publisher=Daily Mail | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | location=London | first=Luke | last=Salkeld | date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For three months before his death, Yaseen was repeatedly beaten&lt;ref name="devoted"/&gt; and suffered numerous internal injuries due to his mother's frustration.&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.ca.msn.com/world/uk-jails-mom-for-killing-son-over-qur%E2%80%99an-study | title=UK jails mom for killing son over Qur’an study | publisher=MSN | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ege told police officers, "I was getting more and more frustrated. If he didn’t read it properly I would be very angry – I would hit him."&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;  Yaseen was allegedly locked in a shed and tied to a door as punishment for failing at his studies.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;  After Yaseen started school, teachers became concerned about his well-being.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; One teacher observed that Yaseen's handwriting was untidy and that he was using his left hand rather than his right one. Yaseen explained that his hand hurt because his mother had struck him with a ruler.&lt;ref name="teacher"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-20221023 | title=Yaseen Ali Ege death: Son told teacher his mother Sara hit him | publisher=BBC | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

On the day of his death, Sara kept her son home from school to focus on memorizing the Quran. She was angry at his lack of progress and attacked him.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;  Yaseen collapsed but continued to murmur extracts of the Quran.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} His mother undressed him, gave him some milk, and then dragged him to his bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2012-11-14/jury-hears-confession-from-mother-accused-of-killing-her-son/ | title=Yaseen Ali Ege trial: Jury hears confession from mother accused of killing her son | publisher=ITV | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother said he was repeatedly muttering the same verse and she thought he was just tired and left him. She returned to the room a few minutes later and found Yaseen convulsing on the floor before dying soon after.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

After Yaseen's death, Ms. Ege used barbecue gel to burn her son's body to destroy the evidence and set fire to the family home.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; It was initially thought that Yaseen had died in the blaze but investigations proved he had died several hours earlier.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Pathologists discovered that Yaseen had broken ribs, a fractured arm and a fractured finger among other injuries, and lighter fuel was found on Ms. Ege's clothing.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

==Trial==

Ms. Ege said that she had hit Yaseen "with a stick on his back like a dog" but also said that her husband, Yousef, was a violent person who had beaten her and her son and was responsible for Yaseen's death. She said her husband had threatened to kill her if she did not accept responsibility.&lt;ref name="devoted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Her husband was cleared of allowing his son’s death by failing to act to prevent the abuse.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Sara was found guilty of murder and perverting the course of justice at Cardiff Crown Court and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 17 years.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

==Domestic violence reports==

The case review by Cardiff's safeguarding children board found that in 2003, concerns regarding domestic violence were raised to a women's safety unit, though these were not reported to the police or children's services.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-20936911 | title=Sara Ege: Domestic violence reports as far back as 2003 says case review | publisher=BBC | accessdate=January 8, 2013 | date=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further reports of domestic violence were made in 2007. Although that several agencies had tried to support the mother, those efforts were "not part of a co-ordinated
plan."&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/objview.asp?Object_ID=24725 | title=Statement regarding the Publication of a Serious Case Review Summary by Cardiff Local Safeguarding Children Board | publisher=Cardiff Local Safeguarding Children Board | accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review made a number of recommendations that were accepted by the Cardiff safeguarding children board.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

'''Myron Brinig''' (December 22, 1896 – May 13, 1991) was a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]]-American author who wrote twenty-one novels from 1929 to 1958.&lt;ref name="Ganz"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Brinig was born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] to [[Romania]]n parents, but grew up in [[Butte, Montana]].&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harry Redcay Warfel|title=American novelists of today|publisher=American Book Co.|year=1951|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZgoGAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=American+novelists+of+today&amp;q=rumanian+parents}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brinig began studying at [[New York University]] in 1914, where poet [[Joyce Kilmer]] gave him lectures on writing.&lt;ref name="Ganz"/&gt; He then studied at [[Columbia University]] and started his career by writing short stories for magazines.&lt;ref name="Flint"/&gt; Brinig's first novel, ''Madonna Without Child'', was released in 1929.&lt;ref name="Ganz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/brinig_m,2.html |title=Brinig, Myron (1896-1991) |last=Ganz |first=Earl |date=February 5, 2008 |publisher=glbtq |accessdate=2009-10-14 |location=Chicago |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705132629/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/brinig_m%2C2.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], the novel tells the story of a woman who is obsessed with another woman's baby.&lt;ref name="Ganz"/&gt;

===Career===
Many of Brinig's early novels depicted the settlement and development of Montana, the state he grew up in. These novels include ''Singermann'' (1929), ''Wide Open Town'' (1931), ''This Man Is My Brother'' (1932), and ''The Sun Sets in the West'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Flint"/&gt; Brinig based the main character of these novels, Singermann, on his father, Maurice Brinig, who was a Romanian immigrant and [[shopkeeper]].&lt;ref name="Flint"/&gt; Brinig's novels often depicted miners, labor organizers, farmers, and businessmen living in Montana.&lt;ref name="Mabel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palken Rudnick|first=Lois|title=Mabel Dodge Luhan: New Woman, New Worlds|publisher=UNM Press|year=1987|page=302|isbn=978-0-8263-0995-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LXrhbNxlL4C&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=%22Myron+Brinig%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Myron%20Brinig%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These usually became bestsellers in the United States and were praised by critics of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; One of the best-selling novels, ''The Sisters'', was adapted to [[The Sisters (1938 film)|a feature-length film]] in 1938, starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Errol Flynn]].&lt;ref name="Flint"/&gt;

Brinig's novels often dealt with homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Ganz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganz|first=Earl|title=The Taos Truth Game|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year= 2007|isbn=978-0-8263-3772-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=Lost Gay Novels|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-1-56023-414-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Dj1cA_vkV4C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22Myron+Brinig%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Myron%20Brinig%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a common theme for Brinig because he was a homosexual himself (although he was publicly [[closeted]] all his life).&lt;ref name="Ganz"/&gt; According to the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Literary Heritage]], Brinig was the "first American Jewish novelist to write in any significant way about the gay experience."&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3491/is_4_13/ai_n29323372/|title=Desert salon|last=E.

In 1951, ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' said Brinig's "sentimental streak and his sympathetic touch with characters usually lend his books a warm glow of humanity, if not of art."&lt;ref name="Flint"/&gt; At the beginning of his career, Brinig was praised by critics for his "artistry and inventivenss in narrative, character and incident."&lt;ref name="Flint"/&gt; In the early 1930s, he was described as one of the leading young writers in America.&lt;ref name="Mabel"/&gt; Brinig's last novels, however, were met with mixed reviews from critics, who criticized them for their "verbosity and banality."&lt;ref name="Flint"/&gt; Brinig died on May 13, 1991. The cause of his death was [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name="Flint"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/15/obituaries/myron-brinig-94-novelist-noted-for-works-on-montana-s-infancy.html|title=Myron Brinig, 94, Novelist Noted For Works on Montana's Infancy|last=Flint|first=Peter|date=May 15, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=D25|accessdate=2009-10-14|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathaniel Woodhull "Nat" Hicks''' (April 19, 1845 &amp;ndash; April 21, 1907) was an [[Americans|American]] professional [[baseball]] player. He played as a [[catcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] for six seasons, two in the [[National League]].&lt;ref name="retrosheet"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nat Hicks' Stats | work = retrosheet.org | url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/H/Phickn101.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks was one of the first catchers to stand directly behind the batter, which allowed future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher, [[Candy Cummings]] to develop the first [[curveball]] used in baseball.&lt;ref name=Catcher&gt;{{cite book |title=Catcher: How the Man Behind the Plate Became an American Folk Hero |last=Morris |first=Peter |year=2010 |publisher=Government Institutes |isbn=1-5666-3870-4 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86P2pteOc40C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=catcher%20peter%20morris&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=catcher%20peter%20morris&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sabr.org/research/evolution-catchers-equipment |title=The Evolution of Catcher’s Equipment |publisher=sabr.org |accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular and highly regarded player during his time in baseball, but injuries sustained over the course of his career cut his playing time short.&lt;ref name="1907times"&gt;{{cite news| title = Behind The Bat With Nat Hicks | work = The New York Times, May 12, 1907 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05EEDE1539E733A25751C1A9639C946697D6CF | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | date=1907-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]], Hicks served briefly in the 15th New York Infantry Regiment near the end of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Catcher/&gt; He began playing [[professional baseball]] in the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] through {{Baseball year|1871}}, most notably for the [[Eckford of Brooklyn]]. Hicks' pivotal role in the development of the curveball is seldom mentioned.&lt;ref name=Catcher/&gt; Most catchers of his era stood twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter, which made it impossible to field a curveball.&lt;ref name=Catcher/&gt; It was Hicks' catching technique of standing directly behind the batter, that allowed Cummings to introduce his curveball.&lt;ref name=Catcher/&gt; The introduction of the curveball not only caused a revolutionary change in the way catchers fielded their position, but also radically changed pitching as well.&lt;ref name=Catcher/&gt;

He later moved on and spent most of his career playing in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]]. He joined the New York Mutuals in {{Baseball year|1872}} where he was reunited with Cummings, and became their everyday catcher. He [[batting average|batted]] .306 that season as the Mutuals finished third.&lt;ref name="1872mutuals"&gt;{{cite web| title = 1872 New York Mutuals team page | work = baseball-reference.com | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYU/1872.shtml | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks returned with the Mutuals in {{Baseball year|1873}}, but that season saw his skills decline significantly both in the field and at the bat. He played in only 28 [[games played|games]] and shared the catching duties that season with [[Dick Higham]] and [[Doug Allison]].&lt;ref name="1873mutuals"&gt;{{cite web| title = 1873 New York Mutuals team page | work = baseball-reference.com | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYU/1873.shtml | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 1873, [[Bob Ferguson (infielder)|Bob Ferguson]] of the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]] was the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in a game between the [[New York Mutuals]] and the [[Baltimore Canaries]] which ended with the Mutuals scoring 3 runs in the bottom of the 9th [[inning]] for an 11-10 victory. Ferguson and the Mutuals' Hicks got into a verbal altercation which ended with Ferguson breaking Hicks' arm by hitting him with a bat. Ferguson required a police escort to leave the field and Hicks was out of action for 2 months.&lt;ref name="19cplayers"&gt;{{cite web| title = 19th Century Baseball: Bob Ferguson | work = 19cbaseball.com | url=http://www.19cbaseball.com/players-bob-ferguson.html | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hicks changed teams in {{Baseball year|1874}}, joining the [[Philadelphia White Stockings]] where he was once again reunited with Cummings, and enjoyed a bounce back season, batting .274, and caught every game the team played.&lt;ref name="1874whites"&gt;{{cite web| title = 1874 Philadelphia White Stockings team page | work = baseball-reference.com | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PHI/1874.shtml | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the mutuals in {{Baseball year|1875}} when he was named the [[player-manager]], the only stint as a [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in his career.&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nat Hicks' Managerial Stats | work = baseball-reference.com | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/hicksna01.shtml | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some dispute with this notion, as other baseball references have him as player-manager for the White Stockings the previous year as well,&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt; instead of [[Bill Craver]].&lt;ref name="1874whites"/&gt; When the Association folded, the Mutuals and Hicks moved over to the newly formed National League in {{Baseball year|1876}}, and then finished his career with the [[Cincinnati Reds (1876–80)|Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt;

==Post-career==
After his baseball days were over, he became a professional singer and proprietor of a billiard academy.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Dead Ball Era: Heading Home | work = thedeadballera.com | url=http://www.thedeadballera.com/HeadingHome.html | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cummings went on to become enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame, Hicks' role in the development of the curveball is rarely mentioned.&lt;ref name=Catcher/&gt; Hicks died in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] at the age of 62 of accidental gas [[asphyxia]]tion in a [[hotel]] room,&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Dead Ball Era: Accidents | work = thedeadballera.com | url=http://www.thedeadballera.com/accidents.html | accessdate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interred in St. Peter Cemetery in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="retrosheet"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33077">A '''nuptial gift''' is often referred to as a token that is presented to a female by a male in order to copulate. This definition, however, is not wrong, but not completely correct. Nuptial gifting is at the intersection of sexual selection, nutritional ecology and life history theory, creating a link between the three.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lewis|first=Sara|title=The Evolution of Animal Nuptial Gifts|date=2012|work=Advances in the Study of Behavior|pages=53–97|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780123942883|last2=South|first2=Adam|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-394288-3.00002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuptial gifts are both widespread and diverse. An accurate definition of a nuptial gift would be a material presentation to a recipient by a donor that is not simply the gametes in order to improve the fitness of the donor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;This definition insinuates neutral gifts, costly gifts and beneficial gifts regarding the fitness of the recipient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;It also encompasses hermaphrodite nuptial gift exchange where the gift giving is often bidirectional as well as encompassing female to male gift giving.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis, South|first=SM, A|date=2012|title=The evolution of animal nuptial gifts|url=|journal=Advanced Behaviour|volume=44|pages=53–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inedible tokens may include items such as a fragment of leaf or twig, a seed tuft, or a silk balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Current Biology |year=2008 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=64–67 |title= An Invasion of Cheats: The Evolution of Worthless Nuptial Gifts |author1=LeBas, Natasha R. |author2=Hockham, Leon R. |last-author-amp=yes | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.043 |pmid= 15649367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many species of animals, including birds, insects, and spiders, this takes the form of a food item that is transferred from a male to a female just prior to copulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=John |authorlink=John Alcock (behavioral ecologist) |title=Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach |edition=9th |url=http://www.sinauer.com/detail.php?id=2252 |accessdate=April 25, 2012|page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Ethology|behaviour]] known as '''courtship feeding'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lack, D.|year=1940| title= Courtship feeding in birds| journal= Auk |volume=57|pages=169–178|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v057n02/p0169-p0178.pdf|doi=10.2307/4078744|issue=2|jstor=4078744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ornitologia Neotropical|volume=18|pages=311–312| year=2007| title=A Greater Ani (''Crotophaga major'') gives a nuptial gift while copulating|author=Logue, DM|url=http://www.ibiologia.unam.mx/links/neo/revista/Volumenes%2018-19/18-2/ON%20%2818%29%20311-312.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nuptial gifts vary but can mostly classified within two main dimensions:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Dimension 1: How gifts are taken by recipients&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
There are three ways in which a gift may be received. The first being an oral gift, which is absorbed through the digestive system of the recipient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The second is genital gifts; the gift is absorbed through the reproductive tract.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, there are transdermal gifts which are injected into the body wall of the recipient by the donor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Dimension 2: Gifting based on source&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
There are two types of gifts; endogenous gifts and exogenous gifts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Endogenous gifts are those that are made by the donor. These gifts often carry great cost to the donor and usually contain hemolymph or body parts. For instance, endogenous oral gifts are secreted by the donors glands (salivary, reproductive, etc).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They often carry nutrients that are severally lacking in the body of the recipient, these include types of macronutrients, micronutrients, water and defensive chemicals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study was done on the moth ''[[Utetheisa ornatrix]],'' where the male gifted the female with defensive alkaloids in order to reduce predation of the larvae and eggs of the female, an excellent example of defensive chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisner|first=T.|last2=Meinwald|first2=J.|date=1995-01-03|title=The chemistry of sexual selection|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/92/1/50|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=92|issue=1|pages=50–55|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.1.50|issn=0027-8424|pmid=7816847|pmc=42815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are some of the gifts that are presented to females not nutritionally based, but they can actually affect the fitness of the recipient. For instance, in some [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[Land snail|land snails]], one partner (the donor) shoots a mucus covered dart at the other called a [[love dart]] (the recipient).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koene|first=JM|date=2005|title=Shooting darts: co- evolution and counter-adaptation in hermaphroditic snails|url=|journal=BMC Evol. Biol.|volume=5|pages=25|via=|pmid=15799778|pmc=1080126|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-5-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately increases the fitness of the donor but at a great risk to the recipient. This dart changes the sperm storage ability of the receiver, not to mention the risk of injury from the dart itself. If shot in the incorrect place, the dart could puncture vital organs of the receiver resulting in permanent reproductive ability damage or death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Exogenous gifts are food items that the donor would capture or collect in order to present to the recipient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These can include seeds, prey items and leaves but can also include non-nutritive things as well like rocks.&lt;ref name="Worthless" /&gt; Gifts such as these increase the chances of the donors mating success and the duration of copulation.&lt;ref name="Worthless" /&gt;

Nuptial gifts can also be classified into oral and seminal gifts.&lt;ref name="gwynne"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Sexual Conﬂict over Nuptial Gifts in Insects|url=http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/gwynne/reprints/Gwynne2008AnnRevEnt.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=53|pages=83–101|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.53.103106.093423|pmid=17680720|author=Gwynee, Darry T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seminal gifts may be tokens that do not have any direct value as food but may serve as an indicator of male fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=An Invasion of Cheats: The Evolution of Worthless Nuptial Gifts Current Biology|url=http://www.alternativetactics.org/lebas_files/LeBas%20Current%20Biology%202005.pdf|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=64–67|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.043|pmid=15649367|author1=LeBas, NR|author2=Hockham LR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=The function of nuptial feeding in insects: A review of empirical studies|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=73|pages=43–78|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1997.tb00025.x|author=Vahed, K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis et al"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=South|first2=A.|last3=Burns|first3=R.|last4=Al-Wathiqui|first4=N.|year=2011|title=Nuptial gifts|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/lewis/publications/documents/2011NuptialGifts.pdf|journal=Current Biology|volume=21|issue=17|pages=R644–R645|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.05.046|pmid=21920290|last1=Lewis|first1=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species of insects such as [[katydids]], the nuptial gift is packaged with the sperm of the male. The package is an edible [[spermatophore]]. These extra nutrients in the sperm are assimilated by the female and are thought to enhance the fitness of the offspring produced, thus increasing the probability that a male passes on its genes.

== Occurrence ==
Nuptial gifts are common in insects and other invertebrates, such as [[butterflies]], [[Ceratitis capitata|fruit flies]] and [[katydid]]s. They are less common in [[spider]]s, though the spider species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'' is known for nuptial gift giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Line Spinner |last=Hansen |first2=Sofia Fernández |last2=Gonzáles |first3=Søren |last3=Toft |first4=Trine |last4=Bilde |year=2008 |title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis'' |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=546–551 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may in part be due to an experimental bias due to the ease of rearing it for experiments.&lt;ref name ="prokop" /&gt;  Other taxa may commonly exhibit gift-giving behavior. Thus, more research is required to evaluate the scope of nuptial gifts in arachnid taxa. In many species of insects, birds and mammals, males acquire and donate food to females either before, during, or after copulation (termed '''mate provisioning''', courtship feeding, nuptial gift giving, or meat-for-sex). Males may relinquish body parts, produce glandular secretions, or share prey or other food to gain fitness benefits via natural and sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Animal Behaviour |year=2004 |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=603–614 |title= A conceptual framework for nonkin food sharing: timing and currency of benefits|author1=Stevens, Jeffrey  R.  |author2=Gilby, Ian C. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtship feeding is particularly common among many bird species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Courtship Feeding in Birds |first=David |last=Lack |journal=The Auk |volume=57 |date=April 1940 |pages=169–178 |jstor=4078744 |issue=2 |doi=10.2307/4078744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role Reversal ==

A popular and more occurring area of study is the male presenting the nuptial gift to the female, however, the reverse does occur. Female Zeus bugs, ''Phoreticovelia disparata,'' actually present the male with a food item before copulation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnqvist|first=Goran|date=July 2003|title=Reversal of sex roles in nuptial feeding|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/424387a|journal=Nature|volume=424|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the food item is presented to the male, he will ride on the back of the female in a small hallow. As he rides on her back she secretes a wax from a gland on the back of her head.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The male will ride on the back of the female for up to a week, eating the wax feed she secretes; she is able to secrete this wax until the male decides to leave&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnqvist|first=Göran|last2=Jones|first2=Therésa M.|last3=Elgar|first3=Mark A.|date=July 2003|title=Reversal of sex roles in nuptial feeding|journal=Nature|volume=424|issue=6947|pages=387|doi=10.1038/424387a|pmid=12879056|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Once the sperm is finally deposited, it will allow the female to lay fertile eggs for up to two weeks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At first, it appeared that there were no obvious advantages to the female in this scenario, upon closer inspection scientists believe that by allowing the male to remain, it is energetically efficient for the female.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She saves energy. She does not have to fight off the male, or any other male that attempts to copulate with her, she is guaranteed the ability to reproduce, it also greatly reduces the risk of harming herself in combat.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Vertebrates ==

=== Great grey shrike ===
{{anchor|Great Grey Shrike}}
The male [[great grey shrike]], a raptor-like passerine bird, gives prey ([[rodents]], [[birds]], [[lizards]], or large [[insects]]) to females immediately before copulation. Shrikes are well known for impaling prey on thorns and sharp sprigs. Great grey shrike females select a mate according to the size of prey impaled, with larders thus serving as an [[extended phenotype]] of a male. If the amount of food stored by the males can drive female mate choice, food provided by males before copulation may also influence the female's decision to copulate. This applies both to the male's own partner and to other females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Animal Behaviour  |year=2005 |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=529–533 |title= Do males of the great grey shrike, ''Lanius excubitor'', trade food for extrapair copulations?|author1=Tryjanowski, Piotr  |author2=Hromada, Martin |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.06.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invertebrates ==

=== Arachnids ===
[[File:Pisaura mirabilis on Plantago lanceolata.jpg|thumb|''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'' on ''[[Plantago lanceolata]]'' inflorescence]]

==== ''Pisaura mirabilis'' ====

In spiders, nuptial gifts in the form of prey are restricted to a few species from two families belonging to the superfamily [[Lycosoidea]]: [[Nursery web spider|Pisauridae]] and [[Trechaleidae]]. In both families, the male courts the female by offering a prey wrapped in silk and mating occurs while the female consumes the gift. In the species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'' (Pisauridae), the gift functions as a mating effort that increases male mating success. The nuptial gift consists of a prey the male has caught and wrapped up in silk. The male offers this gift during courtship, and if the female accepts the invitation, she grabs the wrapped prey. While the female is eating, the male inserts the mating organ, and sperm is transferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Behavioral Ecology |year=2001 |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=691–697 |title= Nuptial gift in the spider Pisaura mirabilis maintained by sexual selection |author=Stålhandske, Pia  |doi= 10.1093/beheco/12.6.691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar function was recently suggested for the trechaleid spider, ''Paratrechalea ornata''. In both species, males can obtain mating without a gift, but male mating success increases dramatically when a gift is offered. In ''Pisaura mirabilis'', the male pushes up the female during mating and performs alternate pedipalp insertions into the female sperm storage organs place ventrally on the abdomen. After each insertion the male returns to a face-to-face position with the female, grabbing the gift in the chelicerae. Females often control mating duration and they often attempt to run away with the gift upon terminating the copulation.&lt;ref name=Worthless&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-329|title=Worthless donations: Male deception and female counter play in a nuptial gift-giving spider|year=2011|last1=Albo|first1=Maria J|last2=Winther|first2=Gudrun|last3=Tuni|first3=Cristina|last4=Toft|first4=Søren|last5=Bilde|first5=Trine|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=11|pages=329|pmid=22082300|pmc=3228764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females are less likely to succeed in stealing a wrapped – rather than an unwrapped – gift due to the silk wrapping of the gift. The silk wrapping facilitates male handling and control over the gift, as it facilitates a stronger hold of the silk covered package versus an unwrapped insect. Male spiders have a unique opportunity for gift manipulation through the gift wrapping trait, for example by preventing female assessment of the gift content. By disguising the gift content, males may deceive females to copulate, while the female attempts to consume the gift. In ''Paratrechalea ornata'', males were observed wrapping prey carrion and occasionally inedible items such as plant seeds. In ''Pisaura  mirabilis'', males have been reported to carry gifts containing empty arthropod exoskeletons or plant parts: gifts of no nutritional value.&lt;ref name=Worthless/&gt; However, some studies have shown that male spiders rarely cheat in nature.&lt;ref name ="prokop"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prokop|first1=P|last2=Maxwell|first2=MR|title=Gift carrying in the spider Pisaura mirabilis: nuptial gift contents in nature and effects on male running speed and fighting success.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2012|volume=83|issue=6|pages=1395–1399|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cogent reasons for this disparate behavior are being explored. It is possible there are confounding factors which do not account for ecological implications. Other research suggests that sensory bias is not the main contributing force behind gift selection in ''P. mirabilis''. Females did not preferentially select unwrapped gifts over wrapped gifts.&lt;ref name ="ghislandi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghislandi|first1=PG|last2=Albo|first2=MJ|last3=Tuni|first3=C|last4=Bilde|first4=T|title=Evolution of deceit by worthless donations in a nuptial gift-giving spider.|journal=Current Zoology|date=2014|volume=60|issue=1|pages=43–51|doi=10.1093/czoolo/60.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Paratrechalea ornata'' ====

Nuptial gift behavior has been seen in the spider species ''Paratrechalea ornata'', a [[Neotropical]] spider belonging to the [[Trechaleidae]] spider family. ''Paratrechalea ornata'' males may present either a wrapped or an unwrapped nuptial prey gift. Prey wrapping seems to be triggered by perception of cues on the female's silk and increases in frequency according to the male's age.&lt;ref name="Worthless" /&gt;

=== Decorated crickets ===

In decorated crickets, ''[[Gryllodes sigillatus]]'' (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), the nuptial food gift is a [[spermatophylax]] (a large, gelatinous, sperm-free mass) that surrounds a smaller, sperm-containing ampulla. Together, the spermatophylax and the ampulla constitute the male’s [[spermatophore]], which is transferred to the female during copulation and remains attached outside her body at the base of her ovipositor. After mating, the female detaches the spermatophylax from the ampulla and feeds on it while the ampulla remains attached and is emptied of sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Animal Behaviour  |year=2012 |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=369–375 |title= Glycine in nuptial food gifts of decorated crickets decreases female sexual receptivity when ingested, but not when injected|author1=Gordon, Darcy G. |author2=Gershman, Susan N. |author3=Sakaluk, Scott K.  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the female has consumed or discarded the spermatophylax, she removes the sperm ampulla, terminating sperm transfer. Female cooperation is required for successful spermatophore transfer, and thus, males cannot impose copulations on females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Phytochemistry
|year=2007 |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=1065–1072 |title= Sequential mate choice in decorated crickets: females use a fixed internal threshold in pre- and postcopulatory choice|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.01.017 |last1= Ivy |first1= Tracie M. |last2= Sakaluk |first2= Scott K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bushcrickets ===

[[Tettigoniidae|Bushcricket]] males offer a spermatophylax containing an ampulla. The nuptial gift is also protein-rich, which the females ingest into their reproductive tract.  The size of the nuptial gifts positively influences the females refractory period and the males reproduction success. The size of the gift depends on the ampulla and serves as a sperm protection. In bushcrickets ''Ephippiger ephippiger'', the females prefer older males, who have larger spermophores and better nutritional value during mating. The nutritional value is related to the female's metabolism, which stands as a benefit for females feeding on the semaphores. Sometimes males produce lower dosages of sperm with a lower nutritional value the fourth time they mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Evolution |year=1993 |volume=47 |issue=4| pages=1203–1212 |title= Spermatophore size in bushcrickets: Comparative evidence for nuptial gifts as a sperm protection device
|author=Wedell, Nina|jstor= 2409986 |doi= 10.2307/2409986 |pmid=28564284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be possible the females are using age and gift quality as a proxy for mates with good genes as their offspring are likely to have high relative fitness.

=== Ornate moth ===

During mating in the [[Utetheisa ornatrix|ornate moth]] (''Utetheisa ornatrix''), males provide the female with a spermatophore containing nutrients, sperm and alkaloids that serve as chemical defense from predators. Such nuptial gift accounts for up to 10% of the male's body weight and represents the total parental investment the male provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iyengar|first1=Vikram K.|last2=Eisner|first2=Thomas |title=Female choice increases offspring fitness in an Arctiid Moth (Utetheisa Ornatrix)|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=1999|volume=96|issue=26|pages=15013–15016|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.26.15013|pmid=10611329|pmc=24764}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Females receive spermatophores from several males and direct a postcopulatory selection process in which they decide what sperm will fertilize their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellya|first1=Caitlin A.|last2=Norbutusb |first2=Amanda J. |last3=Lagalanteb |first3=Anthony F. |last4=Iyengara |first4=Vikram K. |title=Male courtship pheromones as indicators of genetic quality in an arctiid moth (Utetheisa ornatrix)|journal=Behavioral Ecology|year=2012|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1009–1014|doi=10.1093/beheco/ars064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Ostrinia scapulalis'' ===
The males of the species ''[[Ostrinia scapulalis]]'' provides proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and sugars that are included in the spermatophore. This is their nuptial gift to the female. They are known to improve the female's reproductive output. The gifts are provided at a substantial cost to the male. Older males thus tend to produce larger spermatophores with more nuptial gift content since there are less future reproductive episodes possible for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thanda Win |first=Aye|last2=Kojima|first2=Wataru|last3=Ishikawa|first3=Yukio|date=2013-04-01|title=Age-Related Male Reproductive Investment in Courtship Display and Nuptial Gifts in a Moth, Ostrinia scapulalis|journal=Ethology|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=325–334|doi=10.1111/eth.12069|issn=1439-0310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comma butterfly ===
In the comma butterfly (''[[Polygonia c-album]]''), males provide females with nutrients and protein via the nuptial gift to entice the polyandrous females to mate. Females are able to recognize and preferentially mate with males reared on higher-quality host plants as larvae, because they are able to provide superior nuptial gifts with higher protein and spermatophore content. When females mated with males that could provide larger investments, they were seen to not only allocate more resources to their egg production, but also to themselves in the form of female life expectancy, female maintenance, and future reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wedell|first=Nina|date=1996|title=Mate Quality Affects Reproductive Effort in a Paternally Investing Species|jstor=2463563|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=148|issue=6|pages=1075–1088|doi=10.1086/285972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rocky Mountain parnassian ===

Nuptial gifts can be given by butterflies such as the ''[[Parnassius smintheus]]'', consisting of the male depositing a waxy genital plug onto the tip of the female butterfly's abdomen during copulation.&lt;ref name="butterflybook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepard|first1=Jon|last2=Guppy|first2=Crispin|title=Butterflies of British Columbia: Including Western Alberta, Southern Yukon, the Alaska Panhandle, Washington, Northern Oregon, Northern Idaho, and Northwestern Montana|date=2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774844376|url=https://books.google.com/?id=il6rJ7glHNQC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=parnassius+smintheus+sphragis#v=onepage&amp;q=parnassius%20smintheus&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 November 2017|ref=butterfly book|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains sperm and important nutrients for the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=parnassius smintheus|url=http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/bio/insects/butrfly/fampap/pasm.htm|website=imnh.isu.edu|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also ensures that the male is the only one to fertilize the female’s eggs, as it prevents the female from mating again.&lt;ref name="butterflybook" /&gt;

=== Six-spot burnet ===

[[File:Zygaena filipendula 240503.jpg|thumb|[[Six-spot burnet]]]]
Nuptial gifts are widespread in insects such as the [[six-spot burnet]] (''Zygaena filipendulae''), and comprise food items or glandular products offered as paternal investment in offspring and/or to promote mating. Female Zygaena may use this gift for her own defense and to protect her eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Animal Behaviour  |year=2011 |volume=72 |issue=13 |pages=1585–1592 |title= Cyanogenic glucosides in the biological warfare between plants and insects: The Burnet moth-Birdsfoot trefoil model system|author1=Zagrobelny, Mika |author2=Birger, Lindberg Møller |last-author-amp=yes | doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2011.02.023|pmid=21429539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scorpionfly ===

[[File:Panorpa communis with prey Diogma glabrata glabrata.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scorpionfly]] with prey]]
In the scorpionfly ''[[Panorpa cognata]]'', males offer a salivary secretion as a nuptial gift before copulation. Exchange of the salivary secretion takes place after prolonged courtship interactions. The nuptial gift is more likely to be accepted by the female if premating duration is long. Males in poor condition with a limited supply of saliva may deliberately delay initiating copulations to decrease the probability that their costly gift is rejected and, thus, wasted. Males in good condition with ample mating resources, on the other hand, may afford the risk of wasting a salivary mass and therefore take every opportunity to mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Animal Behaviour |year=2009 |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=491–497 |title= Should I stay or should I go?

== Evolution, costs and benefits ==
Male sperm offers many nutrients to increase a female's lifetime and egg production. These nutrients include acids or sodium. Male sperm also protects females and their eggs from predators. The females would also gain a net benefit from a male's sperm. Female recipients are supposed to produce bigger offspring than those females who did not receive nuptial gifts. The eggs of female spiders who receive nuptial gifts may hatch at a higher rate than those without nuptial gifts.&lt;ref name ="ghislandi" /&gt; Historically, nuptial gifts were seen as nutritional substances given to females from males during mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Albo | first1 = M. A. J. | last2 = Costa | first2 = F. G. | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.01.018 | title = Nuptial gift-giving behaviour and male mating effort in the Neotropical spider ''Paratrechalea ornata'' (Trechaleidae) | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 1031 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://web.mnstate.edu/wisenden/Paper%208%20Spider%20nuptial%20gifts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male benefits from a net fitness. Although the gifts are costly to find or produce, the gifts will increase attraction and copulation with other females. One of the more recently identified costs to males is reduced running speed due to gift-carrying.&lt;ref name ="prokop" /&gt; This cost may be exacerbated in areas of high predation. Nuptial gifts can benefit a male by increasing his paternity share when females are promiscuous. In some insects, nuptial gifts allow the male to copulate longer and transfer more sperm to the female.&lt;ref name=gwynne/&gt; In fruit flies, katydids, and [[scorpion flies]], nuptial gifts contain substances that reduce a female’s receptivity to additional matings. While nuptial gifts also may boost female fecundity, from a male’s perspective, such investment will only be beneficial if it increases the number of his own offspring.&lt;ref name="Lewis et al"/&gt; In bell crickets, nuptial gifts may be necessary to avoid injury or death by cannibalizing females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuriwada|first1=T|last2=Kasuya|first2=E|title=Nuptial gifts protect male bell crickets from female aggressive behavior|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2012|volume=23|issue=2|pages=302–306|doi=10.1093/beheco/arr186}}&lt;/ref&gt; This additional benefit allows gift-giving males to surpass the fitness of other males. In this way, females are exploiting the inherent sexual dimorphism of their species.

In species where males provide females with a nuptial gift during mating, there is a particular scope for males to manipulate females to acquire matings and prolong copulation to enhance their fertilization success. Typically, females control the duration and volume of sperm transfer throughout the mating process. Research has suggested that the gifts presented by males temporarily obstruct the female's capacity to manage the copulation event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakaluk|first1=SK|title=Sensory exploitation as an evolutionary origin to nuptial food gifts in insects.|journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B|date=2000|volume=267|issue=1441|pages=339–343|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1006|pmid=10722214|pmc=1690542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female choice for males with nuptial gifts could lead to the evolution of male deception by the use of token gifts. For instance, males can decrease the costs of mating by re-using gifts or by offering worthless gifts. Males of some dance flies may deceive females by offering inadequate or false gifts. Although males that offer inedible gifts run a higher risk of being rejected and may suffer from shorter mating periods compared to males offering edible gifts the chance of acquiring an extra mating should make deception an attractive strategy for males. Hence, males of the dance fly Rhamphomyia sulcata that use inedible token gifts to obtain mates are as successful as males offering small genuine gifts.&lt;ref name=Worthless/&gt;

When nuptial gifts are given it increases copulations and searches to find females to mate with. Albo and Costa conducted an experiment with ''Paratrechala ornata'' spiders to determine the function of the nuptial gift. Two groups of males were exposed to virgin females, 23 males with no nuptial gift (prey) and 21 males with a nuptial gift (prey). Mating ovulation were recorded and the researchers found that males that gave a nuptial gift had better mating success, longer copulations, and longer palpal insertions than those who did not give an nuptial gift. Longer copulations were associated with earlier egg sac construction and oviposition. The researchers' findings suggest that nuptial gift giving represents male mating effort for ''P. ornata''. Nuptial gifts would allow males to control copulation duration and to accelerate female oviposition, improving sperm supply and paternity, and minimizing possible costs of remating with polyandrous individuals.&lt;ref name=Worthless/&gt; Additionally, Prokop found that female mate choice is dependent on nuptial gifts rather than female reproductive status as an unmated or mated individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prokop|first1=P.|title=Insemination does not affect female mate choice in a nuptial feeding spider.|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|date=2006|volume=73|issue=3|pages=197–201|doi=10.1080/11250000600727741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect demonstrates sexual selection's ability to make one sex more discriminatory than the other, since females may negatively impact their output of offspring by refusing mating events with males that do not offer gifts.

=== Benefits to the female ===
Nuptial gift giving is often described in such a way that it only really affects the male counterpart. Nuptial gifting is also of benefit to the female. It has been shown that female fireflies will route spermatophore (contain sperm and are produced by the accessory gland) nutrients throughout their body from a few hours up to a few days.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rooney|first=Jennifer|last2=Lewis|first2=Sara M.|date=2002-06|title=Fitness advantage from nuptial gifts in female fireflies|journal=Ecological Entomology|volume=27|issue=3|pages=373–377|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00420.x|issn=0307-6946}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major benefit of this is that now the female does not have to hunt or graze as frequently, limiting her exposure to predation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Females also have the ability to direct the nutrition from the nuptial gift to the part of the body that needs it the most. Often times it is directed towards metabolism.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Female bushcrickets fuel their metabolism with male nuptial gifts|last=U.C|first=Voigt, Christian C Kretzschmar, Antje S Speakman, John R Lehmann, Gerlind|publisher=The Royal Society|oclc=678614228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen within female [[Tettigoniidae|Bushcrickets]]. An experiment was conducted whereby there were two groups of males, one group was fed high levels of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C the other, low levels.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These males then presented their gifts to the females and the isotopic changes in exhaled breath of the females were measured after consumption.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Within 3 hours, the stable carbon isotope ratio of the breath was the same as the ratio of male donors gift, proving that the female had directed the extra nutrients to metabolism.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''''On the Waterfront''''' is a 1954 American [[crime drama]] film directed by [[Elia Kazan]], and written by [[Budd Schulberg]]. It stars [[Marlon Brando]], and features [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]], Pat Henning and [[Eva Marie Saint]] in her film debut. The soundtrack score was composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The film was suggested by "Crime on the Waterfront" by [[Malcolm Johnson (journalist)|Malcolm Johnson]], a series of articles published in November–December 1948 in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]], but the screenplay by [[Budd Schulberg]] is directly based on his own original story.&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{AFI film|51286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film focuses on [[union violence]] and corruption amongst [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], while detailing widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[extortion]], and [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] on the waterfronts of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]].

''On the Waterfront'' was a critical and commercial success, and received twelve [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, winning eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brando, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Saint, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the eighth-greatest American movie of all time]], and in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.

In 1989, ''On the Waterfront'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==
[[American Mafia|Mob]]-connected union boss Johnny Friendly ([[Lee J. Cobb]]) gloats about his iron-fisted control of the waterfront. The police and the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]] know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play "D and D" ("deaf and dumb"), accepting their subservient position, rather than risking the danger and shame of informing.

Terry Malloy ([[Marlon Brando]]) is a dockworker whose brother Charley "the Gent" ([[Rod Steiger]]) is Friendly's right-hand man. Some years earlier, Terry had been a promising boxer, until Friendly had Charley instruct him to deliberately lose a fight that he could have won, so that Friendly could win money betting against him. Terry is used to coax Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), a popular dockworker, into an ambush, preventing Joey from testifying against Friendly before the Crime Commission. Terry assumed that Friendly's enforcers were only going to "lean" on Joey to pressure him into silence, and is surprised when Joey is killed.

Joey's sister Edie ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), angry about her brother's death, shames "waterfront priest" Father Barry ([[Karl Malden]]) into fomenting action against the mob-controlled union. Friendly sends Terry to attend and inform on a dockworkers' meeting Father Barry holds in the church, which is broken up by Friendly's men. Terry helps Edie escape the violence, and is smitten with her. Another dockworker, Timothy J. "Kayo" Dugan (Pat Henning), who agrees to testify after Father Barry promises unwavering support, ends up dead after Friendly arranges for him to be crushed by a load of whiskey in a staged accident.

Although Terry resents being used as a tool in Joey's death, and despite Father Barry's impassioned "sermon on the docks" reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them and that every murder is a [[Calvary]], Terry is at first willing to remain "D and D", even when [[subpoena]]ed to testify. However, when Edie, unaware of Terry's role in her brother's death, begins to return Terry's feelings, Terry is tormented by his awakening conscience and confesses the circumstances of Joey's death to Father Barry and Edie. Horrified, Edie breaks up with him.

As Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can coerce him into keeping quiet. Charley tries bribing Terry with a good job and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who blames his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. In what has become an iconic scene, Terry reminds Charley that had it not been for the fixed fight, Terry's prizefighting career would have bloomed. "I coulda' been somebody. I coulda' been a contender", laments Terry to his brother, "Instead of a bum, which is what I am – let's face it." Charley gives Terry the gun, and advises him to run. Terry flees to Edie's apartment, where she first refuses to let him in, but finally admits her love for him. Friendly, having had Charley watched, has Charley murdered and his body hung in an alley as bait to lure Terry out to his death, but Terry and Edie both escape the attempt on Terry's life.

After finding Charley's body, Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry prevents it by blocking Terry's line of fire and convincing Terry to fight Friendly by testifying instead. Terry proceeds to give damaging testimony implicating Friendly in Joey's murder and other illegal activities, causing Friendly's mob boss to cut him off and Friendly to face [[indictment]].

After the testimony, Friendly announces that Terry will not find employment anywhere on the waterfront. Terry is shunned by his former friends and by a neighborhood boy who had previously looked up to him. Refusing Edie's suggestion that they move away from the waterfront together, Terry shows up during recruitment at the docks. When he is the only man not hired, Terry openly confronts Friendly, calling him out and proclaiming that he is proud of what he did. The confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendly's thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death. The dockworkers, who witness the confrontation, show their support for Terry by refusing to work, unless Terry is working, too, and pushing Friendly into the river. Encouraged by Father Barry and Edie, the badly injured Terry forces himself to his feet and enters the dock, followed by the other workers. A soaking wet and face-scarred Friendly, now left with nothing, swears revenge on them all, but his threats fall on deaf ears as they enter the garage, and the door closes behind them.

==Production==
===Screenplay and political context===
The film is widely considered to be [[Elia Kazan]]'s answer to those who criticized him for identifying eight (former) Communists in the film industry before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) in 1952. One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright [[Arthur Miller]], who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally entitled ''The Hook''. Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make ''The Hook'', but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.{{cn|date=January 2018}} When Cohn asked the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie "pro-American". Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with [[Budd Schulberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Geneveive | last=Haas | title=Dartmouth acquires Budd Schulberg '36 papers | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | work=Dartmouth News | accessdate=January 6, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206144751/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | archivedate=February 6, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After rewriting the script, Schulberg and Kazan approached [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who eventually told them he did not like a single thing about the script, asking, "Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?" This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer [[Sam Spiegel]], who set up a deal with Columbia. Spiegel was insistent on Schulberg delivering a perfect screenplay, and barraged the writer with changes and suggestions, to the frustration of Schulberg.

Schulberg's script nonetheless went through a number of changes before reaching the screen. In an early draft, the Terry Malloy character was not an ex-pug dockworker, but a cynical investigative reporter, as well as an older, divorced man.

===Real-life basis for characters===

Terry Malloy's fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DeVincenzo, who testified before a real-life [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Commission]] about activities on the Hoboken Docks and suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DeVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with [[Columbia Pictures]] over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DeVincenzo claimed to have recounted his story to screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings. Schulberg attended DeVincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing.

The character of Father Barry was based on the real-life "waterfront priest" [[John M. Corridan|Father John M. Corridan]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and graduate of [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|west side of Manhattan]]. Father Corridan was interviewed extensively by Schulberg, who also wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan, ''Waterfront Priest'' by Allen Raymond.

The character of Johnny Friendly was partially based on [[International Longshoremen's Association]] boss [[Michael Clemente]]. Friendly also had aspects of former [[Murder, Inc.]] head [[Albert Anastasia]], who was a top enforcer for the crime family that ran the Hoboken docks, the Luciano{{spnd}}later Genovese{{spnd}}family. In 1979, Clemente and other members of the Genovese family were indicted for corruption and racketeering on the New York waterfront.

===Casting===
According to [[Richard Schickel]] in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially refused the role of Terry Malloy, and [[Frank Sinatra]] (a native of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where the film was being made) then had "a handshake deal"{{spnd}}but no formally signed contract{{spnd}}to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a "more Brando-like" actor as Terry Malloy, in an effort to persuade Spiegel that "an actor like Marlon Brando" could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of [[Actors Studio]] members [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]] performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterwards, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had already been signed for that role.

The part of Edie Doyle was offered to [[Grace Kelly]], who turned it down, preferring to make ''[[Rear Window]]'' instead. Kazan said in his autobiography ''A Life'' that the choice of an actress to play Edie Doyle was narrowed down to [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]]. There was something well-bred about Montgomery that Kazan thought would not be becoming for Edie,{{cn|date=January 2018}} who was raised on the waterfront in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. He gave the part to Saint.

The role of Terry's older brother Charley was originally offered to [[Lawrence Tierney]], who asked for too much money, so the role went to [[Rod Steiger]]. Despite playing Terry's older brother, Steiger was one year younger than Brando.

Several of the labor boss' men in the film, including [[Abe Simon]] as Barney, [[Tony Galento]] as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tillio, were former professional [[heavyweight]] boxers in real life.

===Filming locations===
''On the Waterfront'' was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic [[Church of Our Lady of Grace (Hoboken, New Jersey)|Our Lady of Grace]], built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.&lt;ref name=movielove&gt;{{cite movielove}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Upon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (January 5, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; In his July 29, 1954, review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A. H. Weiler called the film "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals".&lt;ref&gt;Weiler, A. H. [https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/29/movies/19540729waterfront.html?_r=0 "Movie Review: On the Waterfront"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (July 29, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a critical score of 98% with an average rating of 9.2/10 and a critical consensus of "With his electrifying performance in Elia Kazan's thought-provoking, expertly constructed melodrama, Marlon Brando redefined the possibilities of acting for film and helped permanently alter the cinematic landscape".&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_the_waterfront/ |title=On the Waterfront |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legacy'''

In 1989, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. It is also on the [[Vatican's list of films|Vatican's list of 45 greatest films]], compiled in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.usccb.org/movies/vaticanfilms.shtml |title=Vatican Best Films List |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
{{Anchor|Video|DVD|DVD release}} The first home video release of the film was by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]] in 1982, on VHS and Beta. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the [[Columbia Classics]] line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's "Studio Heritage Collection", and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette "Contender: Mastering the Method", a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the [[Criterion Collection]]. 

The 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: "In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including ''On The Waterfront'', would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (''Twelve Angry Men'', ''Baby Doll'') split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, ''On The Waterfront'' was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era. Here, for the first time, Criterion is presenting the film in all three aspect ratios so that viewers can compare and choose the version they prefer."

{{Christian mysticism}}
'''''Paradiso''''' ({{IPA-it|paraˈdiːzo|pron}}; Italian for "[[Paradise]]" or "[[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]]") is the third and final part of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', following the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' and the ''[[Purgatorio]]''.  It is an [[allegory]] telling of Dante's journey through Heaven, guided by [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], who symbolises theology.  In the poem, Paradise is depicted as a series of concentric spheres surrounding the Earth, consisting of the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], the [[Sun]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], the [[Fixed stars|Fixed Stars]], the [[Primum Mobile]] and finally, the [[Empyrean]]. It was written in the early 14th century. Allegorically, the poem represents the soul's ascent to God.

==Introduction==
[[File:figura dos copy.jpg|thumb|The ''Paradiso'' assumes the medieval view of the Universe, with the Earth surrounded by concentric spheres containing planets and stars.]]
The ''Paradiso'' begins at the top of [[Purgatorio|Mount Purgatory]], called the [[Purgatorio#The Earthly Paradise|Earthly Paradise]] (i.e. the [[Garden of Eden]]), at noon on Wednesday, March 30 (or April 13), 1300, following [[Easter Sunday]]. Dante's journey through Paradise takes approximately twenty-four hours, which indicates that the entire journey of the ''Divine Comedy'' has taken one week, Thursday evening (''Inferno'' I and II) to Thursday evening.

After ascending through the [[sphere of fire]] believed to exist in the earth's upper atmosphere (Canto I), [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] guides Dante through the nine [[celestial spheres]] of [[Heaven]], to the [[Empyrean]], which is the abode of God. The nine spheres are concentric, as in the standard medieval [[geocentric model]] of cosmology,&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'', Chapter V, Cambridge University Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; which was derived from [[Ptolemy]]. The Empyrean is non-material. As with his Purgatory, the structure of Dante's Heaven is therefore of the form 9+1=10, with one of the ten regions different in nature from the other nine.

During the course of his journey, Dante meets and converses with several blessed souls. He is careful to say that these all actually live in bliss with God in the Empyrean:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But all those souls grace the Empyrean;&lt;br&gt;
and each of them has gentle life though some&lt;br&gt;
sense the Eternal Spirit more, some less.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto IV, lines 34–36, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, for Dante's benefit (and the benefit of his readers), he is "as a sign"&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto IV, line 38, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; shown various souls in planetary and stellar spheres that have some appropriate connotation.

While the structures of the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' and ''[[Purgatorio]]'' were based around different classifications of sin, the structure of the ''Paradiso'' is based on the four [[cardinal virtues]] ([[Prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], and [[Courage|Fortitude]]) and the three [[theological virtues]] ([[Faith in Christianity|Faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]]).

==The Spheres of Heaven==
[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|thumb|upright|On visiting the [[Moon]], Beatrice explains to Dante the reasons for its markings, Canto 2.]]
Dante's nine spheres of Heaven are the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], the [[Sun]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], the [[Fixed stars|Fixed Stars]], and the [[Primum Mobile]]. These are associated by Dante with the nine levels of the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|angelic hierarchy]]. Dante also relies on traditional associations, such as the one between Venus and romantic love. The first three spheres (which fall within the shadow of the Earth) are associated with deficient forms of [[Courage|Fortitude]], [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], and [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]. The next four are associated with positive examples of [[Prudence]], Fortitude, Justice, and Temperance; while [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Charity (virtue)|Love]] appear together in the eighth sphere.

===First Sphere (The Moon: The Inconstant)===
When visiting the [[Moon]], Beatrice explains to Dante the reasons for the markings on its surface, describing a simple scientific experiment in [[optics]]. She also praises the experimental method in general (Canto II):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet an experiment, were you to try it,&lt;br&gt;
could free you from your cavil, and the source&lt;br&gt;
of your arts' course springs from experiment.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto II, lines 94–96, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Philipp Veit 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Dante and Beatrice speak to [[Piccarda]] and [[Constance of Sicily|Constance]] (fresco by [[Philipp Veit]]), Canto 3.]]
The waxing and waning of the moon is associated with inconstancy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto II.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the sphere of the Moon is that of souls who abandoned their [[vow]]s, and so were deficient in the virtue of [[Courage|fortitude]] (Canto II). Here Dante and Beatrice meet [[Piccarda]], sister of Dante's friend [[Forese Donati]], who died shortly after being forcibly removed from her convent. They also meet [[Constance of Sicily]], who (Dante believes) was forcibly removed from a convent to marry [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] (Canto III).&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto III.&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice discourses on the freedom of the will, the sacredness of vows, and the importance of not collaborating with force (Canto IV):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
for will, if it resists, is never spent,&lt;br&gt;
but acts as nature acts when fire ascends,&lt;br&gt;
though force a thousand times tries to compel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So that, when will has yielded much or little,&lt;br&gt;
it has abetted force as these souls did:&lt;br&gt;
they could have fled back to their holy shelter.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto IV, lines 76–81, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beatrice explains that a vow is a pact "drawn between a man / and God,"&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto V, lines 28–29, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a person freely offers up his free will as a gift to God. Vows should therefore not be taken lightly, and should be kept once given – unless keeping the vow would be a greater evil, as with [[Jephthah]]'s and [[Agamemnon]]'s sacrifice of their daughters (Canto V).&lt;ref name="DLS5"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto V.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|upright|Dante meets the Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in the Sphere of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], Canto 5.]]

===Second Sphere (Mercury: The Ambitious)===
Because of its proximity to the sun, the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is often difficult to see. Allegorically, the planet represents those who did good out of a desire for fame, but who, being ambitious, were deficient in the virtue of [[Justice (virtue)|justice]]. Their earthly glory pales into insignificance beside the glory of God, just as Mercury pales into insignificance beside the sun.&lt;ref name="DLS5" /&gt; Here Dante meets the Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], who introduces himself with the words "Caesar I was and am Justinian,"&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto VI, line 10, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that his personality remains, but that his earthly status no longer exists in Heaven&lt;ref name="DLS6"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto VI.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto V). Justinian recounts the history of the [[Roman Empire]], mentioning, among others, [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cleopatra]]; and bemoans the present state of Italy, given the conflict between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], and the involvement of the "yellow lilies" of France&lt;ref name="DLS6" /&gt; (Canto VI):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For some oppose the universal emblem&lt;br&gt;
with yellow lilies; others claim that emblem&lt;br&gt;
for party: it is hard to see who is worse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let Ghibellines pursue their undertakings&lt;br&gt;
beneath another sign, for those who sever&lt;br&gt;
this sign and justice are bad followers.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto VI, lines 76–81, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By association, Beatrice discourses on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] and the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] of [[Christ]], which occurred during Roman times (Canto VII).

===Third Sphere (Venus: The Lovers)===
The planet [[Venus]] (the Morning and Evening Star) is traditionally associated with the [[Venus (mythology)|Goddess of Love]], and so Dante makes this the planet of the lovers, who were deficient in the virtue of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] (Canto VIII):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The world, when still in peril, thought that, wheeling,&lt;br&gt;
in the third epicycle, Cyprian&lt;br&gt;
the fair sent down her rays of frenzied love,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
.. and gave the name of her&lt;br&gt;
with whom I have begun this canto, to&lt;br&gt;
the planet that is courted by the sun,&lt;br&gt;
at times behind her and at times in front.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto VIII, lines 1–3, 9–12, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gustave Dore XIV.jpg|thumb|Illustration for Paradiso by Gustave Dore.]]

[[File:1K002578 Divine Comedy Giovanni di paolo.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Folquet de Marselha|Folquet de Marseilles]] bemoans the corruption of the Church, with the clergy receiving money from [[Satan]] (miniature by [[Giovanni di Paolo]]), Canto 9.]]
Dante meets [[Charles Martel of Anjou]], who was known to him,&lt;ref name="DLS8"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; and who points out that a properly functioning society requires people of many different kinds. Such differences are illustrated by [[Cunizza da Romano]] (lover of [[Sordello]]), who is here in Heaven, while her brother [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] is in [[Inferno (Dante)|Hell]], among the violent of the seventh circle.&lt;ref&gt;''Inferno'', Canto XII, line 109, Mandelbaum translation: "That brow with hair so black is Ezzelino."&lt;/ref&gt;

The troubadour [[Folquet de Marselha|Folquet de Marseilles]] speaks of the temptations of love, and points out that (as was believed at the time) the cone of the Earth's shadow just touches the sphere of Venus. He condemns the city of Florence (planted, he says, by [[Satan]]) for producing that "damned flower" (the [[Italian coin florin|florin]]) which is responsible for the corruption of the Church, and he criticises the clergy for their focus on money, rather than on Scripture and the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] (Canto IX):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your city, which was planted by that one&lt;br&gt;
who was the first to turn against his Maker,&lt;br&gt;
the one whose envy cost us many tears&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
produces and distributes the damned flower&lt;br&gt;
that turns both sheep and lambs from the true course,&lt;br&gt;
for of the shepherd it has made a wolf.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For this the Gospel and the great Church Fathers&lt;br&gt;
are set aside and only the Decretals&lt;br&gt;
are studied as their margins clearly show.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On these the pope and cardinals are intent.&lt;br&gt;
Their thoughts are never bent on Nazareth,&lt;br&gt;
where Gabriel's open wings were reverent.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto IX, lines 127–138, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fourth Sphere (The Sun: The Wise)===
Beyond the shadow of the Earth, Dante deals with positive examples of [[Prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]], and [[Courage|Fortitude]]. Within the [[Sun]], which is the Earth's source of illumination, Dante meets the greatest examples of prudence: the souls of the wise, who help to illuminate the world intellectually&lt;ref name="DLS10"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto X.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto X). Initially, a circle of twelve bright lights dance around Dante and Beatrice. These are the souls of:&lt;ref name="DLS10" /&gt;

[[File:Dante Pd10 BL Yates Thompson 36 f147.jpg|thumb|350px|Dante and Beatrice meet twelve wise men in the Sphere of the Sun (miniature by [[Giovanni di Paolo]]), Canto 10.]]
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]
* [[Albertus Magnus]]
* [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]
* [[Peter Lombard]]
* King [[Solomon]]
* [[Dionysius the Areopagite]], confused here with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]]
* [[Orosius]]
* [[Boethius]]
* [[Isidore of Seville]]
* [[Bede]]
* [[Richard of Saint Victor]]
* [[Siger of Brabant]]

This list includes philosophers, theologians and a king, and has representatives from across Europe. Thomas Aquinas recounts the life of [[St. Francis of Assisi]], and his love for "Lady Poverty" (Canto XI):
[[File:Saint Francis of Assisi by Jusepe de Ribera.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]], whose life is recounted by [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] (painting by [[Jusepe de Ribera]]), Canto 11.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Between Topino's stream and that which flows&lt;br&gt;
down from the hill the blessed Ubaldo chose,&lt;br&gt;
from a high peak there hangs a fertile slope;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
from there Perugia feels both heat and cold&lt;br&gt;
at Porta Sole, while behind it sorrow&lt;br&gt;
Nocera and Gualdo under their hard yoke.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From this hillside, where it abates its rise,&lt;br&gt;
a sun was born into the world, much like&lt;br&gt;
this sun when it is climbing from the Ganges.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Therefore let him who names this site not say&lt;br&gt;
Ascesi, which would be to say too little,&lt;br&gt;
but Orient, if he would name it rightly.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XI, lines 43–54, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twelve new bright lights appear, one of which is [[St. Bonaventure]], a [[Franciscan]], who recounts the life of [[St. Dominic]], founder of the order to which Aquinas belonged. The two orders were not always friendly on earth, and having members of one order praising the founder of the other shows the love present in Heaven&lt;ref name="DLS11"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XI.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XII). The twenty-four  bright lights revolve around Dante and Beatrice, singing of the [[Trinity]], and Aquinas explains the surprising presence of King Solomon, who is placed here for kingly, rather than philosophical or mathematical wisdom (Cantos XIII and XIV):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My words did not prevent your seeing clearly&lt;br&gt;
that it was as a king that he had asked&lt;br&gt;
for wisdom that would serve his royal task&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and not to know the number of the angels&lt;br&gt;
on high or, if combined with a contingent,&lt;br&gt;
''necesse'' ever can produce ''necesse'',&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
or ''si est dare primum motum esse'',&lt;br&gt;
or if, within a semicircle, one&lt;br&gt;
can draw a triangle with no right angle.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XIII, lines 94–102, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fifth Sphere (Mars: The Warriors of the Faith)===
[[File:Perseid Meteor.jpg|thumb|The souls in the Fifth Sphere form a [[Greek cross]], which Dante compares to the [[Milky Way]], Canto 14.]]
The planet [[Mars]] is traditionally associated with the [[Mars (mythology)|God of War]], and so Dante makes this planet the home of the warriors of the Faith, who gave their lives for God, thereby displaying the virtue of [[Courage|fortitude]].&lt;ref name="DLS14"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;  The millions of sparks of light that are the souls of these warriors form a [[Greek cross]] on the planet Mars, and Dante compares this cross to the [[Milky Way]] (Canto XIV):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As, graced with lesser and with larger lights&lt;br&gt;
between the poles of the world, the Galaxy&lt;br&gt;
gleams so that even sages are perplexed;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
so, constellated in the depth of Mars,&lt;br&gt;
those rays described the venerable sign&lt;br&gt;
a circle's quadrants form where they are joined.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XIV, lines 97–102, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dante says that sages are "perplexed" by the nature of the Milky Way, but in his ''[[Convivio]]'', he had described its nature fairly well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What Aristotle said on this matter cannot be known with certainty. In the Old Translation he says that the Galaxy is nothing but a multitude of fixed stars in that region, so small that we are unable to distinguish them from here below, though from them originates the appearance of that brightness which we call the Galaxy; this may be so, for the heaven in that region is denser, and therefore retains and throws back this light. Avicenna and Ptolemy seem to share this opinion with Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante Alighieri]], ''[[Convivio]]'', [http://dante.ilt.columbia.edu/books/convivi/convivio2.html Book II, Chapter 14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710102731/http://dante.ilt.columbia.edu/books/convivi/convivio2.html |date=2010-07-10 }}, Richard Lansing translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dante meets his ancestor [[Cacciaguida]], who served in the [[Second Crusade]].&lt;ref name="DLS15"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XV.&lt;/ref&gt; Cacciaguida praises the twelfth-century [[Republic of Florence]], and bemoans the way in which the city has declined since those days (Cantos XV and XVI). The setting of the ''Divine Comedy'' in the year 1300, before Dante's exile, has allowed characters in the poem to "foretell" bad things for Dante.&lt;ref name="DLS17"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XVII.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a question from Dante, Cacciaguida speaks the truth bluntly. Dante will be exiled (Canto XVII):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You shall leave everything you love most dearly:&lt;br&gt;
this is the arrow that the bow of exile&lt;br&gt;
shoots first. You are to know the bitter taste&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
of others' bread, how salt it is, and know&lt;br&gt;
how hard a path it is for one who goes&lt;br&gt;
descending and ascending others' stairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XVII, lines 55–60, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Cacciaguida also charges Dante to write and tell the world all that he has seen of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.&lt;ref name="DLS17" /&gt; Finally, Dante sees some other warriors of the Faith, such as [[Joshua]], [[Judas Maccabeus]], [[Charlemagne]], [[Roland]], and [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] (Canto XVIII).

===Sixth Sphere (Jupiter: The Just Rulers)===
[[File:Fontainebleau - aigle impériale.JPG|thumb|An imperial eagle. The souls forming the final "M" of "TERRAM" transform themselves into this shape, Canto 18.]]
The planet [[Jupiter]] is traditionally associated with the [[Jupiter (mythology)|king of the gods]], so Dante makes this planet the home of the rulers who displayed [[Justice (virtue)|justice]].&lt;ref name="DLS18"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; The souls here spell out the Latin for "Love justice, ye that judge the earth", after which the final "M" of that sentence is transformed into the shape of a giant imperial eagle&lt;ref name="DLS18" /&gt; (Canto XVIII):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
DILIGITE IUSTITIAM were the verb&lt;br&gt;
and noun that first appeared in that depiction;&lt;br&gt;
QUI IUDICATIS TERRAM followed after.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then, having formed the M of the fifth word,&lt;br&gt;
those spirits kept their order; Jupiter's&lt;br&gt;
silver, at that point, seemed embossed with gold.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XVIII, lines 91–96, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Present in this sphere are [[David]], [[Hezekiah]], [[Trajan]] (converted to Christianity according to a medieval legend), [[Constantine I|Constantine]], [[William II of Sicily]], and (to Dante's amazement) [[Ripheus]] the Trojan, a pagan saved by the mercy of God.&lt;ref name="DLS20"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XX.&lt;/ref&gt; The souls forming the imperial eagle speak with one voice, and tell of God's justice&lt;ref name="DLS19"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; (Cantos XIX and XX).

===Seventh Sphere (Saturn: The Contemplatives)===
The sphere of [[Saturn]] is that of the contemplatives, who embody [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name="DLS21"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante here meets [[Peter Damian]], and discusses with him [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]], the doctrine of [[predestination]], and the sad state of the Church&lt;ref name="DLS22"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXII.&lt;/ref&gt; (Cantos XXI and XXII). Beatrice, who represents [[theology]], becomes increasingly lovely here, indicating the contemplative's closer insight into the truth of God:
[[File:Divine Comedy Dante14.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Dante and Beatrice meet [[Peter Damian]], who tells of his life, and discusses [[predestination]] (miniature by [[Giovanni di Paolo]]), Canto 21.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
She did not smile. Instead her speech to me&lt;br&gt;
began: Were I to smile, then you would be&lt;br&gt;
like Semele when she was turned to ashes,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
because, as you have seen, my loveliness&lt;br&gt;
which, even as we climb the steps of this&lt;br&gt;
eternal palace, blazes with more brightness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
were it not tempered here, would be so brilliant&lt;br&gt;
that, as it flashed, your mortal faculty&lt;br&gt;
would seem a branch a lightning bolt has cracked.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXI, lines 4–12, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Eighth Sphere (The Fixed Stars: Faith, Hope, and Love)===
[[File:Crescent-shaped Earth and Moon.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Looking down from the Sphere of the [[Fixed stars|Fixed Stars]], Dante sees the humble planet that is the [[Earth]], Canto 22.]]
The sphere of the [[Fixed stars|Fixed Stars]] is the sphere of the [[Church militant and church triumphant|church triumphant]].&lt;ref name="DLS23"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXIII.&lt;/ref&gt; From here (in fact, from the constellation [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], under which he was born), Dante looks back on the seven spheres he has visited, and on the Earth (Canto XXII):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My eyes returned through all the seven spheres&lt;br&gt;
and saw this globe in such a way that I&lt;br&gt;
smiled at its scrawny image: I approve&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
that judgment as the best, which holds this earth&lt;br&gt;
to be the least; and he whose thoughts are set&lt;br&gt;
elsewhere, can truly be called virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXII, lines 133–138, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Dante sees the [[Virgin Mary]] and other [[saint]]s (Canto XXIII). [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] tests Dante on [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], asking what it is, and whether Dante has it. In response to Dante's reply, St. Peter asks Dante how he knows that the Bible is true, and (in an argument attributed to Augustine&lt;ref name="DLS24"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXIV.&lt;/ref&gt;) Dante cites the miracle of the Church's growth from such humble beginnings (Canto XXIV):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Say, who assures you that those works were real?&lt;br&gt;
came the reply. The very thing that needs&lt;br&gt;
proof no thing else attests these works to you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{{Listen|filename=AlessandroSorrentinoXXXIII ParadisoDante.ogg

I said: If without miracles the world&lt;br&gt;
was turned to Christianity, that is&lt;br&gt;
so great a miracle that, all the rest&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
are not its hundredth part: for you were poor&lt;br&gt;
and hungry when you found the field and sowed&lt;br&gt;
the good plant once a vine and now a thorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXIV, lines 103–111, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt - Sankt Jakobus der Ältere.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]], who questions Dante on [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] (painting by [[Rembrandt]]), Canto 25.]]
[[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]&lt;ref name="DLS25"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXV.&lt;/ref&gt; questions Dante on [[Hope (virtue)|hope]], and Beatrice vouches for his possession of it (Canto XXV):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no child of the Church Militant&lt;br&gt;
who has more hope than he has, as is written&lt;br&gt;
within the Sun whose rays reach all our ranks:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
thus it is granted him to come from Egypt&lt;br&gt;
into Jerusalem that he have vision&lt;br&gt;
of it, before his term of warring ends.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXV, lines 52–57, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, [[John the Apostle|St. John]] questions Dante on [[Charity (virtue)|love]]. In his reply, Dante refers back to the concept of "twisted love" discussed in the ''[[Purgatorio]]''&lt;ref name="DLS26"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXVI.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XXVI):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus I began again: My charity&lt;br&gt;
results from all those things whose bite can bring&lt;br&gt;
the heart to turn to God; the world's existence&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and mine, the death that He sustained that I&lt;br&gt;
might live, and that which is the hope of all&lt;br&gt;
believers, as it is my hope, together&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
with living knowledge I have spoken of&lt;br&gt;
these drew me from the sea of twisted love&lt;br&gt;
and set me on the shore of the right love.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The leaves enleaving all the garden of&lt;br&gt;
the Everlasting Gardener, I love&lt;br&gt;
according to the good He gave to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXVI, lines 55–56, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

St. Peter then denounces [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in very strong terms, and says that, in his eyes, the [[Papal See]] stands empty (Canto XXVII).

===Ninth Sphere (The Primum Mobile: The Angels)===
[[File:Par 28.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dante and Beatrice see God as a point of light surrounded by angels (illustration by [[Gustave Doré]]), Canto 28.]]
The [[Primum Mobile]] ("first moved" sphere) is the last sphere of the physical universe. It is moved directly by God, and its motion causes all the spheres it encloses to move&lt;ref name="DLS27"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXVII.&lt;/ref&gt; (Canto XXVII):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This heaven has no other where than this:&lt;br&gt;
the mind of God, in which are kindled both&lt;br&gt;
the love that turns it and the force it rains.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As in a circle, light and love enclose it,&lt;br&gt;
as it surrounds the rest and that enclosing,&lt;br&gt;
only He who encloses understands.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No other heaven measures this sphere's motion,&lt;br&gt;
but it serves as the measure for the rest,&lt;br&gt;
even as half and fifth determine ten;&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXVII, lines 109–117, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Primum Mobile is the abode of [[angel]]s, and here Dante sees God as an intensely bright point of light surrounded by [[Christian angelic hierarchy|nine rings of angels]] (Canto XXVIII). Beatrice explains the [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] of the universe, and the role of the angels, ending with a forceful criticism of the preachers of the day (Canto XXIX):
[[File:Divine Comedy. Dante.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Beatrice criticises the preachers of the day, suggesting that a sinister "bird" (a winged demon) nests in the preacher's cowl (miniature by [[Giovanni di Paolo]]), Canto 29.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Christ did not say to his first company:&lt;br&gt;
'Go, and preach idle stories to the world';&lt;br&gt;
but he gave them the teaching that is truth,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and truth alone was sounded when they spoke;&lt;br&gt;
and thus, to battle to enkindle faith,&lt;br&gt;
the Gospels served them as both shield and lance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But now men go to preach with jests and jeers,&lt;br&gt;
and just as long as they can raise a laugh,&lt;br&gt;
the cowl puffs up, and nothing more is asked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But such a bird nests in that cowl, that if&lt;br&gt;
the people saw it, they would recognize&lt;br&gt;
as lies the pardons in which they confide.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXIX, lines 109–120, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Empyrean==
From the Primum Mobile, Dante ascends to a region beyond physical existence, the [[Empyrean]], which is the abode of God. Beatrice, representing theology,&lt;ref name="DLS30"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; is here transformed to be more beautiful than ever before, and Dante becomes enveloped in light, rendering him fit to see God&lt;ref name="DLS30" /&gt; (Canto XXX):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Like sudden lightning scattering the spirits&lt;br&gt;
of sight so that the eye is then too weak&lt;br&gt;
to act on other things it would perceive,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
such was the living light encircling me,&lt;br&gt;
leaving me so enveloped by its veil&lt;br&gt;
of radiance that I could see no thing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Love that calms this heaven always welcomes&lt;br&gt;
into Itself with such a salutation,&lt;br&gt;
to make the candle ready for its flame.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXX, lines 46–54, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dante sees an enormous rose, symbolising divine love,&lt;ref name="DLS30" /&gt; the petals of which are the enthroned souls of the faithful (both those of the [[Old Testament]] and those of the New).  All the souls he has met in Heaven, including Beatrice, have their home in this rose.&lt;ref name="DLS30" /&gt; Angels fly around the rose like bees, distributing peace and love. Beatrice now returns to her place in the rose, signifying that Dante has passed beyond theology in directly contemplating God,&lt;ref name="DLS31"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]], as a [[Christian mysticism|mystical contemplative]], now guides Dante further (Canto XXXI).

[[File:Dell' alto lume parvemi a.jpg|thumb|right|The three circles of the [[Trinity]] (illustration by [[John Flaxman]]), Canto 33.]]
St. Bernard further explains [[predestination]], and prays to the [[Virgin Mary]] on Dante's behalf. Finally, Dante comes face-to-face with God Himself (Cantos XXXII and XXXIII). God appears as three equally large circles occupying the same space, representing the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]]:&lt;ref name="DLS33"&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Paradise'', notes on Canto XXXIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
but through my sight, which as I gazed grew stronger,&lt;br&gt;
that sole appearance, even as I altered,&lt;br&gt;
seemed to be changing. In the deep and bright&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
essence of that exalted Light, three circles&lt;br&gt;
appeared to me; they had three different colors,&lt;br&gt;
but all of them were of the same dimension;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
one circle seemed reflected by the second,&lt;br&gt;
as rainbow is by rainbow, and the third&lt;br&gt;
seemed fire breathed equally by those two circles.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXXIII, lines 112–120, Mandelbaum translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within these circles Dante can discern the human form of [[Christ]]. The ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ends with Dante trying to understand how the circles fit together, and how the humanity of Christ relates to the divinity of the Son but, as Dante puts it, "that was not a flight for my wings".&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXXIII, line 139, [[C. H. Sisson]] translation.&lt;/ref&gt; In a flash of understanding, which he cannot express, Dante does finally see this, and his soul becomes aligned with God's love:&lt;ref name="DLS33" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
But already my desire and my will&lt;br&gt;
were being turned like a wheel, all at one speed,&lt;br&gt;
by the Love which moves the sun and the other stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'', Canto XXXIII, lines 142-145, [[C. H. Sisson]] translation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Sceliphron and pest.jpg|thumb|[[Varied carpet beetle|Carpet beetle]] [[larva]]e damaging a specimen of ''[[Sceliphron|Sceliphron destillatorius]]'' in an entomological collection]]

A '''pest''' is a plant or animal detrimental to humans or human concerns including crops, livestock, and forestry. The term is also used of organisms that cause a nuisance, such as in the home. An older usage is of a deadly [[epidemic]] disease, specifically [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. In its broadest sense, a pest is a [[Competition (biology)|competitor]] of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pest Merriam-Webster dictionary], accessed 22 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pest vermin |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453421/pest |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
A pest is any living organism, whether animal, plant or fungus, which is invasive or troublesome to plants or animals, human or human concerns, livestock, or human structures. It is a loose concept, as an organism can be a pest in one setting but beneficial, domesticated or acceptable in another.

[[File:White Ants (Termites)147.jpg|thumb|Pests often occur in high densities, making the damage they do even more detrimental. [[Termite]]]]

Animals are called pests when they cause damage to [[agriculture]] by feeding on crops or [[parasite|parasitising]] [[livestock]], such as [[codling moth]] on [[apple]]s, or [[boll weevil]] on [[cotton]]. An animal could also be a pest when it causes damage to a wild [[ecosystem]] or carries [[bacteria|germs]] within human habitats. Examples of these include those organisms which [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] human [[disease]], such as [[rat]]s and [[flea]]s which carry the [[bubonic plague|plague]] disease, [[mosquito]]es which vector [[malaria]], and [[tick]]s which carry [[Lyme disease]].

A species can be a pest in one setting but beneficial or domesticated in another (for example, European [[Rabbits in Australia|rabbits introduced to Australia]] caused [[ecology|ecological]] [[invasive species|damage]] beyond the scale they inflicted in their natural habitat). Many [[weed]]s are also seen as useful under certain conditions, for instance [[Patterson's curse]] is often valued as food for honeybees and as a wildflower, even though it can poison livestock.

The term "plant pest" has a specific definition in terms of the [[International Plant Protection Convention]] and phytosanitary measures worldwide. A pest is any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal, or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3241E/y3241e05.htm  FAO Corporate Document Repository: Guidelines for Phytosanitary Certificates.] Retrieved 1 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Plants may be considered pests themselves if an [[invasive species]].

The animal groups of greatest importance as pests (in order of economic importance) are [[insect]]s, [[mites]], [[nematode]]s and [[gastropod]]s.&lt;ref name="Speiser 2002"&gt;Speiser B. (2002). "Chapter 219. Molluscicides". 506–508. {{doi|10.1201/NOE0824706326.ch219}} [http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdf/10.1201/NOE0824706326.ch219 PDF] In:  Pimentel D. (ed.) (2002). ''Encyclopedia of Pest Management''. {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0632-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Plant pests can be classed as [[monophagous]],  [[oligophagous]], and [[polyphagous]] according to how many hosts they have. Alternatively, they can be divided by feeding type, whether biting and chewing; piercing and sucking; or Lapping and chewing. Another approach is to class them by population presence as * key pests,  occasional pests, and potential pests. In terms of population biology, there are [[population growth rate]] (r) pests;  [[carrying capacity]] (k) pests; and  [[r/K selection theory|r-k pests]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4488">'''Pseudogamy''' refers to aspects of reproduction. It has different (but related) meanings in [[zoology]] and in [[botany]].

== In zoology ==
In zoology it means a type of [[parthenogenesis]] in which the sperm stimulates the [[egg cell]] to develop into an [[embryo]], but no genes from the male are inherited. [[Gynogenesis]] is a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Engelstädter, J. (2008). Constraints on the evolution of asexual reproduction. ''BioEssays''. Review Article. 30(11–12): 1138–1150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlupp, I. (2005). The evolutionary ecology of gynogenesis. ''Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics''. 36: 399–417.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In botany ==
In botany, "pseudogamy" is also related to [[asexual reproduction]]. [[Wilhelm Olbers Focke]]&lt;ref&gt;Focke, W.O. 1881. ''Die Pflanzen-mischlinge, ein Beitrag zur Biologie der Gewächse''. Borntraeger, Berlin. [https://archive.org/details/diepflanzenmisc00fockgoog Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; (1881) is usually cited for the definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Hermsen, J.G.T. (1980). Breeding for apomixis in potato: Pursuing a utopian scheme. ''Euphytica''. 29(3): 595-607&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, G. (1960). Role of the male parent in crosses involving apomictic Rubus species. ''Heredity''. 14(1): 101–113.&lt;/ref&gt; What he actually said was (page 525, translated)
:"III PSEUDOGAMY.&lt;br&gt;In experiments to raise [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s, you sometimes get plants that resemble the mother plant, but partly in their sexual potency appear noticeably weakened. They have for this reason often been taken for hybrids. I suspect that in such cases the foreign pollen no real fertilization completed, but only gave the stimulus to produce the outer parts of fruit. The seeds, which are found in the fruit, are, in my opinion, not spawned by hybridization and generally not through sexual procreation, rather they are incurred [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetically]]."

Thus in botany, ''pseudogamy'' means any reproductive process that requires [[pollination]] but does not involve male inheritance. It is sometimes used in a restrictive sense&lt;ref name=Nygren&gt;Nygren, A. 1967. Apomixis in the angiosperms. In Handbuch der Pflanzenphysiologie. Edited by W. Ruhland. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. pp. 551–596.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nogler&gt;Nogler, G.A. 1984. Gametophytic apomixis. In Embryology of angiosperms. Edited by B.M. Johri. Springer, Berlin, Germany. pp. 475–518.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to types of [[agamospermy]] in which the [[endosperm]] is fertilized but the embryo is not (see Pseudogamous apomixis, below). A better term for the restrictive sense is '''centrogamy'''.&lt;ref&gt;Solntzeva, M.P. (2003). About some terms of apomixis: pseudogamy and androgenesis. ''Biologia''. 58(1): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudogamous apomixis===
[[Apomixis]] in flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]) includes some types of vegetative reproduction and also [[agamospermy]], which is asexual reproduction through seeds&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, H. (1908). Über Parthenogenesis und Apogamie im Pflanzenreich. ''Progressus Rei Botanicae''. 2(3): 293–454.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[apomixis]] for more information). Agamospermy can occur through many different mechanisms,&lt;ref name=Nygren/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nogler/&gt; some of which require pollination (pseudogamy), and some of which do not (autonomous apomixis). Many flowering plants with pseudogamous apomixis require fertilization to produce the [[endosperm]] of the [[seed]].&lt;ref name=Nygren/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nogler/&gt; However, it has been shown&lt;ref&gt;Bicknell, R.A., et al. (2003). Quantification of progeny classes in two facultatively apomictic accessions of Hieracium. ''Hereditas''. 138(1): 11–20.&lt;/ref&gt; that pollination with compatible pollen can be required even in some species where endosperm development is autonomous.

Pseudogamous apomixis occurs in many [[Family (biology)|families]].&lt;ref name=Nygren/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nogler/&gt; It is particularly common in [[Rosaceae]] and [[Poaceae]], where it occurs in many different [[genera]] and [[species]]. Examples of species with pseudogamous apomixis include the Himalayan blackberry ''[[Rubus armeniacus]]'' and gamagrass ''[[Tripsacum dactyloides]]''. By contrast, autonomous apomixis is the rule among the many apomictic species of [[Asteraceae]] including the common dandelion ''[[Taraxacum officinale]]'', and also occurs in several genera of [[Poaceae]].

The '''putridarium''' is a temporary burial place, generally in an underground [[crypt]], in which bodies, commonly of monks or nuns, can be stored in wall niches, often seated on masonry chairs with a central hole and vessel to collect the liquids of [[decomposition]]. Once the bodies have reached a proper stage of decomposition, the bones are collected, cleaned, and stored in an [[ossuary]].

[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Scapegoat.jpg|thumb|''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'', by [[William Holman Hunt]], 1854]]

In the [[Bible]], a '''scapegoat''' is an animal which is ritually burdened with the sins of others, then driven away. The concept first appears in [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], in which a goat is designated to be cast into the desert to carry away the sins of the community. 

{{Quote|And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the {{Lord}}, and the other lot for Azazel.||Leviticus 16:8, Jewish Publication Society (1917)}}

Practices with some similarities to the scapegoat ritual also appears in ancient Greece and [[Ebla]].

==Etymology==
{{main|Azazel}}

The word 'scapegoat' is an English translation of the Hebrew ''‘ăzāzêl'' (Hebrew: עזאזל) which occurs in [[Leviticus]] 16:8. The lexicographer [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]&lt;ref&gt;Gesenius "I have no doubt that it should be rendered 'averter'"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brown–Driver–Briggs]] Hebrew Lexicon&lt;ref&gt;p736&lt;/ref&gt; give ''la-azazel'' (Hebrew: לעזאזל) as a [[reduplicative]] intensive of the stem ''‘-Z-L'' "remove", hence ''la-‘ăzāzêl,'' "for entire removal". This reading is supported by the [[Septuagint|Greek Old Testament]] translation as "the sender away (of sins)".

Alternatively, broadly contemporary with the Septuagint, the pseudepigraphical [[Book of Enoch]] may preserve Azazel as the name of a [[fallen angel]].&lt;ref&gt;Archie T. Wright ''The origin of evil spirits: the reception of Genesis 6.1-4'' Page 111 2005 "However, the corresponding Aramaic fragment of / Enoch 10.4 does not use the name Azazel; instead, the name has been reconstructed by Milik to read Asa'el. Stuckenbruck suggests the presence of the biblical form Azazel in the Ethiopic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David P. "Azazel". Pages 1:536-37 in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]]. Edited by David Noel Freedman et al. New York: Doubleday, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The symbolism of the Azazel goat'' Ralph D. Levy 1998 "This is still fairly straightforward, and is translated by the majority of the versions as "for Azazel" (Targums Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan follow this understanding, as do the RSV, NRSV, REB, and Tanakh). KJV and NKJV have "to be the scapegoat"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring [[tinctures]]."&lt;ref&gt;Enoch 8:1, translation by R. H. Charles. Online [https://www.ccel.org/c/charles/otpseudepig/enoch/ENOCH_1.HTM here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Early English [[Christian Bible]] versions follow the translation of the [[Septuagint]] and Latin [[Vulgate]] which interpret ''azazel'' as "the goat that departs" (Greek ''tragos apopompaios'', "goat sent out", Latin ''caper emissarius'', "emissary goat"). [[William Tyndale]] rendered the Latin as "(e)scape goat" in his [[Tyndale Bible|1530 Bible]]. This translation was followed by following versions up to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in 1611: "And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&amp;pg=PA412|year=1991|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|isbn=978-0-87779-603-9|pages=411–412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern versions however either follow the reading as a demon, Azazel, or footnote "for Azazel." as an alternative reading.

Jewish sources in the [[Talmud]] (Yoma 6:4,67b) give the etymology of ''azazel'' as a compound of ''az'', strong or rough, and ''el'', mighty, that the goat was sent from the most rugged or strongest of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2203&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Azazel#6890 |title=AZAZEL |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Targums]] onwards the term ''azazel'' was also seen by some rabbinical commentators as the name of a Hebrew demon, angelic force, or pagan deity.&lt;ref&gt;The JPS guide to Jewish traditions - Page 224 Ronald L. Eisenberg, Jewish Publication Society - 2004 "(Leviticus 16:8–10). In talmudic times, a popular rabbinic interpretation was that Azazel referred to the place to which the goat was sent, the eretz g'zera (inaccessible region) of Leviticus (16:22). Later, Azazel became associated with another..."&lt;/ref&gt; The two readings are still disputed today.&lt;ref&gt;The JPS Torah Commentary: Leviticus Nahum M. Sarna, Chaim Potok, Jewish Publication Society - 1989 " According to the first, Azazel is the name of the place in the wilderness to which the scapegoat was dispatched; ... According to the second line of interpretation, Azazel describes the goat. The word ' aza''zel is a contraction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Judaism==
{{main|Azazel}}
The scapegoat was a [[goat]] that was designated (Hebrew לַעֲזָאזֵֽל ) ''la-aza'zeyl''; "[[Azazel|for absolute removal]]" (for symbolic removal of the people's sins with the literal removal of the goat), and outcast in the desert as part of the ceremonies of the [[Day of Atonement]], that began during the Exodus with the original Tabernacle and continued through the times of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temples in Jerusalem]].

Once a year, on [[Yom Kippur]], the [[Cohen Gadol]] sacrificed a bull as a [[sin offering]] to [[Atonement in Judaism|atone]] for sins he may have committed unintentionally throughout the year. Subsequently he took two goats and presented them at the door of the tabernacle. Two goats were chosen by [[cleromancy|lot]]: one to be "for [[YHWH]]", which was offered as a blood sacrifice, and the other to be the scapegoat to be sent away into the wilderness. The blood of the slain goat was taken into the Holy of Holies behind the sacred veil and sprinkled on the mercy seat, the lid of the ark of the covenant. Later in the ceremonies of the day, the High Priest [[confession in Judaism|confessed]] the intentional sins of the Israelites to God placing them figuratively on the head of the other goat, the Azazel scapegoat, who would symbolically "take them away".

== Christian perspectives ==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Agnus-Dei The Scapegoat (Agnus-Dei. Le bouc émissaire.) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|''Agnus-Dei: The Scapegoat'' (''Agnus-Dei. Le bouc émissaire.''), by [[James Tissot]]]]
In Christianity this process prefigures the sacrifice of [[Christ]] on the cross through which God has been propitiated and sins can be expiated. Jesus Christ is seen to have fulfilled all of the biblical "types"—the High Priest who officiates at the ceremony, the Lord's goat that deals with the pollution of sin and the scapegoat that removes the "burden of sin". Christians believe that sinners who own their guilt and confess their [[sins]], exercising faith and trust in the person and sacrifice of [[Jesus]], are forgiven of their sins. 

Since the second goat was sent away to perish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Golden Bough]]'' p. 569 Sir [[James Frazer]], Worsworth Reference {{ISBN|1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word "scapegoat" has developed to indicate a person who is blamed and punished for the sins of others.

== Similar practices==

===Ancient Syria===
A concept superficially similar to the biblical scapegoat is attested in two ritual texts in archives at [[Ebla]] of the 24th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatelli |first=Ida |date=April 1998 |title=The Origin of the Biblical Scapegoat Ritual: The Evidence of Two Eblaite Text |journal=[[Vetus Testamentum]] |volume=48 |issue=2 |page= |pages=254–263 |ref=href |doi=10.1163/1568533982721604}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were connected with ritual purification on the occasion of the king's wedding. In them, a she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of "Alini"; "we" in the report of the ritual involves the whole community. Such "elimination rites", in which an animal, without confession of sins, is the vehicle of evils (not sins) that are chased from the community are widely attested in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;David P. Wright, ''The Disposal of the Impurity: Elimination Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and Mesopotamian Literature'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press) 1987:15-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greeks practiced scapegoating rituals in exceptional times based on the belief that the repudiation of one or two individuals would save the whole community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bremmer|first=Jan|date=1983|title=Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/311262|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=87|pages=299–320|doi=10.2307/311262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Raymond|date=|title=Who Led the Scapegoat in Leviticus 16:21?|url=|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scapegoating was practiced with different rituals across ancient Greece for different reasons but was mainly used during extraordinary circumstances such as famine, drought or plague.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The scapegoat would usually be an individual of lower society such as a criminal, slave or poor person and was referred to as the [[pharmakos|''pharmakos'']], ''katharma'' or ''peripsima''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a dichotomy, however, in the individuals used as scapegoats in mythical tales and the ones used in the actual rituals. In mythical tales it was stressed that someone of high importance had to be sacrificed if the whole society would benefit from the aversion of catastrophe (usually a king or the king's children).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, since no king or person of importance would be willing to sacrifice himself or his children, the scapegoat in actual rituals would be someone of lower society who would be given value through special treatment such as fine clothes and dining before the sacrificial ceremony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sacrificial ceremonies varied across Greece depending on the festival and type of catastrophe. In [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], for example, a poor man was feasted and led around the walls of the city once before being chased out with stones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Massilia a poor man was feasted for a year and then cast out of the city in order to stop a plague.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The scholia refer to the ''pharmakos'' being killed, but many scholars reject this, and argue that the earliest evidence (the fragments of the [[Iambic poetry|iambic satirist]] [[Hipponax]]) only show the ''pharmakos'' being stoned, beaten and driven from the community.

'''Service innovation''' is used to refer to many things. These include but not limited to:

# [[Innovation]] in [[Service (economics)|services]], in ''service products''&amp;nbsp;– new or improved service products (commodities or public services). Often this is contrasted with “[[technological innovation]]”, though service products can have technological elements. This sense of service innovation is closely related to [[service design]] and "new service development".
# Innovation in ''service processes''&amp;nbsp;– new or improved ways of designing and producing services. This may include innovation in service delivery systems, though often this will be regarded instead as a service product innovation. Innovation of this sort may be technological, technique- or expertise-based,or a matter of work organization (e.g. restructuring work between professionals and [[paraprofessional]]s).
# Innovation in ''service firms'', organizations, and industries&amp;nbsp;– organizational innovations, as well as service product and process innovations, and the management of innovation processes, within service organizations.

== Definitions ==
The [[Finland|Finnish]] research agency [[Tekes (agency)|TEKES]] defines service innovation as "a new or significantly improved service concept that is taken into practice. It can be for example a new customer interaction channel, a distribution system or a technological concept or a combination of them. A service innovation always includes replicable elements that can be identified and systematically reproduced in other cases or environments. The replicable element can be the service outcome or the service process as such or a part of them. A service innovation benefits both the service producer and customers and it improves its developer’s competitive edge. A service innovation is a service product or service process that is based on some technology or systematic method. In services however, the innovation does not necessarily relate to the novelty of the technology itself but the innovation often lies in the non-technological areas. Service innovations can for instance be new solutions in the customer interface, new distribution methods, novel application of technology in the service process, new forms of operation with the supply chain or new ways to organize and manage services."

Another definition proposed by Van Ark et al. (2003){{ref|vanark}} states it as a "new or considerably changed service concept, client interaction channel, service delivery system or technological concept that individually, but most likely in combination, leads to one or more (re)new(ed) service functions that are new to the firm and do change the service/good offered on the market and do require structurally new technological, human or organizational capabilities of the service organization." This definition covers the notions of technological and non-technological innovation. Non-technological innovations in services mainly arise from investment in intangible inputs.

== Service Innovation Research ==
Many literatures on what makes for successful innovations of this kind comes from the New Service Development research field (e.g. Johne and Storey, 1998;{{ref|Johne_Storey}} Nijssen et al., 2006{{ref|Nijssen}}). Service design practitioners have also extensively discussed the features of effective service products and experiences. One of the key aspects of many service activities is the high involvement of the client/customer/user in the production of the final service. Without this co-production (i.e. interactivity of service production), the service would often not be created. This co-production, together with the intangibility of many service products, causes service innovation to often take forms rather different from those familiar through studies of innovation in manufacturing. Innovation researchers have, for this reason, stressed that much service innovation is hard to capture in traditional categories like product or process innovation. The co-production process, and the interactions between service provider and client, can also form the focus of innovation. A growing number of professional association have service sections that promote service innovation research, including [[INFORMS]], [[ISSIP]], and others.

=== Areas of innovation – den Hertog's model ===
Thus den Hertog (2000){{ref|den Hertog}} who identifies four “dimensions” of service innovation, takes quite a different direction to much standard innovation theorizing.
# '''The Service Concept''' refers to a service concept that is new to its particular market&amp;nbsp;– a new service in effect, or in Edvardsson’s (1996,{{ref|Edvardsson1}} 1997{{ref|Edvardsson2}}) terminology, a “new value proposition”. Many service innovations involve fairly intangible characteristics of the service, and others involve new ways of organizing solutions to problems (be these new or familiar ones). Examples might include new types of bank account or information service.  In some service sectors, such as retail, there is much talk about “formats”, such as the organization of shops in different ways (more or less specialized, more or less focused on quality or cost-saving, etc.).
# '''The Client Interface''' refers to innovation in the interface between the service provider and its customers. Clients are often highly involved in service production, and changes in the way in which they play their roles and are related to suppliers can be major innovations for many services. Examples might include a greater amount of self-service for clients visiting service organizations. There is a French literature on service innovation that focuses especially on this type of innovation, identifying it as innovation in “servuction”.
# '''The Service Delivery System''' also often relates to the linkage between the service provider and its client, since delivery does involve an interaction across this interface. However, there are also internal organizational arrangements that relate to the ways in which service workers perform their job so as to deliver the critical services.  Much innovation concerns the electronic delivery of services, but we can also think of, for instance, transport and packaging innovations (e.g. pizza delivery). An emerging concept of SDP is the idea of taking a "factory" approach to Service Innovation. A [http://www.accenture.com/Global/Research_and_Insights/By_Industry/Communications/ServiceSolutions.htm "service factory" approach] is a standardized and [[industrialized]] environment for more effective service innovation, development and operations for the IP era.
# '''Technological Options''' resemble most familiar process innovation in manufacturing sectors. New information technology is especially important to services, since it allows for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the information-processing elements that are, as we have seen, prevalent to a great extent in services sectors. We also often see physical products accompanying services, such as customer loyalty cards and “smart” RFID cards for transactions, and a wide range of devices for communication services.

In practice, the majority of service innovations will almost certainly involve various combinations of these four dimensions. For instance:
* A new IT system (technology dimension) may be used to enable customer self-service (interface dimension) as in the case of a bank contacting its customers.
* The ability to track one’s order or the location of an item that one has posted or is expecting to receive.
* Services may be delivered electronically, as in the case of much online banking and cash withdrawals from ATMs.
* A new service allowing a client to examine various options and calculate what they would be paying with different types of accounts.
* A new service will often require a new service delivery system, and changes at the client interface.

An elaboration of this model to suggest six dimensions of innovation was developed in the course of work on creative sectors, by Green, Miles and Rutter. [http://www.nesta.org.uk/assets/pdf/hidden_innovation_creative_sectors_working_paper_NESTA.pdf] As well as Technology and Production process, four dimensions were specified whose linkages are very strong in creative sectors like videogames, advertising and design: Cultural Product, Cultural Concept, Delivery and User Interface.

The service innovation literature is surprisingly poorly related to the literature on new product development, which has spawned a line of study on new service development. This often focuses on the managerially important issue of what makes for successful service innovation.  See for example Johne and Storey (1998),{{ref|Johne_Storey|4|b}} who reviewed numerous New Service Development studies.

=== Services Features and Innovation Potential: Miles (1993) influential article on 'Service Innovation' ===

Ian Miles of the [[Manchester Institute of Innovation Research]] (MIoIR), The University of Manchester, is one of the scholars on the study of 'Service Innovation'. He coined the term in his 1993 article in the journal ''FUTURES'', (Vol. 25, No. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;653–672,) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V65-45P15VV-7C&amp;_user=494590&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F1993&amp;_fmt=abstract&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=5805&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000024058&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=494590&amp;md5=8c83cb9d00e681e9af5eb61b70d80682&amp;ref=full]. He listed a series of characteristic features of services, and associated these with particular types of innovation.  Such innovations are often aimed at overcoming problems associated with service characteristics like the difficulty in demonstrating the service to the client, or the problems in storing and building up stocks of the service.

After Miles (1993), numerous studies were made, one of the more recent studies that reaches similar conclusions was from a qualitative survey of service organizations by Candi (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Candi (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that the “product” related innovations below have a lot in common with new service development as discussed above.  In the following list, features of services are linked to innovation strategies by the symbol &gt;&gt;&gt;.
# '''Features of services associated with service production'''
## Technology and Plant (Low levels of capital equipment; heavy investment in buildings &gt;&gt;&gt; Reduce costs of buildings by use of teleservices, toll-free phone numbers, etc.)
## Labor (Some services highly professional, esp. requiring interpersonal skills);  others relatively unskilled, often involving casual or part-time labor.  Specialist knowledge may be important, but rarely technological skills (other than Information Technology) &gt;&gt;&gt; Reduce reliance on expensive and scarce skills by use of expert systems and related innovations; Relocation of key operations to areas of low labor costs (using telecommunications to maintain coordination).
## Organization of Labor Process (Workforce often engaged in craft-like production with limited management control of details of work. &gt;&gt;&gt; Use IT to monitor workforce (e.g. tachometers and mobile communications for transport staff;  Aim for 'flatter' organizational structures, with data from field and front-office workers directly entering databases and thence Management Information Systems.)
## Features of Production (Production is often non-continuous and economies of scale are limited &gt;&gt;&gt; Standardize production (e.g. 'fast-food' chains), reorganize in more assembly-line-like feature with more standard components and higher division of labor.)
## Organization of Industry  (Some services state-run public services; Others often small-scale with high preponderance of family firms and self-employed &gt;&gt;&gt; Externalization and privatization of public services; combination of small firms using network technologies; IT-based service management systems.)
# '''Features of services associated with service product'''
## Nature of Product (Immaterial, often information-intensive;  Hard to store or transport; Process and product hard to distinguish. &gt;&gt;&gt; Add material components (e.g. client cards, membership cards).  Use telematics for ordering, reservation, and if possible&amp;nbsp;– delivery.  Maintain elements of familiar 'user-interfaces'.)
## Features of Product (Often customized to consumer requirements.&gt;&gt;&gt; Use of Electronic Data Interchange or Internet for remote input of client details; use software to record client requirements and match to service product.
# '''Features of services associated with services consumption'''
## Delivery of Product (Production and consumption coterminous in time and space; often client or supplier has to move to meet the other party. &gt;&gt;&gt; Telematics; Automated Teller Machines and equivalent information services.)
## Role of Consumer (Services are ''consumer-intensive'', requiring inputs from consumer into design/production process. &gt;&gt;&gt;  Consumer use of standardized ''menus and new modes of delivering orders''.)
## Organization of Consumption (Often hard to separate production from consumption; Self-service in formal and informal economies commonplace.&gt;&gt;&gt; Increased use of self-service, utilizing existing consumer (or intermediate producer) technology&amp;nbsp;– e.g. telephones, PCs&amp;nbsp;– and user-friendly software interfaces.)
# '''Features of services associated with services markets'''
## Organization of Markets (Some services delivered via public sector bureaucratic provision; Some costs are invisibly bundled with goods (e.g. retail sector).&gt;&gt;&gt; Introduction of ''quasi-markets'' and/or privatization of services; New modes of charging (''pay per'' society), new reservation systems; more volatility in pricing using features of EPOS and related systems.)
## Regulation (Professional regulation common in some services. &gt;&gt;&gt; Use of databases by regulatory institutions and service providers to supply and examine performance indicators and diagnostic evidence.)
## Marketing (Difficult to demonstrate products in advance.&gt;&gt;&gt; Guarantees; demonstration packages (e.g. ''demo'' software, shareware, trial periods of use).)

Additionally, a number of more general tendencies in the innovation process in services have been noted.  These include:

# The industrialization of services, involving efforts to standardize services, to yield service products of predictable characteristics and quality, with economies of scale and improved delivery times. This typically involves the introduction of high levels of division of labor, with the use of pre-packaged and automated elements (such as pre-prepared meals, word processed templates for form letters, and the like). Standardization of the service products has become a competitive strategy for many firms.
# Organizational is innovation. Survey data suggest that services place particular emphasis on organizational change. Many innovations in services involve combinations of specific new technologies together with organization change. The role of organizational innovations in services is very apparent&amp;nbsp;– developments such as supermarkets and other self-service facilities are significant in the development of modern service industries. Such organizational innovations will often have a technological dimension, whether this be very basic (e.g. shopping trolleys), or relatively high-tech (EPOS&amp;nbsp;– electronic point of sale&amp;nbsp;– equipment or ATMs linked into networks).
# An important trajectory of organizational change has been towards [[self-servicing]], without necessarily following this development all the way toward the vision of the client sitting at home interacting with the service provider via a remote terminal. Instead, reorganization of the facilities of the service provider permits customer self-service in the service establishment, saving on labor costs and often increasing user satisfaction as it is possible to make decisions anonymously and at one's own pace.
# Beyond self-servicing, the involvement of clients as coproducers is particularly important for knowledge-intensive business services, with the emphasis being laid upon clients' role in advancing the expertise of service suppliers, and identifying new avenues for its application. Web2.0 has brought “''user innovation''” to the fore in electronic services.

There have been many methods for service innovation design and one of these is Dominant Innovation methodology which is a systematic approach to discover the gaps of service value delivery through a [[Scenario planning|scenario-based]] mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dominantinnovation.com/english/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218220259/http://dominantinnovation.com/english/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-18|title=Dominant Innovation Official Website|website=www.dominantinnovation.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant Innovation methodology is based on a visible/ and invisible matrix to map the growth gaps of product value and further develop an innovation ecosystem between evidence and supply sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|last2=AbuAli|first2=Mohamed|date=2011-01-01|title=Innovative Product Advanced Service Systems (I-PASS): methodology, tools, and applications for dominant service design|journal=The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology|volume=52|issue=9–12|pages=1161–1173|doi=10.1007/s00170-010-2763-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design and service innovation have also been combined in the context of business acceleration using the Minimum Valuable Service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pinheiro|first=Tenny|date=2014-01-01|title=The Service Startup - Design Thinking gets Lean|url=http://www.theservicestartup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MVS is an open source methodology that integrates [[lean startup]] and Service Design and it has been largely adopted by startups and large organizations like [[General Electric|Ge]] and [[Cisco]] in Silicon Valley.

== Service Innovation using IoT and Big Data Analytics ==
In the traditional [[product-service system]] (PSS) business model, industries develop product with value-added service instead of single product itself, and provide their customers services that are needed. In this relationship, the market goal of manufacturers is not one-time product selling, but continuous profit from customers by total service solution, which can satisfy unmet customers’ needs.   Most of PSS systems focus on ‘human-generated or human-related data’ instead of ‘machine-generated data or industrial data’, which may include machine controllers, sensors, manufacturing systems, etc.  Early work using web-based product monitoring for remote product services including GM OnStar Telematics, Otis Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM), and GE Medical InSite during 1990s.  Service innovation using web-based system was further developed for e-service applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|date=2003-01-01|title=Smart products and service systems for e-business transformation|journal=International Journal of Technology Management|volume=26|issue=1|pages=45–52|doi=10.1504/IJTM.2003.003143|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, more advanced approaches using predictive analytics and cyber physical systems (CPS) can harvest  large amounts of data of a variety of types to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information from industrial and manufacturing systems and integrate with business automation software for improved productivity and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|last2=Kao|first2=Hung-An|last3=Yang|first3=Shanhu|date=2014-01-01|title=Service innovation and smart analytics for industry 4.0 and big data environment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827114000857|journal=Procedia CIRP|volume=16|pages=3–8|doi=10.1016/j.procir.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imscenter.net/|title=Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems             —                  IMS Center|website=www.imscenter.net|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service innovation and public policy ==
In recent years policy makers have begun to consider the potential for promoting services innovation as part of their economic development strategies. Such consideration has, in part, been driven by the growing contribution that services activities make to national and regional economies. It also reflects the emerging recognition that traditional policy measures such as R&amp;D grants and technology transfer supports have been developed from a manufacturing perspective of the innovation process.

The [[European Commission]] and the [[OECD]] has been particularly active in seeking to generate reflection on services innovation and its policy implications. This has resulted in studies such as the OECD’s reports into knowledge intensive services,{{ref|OECD}} and the European Commission Expert Group report on services innovation&amp;nbsp;– the report of the group, "Fostering Innovation in Services"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europe-innova.org/servlet/Doc?cid=7550&amp;lg=EN Europe Innovatiob] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021052443/http://www.europe-innova.org/servlet/Doc?cid=7550&amp;lg=EN |date=2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various TrendChart studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proinno-europe.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=104&amp;parentID=52 Pro-innovation Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924232640/http://www.proinno-europe.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=104&amp;parentID=52 |date=2009-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has also launched a number of Knowledge Intensive Services Platforms designed to act as laboratories for new public policies for services innovation. Few economic development agencies at the member state level, and fewer still at the regional level, have translated this new thinking on services innovation into policy action.  Finland is an exception, where [[knowledge intensive business services]] have been a focus of much regional work (esp. the [[Uusimaa]] region).

Finland has been active in thinking about the policy implications of services innovation. This has seen '''TEKES'''&amp;nbsp;– the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation&amp;nbsp;– launch the ''SERVE'' initiative, designed to support ‘Finnish companies and research organisations in the development of innovative service concepts that can be reproduced or replicated and where some technology or systematic method is applied .’{{ref|Tekes_definition|a}}  [[Germany]] has also undertaken initiatives for services R&amp;D, and [[Canada]] and [[Norway]] have programs as well.

Ireland has been considering a services-focused innovation policy, with ''Forfás''&amp;nbsp;– its national policy and advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation&amp;nbsp;– having undertaken a review of Ireland’s existing policy and support measures for innovation, and outlined options for a new policy and framework environment in support of service innovation activity.{{ref|Forfas}}

At the regional level, limited information is available on how Europe’s regions are responding to the challenges presented by service innovation. [CM International] has recently published a European survey on services innovation and regional policy responses. The results of this suggest that very few regions in France, the UK and Ireland have an explicit focus on services and innovation. Many do, however, express a desire to address this issue in the coming future.{{ref|CMInternational}}

[[Image:Johann Heinrich Füssli 063.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''The Shade of [[Tiresias]] Appearing to [[Odysseus]] during the [[Nekyia|Sacrifice]]'' (c. 1780-85), painting by [[Johann Heinrich Füssli]], showing a scene from Book Ten of the ''[[Odyssey]]'']]

In literature and poetry, a '''shade''' (translating Greek σκιά,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dskia%2F Liddell &amp; Scott entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Latin ''umbra''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=umbra&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059 Lewis &amp; Short]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the spirit or [[ghost]] of a dead person, residing in the [[underworld]].

An underworld where the dead live in shadow is common to beliefs in the [[ancient Near East]], in [[Biblical Hebrew]] expressed by the term ''tsalmaveth'' (צַלמָוֶת: lit. "death-shadow", "shadow of death"; alternate term for [[Sheol]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H6757&amp;t=KJV Gesenius]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(edit.) Boustan, Ra'anan S. Reed, Annette Yoshiko. Heavenly Realms and Earthly Realities in Late Antique Religions. Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Witch of Endor]] in the [[Books of Samuel|First Book of Samuel]] notably conjures the ghost (''owb''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H178&amp;t=KJV Gesenius]&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Samuel]].

Only select individuals are exempt from the fate of dwelling in shadow after death, and instead ascend to the divine sphere. This is the [[apotheosis]] aspired to by kings [[imperial cult|claiming divinity]], and reflected in the veneration of [[Greek Hero cult|heroes]]. [[Plutarch]] relates how [[Alexander the Great]] was inconsolable after the death of [[Hephaistion]] up to the moment he received an [[oracle]]  of [[Amun|Ammon]] confirming that the deceased was a hero, i.e. enjoyed the status of a divinity.&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander's grief for him exceeded all reasonable measure. He ordered the manes of all the horses and mules to be cut off in sign of mourning, he struck off the battlements of all the neighbouring cities, crucified the unhappy physician, and would not permit the flute or any other musical instrument to be played throughout his camp, until a response came from the oracle of Ammon bidding him honour Hephæstion and offer sacrifice to him as to a hero." ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shades appear in Book Eleven of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', when [[Odysseus]] descends into [[Greek Underworld|Hades]], and in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', when [[Aeneas]] travels to the underworld. In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]], many of the dead are similarly referred to as shades (Italian ''ombra''), including Dante's guide, Virgil. 

The phrase "peace to thy gentle shade [and endless rest]" is sometimes seen in [[epitaph]]s, and was used by [[Alexander Pope]] in his epitaph for [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]].

'''Somaclonal variation''' is the variation seen in plants that have been produced by [[plant tissue culture]]. [[Chromosome|Chromosomal]] rearrangements are an important source of this variation.  The term  somaclonal variation is a phenomenon of broad taxonomic occurrence, reported for species of different ploidy levels, and for outcrossing and inbreeding, vegetatively and seed propagated, and cultivated and non-cultivated plants. Characters affected include both qualitative and quantitative traits.

Somaclonal variation is not restricted to, but is particularly common in, plants regenerated from [[callus (cell biology)|callus]]. The variations can be [[genotypic]] or [[phenotypic]], which in the latter case can be either genetic or [[epigenetic]] in origin. Typical genetic alterations are: changes in chromosome numbers ([[polyploidy]] and [[aneuploidy]]), chromosome structure ([[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]]s, [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]]s, [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]]s and [[Gene duplication|duplication]]s) and DNA sequence (base mutations). A typical epigenetics-related event would be [[gene methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miguel | first1 = C | last2 = Marum | first2 = L | date = Jul 2011 | title = An epigenetic view of plant cells cultured in vitro: somaclonal variation and beyond | url = http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/62/11/3713.long | journal = J Exp Bot | volume = 62 | issue = 11| pages = 3713–25 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/err155 | pmid = 21617249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaligot | first1 = E | last2 = Adler | first2 = S | last3 = Debladis | first3 = É | last4 = Beulé | first4 = T | last5 = Richaud | first5 = F | last6 = Ilbert | first6 = P | last7 = Finnegan | first7 = EJ | last8 = Rival | first8 = A | date = Dec 2011 | title = Epigenetic imbalance and the floral developmental abnormality of the in vitro-regenerated oil palm Elaeis guineensis | journal = Ann.

If no visual, [[Morphogenesis|morphogenic]] changes are apparent, other plant screening procedures must be applied. There are both benefits and disadvantages to somaclonal variation. The phenomenon of high variability in individuals from plant cell cultures or adventitious shoots has been named somaclonal variation.

==Advantages==
The major likely benefit of somaclonal variation is  plant/crop improvement. Somaclonal variation leads to the creation of additional genetic variability. Characteristics for which somaclonal mutants can be enriched during ''in vitro'' culture includes resistance to disease [[Biotoxin|pathotoxins]], herbicides, high salt concentration, mineral toxicity and tolerance to environmental or chemical stress, as well as for increased production of secondary metabolites.

suitable for breeding of new species

==Disadvantages==
A serious disadvantage of somaclonal variation occurs in operations which require clonal uniformity, as in the horticulture and forestry industries where tissue culture is employed for rapid propagation of elite genotypes.
* Sometimes leads to undesirable results
* Selected variants are random and genetically unstable
* Require extensive and extended field trials
* Not suitable for complex agronomic traits like yield, quality etc.
* May develop variants with pleiotropic effects which are not true.yes

==Reducing somaclonal variation==
Different steps can be used to reduce somaclonal variation. It is well known that increasing numbers of subculture increases the likelihood of somaclonal variation, so the number of subcultures in micropropagation protocols should be kept to a minimum. Regular reinitiation of clones from new [[Explant culture|explants]] might reduce variability over time. Another way of reducing somaclonal variation is to avoid [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]] in the culture medium, as this hormone is known to introduce variation. [[Vitrification]], commonly referred to as hyperhydricity in the tissue culture world, may be a problem in some species. Hyperhydricity is a physiological malformation that results in excessive hydration, low lignification, impaired stomatal function and reduced mechanical strength of tissue culture-generated plants. In case of forest trees, mature elite trees can be identified and rapidly cloned by this technique.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

High production cost has limited the application of this technique to more valuable ornamental crops and some fruit trees.

'''''Soul Cartel''''' ({{Korean|hangul=소울 카르텔|rr=|labels= }}) is a [[Korea]]n [[manhwa]] series written by Kim Eun-hyo and illustrated by Kim Yeong-ji. Started on 2012, this [[webtoon]] manhwa was released on [[Line Webtoon|Naver Webtoon]] and its final raw chapter was published on April 6, 2016.

==Plot==
Soul Cartel follows Si-hun Cha, a young Korean boy who is able to see the spirits of the dead. He is taken care of by his older sister, Su-In Cha, and comes from a family of powerful mediums and exorcists.  Si-hun Cha himself is lacking in any spiritual abilities whatsoever aside from his ability to see spirits. Despite this, he tries to help his sister catch weaker wayward ghosts. When chasing after one of these ghosts, he runs into a very powerful demon. The demon claims to be the [[Mephistopheles]], or shortly, Mephisto, who wants Si-hun Cha to teach him of the modern human world and bring him books about his exploits. He states that if Si-hun Cha tries to run away, he's done for. Si-hun Cha does have the common sense to consult his sister (without revealing that he's actually caught a powerful demon's attention), but he quickly learns that even his sister would be no match for Mephisto. After Mephisto finishes a copy of Faust he reveals that he came to earth because Faust has been reincarnated. Faust was a human who'd claimed that he would not be corrupted by Mephisto's temptations, so they'd entered a contractual wager, with God acting as the judge. However, according to Mephisto, God had unfairly intervened at the last moment and cost Mephisto his victory.

===Main===
'''Cha Shi-Hoon (차시훈)'''

Si-hun Cha is the main protagonist of the series. Although he is the main hero, his role in the series so far has been severely limited. This is because of his lack of strength and skills. But rest assured, he is still young and in training.

[[Mephistopheles]] (more commonly known as Mephisto) is one of the main characters of the manhwa and is the first Archdevil shown. He is also known as the Arch-devil of combat. His alter ego is [[Asura]] of Resentment.

'''Faust (파우스트)'''

[[Faust]] is a Human who due to being reborn has decided to re-engage in his battle with the Archdevil Mephisto as a means of ensuring humans are safe. Due to 'said interference from god, Mephisto has claimed he never really lost. In this battle Faust will utilizing God's Papyrus a tool with divine powers from god that can do anything but be used for evil unpure reasons. Faust has used on numerous occasions to subdue Mephisto to a degree.

'''Cha Su-In / Cha Soo-In (차수인)'''

Cha Su-In is one of the main characters of the series and is the elder sister of the protagonist Cha Shi-Hoon. She took up being a spirit medium after her parents vanished during a mysterious fight with a powerful being from the underworld. After a failed attempt to rescue them from the Underworld a few years ago, she was quietly doing her job guiding spirits to the next world when she came to know that her brother had gotten into a contract with the Archdevil Mephisto and would have to go the underworld. Upon hearing this, she decided to come along to protect her brother.

===Supporting===
=== Angels and Azraels ===
Pure angels are servants of God from birth and they maintain the peace and harmony in the underworld. They are different from Azraels, who are human souls that have gone through training to become angels

'''Michael'''

[[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] is one of the four Archangels, followers of the word of God and leader of the Angels. He often shows up in order to restrain Mephisto, although he has given aide to the party many times. Faust is branded with his crest, enabling them to communicate and for Michael to know of his whereabouts. Michael is known for having the strongest defense in the underworld, supposedly unpierced since [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]]. This has earned him the title 'The Impregnable Archangel'.

'''Cherub / Karob'''

Karob is a Head Angel who serves under Michael. He is also a part of the Special Investigations Squad, and is currently assisting the party in their search for Shi-hoon Cha and Soo-In Cha's parents.

'''Banu / Banwoo'''

'''Yago / Yago'''

Yago was an Azrael who was sent to guide the souls down the reincarnation path, but was killed by Meins on his way. He was good friends with Faust before Faust was reincarnated and they both spent time in the library reading together.

'''Philer / Filer'''

Filer is the prosecuter in the trial for creating an illegal contract between Mephisto and Faust without God's approval. He was once humiliated by Faust as a student during a debate over the worth of human life in the front of many other students and he seeks to shame Faust during the trial. However Faust was able to win against him and Filer seems to have accepted defeat.

'''Luteno / Rutano'''

Rutano is a Chief Angel who was one of the weakest as an Azrael cadet and could not graduate for 100 years, but with motivation from Michael he used his own effort to climb up to the Chief Angel position.

=== Meins ===
Meins are souls who defy God and create fake bodies for their souls to reside in. However as their bodies are fake they have to consume other souls regularly to maintain the condition of their bodies. Thus they wish for a human body for their soul to live in permanently, which is why they are desperately after Shi-Hoon and Soo-In as their young bodies can fetch a high price.

'''Minotaurus'''

A mein resembling a [[Minotaur]] who was initially chained up for his crimes. He was released by Mephisto on the condition that he cared for Mephisto's pet, [[Cerberus]].

'''Karl / Carl'''

A Mein whose ability is to jump at his opponent with great force from the ground. He was the Mein who was assigned to capture Soo-In, who lost her sense of hearing in the forest trap. But ultimately Soo-In was able to uncover his weakness and defeated him, and he was arrested along with Ethan and Carl.

'''Ison / Ethan'''

Ethan had holes in his hand from which a poisonous lemon-scented gas that can kill a person within 3 seconds emits. He was supposed to kill Faust who lost his sense of smell in the forest, but due to Faust's brilliant thinking and acting Ethan was captured instead. He, Carl and Joon were ultimately arrested by the angels.

'''Joon'''

Joon was the trap maker of the forest trap which is a level 3 maze that he spent 100 years learning how to create. However Faust caught him and trapped him inside an Infinite Maze which he (Faust) learnt and created in the blink of an eye until Joon was arrested by the angels along with Ethan and Carl

'''Nigel'''

Nigel was Mephisto's enemy from a 100 years ago when he lost the battle with Mephisto and wished to obtain revenge. While searching for Mephisto in the forest trap he came across Shi-Hoon and Karob and almost killed them until Mephisto interrupted. Ultimately, in their re-battle, Nigel was killed by Mephisto who used his the source of his fire to summon Hell's Blade and burnt him to death.

'''Gilgath / Gilgas'''

A Mein initially hired by the Nesk Trading Company in order to face off with Mephisto. He was nearing the end of his "Hell's Pilgrimage", a tedious journey in which a demon must fight and survive all 4 Archangels and Arch-devils. He only needed to fight Mephisto to complete his Hell's Pilgrimage and become a "Pluto".

'''Gairon / Giron'''

The head of the Nesk Trading Company. Gairon is an extremely powerful Mein, and the first known "Pluto". He is extremely business-oriented, and will not stop at anything to further his company's strength.

[[Beelzebub]] is the second Arch-devil to appear in Soul Cartel who consider Mephisto as a rival and is his younger twin brother by a second. He aims to overturn the Arch-devil hierarchy. He is also known as the Arch-devil of slaughter.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list.nhn?titleId=423384&amp;weekday=thu Soul Cartel webtoon Naver page ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mastema '''

[[Mastema]] is the third Arch-devil to appear in Soul Cartel and is Mephisto and Beelzebub's younger brother and Astaroth's elder brother. He is very fond of games and aims to play a game with Faust and corrupt him, something which Mephisto failed to do. In doing so, he wishes to prove that he is better than God.

'''Astaroth  / (yet to debut in LINE Webtoon)'''

[[Astaroth]] is the fourth and final Arch-devil to be introduced in Soul Cartel, and is the youngest family member out of the 4 Arch-devils. She calls herself the Mother of Devils, and is willing to do anything to ensure the devil race stand on top of the underworld hierarchic.

=== Witches ===
'''Irene / Airen'''

Irene is a young member of the Witches Clan, and the current librarian. She initially runs into the party seeking Mephisto, in order to request his help in healing the Supreme Witch. She eventually grows attached to the party, and has promised to travel with them in the future.

'''Supreme / Chief Witch Haelia'''

The Supreme Witch was the lead of the Witches Clan, and a very powerful being. She was the traitor of the witches and conspired with Meins to attack and capture Shi-Hoon, Mephisto, Faust and Soo-In.  Although she supposedly wishes the best for her clan, her ideals were ultimately misguided by her deceased daughter Risella, and she was defeated by Mephisto.

'''Liselot / Risella'''

Liselot was Supreme Witch Haelia's daughter, and was a Mein-supporter who wished for the fusion of the witches and the Meins, an idea which was objected by some of the witched. After her failure to obtain approval for conducting business with the Meins, she resorted to other measures to infiltrate the Central Tower of the witches to kill off the High Witches, which includes procuring "The Book of Spell Release" to be able to dispel the spells placed around the tower. She ends up murdering Inea and was captured by the witches and burned at the stake, but not before notifying her mother of her research and intentions.

Violin has a high position in the Council of Witches and replaced Ciole as the chairwitch after the death of Haelia. She was the witch who proposed the "Fighting Chess" game to Mephisto.

=== Human ===
'''Gretchin'''

[[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|Gretchen]] is a human, and the lover of Faust from his previous life.

A '''suicide mission''' is a task which is so dangerous for the people involved that they are not expected to survive. The term is sometimes extended to include [[suicide attack]]s such as [[kamikaze]] and [[suicide bomber|suicide bombing]]s, whose perpetrators actively commit suicide during execution of the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Monsters and Critics|title=British man on 'suicide mission' in attempted restaurant attack| url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/uk/news/article_1407237.php/British_man_on_&amp;quotsuicide_mission&amp;quot_in_attempted_restaurant_attack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1955766/Girl,-8,-'kills-Iraqi-officer-in-suicide-mission'.html|work=Daily Telegraph|location=UK|title=Girl, 8, kills Iraqui officer in suicide mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Distinctions==
The risks involved with suicide missions are not always apparent to those participating in them or to those who plan them. However, for an action to be considered a suicide mission someone involved must be aware of the risks; therefore, a mission that goes horribly wrong is not a suicide mission. Rather, in some instances, an individual or group taking part in a mission may perceive the risks involved to be far greater than what they believe to be acceptable, while those planning or commanding the mission may think otherwise; these situations can lead to refusals to participate in missions on the basis that they are "suicide missions".{{cn|date=August 2018}} Conversely, planners or commanders may be well aware of the risks involved with missions while those participating in them may not.

==Military and wartime==
In a military context, soldiers can be ordered to perform very dangerous tasks or can undertake them on their own initiative. For example, in the [[First World War]], [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|French soldiers mutinied]] ''en masse'' in 1917, after appalling losses convinced them that their participation at the front would inevitably lead to their deaths, and in October 2004, during the [[Iraq War]], [[2004 Baghdad refusal of orders|17 soldiers in the US Army]] refused orders to drive unarmored fuel trucks near [[Baghdad]], calling the task a "suicide mission". Those soldiers faced investigations for breakdown of discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/16/iraq.usa |title=Doubts about US morale in Iraq as troops refuse 'suicide mission'|newspaper= The Guardian|date= October 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the same time, many individuals or groups voluntarily undertake suicide missions in times of war. For example, both the [[Waffen SS]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] were known for executing what could be labeled as suicide missions throughout the [[Second World War]]. 

Suicide missions can also be an act of desperation, such as a [[last stand]]. The latter end of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] could be seen as a suicide mission from the German perspective, as they were ordered to fight to the death with no option of surrendering nor chance of escape.

===Special forces===
[[Special forces]] units are often sent on missions that are exceedingly dangerous with the hope that their superior training and abilities will allow them to complete them successfully and survive. An example is the desperate attempt by two U.S. [[Delta Force]] snipers to protect a downed helicopter pilot ([[Michael Durant]]) from being killed or captured by masses of Somali militia during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993. While the sniper team held off overwhelming numbers of Somalis long enough for the pilot to survive, both snipers were killed, and the pilot was eventually captured but then later released. 

However, even special forces groups refuse to participate in some missions. [[Operation Mikado]], a plan for a [[Special Air Service]] raid on [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego]] during the 1982 [[Falklands War]], was ultimately not executed due in part to significant hostility from members of the SAS who saw the mission as exceedingly risky.

==Armed hostage takings==
Armed [[hostage]] takings, particularly those planned (e.g., by a [[terrorist]] group) for political purposes, could be considered suicide missions. As most governments have a policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists, such incidents usually end with a bloody confrontation between the hostage takers and an armed force (e.g., police or military) attempting to free the hostages. In addition, such hostage takings often occur in a country foreign to the perpetrators, thereby limiting their chances of escape. Notable examples include the 1972 [[Munich massacre]], the 1977 [[Landshut Hijacking]], the 1980 [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the 1996 [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]], and the 2004 [[Beslan school hostage crisis]]. All of these high-profile hostage takings ended with the hostage takers being engaged by the military forces of the country in which the incident occurred, with the vast majority of the hostage takers being killed in the aftermath. The extent to which the hostage takers in each incident expected to survive or simply desired to capitalize on their publicity to send a message is a matter of speculation.

'''Thrombolites''' are ancient forms of microbial communities that [[photosynthesize]]. They are clotted accretionary [[structure]]s formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by [[biofilm]]s of [[microorganism]]s, especially [[cyanobacteria]]. They are now only found in a few places in the world. [[Stromatolite]]s are similar but consist of layered accretions. The ancestors of thrombolites and stromatolites are thought to have contributed to the [[Great Oxygenation Event|increase in oxygen]] in Earth's atmosphere.

==Structure==
Thrombolites have a clotted structure which lacks the laminae of stromatolites and each clot within a thrombolite mound is a separate cyanobacterial colony.&lt;ref name="kennard"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Kennard| first=John M. |last2=James |first2= Noel P.|date= October 1986|title= Thrombolites and Stromatolites: Two Distinct Types of Microbial Structure|jstor=3514631  |journal= PALAIOS|publisher= SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology|volume= 1|issue= 5|pages= |doi= 10.2307/3514631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clots are on the scale of millimetres to centimetres and may be interspersed with sand, mud or [[carbonate rock|sparry carbonate]].&lt;ref name="kennard"/&gt; The larger clots make up more than 40% of a thrombolite's volume and each clot has a complex internal structure of cells and rimmed lobes resulting primarily from the in situ [[calcification]] of the cyanobacterial colony. Very little sediment is found within the clots as the main growth method is calcification rather than sediment trapping.&lt;ref name="kennard"/&gt;

'''Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome''' ('''TTTS'''), also known as '''feto-fetal transfusion syndrome''' ('''FFTS''') and '''twin oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence''' ('''TOPS'''), is a complication of disproportionate blood supply, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. It can affect [[Monochorionic twins|monochorionic multiples]], that is, [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancies]] where two or more [[fetus]]es share a [[chorion]] and hence a single [[placenta]]. Severe TTTS has a 60–100% mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Zach T, Ford SP |title=Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome |publisher=EMedicine |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3410.htm |accessdate= July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==

As a result of sharing a single placenta, the blood supplies of [[chorion|monochorionic]] twin fetuses can become connected, so that they share blood circulation: although each fetus uses its own portion of the placenta, the connecting blood vessels within the placenta allow blood to pass from one twin to the other. It is thought that most monochorionic placentae have these "shared connections" that cross the placenta, with the net flow volumes being equal between them. This state is sometimes referred to as "flow balance". Depending on the number, type and direction of the interconnecting [[blood vessel]]s ([[anastomosis|anastomoses]]), blood can be transferred disproportionately from one twin (the "donor") to the other (the "recipient"), due to a state of "flow imbalance" imparted by new blood vessel growth across the placental "equator", the line that divides each baby's proportion of the shared placenta. This state of transfusion causes the donor twin to have decreased blood volume, retarding the donor's development and growth, and also decreased [[urine|urinary]] output, leading to a lower than normal level of [[amniotic fluid]] (becoming [[oligohydramnios]]). The blood volume of the recipient twin is increased, which can strain the fetus's heart and eventually lead to heart failure, and also higher than normal urinary output, which can lead to excess amniotic fluid (becoming [[polyhydramnios]]).

TTTS usually develops during the period of peak placental growth, starting in week 16 and proceeding through week 25; after this point, the placenta's growth decelerates, essentially stopping just after week 30. While TTTS has occasionally been detected beyond this timepoint, it is thought that its occurrence beyond week 30 may be due to a placental embolism that upsets the flow balance of the shared connections between the babies. TTTS is potentially lethal to either or both twins, no matter when it is detected. However, when detected past week 25, emergency delivery may be considered to rescue the babies if the TTTS is severe.

Other than requiring a monochorionic twin (or higher multiple) pregnancy, the underlying causes of TTTS are not known. It is not known to be hereditary or genetic.

===Imbalance in development===
Some doctors recommend complete bed-rest for the mother coupled with massive intakes of protein as a therapy to try to counteract the syndrome. Research completed shows these nutritional supplements do work. Diet supplementation was associated with lower overall incidence of TTTS (20/52 versus 8/51, P = 0.02) and with lower prevalence of TTTS at delivery (18/52 versus 6/51, P = 0.012) when compared with no supplementation. In the study, nutritional supplementation contained 250kcal, consisting of 6g of lipids, 40g of carbohydrates, 9g of protein, vitamins and minerals, consumed three times per day. Nutritional intervention also significantly prolonged the time between the diagnosis of TTTS and delivery (9.4 ± 3.7 weeks versus 4.6 ± 6.5 weeks; P = 0.014). The earlier nutritional regimen was introduced, the lesser chance of detecting TTTS ( P = 0.001). Although not statistically significant, dietary intervention was also associated with lower Quintero stage, fewer invasive treatments, and lower twin birth weight discordance. Diet supplementation appears to counter maternal metabolic abnormalities in monochorionic twin pregnancies and improve perinatal outcomes in TTTS when combined with the standard therapeutic options. Nutritional therapy appears to be most effective in mitigating cases that are caught in Quintero Stage I, little effect has been observed in those that are beyond Stage I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiossi|first=Giuseppe|title=Nutritional Supplementation in Monochorionic Diamniotic Twin Pregnancies: Impact on Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome|journal=American Journal of Perinatology|volume=25|issue=10|pages=667–72|url=https://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0028-1091400|publisher=American Journal of Perinatology|accessdate=7 August 2012|doi=10.1055/s-0028-1091400|pmid=18942043|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Quintero Stages===
A staging system is commonly used to classify the severity of TTTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Understanding the Stages of TTTS |publisher= UC San Diego |accessdate= April 23, 2012 |url= http://health.ucsd.edu/women/child/prenatal/perinatal/fetalsurgery/ttts/Pages/stages.aspx |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120410123546/http://health.ucsd.edu/women/child/prenatal/perinatal/fetalsurgery/ttts/Pages/stages.aspx |archivedate= April 10, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage I''': A small amount of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) is found around the donor twin and a large amount of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) is found around the recipient twin.

'''Stage II''': In addition to the description above, the ultrasound is not able to identify the bladder in the donor twin.

'''Stage III''': In addition to the characteristics of Stages I and II, there is abnormal blood flow in the umbilical cords of the twins.

'''Stage IV''': In addition to all of the above findings, the recipient twin has swelling under the skin and appears to be experiencing heart failure (fetal hydrops).

'''Stage V''': In addition to all of the above findings, one of the twins has died. This can happen to either twin. The risk to either the donor or the recipient is roughly equal &amp; is quite high in Stage II or higher TTTS.

The Quintero staging does not provide information about prognosis, and other staging systems have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cristina|first=Rossi|title=The Efficacy of Quintero Staging System to Assess Severity of Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome Treated with Laser Therapy: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis|volume=26|issue=7|pages=537|url=https://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0029-1215430|work=American Journal of Perinatology|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|accessdate=7 August 2012|doi=10.1055/s-0029-1215430|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Various treatments for TTTS include:

===Non treatment===
This is equivalent of zero intervention. It has been associated with almost 100% mortality rate of one or all fetuses. Exceptions to this include patients that are still in Stage 1 TTTS and are past 22 weeks' gestation.

===Adjustment of amniotic fluid===

====Serial amniocentesis====

This procedure involves removal of amniotic fluid periodically throughout the pregnancy under the assumption that the extra fluid in the recipient twin can cause preterm labor, perinatal mortality, or tissue damage. In the case that the fluid does not reaccumulate, the reduction of amniotic fluid stabilizes the pregnancy. Otherwise the treatment is repeated as necessary. There is no standard procedure for how much fluid is removed each time. There is a danger that if too much fluid is removed, the recipient twin could die. This procedure is associated with a 66% survival rate of at least one fetus, with a 15% risk of cerebral palsy and average delivery occurring at 29 weeks' gestation.

====Septostomy, or iatrogenic disruption of the dividing membrane====

This procedure involves the tearing of the dividing membrane between fetuses such that the amniotic fluid of both twins mixes under the assumption that pressure is different in either amniotic sac and that its equilibration will ameliorate progression of the disease. It has not been proven that pressures are different in either amniotic sac. Use of this procedure can preclude use of other procedures as well as make difficult the monitoring of disease progression. In addition, tearing the dividing membrane has contributed to cord entanglement and demise of fetuses through physical complications.

===Adjustment of blood supply===

====Laser therapy====
[[File:TTTS laser cartoon.JPG|thumb|Illustration of a [[Fetoscopy]] and laser ablation of connecting vessels in Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]

This procedure involves endoscopic surgery using laser to interrupt the vessels that allow exchange of blood between fetuses under the assumption that the unequal sharing of blood through these vascular communications leads to unequal levels of amniotic fluid. Each fetus remains connected to its primary source of blood and nutrition, the placenta, through the umbilical cord. This procedure is conducted once, with the exception of all vessels not having been found. The use of endoscopic instruments allows for short recovery time. This procedure has been associated with 85% survival rate of at least one fetus, with a 6–7% risk of cerebral palsy and average delivery occurring at 32–33 weeks' gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit RM, Baschat AA. (2014) Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome: prenatal diagnosis and treatment. American J of Perinatology&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS) may occur after laser surgery for TTTS (post-laser form). The spontaneous form of TAPS complicates approximately 3 to 5% of monochorionic twin pregnancies, whereas the post-laser form occurs in 2 to 13% of TTTS cases.&lt;ref&gt;Robyr R, Lewi L, Salomon LJ, Yamamoto M, Bernard JP, Deprest J et al.

Am J Obstet Gynecol 2009; 201(4):417.&lt;/ref&gt; The pathogenesis of TAPS is based on the presence of few, minuscule arterio-venous (AV) placental anastomoses (diameter &lt;1mm)&lt;ref&gt;Lopriore E, Deprest J, Slaghekke F, Oepkes D, Middeldorp JM, Vandenbussche FP et al. Placental characteristics in monochorionic twins with and without twin anemia-polycythemia sequence.

Twin anemia-polycythemia sequence: diagnostic criteria, classification, perinatal management and outcome. Fetal Diagn Ther 2010; 27(4):181-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent review found that laser coagulation resulted in fewer fetal and perinatal deaths than amnioreduction and septostomy, and recommended its use for all states of TTTS.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts D, Neilson JP, Kilby M, Gates S. (2014) Interventions for the treatment of twin–twin transfusion syndrome. Cochrane Database Syst Rev&lt;/ref&gt;

====Umbilical cord occlusion====

This procedure involves the ligation or otherwise occlusion of the umbilical cord to interrupt the exchange of blood between the fetuses. The procedure is typically offered in cases where one of the fetuses is presumed moribund and endangering the life or health of the other twin through resultant hypotension. Use of this treatment has decreased as TTTS is identified and treated in earlier stages and with better outcomes. When used, it is associated with an 85% survival rate of the remaining fetus(es) with 5% risk of cerebral palsy and a 33–39 weeks of gestation at delivery.

==Epidemiology==

Based on recent (2005) US NCHS data, the rate of multiple births is now approximately 3.4% (4,138,349 total births, of which 139,816 were twins or higher-order multiple births).
The majority of identical twins share a common (monochorionic) placenta, and of these approximately 15% go on to develop TTTS.
By extrapolating the number of expected identical twins (about one-third) from annual multiple births, and the number of twins with monochorionic placentae (about two-thirds), and from these the number thought to develop TTTS (about 15%), there are at least 4,500 TTTS cases per year in the U.S. alone: 139,816 × .33 × .66 × .15 = 4,568 cases of TTTS per year in U.S. (involving more than 9,000 babies.)
Since spontaneous pregnancy losses and terminations that occur prior to 20 weeks go uncounted by the C.D.C., this estimate of TTTS cases may be very conservative.
Although infertility treatments have increased the rate of multiple birth, they have not appreciably diluted the expected incidence of identical twins. Studies show a higher rate of identical twins (up to 20 times with IVF) using these treatments versus spontaneous pregnancy rates.

One Australian study, however, noted an occurrence of only 1 in 4,170 pregnancies, or 1 in 58 twin gestations. This distinction could be partly explained by the "hidden mortality" associated with MC multifetal pregnancies—instances lost due to premature rupture of membrane (PROM) or intrauterine fetal demise before a thorough diagnosis of TTTS can be made.&lt;ref name="texaschildrens"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Johnson, A. |author2=Moise, K.

==History==
TTTS was first described by a German [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]], [[Friedrich Schatz]], in 1875. Once defined by neonatal parameters—differences in birth weight and cord hemoglobin at the time of delivery—TTTS is now defined differently. Today, it is known that discordant fetal weights will most likely be a late manifestation, and fetal hemoglobin through cordocentesis is often equivalent in the twin pair even in severe TTTS.&lt;ref name="texaschildrens" /&gt;

===In art===
[[File:De Wikkellkinderen.jpeg|thumb|right|''De Wikkelkinderen'' (The Swaddled Children), 1617, by an unknown artist, is thought to depict TTTS.]]

A painting known as the ''De Wikkelkinderen'' (The Swaddled Children), from 1617, is thought to represent a depiction of TTTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berger H, de Waard F, Molenaar Y | title = A case of twin-to-twin transfusion in 1617 | journal=Lancet | volume = 356 | issue = 9232 | pages = 847–8 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11022944 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02665-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawing shows twins that appear to be identical, but one is pale (possibly [[anemia|anemic]]), while the other is red (possibly [[polycythemia|polycythemic]]). Analysis of the family histories of the owners of the painting suggests that the twins did not survive to adulthood, although whether that is due to TTTS is uncertain.

'''Vasily Vasilievich Rozanov''' ({{lang-ru|Васи́лий Васи́льевич Рóзанов}}; {{OldStyleDate|2 May|1856|20 April}} &amp;ndash; 5 February 1919) was one of the most controversial [[Russia]]n writers and philosophers of the pre-[[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]]ary epoch.

==Views==
Rozanov tried to reconcile Christian teachings with ideas of healthy [[sex]] and family life, though as his adversary [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] put it, "to set up sex in opposition to the Word". Because of references to the [[phallus]] in Rozanov's writings, [[Klaus von Beyme]] called him the [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] of the Russian [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von Beyme, ''Politische Theorien im Zeitalter der Ideologien'', Wiesbaden 2002, pp. 604-05&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozanov's mature works are personal diaries containing intimate thoughts, [[impromptu]] lines, unfinished maxims, vivid [[aphorism]]s, reminiscences, and short [[essay]]s. These works, in which he thus attempted to recreate the intonations of speech, form a loosely connected [[trilogy]], comprising ''Solitaria'' (1911) and the two volumes of ''Fallen Leaves'' (1913 and 1915).

Rozanov frequently referred to himself as [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s "Underground Man" and proclaimed his right to espouse contrary opinions at the same time. He first attracted attention in the 1890s when he published political sketches in the conservative newspaper ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|Novoye Vremya]]'', owned and run by [[Aleksey Suvorin]]. Rozanov's comments, always paradoxical and sparking controversy, led him into clashes with the [[Tsarist]] government and with radicals such as [[Lenin]]. For example, Rozanov readily passed from criticism of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], and even of what he saw as the Christian preoccupation with death, to fervent praise of [[Christianity|Christian faith]], from praise of [[Judaism]] to unabashed [[anti-Semitism]], and from acceptance of [[homosexuality]] as yet another side of human nature to vitriolic accusations that [[Gogol]] and some other writers had been latent homosexuals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} He proclaimed that politics was "obsolete" because "God doesn't want politics any more," constructed an "apocalypse of our times," and recommended the "healthy instincts" of the Russian people, their longing for authority, and their hostility to modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilij Rozanov: ''The Apocalypse of Our Times'', 1977, pp. 204, 443, 483&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozanov starved to death in a monastery in the hungry years following the Revolution. His work was suppressed and largely forgotten in the [[Soviet Union]], though there were some prominent writers, including [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Venedikt Erofeev]]  among his admirers, and his ideas are thought to have exercised an influence on [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s approach to the everyday world of existence (быт/''byt'') as utopic.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Ure, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XvmoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 ''Vasilii Rozanov and the Creation: The Edenic Vision and the Rejection of Eschatology''], Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011 pp. 7, 204, n. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, his paradoxical writings have once again become available to Russian readers, and there has been somewhat of a resurgence among readers sympathetic to Rozanov's political views. Rozanov is the main source of inspiration for [[Dmitry Galkovsky]]'s [[philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]] ''The Infinite Deadlock'' (1988), which revises 19th-century Russian history and places Rozanov at the center of Russian philosophical thought. Rozanov remains little known outside Russia, though some western scholars have become increasingly fascinated by his work and his persona.

'''Venom''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with [[Spider-Man]]. The character is a sentient alien [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] with an amorphous, liquid-like form, who requires a host, usually human, to bond with for its survival. After bonding with a human host, the Symbiote bestows its enhanced powers upon the host. When the Venom Symbiote bonds with a human, that new dual-life form usually refers to itself as "Venom". The Symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988).

The Venom Symbiote's first human host was Spider-Man, who eventually separated himself from the creature in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #258 (November 1984)&lt;ref name=Amazing258&gt;{{cite comic |writer=[[Tom DeFalco]] |penciller=[[Ron Frenz]] |inker=[[Josef Rubinstein]] |story=The Sinister Secret of Spider-Man's New Costume |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume= |issue=258 |date=November 1984 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with a brief rejoining in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #1, five months later),&lt;ref name=Web1&gt;{{cite comic |story=Til Death Do Us Part! |title=[[Web of Spider-Man]] |writer=[[Simonson, Louise]] |penciller=LaRocque, Greg |inker=Mooney, Jim |publisher=Marvel Comics |volume=1 | issue=1 |date=April 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he discovered its true nefarious nature. The Symbiote went on to merge with other hosts, most notably [[Eddie Brock]], its second and most infamous host, with whom it first became Venom and one of Spider-Man's [[archenemy|archenemies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=10550 |title=Venom: Dark Origin #5 - Marvel Comics Catalog: The Official Site - Iron Man, Hulk, Spider-Man, X-Men, Wolverine and all Marvel Comics and Graphic Novels &amp;#124; Marvel Comics Catalog |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived by a Marvel Comics reader from [[Norridge, Illinois]] named Randy Schueller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller’s Brush With Comic History &amp;#124 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=May 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Jim Shooter]], Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's interest in the idea, which they ended up purchasing from him for $220.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG August 3, 1982 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104171743/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG |date=November 4, 2015 }}.

Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]], with artist [[Mike Zeck]] designing the black-and-white costume.&lt;ref name=PeterDavid&gt;[[David, Peter]] (June 4, 1993). "The Wacko Theory", ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', Reprinted in the collection ''But I Digress'' (1994). pp. 104-106&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] states on his website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on '' [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] '' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who established that the costume was a sentient alien being that was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]].

The Symbiote was first introduced as Spider-man's new black costume in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #252 (May 1984) as part of a story called "Homecoming!" The story takes place after Spider-Man's return from the events of the miniseries ''[[Secret Wars]]'', where he first obtains the black costume. The full first appearance of Venom is in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988), after the Symbiote bonds with Eddie Brock.

===Spider-Man (Peter Parker)===

The story of how Spider-Man gets his new black costume is recounted in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]'' #8 (December 1984), in which writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck depicted the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe transported to another planet called Battleworld by a being called the [[Beyonder]]. After Spider-Man's costume is ruined from battles with the villains, he is directed by Thor and the Hulk to a room at the heroes' base where they inform him a machine can read his thoughts and instantly fabricate any type of clothing. Choosing a machine he believes to be the correct one, Spider-Man causes a black sphere to appear before him, which spreads over his body, dissolving the tattered old costume and covering his body to form a new black and white costume. To Spider-Man's surprise, the costume can mimic street clothes and provides a seemingly inexhaustible and stronger supply of webbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|story=Invasion!|title=[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars]]|issue=1|writer=[[Shooter, Jim]]|penciller=[[Zeck, Mike]]|inker=[[Beatty, John]]; [[Abel, Jack]]; [[Esposito, Mike]]|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.687 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091004145420/http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.687 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 4, 2009 |title=Venom: The Sordid History of Spider-Man's Black Costume |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=November 29, 2006 |accessdate=2010-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz established that the costume was a sentient alien Symbiote that was vulnerable to both fire and high sonic energy. It was in that storyline that the costume would envelop Peter Parker while he slept, and go out at night to fight crime, leaving Parker inexplicably exhausted in the morning. Parker had the costume examined by [[Reed Richards]], who discovered that it was alive, and when Parker realized it was trying to permanently bond to Parker's body, he rejected it, and it was subsequently contained by the Fantastic Four.&lt;ref name=Amazing258/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Byrne, John]].

===Eddie Brock===



David Michelinie would later write the backstory of [[Eddie Brock]] as the alien's new host that would become the villain Venom, using the events of [[Peter David]]'s 1985 "[[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin Eater]]" storyline in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' as a basis for Brock's origin.&lt;ref name=PeterDavid /&gt; Venom's existence was first indicated in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September 1986), when he shoved [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's [[spider-sense]] warning him, though only Brock's hand was seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but found a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense. Venom made his cameo appearance on the last page of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #299 (April 1988), when he terrorized Parker's wife, [[Mary Jane Watson]], and made his full appearance in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #300 (May 1988).&lt;ref name="ComicsPriceGuide"&gt;[http://comicspriceguide.com/collection/marvel/amazing-spider-man/300/xbvwh], "Amazing Spider-man #300 Vol 1", Comics Price Guide, accessed March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spider-Man would confront him in the following issue, when Brock reveals that he was a ''Daily Globe'' reporter who worked on the Sin-Eater case, and that his career was ruined when it was discovered that the man Brock announced as the Sin-Eater was a compulsive confessor. Forced to eke out a living writing lurid stories for venomous tabloids, Brock blamed Spider-Man for his predicament. He took up bodybuilding to reduce stress. It failed to do so, and Brock sank into a suicidal depression. Seeking solace at the church where Spider-Man repelled the Symbiote, the Symbiote—sensing Brock's hatred for Spider-Man—bonded with the disgraced reporter. Brock took on the name Venom in reference to the sensationalistic material he was forced to traffic in following his fall from grace.&lt;ref name=ASM300&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[David Michelinie]]|artist=[[Todd McFarlane]]|story=Venom|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=300|date=May 1988|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/universe/Venom |title=(Eddie Brock) - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, as the Symbiote gained more intelligence and moved to additional human hosts, the name began to apply to the Symbiote as well as its hosts. As Venom, Brock fights Spider-Man many times, winning on several occasions. Venom repeatedly tries to kill Peter Parker/[[Spider-Man]]—both when the latter was in and out of costume. Thus Parker is forced to abandon his "black costume", which the Symbiote had been mimicking, after Venom confronts Parker's wife [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=David Michelenie|artist=Todd McFarlane|story=Survival of the Hittist|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|issue=299|date=April 1988|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as helping Eddie Brock to seek continued revenge against Spider-Man, the Symbiote also aids Brock in a sporadic career as a [[vigilante]]. He and the Symbiote occasionally share a desire to protect innocent people from harm, even if it means working side-by-side with the hated Spider-Man. This is especially true when Venom combats the entity he believes to be his spawn, Carnage. When Spider-Man helps Venom save Brock's ex-wife Anne Weying, the two form a temporary truce, though this falls apart after Weying's suicide.&lt;ref name=ASM375&gt;{{cite comic|writer=David Michelinie|penciller=Mark Bagley|inker=Randy Emberlin|story=Spidey Vs.

''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man''. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, Eddie Brock and the Symbiote go their separate ways as the Symbiote grows tired of having a diseased host and Eddie rejects its growing bloodlust, leading him to sell the Symbiote at a super villain auction.

The creature that would become Venom was born to a race of extraterrestrial [[symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]]s, which lived by possessing the bodies of other life-forms. The parasites would endow their victims with enhanced physical abilities, at the cost of fatally draining them of adrenaline.{{issue|date=May 2014}} According to the 1995 "[[Planet of the Symbiotes]]" storyline, the Venom Symbiote was deemed insane by its own race after it was discovered that it desired to commit to its host rather than use it up. The Symbiote was then imprisoned on [[Battleworld]] to ensure it did not pollute the species' gene pool.{{issue|date=May 2014}}

The symbiote bonds with its new host, Lee Price, launching volume 3 of the ''Venom'' comic book series. The series ran for six issues total (Nov. 2016-April 2017). Eddie Brock is able to regain the Venom symbiote at the conclusion of the series, returning the ''Venom'' comic book title to volume 1 with issue #150.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Venom'' Vol. 3 #6.

===Mac Gargan===

The Venom Symbiote approaches '''[[Mac Gargan]]''', the villain formerly known as [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], and offered him new abilities as the second Venom.&lt;ref name=MKSpidey9&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Mark Millar|penciller=Terry Dodson|inker=[[Rachel Dodson]]|story=The Last Stand, Part 1 of 4|title=Marvel Knights Spider-Man|issue=9|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gargan bonded with the creature, which would later give him an extra edge as part of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Twelve]].&lt;ref name=MKSpidey10&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Mark Millar|penciller=Terry Dodson|inker=Rachel Dodson|story=The Last Stand, Part 2 of 4|title=Marvel Knights Spider-Man|issue=10|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] dealt with the rest of the Twelve, Spider-Man swiftly defeated Gargan, even with these additional powers, which Spider-Man suggests is attributed to the fact that Mac Gargan does not hate Spider-Man as much as Eddie Brock did.&lt;ref name=MKSpidey11&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Mark Millar|penciller=Terry Dodson|inker=Rachel Dodson|story=The Last Stand, Part 3 of 4|title=Marvel Knights Spider-Man|issue=11|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venom Thunderbolts.png|thumb|upright|left|Mac Gargan as the fourth host and the second Venom]]
Gargan later became a member of a sub-group of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Mark Millar|penciller=[[Steve McNiven]]|inker=[[Dexter Vines]]|story=Civil War, Part Four of Seven|title=[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]|issue=4|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was drafted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|editor=[[Tom Brevoort]], Molly Lazer and [[Joe Quesada]]|artist=[[Leinil Francis Yu]]|title=Civil War: Choosing Sides|issue=1|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive New Avengers. It was then revealed that he had been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Symbiote in check.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire Vol. 2'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

When in the Venom persona, Gargan retained very little of his original personality and was controlled almost completely by the Symbiote, which drove him to cannibalism. When the Symbiote was dormant in his body, he expressed nausea and fear of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Warren Ellis]]|artist=[[Mike Deodato]]|title=[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]|issue=112|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a fight with "Anti-Venom" (Eddie Brock), he and his Symbiote were separated, and the Venom Symbiote was nearly destroyed. Blobs of it still existed in his bloodstream, however, so Osborn injected Gargan with a vaccine for Anti-Venom's healing powers, which restored the Symbiote by causing the remaining pieces of it to expand rapidly. Gargan dons a Scorpion battle armor over the Symbiote while it heals, causing him to become what Spider-Man calls "Ven-orpion" although when the Symbiote is fully restored it shatters the armor.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

After ingesting a chemical given to him by Norman Osborn, Venom transforms into a more human appearance similar to the Black-Suited Spider-Man.

===Flash Thompson===

{{Main|Flash Thompson}}
On December 9, 2010, [[Marvel Comics]] announced a new "black ops" Venom owned by the government. This new Venom was featured in a new series called ''Venom'' in March 2011. The birth of the new Venom can be seen in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #654 in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/113/1139513p1.html |title=New Venom |publisher=IGN|date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 2011, the identity of "black ops" Venom was revealed to be '''[[Flash Thompson]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15094/the_next_big_thing_venom|title=The Next Big Thing: Venom|accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifanboy.com/content/articles/New_Venom_Identity_REVEALED |title=New Venom Identity Revealed |publisher=ifanboy.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2011-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130225456/http://www.ifanboy.com/content/articles/New_Venom_Identity_REVEALED |archivedate=2011-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flash is hired by the government to be a special agent wearing the Venom Symbiote. Flash is only allowed to wear the suit for up to 48 hours, or risk a permanent bonding with the Symbiote. Along with the alien, Flash is equipped with a "Multi-Gun" designed to change into any type of gun Flash needs. The Government is also equipped with a "kill switch" designed to take Flash out if he loses control. Flash rejects the kill switch and later joins the [[Secret Avengers]],&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 1 Issues 23-37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thunderbolts (comics)#Red Hulk.27s Thunderbolts|Thunderbolts]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' Volume 2 issue 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guardians of the Galaxy]],&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and even becomes appointed by the Klyntar a Space Knight.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom: Space Knight'' Vol. 1 1-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lee Price===

After being separated from Flash Thompson through unspecified means, the Venom symbiote happens upon a black market deal between [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]'s gang and Tombstone's gang. He resorts to bonding with one of the men present, a discharged Army Ranger named Lee Price who was with Scorpion as part of Black Cat's gang. The weakened symbiote pleads with Price, attempting to convince him to become a hero like Thompson. Price ignores and overpowers it, intent on using it for personal gain as a new, wholly villainous Venom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Costa|penciller = Gerardo Sandoval|inker = Gerardo Sandoval|colorist = Dono Sanchez Almara|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Devin Lewis|title = Venom|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = 23 November 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Price makes his way to Black Cat's hideout where Scorpion accuses him of botching the black market sale by causing the shoot-out. After having to keep the Venom symbiote from attacking Black Cat, Lee Price takes his leave from Black Cat's lair as Scorpion gets suspicious towards Lee. His departure is seen by some FBI Agents. Lee Price later gets attacked by Tombstone's minion Firebug. Upon defeating Firebug, an FBI Agent with a bazooka appears telling Lee Price that he is under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' Vol. 3 #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Price eventually loses the symbiote when Eddie Brock and Spider-Man take him down and he is arrested by the NYPD.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

While incarcerated at the New York Corrections Supermax Facility for Superhuman Incarceration, Lee Price is feared by most of the inmates and he even defeats three inmates in the prison's cafeteria when they try to kill him to boost their reputation. Lee swears to get out, reclaim the Venom symbiote, and plan revenge on those who have wronged him.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #155&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Price is later visited by his [[lawyer]] who tells him that two of the inmates he defeated had died in the infirmary and that Venom has resurfaced upon it being revealed in the news.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #157&lt;/ref&gt; At the courthouse, Lee Price's lawyer stated that Lee's actions as Venom were caused by the Venom symbiote while the opposing lawyer mentions about Venom still being at large. The judge then asked for some evidence to help with the trial. After the trial, Lee Price is released from prison and begins his plans to reclaim the Venom symbiote and take revenge on those who have wronged him.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #158&lt;/ref&gt;

In Venom Inc., Lee Price steals the [[Mania (symbiote)|Mania]] symbiote from Andy and becomes '''Maniac'''. He uses the symbiote to infect the crime bosses and become a criminal kingpin, but he is defeated by Spider-Man, Venom, Black Cat and [[Flash Thompson|Agent Anti-Venom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Venom Inc''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tel-Kar===
It is revealed in ''Venom: First Host'' that Peter Parker is not Venom's first host. Venom's first host is actually a ''[[Kree]]'' soldier named [[Kree|Tel-Kar]]. The Kree, desiring to replicate ''[[Skrull]]'' shapeshifting abilities, obtain the newborn Venom, which had been outcast from the other symbiotes. Tel-Kar is recruited to be bonded to the newborn symbiote so that he can infiltrate the Skrull army. Tel-Kar's body is biologically altered so he can have full control over the symbiote's mind to the point of erasing its memories. Separated from Tel-Kar after his capture by the Skrulls, the symbiote goes on to be bonded to Spider-Man. &lt;ref&gt; Venom First Hostm #1 Marvel Comics. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Spider-Man Annual #1 Marvel Comics. (2018) &lt;/ref&gt;

Tel-Kar escapes the Skrulls and wanders through the Galaxy until he hears of an agent from Earth called [[Flash Thompson]] with a black symbiote suit. Recognizing it as his symbiote, he goes to Earth to find it. Eddie Brock arrives with the symbiote and saves Tel-Kar from the Warbride Skrull M'Lanz, who had followed him. Angered by Venom's refusal to return to him, Tel-Kar threatens to kill Venom's latest offspring. Acceding to Tel-Kar, Venom reunites with him and they go to a Skrull research base to get a Skrull bioweapon. Simultaneously, Eddie is bonded to the offspring calling itself [[Symbiote (comics)|Sleeper]] and allies with M'Lanz to stop Tel-Kar. During the ensuing battle, Tel-Kar concludes that he doesn't need Venom anymore and uses an electrified spear to detach himself from it. Later he is betrayed by the Kree Empire while Eddie escapes with Venom and M'Lanz with Sleeper. Tel-Kar, now furious, attempts to release the bioweapon on Earth. Sleeper bonds to Tel-Kar and lobotomizes him. Sleeper, now with Tel'Kar's body, wishes Eddie farewell and goes to explore the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom First Host''. #5 Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other hosts===
There have been other, shorter term hosts for the symbiote.

==== Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly) ====
In the [[Planet of the Symbiotes]] storyline, the symbiote was rejected by Eddie, causing it to release a powerful scream that attracts the other symbiotes to Earth. Subsequently the symbiote sees [[Scarlet Spider]], (Ben Reilly) and takes the form of his hooded top attempting to bond to Ben mistaking him for Spider-man. When it was later discovered by Brock and Peter Parker, the symbiote returned to Eddie.

==== Anne Weying ====
[[File:Brideofvenom.png|thumb|upright|right|Anne Weying, the bride of Venom]]
{{main|Anne Weying}}
'''Anne Weying''' first appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #375. She is Eddie Brock's ex-wife and a successful lawyer. Weying assists Spider-Man by sharing some of Brock's history. Later, she follows Spider-Man to the amusement park where Venom had Peter's (fake) parents. She confronts Brock and manages to convince him to end his feud. After [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] shoots Ann as part of a crusade against social injustice, Ann becomes She-Venom when the Venom Symbiote temporarily bonds with her to save her life. She-Venom lashes out against the men who had hurt her, and Brock becomes afraid for her (and of her) and compels the Symbiote to return to him. Ann is left distraught at her actions while bonded. Later Ann is arrested on a false charge as part of a trap for Venom. She manages to warn Brock who sends the Symbiote to her, allowing her to become She-Venom and escape custody. Some time later, Ann, traumatized by her experiences with Venom and the Symbiote, commits suicide after seeing Spider-Man pass by her window in a black costume, believing it is Brock returning for her.&lt;ref name="ASMv2#22"/&gt;

The story follows U.S. Army communication specialist '''Patricia Robertson'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; During a supply run to an Ararat Corporation owned outpost she discovers everyone at the installation dead except for one scientist. It is revealed that the Ararat Corporation is run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots led by an entity named Bob, that have infiltrated the American government. The Ararat Corporation has cloned Venom to facilitate the extermination of humanity, but the clone ravages its hosts.

But Carol gathered her powers and detached from the symbiote which rebonded to Mac.

==== Red Hulk (Thunder Bolt Ross) ====
When [[Red Hulk]] came crashing into to Flash's apartment so he can recruit him, the symbiote sensing Red Hulk as danger, briefly bonds to him so he doesn't any harm to Flash. Then when Red Hulk calms down, the symbiote went to Flash.

====Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus)====

While Flash was recovering, Superior Spider-Man put the symbiote in a canister and gave Flash a pair of prosthetic legs.

After bonding to the symbiote Otto called himself the '''Superior Venom''' and went solving crime in a much brutal way. Then [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] called the Avengers to stop the Superior Venom.

A bout of temporary insanity that the Venom symbiote subsequently experiences is eventually discerned to have been caused by its brief fusion with Mercurio, whose evil had undone the mental "cleansing" that the creature had earlier undergone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Robbie Thompson|penciller = Kim Jacinto and Ario Anindito|inker = Kim Jacinto and Ario Anindito|colorist = Java Tartaglia and Andrew Crossley|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Jake Thomas|title = Venom: Space Knight|volume = 1|issue = #10|date = 27 July 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Venom Vol 3 1 Variant.png|thumb|upright|The Symbiote enhances the physical strength of its host. Art from the variant cover of ''Venom'' vol. 3, #1 (November 2016) by [[Clayton Crain]].]]
Though it requires a living host in order to survive, the Venom symbiote has been shown to be adept at fending for itself independent of a host. The Symbiote is capable of shapeshifting abilities, including the ability to form spikes or expand its size,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Daniel Way]]|penciller=Francisco Herrera|inker=Carlos Lobo Cuevas|title=Venom|story=Patterns. Part 2|issue=12|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as mimic the appearance of other humanoids after it has obtained a host. The organism can additionally use its shape-shifting abilities to conceal itself by altering its coloration or by becoming completely invisible. It also contains a small "dimensional aperture", allowing its hosts to carry items without adding mass to the costume. The Symbiote also exhibits telepathic abilities, primarily when it needs to communicate with its host.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Because of its contact with Spider-Man, the Symbiote grants all of its subsequent hosts that hero's powers and cannot be detected by his spider-sense. As Spider-Man's fighting style is partly dependent on his spider-sense, his effectiveness was somewhat hampered when he battled Eddie Brock. Retaining its memory from the time it was bonded with Spider-Man, Venom is also capable of producing webbing similar to Spider-Man's own variety created from itself.&lt;ref name=ASM300/&gt;

The Symbiote greatly enhances the physical strength of those it bonds with. Its hosts experience a vastly larger size and musculature. The Symbiote displays non-human teeth, which are very sharp, and commonly protrudes a long tongue from its mouth. Venom is depicted as being physically much bigger than Spider-Man, as well as having more brute strength.

Venom exhibits some immunities to the supernatural powers of others such as the Penance Stare of [[Ghost Rider]] or Spider-Man's extrasensory spider-sense. 

Some incarnations of the Venom Symbiote have shown it able to replicate itself. This ability is shown in the 2005–2006 miniseries ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'', when Venom recreates his own Symbiote to combat his loneliness.

The Venom Symbiote is vulnerable to fire and sonic waves, causing it great pain and exhaustion if it sustains enough exposure. It can sense and track all of its offspring Symbiotes except [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], who learned how to block this ability shortly after bonding with Cletus Kasady and confronting Venom/Eddie Brock for the first time.&lt;ref name=ASM361-363/&gt;

The Venom symbiote is shown to form giant Web-like dragon wings when it was in contact with [[Symbiotes|Knull]].

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Venom}}
