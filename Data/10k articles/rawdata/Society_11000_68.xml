In addition, many native speakers of [[Bantu languages]] and [[South African English|English]] also speak Afrikaans as a second language. It is taught in schools, with about 10.3 million second-language students.&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt; One reason for the expansion of Afrikaans is its development in the public realm: it is used in newspapers, radio programs, TV, and several translations of the [[Bible]] have been published since the first one was completed in 1933.&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt;

In neighbouring [[Namibia]], Afrikaans is widely spoken as a second language and used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'',{{refn|Some 85% of Namibians can understand Afrikaans; see {{harvnb|Bromber|Smieja|2004|p=73}}.&lt;br /&gt;There are 152,000 native speakers of Afrikaans in Namibia; see {{harvnb|Deumert|Vandenbussche|2003|p=16}}.&lt;br /&gt;Afrikaans is a lingua franca of Namibia; see {{harvnb|Deumert|2004|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Adegbija|1994|p=26}}, {{harvnb|Batibo|2005|p=79}}, {{harvnb|Donaldson|1993|p=xiii}}, {{harvnb|Deumert|Vandenbussche|2003|p=16}}, {{harvnb|Baker|Prys Jones|1997|p=364}}, {{harvnb|Domínguez|López|1995|p=399}}, {{harvnb|Page|Sonnenburg|2003|p=8}}, {{harvnb|CIA|2010}}.|group="n"}} while as a native language it is spoken in 10.4% of households, mainly concentrated in the capital [[Windhoek]], Walvis Bay, Swakopmund and the southern regions of [[Hardap Region|Hardap]] and [[ǁKaras Region|ǁKaras]].{{refn|Afrikaans is spoken in 11&amp;nbsp;percent of Namibian households; see {{harvnb|Namibian Population Census|2001}}.

==Etymology==
The term is ultimately derived from the Dutch term ''{{lang|nl|Afrikaans-Hollands}}'' meaning "African Dutch".

==History==

===Origin===
The Afrikaans language arose in the [[Dutch Cape Colony]], through a gradual divergence from European Dutch dialects, during the course of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="omniglot.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/afrikaans.htm |title=Afrikaans |work=Omniglot |accessdate=22 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/8437/Afrikaans-language |title=Afrikaans language |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=22 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831105055/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/8437/Afrikaans-language|archivedate=31 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the mid-18th century and as recently as the mid-20th century, Afrikaans was known in standard Dutch as a "kitchen language" ({{lang-af|kombuistaal|links=no}}), lacking the prestige accorded, for example, even by the educational system in Africa, to languages spoken outside Africa. Other early epithets setting apart ''{{lang|nl|Kaaps Hollands}}'' ("Cape Dutch", i.e. Afrikaans) as putatively beneath official Dutch standards included ''{{lang|nl|geradbraakt}}'', ''{{lang|nl|gebroken}}'' and ''{{lang|nl|onbeschaafd Hollands}}'' ("mutilated/broken/uncivilised Dutch"), as well as ''{{lang|nl|verkeerd Nederlands}}'' ("incorrect Dutch").&lt;ref&gt;Alatis, Hamilton, Ai-Hui Tan (2002).

A relative majority of the first settlers whose descendants today are the [[Afrikaner]]s were from the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] (now [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]]),&lt;ref name="zastudy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Area Handbook for the Republic of South Africa|last=Kaplan|first=Irving|pages=46–771}}&lt;/ref&gt; though up to one-sixth of the community was also of French [[Huguenot]] origin, and a seventh from Germany.&lt;ref name="Britannica1933"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1933|title=Cape Colony|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|editor=James Louis Garvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African and Asian workers and slaves contributed to the development of Afrikaans. The slave population was made up of people from East Africa, West Africa, [[India]], [[Madagascar]], and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern [[Indonesia]]).&lt;ref name="Worden"&gt;{{cite book | last = Worden| first = Nigel| authorlink = | title = Slavery in Dutch South Africa|edition= 2010|pages= 40–43 | publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0521152662}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number were also indigenous [[Khoisan]] people, who were valued as interpreters, domestic servants, and labourers. Many free and enslaved women married, cohabited with, or were victims of sexual violence from the male Dutch settlers. M. F. Valkhoff argued that 75% of children born to female slaves in the Dutch Cape Colony between 1652 and 1672 had a Dutch father.{{sfnp|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=252–254}} Some consider this the origin of the ethnic group, the [[Cape Coloured]]s, who adopted various forms of speech utilising a Dutch vocabulary. Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman argue that Afrikaans' development as a separate language was "heavily conditioned by nonwhites who learned Dutch imperfectly as a second language."{{sfnp|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|p=256}}

Beginning in about 1815, Afrikaans started to replace [[Malay language|Malay]] as the language of instruction in [[Muslim]] schools in [[South Africa]], written with the [[Arabic alphabet]]: see [[Arabic Afrikaans]]. Later, Afrikaans, now written with the [[Latin script]], started to appear in newspapers and political and religious works in around 1850.&lt;ref name="omniglot.com" /&gt;

In 1875, a group of Afrikaans-speakers from the Cape formed the ''{{lang|af|[[Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners|Genootskap vir Regte Afrikaanders]]}}'' ("Society for Real Afrikaners"),&lt;ref name="omniglot.com"/&gt; and published a number of books in Afrikaans including grammars, dictionaries, religious materials and histories. In 1925, Afrikaans was recognised by the South African government as a real language, rather than simply a slang version of Dutch proper.&lt;ref name="omniglot.com"/&gt;

===Recognition===
Afrikaans was considered a Dutch [[dialect]] in South Africa until the early 20th century, when it became recognised as a distinct language under South African law, alongside Standard Dutch, which it eventually replaced as an official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keylanguages.com/new_english/afrikaans.html |title=Afrikaans Language Courses in London |publisher=Keylanguages.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812185524/http://www.keylanguages.com/new_english/afrikaans.html |archivedate=12 August 2007 |date= |accessdate=22 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Military history of South Africa#Boer Wars|Boer Wars]] (1880–81 and 1899–1902), "and indeed for some time afterwards, Afrikaans was regarded as inappropriate for educated discourse.  Rather, Afrikaans was described derogatorily as ‘a kitchen language’ or as ‘a bastard jargon', suitable for communication mainly between the Boers and their servants."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/emoryac/detail.action?docID=10096117|title=Language Planning &amp; Policy S. : Language Planning and Policy in Africa : Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa|last=Kaplan and Baldauf|first=Robert B. and Richard B.|access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  23 years after the Second Boer War ended in 1902, mostly due to the efforts of the Afrikans Language Movement&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  on 8 May 1925, the Official Languages of the Union Act No 8 of 1925 was passed at a joint sitting of the House of Assembly and the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/afrikaans-becomes-official-language-union-south-africa|title=Afrikaans becomes the official language of the Union of South Africa|last=|first=|date=16 March 2011|website=South African History Online|access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which 'Dutch' was "[[Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925|declared to include Afrikaans]]".  The [[South African Constitution of 1961|Constitution of 1961]] reversed the position of Afrikaans and Dutch, so that English and Afrikaans were the official languages and Afrikaans was deemed to include Dutch. The [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution of 1983]] removed any mention of Dutch altogether.

The [[Afrikaans Language Monument]] (''{{lang|af|Afrikaanse Taalmonument}}'') is located on a hill overlooking [[Paarl]], [[Western Cape Province]], [[South Africa]]. Officially opened on 10 October 1975,&lt;ref name="Botha-speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2005/05111709451003.htm |title=Speech by the Minister of Art and Culture, N Botha, at the 30th anniversary festival of the Afrikaans Language Monument |date=10 October 2005 |publisher=[[South African Department of Arts and Culture]] |language=Afrikaans |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604111627/http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2005/05111709451003.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; it commemorates the 50th anniversary of Afrikaans being declared an official language of South Africa in distinction to [[Dutch language|Dutch]].  It was erected in Paarl on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the ''{{lang|af|[[Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners]]}}'' (Society of Real [[Afrikaner]]s), an organisation which helped to strengthen Afrikaner identity and linguistic pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles S.

===Standardisation===
[[File:Pretoriase kunsmuseum 1.jpg|thumb|The side view of the [[Pretoria Art Museum]] in [[Arcadia, Pretoria]], with an Afrikaans language sign.]]
The linguist Paul Roberge suggested the earliest 'truly Afrikaans' texts are [[doggerel|doggerel verse]] from 1795 and a dialogue transcribed by a Dutch traveller in 1825. Printed material among the Afrikaners at first used only standard European Dutch. By the mid-19th century, more and more were appearing in Afrikaans, which was very much still regarded as a set of regional dialects.

In 1861, L.H. Meurant published his ''{{lang|af|Zamenspraak tusschen Klaas Waarzegger en Jan Twyfelaar}}'' ("Conversation between Claus Truthsayer and John Doubter"), which is considered by some to be the first authoritative Afrikaans text. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Abu Bakr Effendi]] also compiled his [[Arabic Afrikaans]] [[Islamic]] instruction book between 1862 and 1869, although this was only published and printed in 1877. The first Afrikaans grammars and dictionaries were published in 1875 by the ''{{lang|af|[[Genootskap vir Regte Afrikaners]]}}'' ("Society for Real Afrikaners") in [[Cape Town]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The main Afrikaans dictionary is the ''{{lang|af|[[Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal]]}}'' (WAT) (''Dictionary of the Afrikaans Language''), which is as yet incomplete owing to the scale of the project, but the one-volume dictionary in household use is the ''{{lang|af|[[Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal]]}}'' (HAT). The official [[orthography]] of Afrikaans is the ''{{lang|af|Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls}}'', compiled by {{lang|af|[[Die Taalkommissie]]}}.

===The Afrikaans Bible===
{{Main|Bible translations into Afrikaans}}
The Afrikaner religion had stemmed from the Protestant practices of the Reformed church of Holland during the 17th century, later on being influenced in South Africa by British ministries during the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Afrikaner|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/afrikaner|website=South African History Online|publisher=South African History Online (SAHO)|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landmark in the development of the language was the translation of the whole [[Bible]] into Afrikaans. While significant advances had been made in the textual criticism of the Bible, especially the Greek New Testament, the 1933 translation followed the textus receptus and was closely akin to the {{lang|nl|[[Statenbijbel]]}}. Before this, most Cape Dutch-Afrikaans speakers had to rely on the Dutch {{lang|nl|[[Statenbijbel]]}}. This {{lang|nl|[[Statenvertaling]]}} had its origins with the [[Synod of Dordrecht]] of 1618 and was thus in an [[archaism|archaic]] form of Dutch. This was hard for Dutch and Cape Dutch speakers to understand, and increasingly unintelligible for Afrikaans speakers.

C. P. Hoogehout, [[:af:Arnoldus Pannevis|Arnoldus Pannevis]], and [[Stephanus Jacobus du Toit]] were the first [[Bible translations (Afrikaans)|Afrikaans Bible]] translators. Important landmarks in the translation of the Scriptures were in 1878 with C. P. Hoogehout's translation of the ''{{lang|af|Evangelie volgens Markus}}'' ([[Gospel of Mark]], lit. Gospel according to Mark); however, this translation was never published. The manuscript is to be found in the South African National Library, Cape Town.

The first official translation of the entire Bible into Afrikaans was in 1933 by [[Totius (poet)|J. D. du Toit]], E. E. van Rooyen, J. D. Kestell, H. C. M. Fourie, and [[BB Keet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enigstetroos.org/bybelstudie.htm |title=Bybelstudies |accessdate=23 September 2008 |last=Bogaards |first=Attie H. |language=af |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010173208/http://www.enigstetroos.org/bybelstudie.htm |archivedate=10 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bybelgenootskap.co.za/afr/bybelgenootskap/jongste_nuus.asp |title=Afrikaanse Bybel vier 75 jaar |accessdate=23 September 2008 |date=25 August 2008 |publisher=Bybelgenootskap van Suid-Afrika |language=af |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609161131/http://www.bybelgenootskap.co.za/afr/bybelgenootskap/jongste_nuus.asp |archivedate=9 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This monumental work established Afrikaans as ''{{lang|af|'n suiwer en ordentlike taal}}'', that is "a pure and proper language" for religious purposes, especially amongst the deeply [[Calvinist]] Afrikaans religious community that previously had been sceptical of a [[Bible translation]] that varied from the Dutch version that they were used to.

In 1983, a fresh translation marked the 50th anniversary of the 1933 version and provided a much-needed revision. The final editing of this edition was done by E. P. Groenewald, A. H. van Zyl, P. A. Verhoef, J. L. Helberg and W. Kempen. This translation was influenced by Eugene Nida's theory of dynamic-equavalence which focussed on finding the nearest equavalent in the receptor language to the idea that the Greek, Hebrew or Aramaic wanted to convey. The challenge to this type of translation is that it doesn't take into account that there are shifts in meaning in the receptor language.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A new translation, ''Die Bybel: 'n Direkte Vertaling'' is currently under preparation. It will be the first truly ecumenical translation of the Bible in Afrikaans as translators from various churches, including the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches, are involved.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Various commercial translations of the Bible in Afrikaans have also appeared since the 1990s, such as ''Die Boodskap'' and the ''Nuwe Lewende Vertaling''. Most of these translations were published by Christelike Uitgewersmaatskappy (CUM).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}{{Vague|date=June 2018}}

===Sociolinguistics===

Some state that instead of ''Afrikaners'', which refers to an ethnic group, the terms ''{{lang|af|Afrikaanses}}'' or ''{{lang|af|Afrikaanssprekendes}}'' (lit. Afrikaans speakers) should be used for people of any ethnic origin who speak Afrikaans. Linguistic identity has not yet established which terms shall prevail, and all three are used in common parlance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vryeafrikaan.co.za/lees.php?id=115 |title=Die dilemma van 'n gedeelde Afrikaanse identiteit: Kan wit en bruin mekaar vind? |trans-title=The dilemma of a shared African identity: Can white and brown find each other? |author=Wessel Visser |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222101806/http://vryeafrikaan.co.za/lees.php?id=115 |archivedate=22 December 2012 |date=3 February 2005 |accessdate=3 February 2017 |language=af }}&lt;/ref&gt; The white Afrikaans-speaking community started being referred to colloquially as "The Boere".  The terms ''{{lang|af|boerseun}}'' (farm boy) and ''{{lang|af|boeremeisie}}'' (farm girl) became popular among young white Afrikaners for expressing national pride, regardless of whether or not they actually grew up on a farm.

[[File:Distribution of Afrikaans in Namibia.png|thumb|The geographical distribution of Afrikaans in [[Namibia]].]]
Afrikaans is also widely spoken in Namibia. Before independence, Afrikaans had equal status with German as an official language. Since independence in 1990, Afrikaans has had constitutional recognition as a national, but not official, language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frydman |first=Jenna |editor-last=Bokamba |editor-first=Eyamba G. |chapter=A Critical Analysis of Namibia's English-only language policy |title=Selected proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference on African Linguistics — African languages and linguistics today |year=2011 |publisher=Cascadilla Proceedings Project |location=[[Somerville, Massachusetts]] |isbn=978-1-57473-446-1 |pages=178–189 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/acal/40/paper2574.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willemyns |first=Roland |title=Dutch: Biography of a Language |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-985871-2 |page=232 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xo2MGkyEfbMC }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a much smaller number of Afrikaans speakers among Zimbabwe's white minority, as most have left the country since 1980. Afrikaans was also a medium of instruction for schools in [[Bophuthatswana]], an Apartheid-era [[Bantustan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armoria patriæ – Republic of Bophuthatswana |url=http://www.geocities.com/haigariep/BopE.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmVdolSf?url=http://www.geocities.com/haigariep/BopE.html |archivedate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many South Africans living and working in Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the [[UAE]] and [[Kuwait]] are also Afrikaans-speaking. They have access to Afrikaans websites, news sites such as [http://www.netwerk24.com/ Netwerk24.com] and [http://www.sake24.com/ Sake24], and radio broadcasts over the web, such as those from [[Radio Sonder Grense]], [[Bokradio]] and [[Radio Pretoria]].

Afrikaans has been influential in the development of [[South African English]]. Many Afrikaans loanwords have found their way into South African English, such as ''{{lang|af|[[bakkie]]}}'' ("pickup truck"), ''{{lang|af|[[braai]]}}'' ("barbecue"), ''{{lang|af|[[naartjie]]}}'' ("tangerine"), ''{{lang|af|tekkies}}'' (American "sneakers", British "trainers", Canadian "runners"). A few words in standard English are derived from Afrikaans, such as ''[[aardvark]]'' (lit. "earth pig"), ''[[trekking|trek]]'' ("pioneering journey", in Afrikaans lit. "pull" but used also for "migrate"), ''spoor'' ("animal track"), ''{{lang|af|veld}}'' ("Southern African grassland" in Afrikaans, lit. "field"), ''commando'' from Afrikaans ''{{lang|af|kommando}}'' meaning small fighting unit, ''{{lang|af|boomslang}}'' ("tree snake") and ''{{lang|af|[[apartheid]]}}'' ("segregation"; more accurately "apartness" or "the state or condition of being apart").

In 1976, secondary-school pupils in [[Soweto]] began [[Soweto riots|a rebellion]] in response to the government's decision that Afrikaans be used as the language of instruction for half the subjects taught in non-White schools (with English continuing for the other half). Although English is the mother tongue of only 8.2% of the population, it is the language most widely understood, and the second language of a majority of South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/public_sector/govt_info_available_online_in_all_official_languages.html Govt info available online in all official languages – South Africa – The Good News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032342/http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/public_sector/govt_info_available_online_in_all_official_languages.html |date=4 March 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaans is more widely spoken than English in the Northern and Western Cape provinces, several hundred kilometres from Soweto.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Black Linguistics: Language, Society and Politics in Africa and the Americas, by Sinfree Makoni, p. 120S.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black community's opposition to Afrikaans and preference for continuing English instruction was underlined when the government rescinded the policy one month after the uprising: 96% of Black schools chose English (over Afrikaans or native languages) as the language of instruction.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Also, due to Afrikaans being viewed as the language of the white oppressor by some, pressure has been increased to remove Afrikaans as a teaching language in South African universities, resulting in bloody student protests in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/world/article/South-Africa-Protesting-students-torch-6853287.php |title=South Africa: Protesting students torch university buildings |author=Lynsey Chutel |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The Advocate (Stamford)|Stamford Advocate]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040206/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/world/article/South-Africa-Protesting-students-torch-6853287.php |archivedate=5 March 2016 |date=25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/aussenpolitik/4933544/Studentenunruhen_Konflikte-zwischen-Schwarz-und-Weiss |title=Studentenunruhen: Konflikte zwischen Schwarz und Weiß |trans-title=Student unrest: conflicts between black and white |work=[[Die Presse]] |date=25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://de.euronews.com/2016/02/26/suedafrika-unerklaerliche-gewaltserie-an-universitaeten/ |title=Südafrika: "Unerklärliche" Gewaltserie an Universitäten |trans-title=South Africa: "Unexplained" violence at universities |work=[[Euronews]] |date=25 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constitution of South Africa|South Africa's Constitution]] of 1996, Afrikaans remains an official language, and has equal status to English and nine other languages. The new policy means that the use of Afrikaans is now often reduced in favour of English, or to accommodate the other official languages. In 1996, for example, the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] reduced the amount of television airtime in Afrikaans, while [[South African Airways]] dropped its Afrikaans name ''{{lang|af|Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens}}'' from its [[livery]]. Similarly, South Africa's [[diplomatic mission]]s overseas now only display the name of the country in English and their host country's language, and not in Afrikaans.

In spite of these moves, the language has remained strong, and Afrikaans newspapers and magazines continue to have large circulation figures. Indeed, the Afrikaans-language general-interest family magazine ''{{lang|af|[[Huisgenoot]]}}'' has the largest readership of any magazine in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superbrands.com/za/pdfs/HUISGENOOT.pdf|title=Superbrands.com, visited on 21 March 2012.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924111839/http://www.superbrands.com/za/pdfs/HUISGENOOT.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a pay-TV channel in Afrikaans called [[KykNet]] was launched in 1999, and an Afrikaans music channel, [[MK (channel)|MK]] (''{{lang|af|Musiek kanaal}}'') (lit. 'Music Channel'), in 2005. A large number of Afrikaans books are still published every year, mainly by the publishers Human &amp; Rousseau, {{lang|af|Tafelberg Uitgewers}}, {{lang|af|Struik}}, and {{lang|af|Protea Boekhuis}}. The Afrikaans film trilogy ''{{lang|af|[[Bakgat]]}}'' (first released in 2008) caused a reawakening of the Afrikaans film Industry (which has been dead since the mid to late 1990s) and Belgian-born singer [[Karen Zoid]]'s debut single "{{lang|af|[[Afrikaners is Plesierig]]}}" (released 2001) caused a resurgence in the Afrikaans music industry as well as gave rise to the Afrikaans Rock genre.

Afrikaans has two monuments erected in its honour. The first was erected in {{lang|af|[[Burgersdorp]]}}, South Africa, in 1893, and the second, nowadays better-known [[Afrikaans Language Monument]] (''{{lang|af|Afrikaanse Taalmonument}}''), was built in [[Paarl]], South Africa, in 1975.

When the British design magazine ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''&lt;!--"Wallpaper" per WP:MOSTM--&gt; described Afrikaans as "one of the world's ugliest languages" in its September 2005 article about the [[Afrikaans Language Monument|monument]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060216042054/http://business.iafrica.com/news/657706.htm Rupert snubs mag over Afrikaans slur], Business Africa, 5 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; South African [[billionaire]] [[Johann Rupert]] (chairman of the [[Richemont|Richemont Group]]), responded by withdrawing advertising for brands such as [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]], [[Montblanc (pens)|Montblanc]] and [[Alfred Dunhill]] from the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/afrikaans-stars-join-row-over-ugly-language-1.261058 Afrikaans stars join row over 'ugly language'] ''[[Cape Argus]]'', 10 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the article, Bronwyn Davies, was an [[South African English|English]]-speaking South African.

Modern Dutch and Afrikaans share over 90 percent of their vocabulary. Afrikaans speakers are able to learn Dutch within a comparatively short time. Native Dutch speakers pick up written Afrikaans even more quickly, due to its simplified grammar,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} whereas understanding spoken Afrikaans might need more effort. Afrikaans speakers can learn Dutch pronunciation with little training. This has enabled Dutch and Belgian companies to [[outsourcing|outsource]] their [[call centre]] operations to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eprop.co.za/news/item/4489-SA-holds-its-own-in-global-call-centre-industry.html "SA holds its own in global call centre industry"], eProp Commercial Property News in South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Post-apartheid South Africa]] has seen a loss of preferential treatment by the government for Afrikaans, in terms of education, social events, media (TV and radio), and general status throughout the country, given that it now shares its place as official language with ten other languages. Nevertheless, Afrikaans remains more prevalent in the media – radio, newspapers and television&lt;ref&gt;Oranje FM, Radio Sonder Grense, Jacaranda FM, Radio Pretoria, Rapport, Beeld, Die Burger, Die Son, Afrikaans news is run everyday; the PRAAG website is a web-based news service. On pay channels it is provided as second language on all sports, Kyknet&lt;/ref&gt; – than any of the other official languages, except English. More than 300 book titles in Afrikaans are published annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oulitnet.co.za/taaldebat/multilin.asp |title=Hannes van Zyl |publisher=Oulitnet.co.za |date= |accessdate=1 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228004644/http://www.oulitnet.co.za/taaldebat/multilin.asp |archivedate=28 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; South African census figures suggest a growing number of speakers in all nine provinces, a total of 6.85 million in 2011 compared to 5.98 million a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=Beeld-2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Antoinette Pienaar &amp; Hanti Otto |title=Afrikaans groei, sê sensus (Afrikaans growing according to census) |url=http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Afrikaans-bly-groei-se-sensus-20121030 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102235326/http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Afrikaans-bly-groei-se-sensus-20121030 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |newspaper=Beeld |date=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) project that a growing majority will be [[Coloured]] Afrikaans speakers.&lt;ref name=Rapport-2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Prince |first=Llewellyn |title=Afrikaans se môre is bruin (Afrikaans' tomorrow is coloured) |url=http://www.rapport.co.za/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Afrikaans-se-more-is-bruin-20130323 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331034159/http://www.rapport.co.za/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Afrikaans-se-more-is-bruin-20130323 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |newspaper=Rapport |date=23 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaans speakers experience higher employment rates than other South African language groups, though half a million remain unemployed.&lt;ref name=Beeld-2012/&gt;

Despite the challenges of demotion and emigration that it faces in South Africa, the Afrikaans vernacular remains competitive, being popular in [[DSTV]] pay channels and several internet sites, while generating high newspaper and music CD sales. A resurgence in Afrikaans popular music since the late 1990s has invigorated the language, especially among a younger generation of South Africans. A recent trend is the increased availability of pre-school educational CDs and DVDs. Such media also prove popular with the extensive Afrikaans-speaking expatriate communities who seek to retain language proficiency in a household context.

After years of slumber, Afrikaans language cinema is showing signs of new vigour. The 2007 film ''{{lang|af|Ouma se slim kind}}'', the first full-length Afrikaans movie since ''[[Paljas]]'' in 1998, is seen as the dawn of a new era in Afrikaans cinema. Several short films have been created and more feature-length movies, such as ''{{lang|af|Poena is Koning}}'' and ''{{lang|af|[[Bakgat]]}}'' (both in 2008) have been produced, besides the 2011 Afrikaans-language film ''{{lang|af|[[Skoonheid]]}}'', which was the first Afrikaans film to screen at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The film ''{{lang|af|Platteland}}'' was also released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plattelanddiemovie.com/|title=Platteland Film|website=www.plattelanddiemovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afrikaans Film industry started gaining international recognition via the likes of big Afrikaans Hollywood film stars, like [[Charlize Theron]] (''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'') and [[Sharlto Copley]] (''[[District 9]]'') promoting their mother tongue.

Afrikaans seems to be returning to the [[SABC]]. SABC3 announced early in 2009 that it would increase Afrikaans programming due to the "growing Afrikaans-language market and [their] need for working capital as Afrikaans advertising is the only advertising that sells in the current South African television market". In April 2009, SABC3 started screening several Afrikaans-language programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenafrica.com/news/industry/997616.htm SABC3 "tests" Afrikaans programming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024421/http://www.screenafrica.com/news/industry/997616.htm |date=16 July 2011 }}, ''Screen Africa'', 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Further latent support for the language derives from its de-politicised image in the eyes of younger-generation South Africans, who less and less often view it as "the language of the oppressor".{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Indeed, there is a groundswell movement within Afrikaans to be inclusive, and to promote itself along with the other indigenous official languages. In Namibia, the percentage of Afrikaans speakers declined from 11.4% (2001 Census) to 10.4% (2011 Census). The major concentrations are in Hardap (41.0%), ǁKaras (36.1%), Erongo (20.5%), Khomas (18.5%), Omaheke (10.0%), Otjozondjupa (9.4%), Kunene (4.2%), and Oshikoto (2.3%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.org.na/files/downloads/Namibia%202011%20Population%20and%20Housing%20Census%20Main%20Report.pdf Namibia 2011 Population &amp; Housing Census Main Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002064316/http://www.nsa.org.na/files/downloads/Namibia%202011%20Population%20and%20Housing%20Census%20Main%20Report.pdf |date=2 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrikaans is offered at many universities outside of South Africa including in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Russia and America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afrikaans.com/news-headlines/het-jy.../afrikaans-floreer-in-die-buiteland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
[[File:Graham Maclachlan - Gevaar Slagysters.jpg|thumb|A warning sign in Afrikaans: ''{{lang|af|Gevaar Slagysters}}'' or "Danger, Bear Traps".]]

Following early dialectal studies of Afrikaans, it was theorised that three main historical dialects probably existed after the Great Trek in the 1830s. These dialects are the Northern Cape, Western Cape, and Eastern Cape dialects.&lt;ref&gt;They were named before the establishment of the current [[Western Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]], and [[Northern Cape]] provinces, and are not dialects of those provinces ''{{lang|la|per se}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Cape dialect may have resulted from contact between Dutch settlers and the [[Khoi-Khoi]] people between the Great Karoo and the Kunene, and Eastern Cape dialect between the Dutch and the Xhosa. Remnants of these dialects still remain in present-day Afrikaans, although the standardising effect of Standard Afrikaans has contributed to a great levelling of differences in modern times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There is also a prison [[cant (language)|cant]], known as {{lang|af|soebela}} or {{lang|af|sombela}}, which is based on Afrikaans, yet heavily influenced by [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. This language is used as a secret language in prison and is taught to initiates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Afrikaans 101 |url=http://www.101languages.net/afrikaans/history.html |accessdate=24 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}} ===

The term ''{{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}}'' ("Cape Afrikaans") is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the entire Western Cape dialect; it is more commonly used for a particular sociolect spoken in the [[Cape Peninsula]] of South Africa. {{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}} was once spoken by all population groups. However, it became increasingly restricted to the [[Cape Coloured]] [[ethnic group]] in [[Cape Town]] and environs. Kaapse Afrikaans is still understood by the large majority of native Afrikaans speakers in South Africa.

{{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}} preserves some features more similar to Dutch than to Afrikaans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieson.co.za/lekker_stories.asp|title=Lekker Stories|last=|first=|date=|website=Kaapse Son - Die eerste Afrikaanse Poniekoerant|language=Afrikaans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015021503/http://www.dieson.co.za/lekker_stories.asp|archive-date=2008-10-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1st person singular pronoun ''{{lang|nl|ik}}'' as in Dutch as opposed to Afrikaans ''{{lang|af|ek}}''
* The diminutive endings ''{{lang|af|-tje}}'', pronounced as in Dutch and not as {{IPA|/ki/}} as in Afrikaans.
* The use of the form ''{{lang|af|seg}}'' (compare Dutch ''{{lang|nl|zegt}}'') as opposed to Afrikaans ''{{lang|af|sê}}''

{{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}} has some other features not typically found in Afrikaans.
* The pronunciation of ''{{lang|af|j}}'', normally {{IPA|/j/}} as in Dutch is often a {{IPA|/dz/}}. This is the strongest feature of {{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}}.
* The insertion of {{IPA|/j/}} after {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} when followed by {{IPA|/e/}}, e.g. ''{{lang|af|kjen}}'' as opposed to Afrikaans ''{{lang|af|ken}}''.

{{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}} is also characterised by much [[code-switching]] between [[South African English|English]] and Afrikaans, especially in the inner-city and lower socio-economic status areas of [[Cape Town]].

An example of characteristic {{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}}:

: {{lang-nl|En ik zeg (tegen) jullie: wat zoeken jullie hier bij mij? Ik zoek jullie niet! Nee, ga nu weg!}}
: {{lang|af|Kaapse Afrikaans}}: | {{lang|af|En ik seg ve' djille, wat soek djille hie' by my? Ik soek'{{Not a typo|ie}} ve' djille nie! Nei, gaat nou weg!}}
: {{lang-af|En ek sê vir julle, wat soek julle hier by my? Ek soek julle nie! Nee, gaan nou weg!}}
: English (direct): | And I say to you, what seek you here by me? I seek you not! No, go now away!
: English: And I'm telling you, what are you looking for here? I don't want you here! No, go away now!

=== ''{{lang|af|Oranjerivierafrikaans}}'' ===
The term ''{{lang|af|Oranjerivierafrikaans}}'' ("Afrikaans of the Orange River") is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the Northern Cape dialect; it is more commonly used for the regional peculiarities of standard Afrikaans spoken in the [[Upington]]/[[Orange River wine district]] of South Africa.

Some of the characteristics of {{lang|af|Oranjerivierafrikaans}} are the plural form ''{{lang|af|-goed}}'' (''Ma-{{lang|af|goed}}'', ''{{lang|af|meneergoed}}''), variant pronunciation such as in ''{{lang|af|kjerk}}'' ("Church") and ''{{lang|af|gjeld}}'' ("money") and the ending ''{{lang|af|-se}}'', which indicates possession.

=== Expatriate geolect ===
Although Afrikaans is mainly spoken in South Africa and Namibia, smaller Afrikaans-speaking populations live in [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Vertel my van SA, Afrikaans' |url=http://www.beeld.com/nuus/2013-07-26-vertel-my-van-sa-afrikaans |accessdate=26 July 2013 |newspaper=Beeld |date=26 July 2013 |language=Afrikaans |trans-title='Tell me of SA, Afrikaans' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia, [[Botswana]], [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], the [[Netherlands]], New Zealand, [[Swaziland]], the UAE, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, the US, [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt; Most Afrikaans-speaking people living outside Africa are emigrants and their descendants. Because of [[emigration]] and migrant labour, more than 100,000 Afrikaans speakers may live in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Influences on Afrikaans from other languages ==

=== Malay ===
Due to the early settlement of a [[Cape Malay]] community in [[Cape Town]], who are now known as [[Coloured]]s, numerous [[History of the Malay language#Classical Malay|Classical Malay]] words were brought into Afrikaans. Some of these words entered Dutch via people arriving from, what is now known as, [[Indonesia]] as part of their colonial heritage. Malay words in Afrikaans include:&lt;ref name="safariafrica.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safariafrica.co.za/tourist-information/afrikaans.htm |title=Afrikaans history and development. The Unique Language of South Africa |publisher=Safariafrica.co.za |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''{{lang|af|baie}}''', which means 'very'/'much'/'many' (from ''{{lang|id|[[wiktionary:banyak|banyak]]}}'') is a very commonly used Afrikaans word, different from its Dutch equivalent ''{{lang|nl|veel}}'' or ''{{lang|nl|erg}}''.
*'''{{lang|af|baadjie}}''', Afrikaans for [[jacket]], where Dutch would use ''{{lang|nl|jas}}'' or ''{{lang|nl|vest}}''. The word ''{{lang|nl|baadje}}'' in Dutch is now considered archaic and only used in written, literary texts.
*'''{{lang|af|piesang}}''', which means [[banana]]. This is different from the common Dutch word ''{{lang|nl|banaan}}''. The Indonesian word ''{{lang|id|pisang}}'' is also used in Dutch, though usage is less common.

=== Portuguese ===
Some words originally came from Portuguese such as ''{{lang|af|sambreel}}'' ("umbrella") from the Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|sombreiro}}'', ''{{lang|af|kraal}}'' ("pen/cattle enclosure") from the Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|curral}}'', and ''{{lang|af|mielie}}'' ("corn", from ''{{lang|pt|milho}}''). These words have become common in South Africa to an extent of being used in many other [[Languages of South Africa|South African languages]]. Some of these words also exist in Dutch, like ''{{lang|nl|sambreel}}'' "parasol",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/sambreel |title=etymologiebank.nl |publisher=Etymologiebank.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; though usage is less common and meanings can slightly differ.

=== Khoisan languages ===
*'''{{lang|af|dagga}}''', meaning cannabis&lt;ref name="safariafrica.co.za" /&gt;
*'''{{lang|af|geitjie}}''', meaning lizard, diminutive adapted from [[Khoekhoe]] word&lt;ref name="austin" /&gt;
*'''{{lang|af|gogga}}''', meaning insect, from the [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] ''xo-xo''
*'''{{lang|af|karos}}''', blanket of animal hides
*'''{{lang|af|kierie}}''' walking stick from [[Khoekhoe]]&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3tAqIU0dPsC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=bantu+loanwords+afrikaans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim0MLErvnQAhVJJsAKHR5rCGIQ6AEIfTAT#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''One Thousand Languages: Living, Endangered, and Lost''], Peter Austin
University of California Press, 2008, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these words also exist in Dutch, though with a more specific meaning: ''{{lang|nl|assegaai}}'' for example means "South-African tribal javelin"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and ''{{lang|nl|karos}}'' means "South-African tribal blanket of animal hides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=WNT&amp;id=M030549 |title=Karos II : Kros |publisher=Gtb.inl.nl |accessdate=2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bantu languages ===
Loanwords from [[Bantu languages]] in Afrikaans include the names of indigenous birds, such as ''{{lang|af|mahem}}'' and ''{{lang|af|sakaboela}}'', and indigenous plants, such as ''{{lang|af|maroela}}'' and ''{{lang|af|tamboekie(gras)}}''.&lt;ref name="Potgieter"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HTzjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=bantu+loanwords+afrikaans&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Bantu+loan-words+in+Afrikaans%22 ''Standard encyclopaedia of Southern Africa''], Volume 1, D.J..

=== French ===
The revoking of the [[Edict of Nantes]] on the 22nd of October 1685 was a milestone in the history of [[South Africa]], for it marked the beginning of the great [[Huguenots|Huguenot]] exodus from [[France]]. It is estimated that between 250,000 and 300,000 protestants left France between 1685 and 1700; out of these, according to [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], 100,000 had received military training. A measure of the calibre of these immigrants and of their acceptance by host countries (in particular South Africa) is given by [[Henry Vollam Morton|H.V. Morton]] in his book: In search of South Africa (London, 1948). The Huguenots were responsible for a great linguistic contribution to Afrikaans, particularly in terms of military terminology as many of them fought on the battlefields during the wars of the [[Great Trek]].

==Grammar==
{{Main|Afrikaans grammar}}

In Afrikaans grammar, there is no distinction between the [[infinitive]] and present forms of verbs, with the exception of the verbs 'to be' and 'to have':
{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#ffdead;"
! infinitive form
! present indicative form
! Dutch
! English
! German
|-
| {{lang|af|wees}} || {{lang|af|is}} || {{lang|nl|zijn}} ({{lang|nl|wezen}}) || be || {{lang|de|sein}} ({{lang|de|gewesen}})
|-
| {{lang|af|hê}} || {{lang|af|het}} || {{lang|nl|hebben}} || have || {{lang|de|haben}}
|}

In addition, verbs do not [[grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] differently depending on the subject. For example,
{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#ffdead;"
! Afrikaans || Dutch || English || German
|-
| {{lang|af|ek is}} || {{lang|nl|ik ben}} || I am || {{lang|de|ich bin}}
|-
| {{lang|af|jy/u is}} || {{lang|nl|jij/u bent}} || you are (sing.) || {{lang|de|du bist/Sie sind}}
|-
| {{lang|af|hy/sy/dit is}} || {{lang|nl|hij/zij/het is}} || he/she/it is || {{lang|de|er/sie/es ist}}
|-
| {{lang|af|ons is}} || {{lang|nl|wij zijn}} || we are || {{lang|de|wir sind}}
|-
| {{lang|af|julle is}} || {{lang|nl|jullie zijn}} || you are (plur.) || {{lang|de|ihr seid}}
|-
| {{lang|af|hulle is}} || {{lang|nl|zij zijn}} || they are || {{lang|de|sie sind}}
|}

Only a handful of Afrikaans verbs have a [[preterite]], namely the auxiliary ''{{lang|af|wees}}'' ("to be"), the [[modal verbs]], and the verb ''{{lang|af|dink}}'' ("to think"). The preterite of ''{{lang|af|mag}}'' ("may") is rare in contemporary Afrikaans.

|}

All other verbs use the perfect tense (''hê'' + past participle) for the past. Therefore, there is no distinction in Afrikaans between ''I drank'' and ''I have drunk''. (Also in colloquial German, the past tense is often replaced with the perfect.)

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#ffdead;"
! Afrikaans || Dutch || English || German
|-
| {{lang|af|ek het gedrink}} || {{lang|nl|ik dronk}} || I drank || {{lang|de|ich trank}}
|-
| {{lang|af|ek het gedrink}} || {{lang|nl|ik heb gedronken}} || I have drunk || {{lang|de|ich habe getrunken}}
|}

When telling a longer story, Afrikaans speakers usually avoid the perfect and simply use the present tense, or [[historical present tense]] instead (as is possible, but less common, in English as well).

A particular feature of Afrikaans is its use of the [[double negative]]; it is classified in Afrikaans as ''{{lang|af|ontkennende vorm}}'' and is something that is absent from the other West Germanic standard languages. For example,

: {{lang-af|Hy kan '''nie''' Afrikaans praat '''nie'''|lit=He can not Afrikaans speak not|links=no}}
: {{lang-nl|Hij spreekt '''geen''' Afrikaans.|links=no}} / ''{{lang-nl|Hij kan '''geen''' Afrikaans praten.}}''
: English: He speaks '''''no''''' Afrikaans. / He can '''''not''''' speak Afrikaans. / He '''''can't''''' speak Afrikaans.
: {{lang-de|Er spricht '''kein''' Afrikaans.|links=no}}
: {{lang-fr|Il '''ne''' parle '''pas''' afrikaans.|links=no}}

Both French and San origins have been suggested for double negation in Afrikaans. While double negation is still found in [[Low Franconian dialects]] in [[West-Flanders]] and in some "isolated" villages in the centre of the Netherlands (such as [[Garderen]]), it takes a different form, which is not found in Afrikaans. The following is an example:

: {{lang-af|Ek wil dit nie doen nie.|links=no}}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (''lit.'' I want this not do not.)
: {{lang-nl|Ik wil dit niet doen.|links=no}}
: English: I do not want to do this.
: {{lang-de|Ich will dies nicht tun.|links=no}}

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Compare with ''{{lang|af|Ek wil nie dit doen nie}}'', which changes the meaning to "I want not to do this." Whereas ''{{lang|af|Ek wil nie dit doen nie}}'' emphasizes a lack of desire to act, ''{{lang|af|Ek wil dit nie doen nie}}'' emphasizes the act itself.

The ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}'' was the Middle Dutch way to negate but it has been suggested that since ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}'' became highly non-voiced, '''''{{lang|dum|nie}}''''' or '''''{{lang|dum|niet}}''''' was needed to complement the ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}''. With time the ''{{lang|dum|-ne}}'' disappeared in most Dutch dialects.

The double negative construction has been fully grammaticalised in standard Afrikaans and its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as the examples below show:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Afrikaans
! Dutch (literally translated)
! More correct Dutch
! English
|-
| {{lang|af|Ek het nie geweet dat hy sou kom nie.}}
| {{lang|nl|Ik heb niet geweten dat hij zou komen.}}
| {{lang|nl|Ik wist niet dat hij zou komen.}}
| I did not know that he would come.
|-
| {{lang|af|Ek het geweet dat hy nie sou kom nie.}}
| {{lang|nl|Ik heb geweten dat hij niet zou komen.}}
| {{lang|nl|Ik wist dat hij niet zou komen.}}
| I knew (did know) that he would not come.
|-
| {{lang|af|Ek het nie geweet dat hy nie sou kom nie.}}
| {{lang|nl|Ik heb niet geweten dat hij niet zou komen.}}
| {{lang|nl|Ik wist niet dat hij niet zou komen.}}
| I did not know that he would not come.
|-
| {{lang|af|Hy sal&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|af|kan}}'' would be best used in this case because ''{{lang|af|kan nie}}'' means cannot and since he is sick he is unable to come, whereas ''{{lang|af|sal}}'' is "will" in English and is thus not the best word choice.&lt;/ref&gt; nie kom nie, want hy is siek.}}
| {{lang|nl|Hij zal niet komen, want hij is ziek.}}
| {{lang|nl|Hij komt niet, want hij is ziek.}}
| He will not come, as he is sick.
|-
| {{lang|af|Dis (Dit is) nie so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer nie.}}
| colspan="2" align="center" | {{lang|nl|Het is niet zo moeilijk (om) Afrikaans te leren.}}
| It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.
|}

A notable exception to this is the use of the negating grammar form that coincides with negating the English present participle. In this case there is only a single negation.

: {{lang-af|Hy is in die hospitaal, maar hy eet nie.|links=no}}
: {{lang-nl|Hij is in het ziekenhuis, maar hij eet niet.|links=no}}
: English: He is in [the] hospital, though he eats not.
: {{lang-de|Er ist im Krankenhaus, aber er isst nicht.|links=no}}

Certain words in Afrikaans arise due to grammar. For example, ''{{lang|af|moet nie}}'', which literally means "must not", usually becomes ''{{lang|af|moenie}}''; although one does not have to write or say it like this, virtually all Afrikaans speakers will change the two words to ''{{lang|af|moenie}}'' in the same way as ''do not'' shifts to ''don't'' in English.

The Dutch word ''{{lang|nl|het}}'' ("it" in English) does not correspond to ''{{lang|af|het}}'' in Afrikaans. The Dutch words corresponding to Afrikaans ''{{lang|af|het}}'' are ''{{lang|nl|heb}}'', ''{{lang|nl|hebt}}'', ''{{lang|nl|heeft}}'' and ''{{lang|nl|hebben}}''.

==Orthography==
There are many parallels to the [[Dutch orthography]] conventions and those used for Afrikaans. There are 26 letters.

In Afrikaans, many consonants are dropped from the earlier Dutch spelling. For example, ''{{lang|nl|slechts}}'' ('only') in Dutch becomes ''{{lang|af|slegs}}'' in Afrikaans. Also, Afrikaans and some Dutch dialects make no distinction between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, having merged the latter into the former; while the word for "south" is written ''{{lang|nl|zuid}}'' in Dutch, it is spelled ''{{lang|af|suid}}'' in Afrikaans (as well as dialectal Dutch writings) to represent this merger. Similarly, the Dutch digraph ''{{lang|nl|[[IJ (digraph)|ĳ]]}}'', normally pronounced as {{IPA|/əi/}}, is written as ''{{lang|af|y}}'', except where it replaces the Dutch [[affix|suffix]] ''{{lang|nl|–lijk}}'' which is pronounced as {{IPA|/lœk/}} or {{IPA|/lik/}}, as in ''{{lang|nl|waarschijnlijk}} &gt; {{lang|af|waarskynlik}}''.

Another difference is the indefinite article, ''{{lang|af|'n}}'' in Afrikaans and {{lang|nl|een}} in Dutch. "A book" is ''{{lang|af|'n boek}}'' in Afrikaans, whereas it is either ''{{lang|nl|een boek}}'' or ''{{lang|nl|'n boek}}'' in Dutch. This ''{{lang|af|'n}}'' is usually pronounced as just a [[weak vowel]], {{IPA|[ə]}}.

The [[diminutive]] suffix in Afrikaans is ''{{lang|af|-tjie}}'', whereas in Dutch it is ''{{lang|nl|-tje}}'', hence a "bit" is {{Lang|af|bie'''tjie'''}} in Afrikaans and {{Lang|nl|bee'''tje'''}} in Dutch.

The letters ''c'', ''q'', ''x'', and ''z'' occur almost exclusively in borrowings from French, English, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. This is usually because words that had ''c'' and ''ch'' in the original Dutch are spelled with ''k'' and ''g'', respectively, in Afrikaans. Similarly original ''qu'' and ''x'' are spelt ''kw'' and ''ks'', respectively. For example, ''{{lang|af|ekwatoriaal}}'' instead of ''equatoriaal'', and ''{{lang|af|ekskuus}}'' instead of ''excuus''.

The vowels with diacritics in non-loanword Afrikaans are: ''á'', ''é'', ''è'', ''ê'', ''ë'', ''í'', ''î'', ''ï'', ''ó'', ''ô'', ''ú'', ''û'', ''ý''. Diacritics are ignored when alphabetising, though they are still important, even when typing the diacritic forms may be difficult. For example, ''{{lang|af|geëet}}'' instead of the 3 e's alongside each other: ''*{{lang|af|geeet}}'', which can never occur in Afrikaans, or ''{{lang|af|sê}}'', which translates to "say", whereas ''{{lang|af|se}}'' is a possessive form.

===Initial apostrophes===
A few short words in Afrikaans take initial apostrophes. In modern Afrikaans, these words are always written in lower case (except if the entire line is uppercase), and if they occur at the beginning of a sentence, the next word is capitalised. Three examples of such apostrophed words are ''{{lang|af|'k, 't, 'n}}''. The last (the indefinite article) is the only apostrophed word that is common in modern written Afrikaans, since the other examples are shortened versions of other words (''{{lang|af|ek}}'' and ''{{lang|af|het}}'', respectively) and are rarely found outside of a poetic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.101languages.net/afrikaans/grammar.html |title=Retrieved 12 April 2010 |publisher=101languages.net |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=22 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015164510/http://101languages.net/afrikaans/grammar.html |archivedate= 15 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are a few examples:

| {{lang|af|'k 't Dit gesê}}

|-
| {{lang|af|'t Jy dit geëet?}}
| {{lang|af|Het jy dit geëet?}}
| Did you eat it?
| Extremely uncommon
|-
| {{lang|af|'n Man loop daar}}
|
| A man walks there
| Standard Afrikaans pronounces ''{{lang|af|'n}}'' as a [[schwa]] vowel.
|}

The apostrophe and the following letter are regarded as two separate characters, and are never written using a single glyph, although a single character variant of the indefinite article appears in Unicode, {{lang|af|ŉ}}.

In the [[Dutch language]] the word ''{{lang|nl|Afrikaans}}'' means African, in the general sense. Consequently, Afrikaans is commonly denoted as ''{{lang|nl|Zuid-Afrikaans}}''. This ambiguity also exists in Afrikaans itself and is either resolved in the context of its usage, or by using ''{{lang|nl|Afrikaan}}'' for an [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|African person]], and ''{{lang|nl|Afrika-}}'' in the adjective sense.

A handful of Afrikaans words are exactly the same as in English. The following Afrikaans sentences, for example, are exactly the same in the two languages, in terms of both their meaning and spelling; only their pronunciation differs.
* '''{{lang|af|My pen was in my hand.}}''' ({{IPA|[məi pɛn vas ən məi ɦant]}})
* '''{{lang|af|My hand is in warm water.}}''' ({{IPA|[məi ɦant əs ən varm vɑːtər]}})

==Sample text==
[[Psalm 23]] 1983 translation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;" lang="af"&gt;
Die Here is my Herder, ek kom niks kort nie.
Hy laat my in groen weivelde rus. Hy bring my by waters waar daar vrede is.
Hy gee my nuwe krag. Hy lei my op die regte paaie tot eer van Sy naam.
Selfs al gaan ek deur donker dieptes, sal ek nie bang wees nie, want U is by my. In U hande is ek veilig.
&lt;/poem&gt;

[[Psalm 23]] alternative translation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;" lang="af"&gt;
Die Here is my Herder, niks sal my ontbreek nie.
Hy laat my neerlê in groen weivelde; na waters waar rus is, lei Hy my heen.
Hy verkwik my siel; Hy lei my in die spore van geregtigheid, om sy Naam ontwil.
Al gaan ek ook in 'n dal van doodskaduwee, ek sal geen onheil vrees nie; want U is met my: u stok en u staf die vertroos my.
&lt;/poem&gt;

[[Lord's Prayer]] (Afrikaans New Living translation){{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;" lang="af"&gt;
Ons Vader in die hemel, laat U Naam geheilig word.
Laat U koningsheerskappy spoedig kom.
Laat U wil hier op aarde uitgevoer word soos in die hemel.
Gee ons die porsie brood wat ons vir vandag nodig het.
En vergeef ons ons sondeskuld soos ons ook óns skuldenaars vergewe het.
Bewaar ons sodat ons nie aan verleiding sal toegee nie; en bevry ons van die greep van die Bose.
Want van U is die koninkryk,
en die krag,
en die heerlikheid,
tot in ewigheid. Amen
&lt;/poem&gt;

[[Lord's Prayer]] (Original translation):{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;" lang="af"&gt;
Onse Vader wat in die hemel is,
laat U Naam geheilig word;
laat U koninkryk kom;
laat U wil geskied op die aarde,
net soos in die hemel.
Gee ons vandag ons daaglikse brood;
en vergeef ons ons skulde
soos ons ons skuldenaars vergewe
en laat ons nie in die versoeking nie
maar verlos ons van die Bose
Want aan U behoort die koninkryk
en die krag
en die heerlikheid
tot in ewigheid. Amen

The '''Ahbans Khanzada''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. They are part of the larger [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] community found in the [[Awadh]] region. The community uses the surname [[Khan (title)|Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and Castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Ahbans Khanzada are [[Muslim]] converts from the Ahbans clan of [[Rajput]]s. They were converted when the [[Bahlol Lodhi]], the [[Sultan of Delhi]] appointed his nephew Mohammed Farman Ali, also known as Kalapahar, as governor of [[Bahraich]]. This Kalapahar is said to have induced the conversion of the Ahbans [[Rana (title)|ranas]] of [[Lakhimpur Kheri]] to [[Islam]]. They remain concentrated in the villages near the city of [[Lakhimpur Kheri]]. Like other [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]]s, they marry other Khanzada clans of similar status. The Ahbans Khanzada provided the [[taluqdar]] families of Kotwara, Agar Buzurg, Chauratia, Kukra, Jalalpur, Raipur and Gola.&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Kheri District Volume XLII: Gazetteers of the United Provinces  edited by H. R Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Ahbans to have converted to [[Islam]] was said to be a Rajah Mul Sah, who is said to have then gone to [[Delhi]], the capital of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Islamic Sultanate]]. From him descended two brothers, Fateh Khan and Baz Khan, from whom most of the present day Ahbans Khanzada claim descent from. Baz Khan had twelve sons, of whom eight had no issues, while from the two eldest, Sangi Khan and Turbat Khan came the [[taluqdar]] families of Kotwara, Jalalpur and Raipur, and the [[zamindar]] families of [[Bhurwara]], Ghunsi, sehrua and Amethi.

The Jalalpur family were descended from Tarbat Khan, who had three sons, the eldest being Mohammad Hasan Khan. These estate was one of the largest in [[Lakhimpur Kheri District]], and consisted of thirteen villages. From the second son of Tarbat Khan came the [[taluqdar]] family of Kotwara. This estate eventually passed into the ownership of a [[Sayyid of Uttar Pradesh|Sayyid]] family. The final [[taluqdar]] estate was Raipur, whose taluqdar claimed descent from Bahudur Khan, a younger son of Baz Khan.&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Kheri District Volume XLII: Gazetteers of the United Provinces  edited by H. R Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

Another community of Ahbans Khanzada are those of [[Bangarmau]] in [[Hardoi District]]. These Ahbans have no connection with those of [[Lakhimpur Kheri]], and are historically connected with another [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] community, the [[Chandel Khanzada]]. They were said to be converted to [[Islam]]  by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. These Ahbans are largely small [[zamindar]]s, and many are simple peasant proprietors. They are also entirely [[Sunni]], while those of Lakhimpur include a small [[Shia]] minority.&lt;ref&gt;A Gazetteer of Hardoi District Volume XLI: Gazetteers of the United Provinces  edited by H. R Neville&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==
They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, except the [[taluqdar]] families, but incorporate many folk beliefs. The Ahbans speak both [[Khari boli]] and [[Urdu]]. They were at one time substantial landowners, but with the carrying out of land reform by the [[government of India]] after independence in 1947, they lost many of their larger estates. The community are now small to medium-sized farmers, growing wheat, sorghum, pulses and sugar cane. They have no caste council or panchayat, although there are localized panchayats in their villages. Although the community did practice clan exogamy, this is no longer the case. While the Ahbans of Bangarmau intermarry largely with the [[Chandel Khanzada]], those of [[Lakhimpur Kheri]] have also had said marital links with the [[Rohilla]] communities of [[Pilibhit]] and [[Bareilly]].&lt;ref&gt;Tribes and Castes of Northwestern Provinces and Oudh by William Crooke page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The sense of belonging to the [[Rajput]] community remains strong, with the Ahbans Khanzada still strongly identifying themselves with the wider [[Rajput]] community of [[Awadh]], and often refer to themselves as simply [[Rajput]]. This is shown by the persistence in their marriages of Rajput customs, like bursting of fire crackers and sending specially made [[Laddu|laddoos]] to biradati members. Many members of the community continue to serve in the armed forces of [[India]], an activity traditionally associated with the Rajputs. The Khanzada, however have been badly affected by abolishment of the [[zamindar]]i system, with many now destitute. However, like other [[Indian Muslim]]s, there is growing movement towards orthodoxy, with many of their villages containing [[madrasa]]s. The madrasas have also facilitated the growth of [[Urdu]], with it beginning to replace the [[Awadhi]] dialect they traditionally spoke.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/times-of-india-the/mi_8012/is_20070708/muslim-rajputs-india/ai_n39451474/?tag=content;col1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aku''', '''Krio''', or '''Creole''' are a minority [[ethnic group]] of [[Gambia]] with roots among the [[Sierra Leone Creole people]]. 

In Gambia the Aku account for about 2% of the population. Some estimates put the figure higher. Gambian Aku are descendants of [[Sierra Leone Liberated Africans]], [[Nova Scotian settlers (Sierra Leone)|Settlers]], transatlantic immigrants to the Gambia, and liberated Africans dropped off in the Gambia. Gambian Krios are an extension of the Freetown community of Creoles, and they have roots in the West Indies, North America, England, and the various African communities. Gambian Aku have also some European heritage through intermarriage and through their connections to Freetown Creoles.
Many speak [[Aku language|Aku]], an [[English language|English]]-based [[creole language]] similar to the [[Krio language]] of Sierra Leone.

==Aku Marabouts==
In Sierra Leone, the Aku Marabouts are known as Okus or Akus (Aku Muslims) or Marabouts, while in the Gambia, the term Aku refers to the entire Creole population. In the Gambia, "Aku Marabout" is the term used for the [[Oku people]] while Aku Creoles in and around Banjul are [[Christian]].

'''Americans in Costa Rica''' consists of immigrants and expatriates from the [[United States]] to [[Costa Rica]], mostly retirees. According to the U.S. State Department, about 70,000 Americans live in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/costa-rica-retirement-not-always-tropical-paradise Costa Rica retirement not always tropical paradise]", ''Marketplace Watch'', 31 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

American retirees, many of whom are [[Baby boom]]ers, flocked to Costa Rica’s tropical beaches to retire as they’re drawn to its biodiversity, the political stability, and its relative low cost health care. The number of Americans who collect their [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] checks in Costa Rica has jumped 67% since 2002.

Many Americans have also purchased vacation homes rather than moving lock, stock and barrel, leaving the U.S. behind. They intend to retire in Costa Rica in five years or so and are using the rental income to pay off the property in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ideal-living.com/?p=12 Living in Costa Rica]", ''ideal-LIVING'', 22 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anyi people''' (or Agnis) are an [[Akan people|Akan]] subgroup in southwest [[Ghana]] and southeast [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=uiowa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Anyi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125233019/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Anyi.html |archivedate=2009-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an [[Akan people]] who speak the [[Anyi language]].

==History==
The Anyi people are a subgroup of the [[Akan people|Akan]], originally from Ghana, who fled from the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] subgroup to their current location in present-day Ivory Coast between the 16th and 18th centuries. They established the Kingdoms of Indene, [[Sanwi]], and [[Moronou]]. 

Today the Anyis live mainly in the area once known as the Kingdoms of Sanwi and Indene. They also inhabit [[Zanzan District|Zanzan]] in Ivory Coast and there are small populations in Ghana.

==Culture==

===Leadership===
The Akan people generally operate under a monarchial system which is also true for the Anyi. Before France colonized the regions inhabited by the Anyi there were three castes: nobility, freemen, and slaves. Today there is usually a local headman, who is directed by a council of elders and who represents his constituency in regional politics. Like other Akan peoples, the Anyi have a highly stratified society that includes a hierarchical political administration with titled officials who proudly display their rank and power. The Anyi are a matrilineal people, and women have relatively high social status exhibited in both the political and economic arenas.

===Society===
[[File:Pg245 Type d'un village gan-ne ou agni.jpg|thumb|Anyi village, 1892]]
The Anyi live in loose neighborhoods of family housing complexes which are generally spread apart. Funerary images and monuments are the preferred forms of art of the Anyi. A family often displays its affluence through the decadence of its memorials as greater beauty is thought to indicate greater respect to those being memoralized.

====Family====
To marry a suitor must provide three things:
O-Bla-kale  : financial assistance for education maintenance of the bride
Adyia-tila  : to purchase the trousseau
Be-ti-sika  : binds the girl and her parents

[[Adultery]] is frowned upon and at one time people would be banished from villages due to it and even put to death.

====Religion====
The Anyi follow a traditional belief [[Akan religion]] and also Islam and Christianity. In the traditional belief [[Akan religion]] living one's life so that one will be remembered and respected as an ancestor is a primary motivations. Their religious system is based upon the continued honoring of one's departed ancestors. When a person passes away an elaborate ceremony follows, involving ritual washing, dressing the deceased in fine garments and gold jewelry to be laid in state for up to three days, and a mourning period that allows the family and community to show their respect for the departed in order to guarantee a welcome into the spirit world.

==Economics==
Anyi operate primarily under an agricultural economy which revolves around [[banana]] and [[taro]] production. [[Yam (vegetable)|Yams]] are also an important staple crop. Many locally grown crops were introduced from the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade. These include maize, manioc, peppers, peanuts, tomatoes, squash, and sweet potatoes. Farm animals include sheep, goats, chickens, and dogs. Markets which are primarily run by women take place every four days and are the center of the local economy. Local produce and craft items are sold alongside imported goods. Palm oil is sold as a commodity on the international market.Forestry work is also practiced by the Anyi.

A '''ballistic missile''' follows a [[ballistic trajectory]] to deliver one or more [[warhead]]s on a predetermined target. These weapons are only guided during relatively brief periods of flight—most of their trajectory is unpowered, being governed by gravity and air resistance if in the atmosphere. Shorter range ballistic missiles stay within the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], while longer-ranged [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs), are launched on a [[sub-orbital flight]] trajectory and spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere.

These weapons are in a distinct category from [[cruise missile]]s, which are [[Lift (force)|aerodynamically guided]] in powered flight.

== History ==
[[File:Fusée V2.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Replica of V-2]]
The earliest use of rockets as a weapon dates to the 13th Century (see [[History of rockets]]). A pioneer ballistic missile was the A-4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zaloga | first = Steven | title = V-2 Ballistic Missile 1942–52 | publisher = [[Osprey Publishing]] | location = Reading | year = 2003 |page=3 | isbn = 978-1-84176-541-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as the [[V-2 rocket]] developed by [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s and 1940s under the direction of [[Wernher von Braun]]. The first successful launch of a V-2 was on October 3, 1942, and it began operation on September 6, 1944 against [[Paris]], followed by an attack on London two days later. By the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, over 3,000 V-2s had been launched.&lt;REF NAME='num_fired'&gt;{{cite book| author=Clayton K. S. Chun| title=Thunder Over the Horizon: From V-2 Rockets to Ballistic Missiles| publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2006| page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[R-7 Semyorka]] was the first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]].

A total of 30 nations have deployed operational ballistic missiles.  Development continues with around 100 ballistic missile flight tests in 2007 (not including those of the US), mostly by China, Iran, and the Russian Federation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010|reason=Dead link removed}} In 2010, the U.S. and Russian governments signed a treaty to reduce their inventory of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) over a seven-year period (to 2017) to 1550 units each.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State (8 April 2010). "Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms":  https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/140035.pdf. Retrieved 25 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minuteman III diagram.png|thumb|Side view of Minuteman-III ICBM]]

== Flight ==

An intercontinental ballistic missile trajectory consists of three parts: the powered flight portion; the free-flight portion, which constitutes most of the flight time; and the re-entry phase, where the missile [[Atmospheric reentry|re-enters the Earth's atmosphere]]. (The flight phases for shorter-range ballistic missiles are essentially the first two phases of the ICBM, as some ballistic categories do not leave the atmosphere.){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Ballistic missiles can be launched from fixed sites or mobile launchers, including vehicles (e.g., [[Transporter erector launcher|transporter erector launchers (TELs)]]), [[aircraft]], [[Navy|ships]], and [[submarine]]s. The powered flight portion can last from a few tenths of seconds to several minutes and can consist of multiple [[rocket]] stages.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

When in space no more [[thrust]] is provided, the missile enters free-flight. In order to cover large distances, ballistic missiles are usually launched into a high [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]; for intercontinental missiles, the highest altitude ([[apogee]]) reached during free-flight is about {{convert|2000|km|mi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/13/asia/north-korea-projectile/index.html|title=North Korea launches missile|last=Almasy|first=Steve|date=14 May 2017|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=2017-10-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Kwon|first2=K. J.|last3=Lee|first3=Taehoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-entry stage begins at an altitude where atmospheric [[Drag (physics)|drag]] plays a significant part in missile [[trajectory]], and lasts until missile [[Impact force|impact]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Reentry vehicles reenter the Earth's atmosphere at very high velocities, on the order of 6-8 kilometers (4–5 miles) per second at ICBM ranges.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasic.af.mil/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=F2VLcKSmCTE%3d&amp;portalid=19|title=Ballistic and Cruise Missile Threat|last=|first=|date=June 2017|website=|publisher=Defense Intelligence Ballistic Missile Analysis Committee|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

The course taken by ballistic missiles has two significant desirable properties. First, ballistic missiles that fly above the atmosphere have a much longer range than would be possible for [[cruise missiles]] of the same size. Powered rocket flight through thousands of kilometers of air would require vastly greater amounts of fuel, making the launch vehicles larger and easier to detect and intercept. Powered missiles that can cover similar ranges, such as cruise missiles, do not use rocket motors for the majority of their flight, but instead use more economical jet engines. However, cruise missiles have not made ballistic missiles obsolete, due to the second major advantage: ballistic missiles can travel extremely quickly along their flight path. An ICBM can strike a target within a 10,000&amp;nbsp;km range in about 30 to 35 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} With terminal speeds of over 5,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, ballistic missiles are much harder to [[Missile defense|intercept]] than cruise missiles, due to the much shorter time available. Therefore, ballistic missiles are some of the most feared weapons available, despite the fact that cruise missiles are cheaper, more mobile, and more versatile.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Missile types ==
[[File:Trident II missile image.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Trident II]] SLBM launched by [[ballistic missile submarine]].]]
Ballistic missiles can vary widely in range and use, and are often divided into categories based on range. Various schemes are used by different countries to categorize the ranges of ballistic missiles:

*[[Air-launched ballistic missile]] (ALBM)
*[[Tactical ballistic missile]]: Range between about 150&amp;nbsp;km and 300&amp;nbsp;km
*[[Theatre ballistic missile]] (TBM): Range between 300&amp;nbsp;km and 3,500&amp;nbsp;km
**[[Short-range ballistic missile]] (SRBM): Range between 300&amp;nbsp;km and 1,000&amp;nbsp;km
**[[Medium-range ballistic missile]] (MRBM): Range between 1,000&amp;nbsp;km and 3,500&amp;nbsp;km
*[[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) or long-range ballistic missile (LRBM): Range between 3,500&amp;nbsp;km and 5,500&amp;nbsp;km
*[[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM): Range greater than 5,500&amp;nbsp;km
*[[Submarine-launched ballistic missile]] (SLBM): Launched from [[ballistic missile submarine]]s (SSBNs); Most current designs have intercontinental range with a notable exception of [[India]]n operational SLBM [[Sagarika (missile)|Sagarika]] and [[K-4 (SLBM)|K-4]] as well as [[North Korea|North Korea's]] currently operationally deployed [[KN-11]]&lt;ref name=YonhapAug24Confirms&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2016/08/24/35/0301000000AEN20160824009552315F.html (2nd LD) N.K. leader calls SLBM launch success, boasts of nuke attack capacity] - Yonhap, 25 Aug 2016 08:17am&lt;/ref&gt;  which might not have intercontinental range. A comparable missile would be the decommissioned [[China|China's]] [[JL-1]] SLBM with a range of less than 2,500&amp;nbsp;km.

Tactical, short- and medium-range missiles are often collectively referred to as [[Tactical ballistic missile|tactical]] and [[theatre ballistic missiles]], respectively. Long- and medium-range ballistic missiles are generally designed to deliver [[nuclear weapon]]s because their payload is too limited for conventional explosives to be cost-effective in comparison to conventional [[bomber aircraft]] (though the U.S. is [[prompt global strike|evaluating the idea]] of a conventionally armed ICBM for near-instant global air strike capability, despite the high costs).

==Throw-weight==
Throw-weight is a measure of the effective weight of ballistic missile [[payload]]s. It is measured in [[kilogram]]s or [[tonne]]s. Throw-weight equals the total weight of a missile's [[warhead]]s, [[reentry vehicle]]s, self-contained dispensing mechanisms, [[penetration aids]], and [[missile guidance]] systems—generally all components except for the launch [[Booster (rocketry)|rocket booster]] and launch fuel. While throw-weight may refer to any type of warhead, in normal modern usage it almost exclusively refers to [[fission bomb|nuclear]] or [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] payloads.  It was once also a consideration in the design of naval ships and the number/size of guns they carried.

Throw-weight was used as a criterion in classifying different types of missiles during [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;James John Tritten, [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/nov-dec/tritten.html Throw-Weight and Arms Control&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], ''Air University Review'', Nov-Dec 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The term became politically controversial during debates over the arms-control accord, as critics of the treaty alleged that Soviet missiles were able to carry larger payloads and therefore enabled the Soviets to maintain higher throw-weight than an American force with a roughly comparable number of lower-payload missiles.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/15/world/what-is-throw-weight.html What Is Throw-Weight?], July 15, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missiles with the world's heaviest payloads are the Russian [[SS-18]] and Chinese [[DF-5|CSS-4]] and Russia is developing a new heavy-lift, liquid-propellant ICBM called the [[Sarmat]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Depressed trajectory===
Throw-weight is normally calculated using an optimal [[ballistic trajectory]] from one point on the surface of the Earth to another.  An optimal trajectory maximizes the total payload (throw-weight) using the available [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] of the missile.  By reducing the payload weight, different trajectories can be selected which either extends the nominal range, or decreases the total time in flight.  A depressed trajectory is a non-optimal, lower and flatter trajectory which takes less time between launch and impact, but with a lower throw-weight. The primary reasons to choose a depressed trajectory are either to evade [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems by reducing the time available to shoot down the attacking vehicle (especially during the vulnerable burn-phase against space-based ABM systems), or in a nuclear [[first-strike]] scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Science &amp; Global Security, 1992, Volume 3, pp.101-159 Depressed Trajectory SLBMs: A Technical Evaluation and Arms Control Possibilities [http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/3_1-2gronlund.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate, non-military, purpose for a depressed trajectory is in conjunction with the [[space plane]] concept with use of [[air-breathing engine]]s, which requires the ballistic missile to remain sufficiently low inside the atmosphere for air-breathing engines to function.

'''Bath broom''' ({{lang-ru|банный веник}}, {{IPA-ru|ˈbannɨj ˈvʲenʲɪk}}; {{lang-fi|vasta}} or ''vihta'') is a [[besom]], or [[broom]], used in Russian bathhouses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagosweatlodge.com/dry-russian-sauna/ |title=History of Dry Russian Sauna |publisher=Chicago Sweatlodge |date= |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Banya (sauna)|banyas]], and in [[Finnish sauna]]s.

A bath broom is typically made with the branches and leaves of a tree or shrub which secretes aromatic oils. The branches and leaves are then dried and tied around a wooden handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stuccu.com/s/Sauna+venik-MbSLsTI-Buy-Exclusive-Deals-70-OFF-Save-Big-Lowest-Price-On-Sauna-venik-Best-In-Stock-Fast-Free-Shipping?vw=g&amp;fp=price%24!LT20--|title=Stuccu: Best Deals on Sauna venik Buy Exclusive Deals 70 OFF Save Big Lowest Price On Sauna venik Best In Stock Fast Free Shipping. Up To 70% off!|work=stuccu.com|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broom is used to massage a bather's skin and generate heat.

==Types==
The bath broom can be made out of almost any tree or shrub whose twigs are sufficiently flexible, have no thorns, and do not emit any sticky or harmful substances. 

Different species of plants are believed to have different effects on humans. Some brooms are meant to have a soothing, relaxing, soporific effect, such as birch, oak, eucalyptus and Gukanov’s combined. Others are meant to have a stimulating effect, such as rowan and tansy. All, however, can be used for [[Thalassotherapy|thalassotherapeutic]] massage.

[[File:Vihtoja.jpg|thumb|Finnish birch vihta]]

'''[[Birch]]''' is commonly used in Finnish sauna culture. They are collected after midsummer and dryed for winter. 

'''[[Pine]]''' bath brooms must be steamed in boiling water for ten minutes, and can be used once they have become soft. 

'''[[Fir]]''' tree bath brooms are used during the winter in Siberia, while [[juniper]] bath brooms are used in Central Asia.

Fir tree and juniper bath brooms cannot be made in advance, as the needles dry up and fall off, and thus must be used fresh.

'''[[Eucalyptus]]''' bath brooms are often used in the [[Caucasus]]. In the sauna, the broom is usually pressed against the face while breathing through the nose for four to five minutes. However, eucalyptus branches are thin and flexible, and the leaves are longer than other plants, so a eucalyptus bath broom is very difficult to control during the massage.

'''Gukanov’s combined''' bath brooms are a combination of oak, linden, birch and juniper twigs, with the juniper twigs usually hidden within the broom. It is usually stored in the attic, laid out on the floor in several rows on top of one another, with dry brooms at the bottom and wet brooms at the top, or hung during rainy weather. This storage method is troublesome, but it keeps the broom flat, in the shape of a fan, and easy to use. Storing it in the dark helps it keep its aroma, color, and freshness, as the leaves lose their color and smell when exposed to light.

'''Maple, walnut, ash, and elm''' can also be used to make bath brooms, as can young shoots of the cherry tree, cut early in summer. Bundles of any herb, including medicinal or aromatic ones, can be added as well. In summer, usually only entirely herbal brooms are used, including those used for rubbing.

==Preparation==

=== Birch bath broom ===
[[File:Продажа банных веников в городе Йошкар-Ола.JPG|thumb|Veniks on sale in [[Yoshkar-Ola]]]]
According to an old tradition, bath brooms are usually prepared after [[Pentecost]], which takes place fifty days after [[Easter]],  usually in the first half of June. At this time of year, birch trees in different parts of Russia may be in different stages of their annual cycles. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the stage of maturation of plants, when the leaves are the most robust. Bath brooms must be prepared on a dry day. Breaking the brooms takes place in the first half of the day, after the dew.

The weeping birch tree is suitable for making bath brooms. Typically, these trees are tall, with very flexible, with long, spongy twigs. The best option is a young birch tree that has never bloomed before, since it will have the most tender leaves. The top side of the leaf should not be rough, but soft and velvety, while the branches should be thin and straight. The leaves will contain the highest possible concentration of beneficial substances. 

The twigs are first tied together loosely. They are then hung on a pole or a rope stretched under a canopy so they avoid direct sunlight. This should be done in a place with a good draft. After six or seven days, when the twigs are well dried, they are tied together tightly. The brooms are then densely stacked on shelves in a dry, well-ventilated place.

It is best to form the broom into the shape of a fan and not a broom. In order to do this, the fresh twigs should be laid on the floor and turned over every day until they are dry. The brooms should not be dried out too much.

Studies have shown that the best quantity and quality of therapeutic substances in bath brooms (including birch brooms) is achieved by following traditional methods of storing medicinal plants. Tightly tying fresh twigs together will result in the central leaves losing color, darkening, and smelling as if burnt.

The broom should be woven after clearing the handle of leaves and small twigs. Then, the desired number of twigs is wrapped with string, while the left hand holds the twigs together. It is important to lay thicker branches on the inside, and the thin, curved ones around them. This makes the bath broom sturdier and it will be able to last several sauna sessions.

Bath brooms should be stored in a haystack. Prepared branches can be stored in the dark in winter, in the form of a sheaf, and tied up whenever needed. In both cases, the leaves are better preserved.

The oak used for making bath brooms is cut down between June and August in a humid, dark forest. The branches are dried and tied in the same way as the birch bath broom. A correctly dried bath broom should have perfectly green leaves and smell of balsamic birch oil. The smell should increase greatly after steaming the broom. Large shoots are very flexible and thus pleasant to use on the body in the sauna.

==History==
The group originated in Arizona in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.irs&amp;ein=237147797|title=Charity Navigator - IRS Data for Best Friends Animal Society|author=|date=|work=charitynavigator.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing from The Foundation Faith of the Millennium, a religious group formerly known as the [[The Process Church of The Final Judgment|Process Church of the Final Judgment]].&lt;ref name="Love Sex Fear Death"&gt;{{cite book | title = Love Sex Fear Death: The Inside Story of the Process Church of the Final Judgement | author = Timothy Wyllie | publisher = [[Feral House]] | year = 2009 | isbn=978-1-932595-37-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Foundation church relocated animals from its Arizona ranch to property in [[Kanab, Utah]], in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Best Friends: The True Story of the World's Most Beloved Animal Sanctuary |last=Glen |first=Samantha |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Kensington |location= |isbn=978-1-57566-735-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the church was renamed Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, which became a tax-exempt, nonprofit charity, and in 2003 renamed Best Friends Animal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&amp;p_theme=rm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1011201973DE3D37&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | publisher = [[Rocky Mountain News]] | title = Friends Find Their Calling | date = February 28, 2004 }}(pay-per-view article)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal sanctuary==
After the Foundation church moved to the current grounds in 1984, the founders eventually began informally calling it "Best Friends" until 1991 when it began formally operating as Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, a [[no-kill shelter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031006/007627.html|title=AR-News: (UT) Best Friends a haven for unwanted animals|author=|date=|work=envirolink.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in Southwestern [[Utah]] in Angel Canyon (formerly Kanab Canyon) near [[Kanab, Utah|Kanab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netmar.com/~maat/archive/sep3/maloney.htm|title=Best Friends, an Animal Sanctuary with a Difference, with Faith Maloney, by Diane Cooper|author=|date=|work=netmar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sanctuary is on {{convert|3700|acre|km2}} with an additional {{convert|33000|acre|km2}} leased from the United States [[Bureau of Land Management]] near [[Zion National Park]], the Grand Canyon's [[North Rim]], [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], and [[Lake Powell]]. The sanctuary is home to around 1,500 homeless animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petergreenberg.com/voluntourism/|title=Voluntourism - Peter Greenberg Travel Detective|author=|date=26 May 2007|work=petergreenberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''[[DogTown]]'' series was filmed at the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dogtown/ DogTown | Dogtown- National Geographic Channel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109132144/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dogtown/ |date=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Angeles shelter==
In August 2011, the [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]] contracted Best Friends to operate and manage its Northeast Valley Shelter, which the city could no longer afford to run. Under the contract, Best Friends was to provide adoptions for shelter animals and spay and neuter services for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/17/local/la-me-0817-animal-shelter-20110817|title=''Los Angeles Times'', "Los Angeles to hand over animal shelter to nonprofit group," August 17, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_18696494?source=rss|title=Nonprofit to run city shelter|author=|date=|work=dailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==
The group publishes ''Best Friends'', a bimonthly magazine about animals, animal welfare, news events, and activities at the sanctuary. The magazine, which is distributed free to members, has 200,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.albertleatribune.com/2009/04/a-close-look-at-best-friends-animal-society/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20141002012717/http://www.albertleatribune.com/2009/04/a-close-look-at-best-friends-animal-society/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = October 2, 2014 | title = A close look at Best Friends Animal Society | date = April 25, 2009 | publisher = Albert Lea Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originating as ''Foundation'' magazine in 1975 with its interview of Charles Manson referred to as the "death" issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://culteducation.com/group/1102-the-process-church/17415-friends-find-their-calling-.html|title=Friends find their calling|first=Lou|last=Kilzer|date=February 28, 2004|publisher=Reprinted from the Rocky Mountain News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first edition of ''Best Friends'' magazine was published in 1993, two years after the religious group became an animal sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feralhouse.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/LSFD_timeline.pdf|title=The Process Church Timeline (magazine history, page 22)|author=|date=|website=feralhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurricane Katrina work==
Best Friends’ teams entered the hurricane disaster area on September 2, 2005, and stayed eight months in and around New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695206279,00.html|title=Art spotlights rescue of New Orleans pets|first=Nancy|last=Perkins|date=1 September 2007|work=deseretnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best Friends did not have a significant presence doing animal disaster rescue or recovery work until Katrina.

The organization's official role post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] was that of a primary animal rescue organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-09-03-katrinapetrescues_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Animal welfare groups rescue abandoned pets | first1=Anita | last1=Manning | date=September 3, 2005 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9900273/|title=Shaggy survivors still hanging on after Katrina - Health - Pet health - NBC News|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also after Katrina, Best Friends helped Pets Alive, an animal shelter in New York state, rescuing around 800 cats from an institutional hoarding situation in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Volunteers say justice not served |publisher=Pahrump Valley Times |date=February 19, 2010 |url=http://archive.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2010/Feb-19-Fri-2010/news/34381259.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T0mhs86H?url=http://archive.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2010/Feb-19-Fri-2010/news/34381259.html |archivedate=2014-10-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Best Friends also assisted local animal rescue groups following the [[2007 Peru earthquake|Peruvian earthquakes of 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_6928266|title=''Salt Lake Tribune'' |publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Vick dogs==
In 2007, Best Friends took in 22 of 47 former [[NFL]] quarterback [[Michael Vick|Michael Vick's]] fighting dogs after petitioning the state of Virginia to save the dogs seized from the [[Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation]].&lt;ref name="Vick Case"/&gt; The dogs, once owned by [[National Football League|NFL]] Quarterback [[Michael Vick]], were expected to be euthanized for fear of aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Dogfighting|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12108421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven shelters took in the remaining 25 dogs. The court ordered Vick to pay $928,073 in restitution for the “past, present and long-term care of all the dogs.” The court allocated $5,000 for dogs deemed likely to be adopted, and $18,275 for each of the dogs that went into longer-term or lifetime sanctuary care at Best Friends.&lt;ref name="Vick Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/sports/football/12rhoden.html|title=Vick Case Exposes Rift Among Animal-Rights Advocates|first=William C.|last=Rhoden|date=12 March 2008|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/05/20/1938942.aspx NBC "Nightly News," "Michael Vick's Dogs Get A Second Chance," May 20, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225110506/http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/05/20/1938942.aspx |date=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Georgia, a former Vick dog, appeared on [[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]] with Best Friends dog trainer [[John Garcia (dog trainer)|John Garcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ellen.warnerbros.com/2008/12/dogtowns_john_garcia_shares_hi.php?page=2|title="DogTown's John Garcia Shares His Story," "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," December 15, 2008|work=EllenTV|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also appeared on [[CNN]]'s "[[Larry King Live]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0908/17/lkl.01.html|title=CNN transcripts, "Larry King Live," "Does Michael Vick Deserve A Second Chance?" with Best Friends' John Garcia and former fighting dog Georgia|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing story of rehabilitation was profiled in an episode of the [[National Geographic Channel]] program [[DogTown]]. Dogtown’s producer, Darcy Dennett, later approached Best Friends about a feature-length documentary on the same story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIFF 2015: Compassion, Justice &amp; Animal Rights - Hamptons International Film Festival|url=http://hamptonsfilmfest.org/hiff-2015-compassion-justice-animal-rights/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in October 2015, ‘’The Champions’’ covers the stories of five of the dogs in detail, and the impact the dogs have had not just on the people who adopted them, but also on the way society looks at dogs rescued from fighting cases, and the [[pit bull]] breed especially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Champions plot synopsis, IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4125222/synopsis?ref_=ttpl_pl_syn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received the 2015 Zelda Penzel "Giving Voice to the Voiceless" award at the 2015 [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIFF 2015: Awards|url=http://hamptonsfilmfest.org/hiff-2015-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film features the work of both Best Friends Animal Society and [[BAD RAP (organization)|BAD RAP]], an [[Oakland]]-based [[animal welfare]] [[rescue group]].

[[FilmRise]] acquired the rights to the film in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FilmRise Nabs Worldwide Rights To Pit Bull Rescue Documentary ‘The Champions’|url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/filmrise-worldwide-rights-the-champions-documentary-pit-bulls-michael-vick-1201637057/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Champions'' was released theatrically through a series of community screenings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tugg, The Champions|url=https://tugg.com/titles/the-champions}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became available for digital download on March 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Champions Documentary website|url=http://www.championsdocumentary.com/vhx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community cat programs==
In August 2008, Best Friends and [[PetSmart Charities]] funded a program called "Feral Freedom" for free-roaming community cats in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcnmhp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/annual-report-FINAL.pdf|title=First Coast No More Homeless Pets - Annual Report|author=|date=|website=fcnmhp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/112008/met_357958458.shtml|title="Program gives feral cats shot at freedom: More than 1,200 strays have been spayed or neutered - and saved from euthanasia," Tia Mitchell, ''The Florida Times-Union'', November 20, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was conceived by Rick Ducharme of First Coast No More Homeless Pets.

Similar programs were funded with a grant from PetSmart Charities and implemented by Best Friends in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; [[DeKalb County, Georgia]]; [[San Antonio, Texas]]; [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/pets/City-shelter-wins-700k-grant-to-save-cats.html?c=r "City shelter wins $700k grant to save cats"], Amy Worden, ''The Inquirer'', August 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and other communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcnmhp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/annual-report-FINAL.pdf "First Coast No More Homeless Pets Annual Report 10.01.12-9.30.13"], at p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[St. George, Utah]], the city partnered with Best Friends on a trap-neuter-return program in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.vocuspr.com/Newsroom/ViewAttachment.aspx?SiteName=BFAS&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;AttachmentType=F&amp;EntityID=45962&amp;AttachmentID=5235b7b0-0d4a-4c7b-851f-9fc6967bc12c "St. George, Best Friends working together to save lives of community cats"], Best Friends Animal Society, January 08, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The betizu occupies a place in the mythology of the [[Basque people]] under the name of Zezengorri ("red bull").  It is found among the stories of other such animals as the behigorri, txahalgorri, ahatxegorri and idigorri which guard the caves in which are hidden the treasures of [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]].&lt;ref name=ElP/&gt;

The betizu has also been known by different authors and in different locations as the "vaca del país", "casta navarra" and "raza vasca".  [[José Miguel de Barandiarán]] has referred to it as the "vaca huraña".&lt;ref name=ElP&gt;

==Populations==
{{As of|2013}}, the number of individual in [[Navarra]] was estimated at 254;&lt;ref name=ITG/&gt; while the numbers in [[Aquitaine]] were put at less than 150.&lt;ref name=CRA/&gt;

===Navarre reserve===
The Government of [[Navarre]] has launched a project to conserve this autochthonous breed. They own a herd that inhabits the abandoned village of Sastoya, in the [[Urraúl Alto]] valley. The stated goal of the project is to protect and expand this breed.

The Sastoya village encompasses more than {{convert|80|ha|acre}}, of which {{convert|12|ha|acres}} are grasslands. It is inside the area of Ecological Production and is property of the Government of Navarra. It is managed by their Environment Department.  The facility includes several warehouses to manage the livestock.

The Sastoya reservation houses about 45 animals.  Reservation workers limit their contact with the animals in order to preserve their wild nature.

==In popular culture==
The Betizu has recently become popular because a [[Basque language]] children´s program ''Betizu'' broadcast by [[ETB 1]].  The show aims to spread awareness of the animal and the conservation efforts ongoing on its behalf.

'''William Martin Hendon''' (November 9, 1944 – June 20, 2018) was an American [[author]], [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|POW/MIA]] activist, and two-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Member of Congress|U.S. Congressman]] from [[North Carolina]]'s [[North Carolina's 11th congressional district|11th District]].

==Political career==
In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1980|1980]], Hendon ousted two-term incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[V. Lamar Gudger]] to become the first Republican to represent what is now the 11th since 1929.  For the rest of the decade, Hendon's rivalry with Democrat [[James M. Clarke|Jamie Clarke]] gained national attention. In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1982|1982]], Clarke defeated Hendon's bid for re-election by less than 1,500 votes. In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1984|1984]] Hendon gained revenge by defeating Clarke's bid for re-election by just two percentage points—likely helped by [[Ronald Reagan]]'s landslide victory. In their third consecutive meeting in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1986|1986]] Hendon lost to Clarke by one percentage point. Despite being encouraged to run against Clarke for a fourth time in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1988|1988]], Hendon declined.

==Post-political career==

One day prior to the release of ''An Enormous Crime'', ''[[The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]'' ran a story about a passage in [[Douglas Brinkley]]’s ''The Reagan Diaries,'' wherein [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], following a briefing by then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H.

Hendon withdrew his name from consideration for the post in the face of stiff Senate Democratic opposition to his environmental record, and instead accepted a position with the pro-defense American Defense Institute.&lt;ref name="tva"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Molotsky | first = Irvin |author2=Weaver Jr., Warren | title = Washington Talk: Briefing; Turning Down the T.V.A. | newspaper = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | location = New York, NY | pages = B4 | date = 1987-02-23 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/us/washington-talk-briefing-turning-down-the-tva.html | accessdate = 2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would remain an active voice on the POW/MIA issue until his death in 2018.

Hendon died on June 20, 2018 under hospice care in [[Forest City, North Carolina]] after long illness at the age of 73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-carolina/articles/2018-06-26/former-north-carolina-congressman-bill-hendon-dies-at-73|title=Former North Carolina Congressman Bill Hendon Dies at 73|publisher=US News|date=June 26, 2018|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Garner Federal Lands Cleanup Day''' is a day observed in the United States to encourage nationwide citizen participation in the cleanup of federal lands.   It occurs on the first Saturday after [[Labor Day]], and may include a variety of programs, ceremonies, and activities.  It was created in 1985 by the Federal Lands Cleanup Act as the "Federal Lands National Cleanup Day" and renamed in 1995 to honor [[Carl Garner]] and continue and expand his work of encouraging citizens to clean up [[Greers Ferry Lake]] and [[Little Red River (Arkansas)|Little Red River]] in [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyon.edu/garner-visitor-center.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502005955/http://www.lyon.edu/garner-visitor-center.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contextual integrity''' is a theory of privacy developed by professor [[Helen Nissenbaum]] and presented in her book ''Privacy In Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Nissenbaum, Privacy in Context, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Contextual Integrity comprises four essential descriptive claims:

* Privacy is provided by appropriate flows of information.
* Appropriate information flows are those that conform with contextual information norms
* Contextual informational norms refer to five independent parameters: data subject, sender, recipient, information type, and transmission principle
* Conceptions of privacy are based on ethical concerns that evolve over time

Contextual Integrity can be seen as a reaction to theories that define privacy as control over information about oneself, as secrecy, or as regulation of personal information that is private, or sensitive.

This places contextual integrity at odds with privacy regulation based on [[Fair Information Practice Principles]]; it also does not line up with the 1990s [[Cypherpunk]] view that newly discovered [[cryptographic]] techniques would assure privacy in the digital age because preserving privacy is not a matter of stopping any data collection, or blocking all flows of information, minimizing data flow, or by stopping information leakage.

The fourth essential claim comprising Contextual Integrity gives privacy its ethical standing and allows for the evolution and alteration of informational norms, often due to novel sociotechnical systems.  It holds that practices and norms can be evaluated in terms of:
* Effects on the interests and preferences of affected parties 
* How well they sustain ethical and political (societal) principles and values
* How well they promote contextual functions, purposes, and values.

The most distinctive of these considerations is the third. As such, Contextual Integrity highlights the importance of privacy not only for individuals, but for society and respective social domains.

==Contextual Integrity’s Parameters==

The “contexts” of contextual integrity are social domains, intuitively, health, finance, marketplace, family, civil and political, etc. The five critical parameters that are singled out to describe data transfer operation are:

# The data subject
# The sender of the data
# The recipient of the data
# The information type
# The transmission principle.

Some illustrations of contextual informational norms in western societies, include:
* In a job interview, an interviewer is forbidden from asking a candidate’s religious affiliation
* A priest may not share congregants’ confession with anyone
* A U.S. citizen is obliged to reveal gross income to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], under conditions of confidentiality except as required by law
* One may not share a friend’s confidences with others, except, perhaps, with one’s spouse
* Parents should monitor their children’s academic performance

Examples of data subjects include patient, shopper, investor, or reader.  Examples of information senders include a bank, police, advertising network, or a friend. Examples of data recipients include a bank, the police, a friend. Examples of information types include the contents of an email message, the data subject’s demographic information, biographical information, medical information, and financial information. Examples of transmission principles include consent, coerced, stolen, buying, selling, confidentiality, stewardship, acting under the authority of a court with a warrant, and national security.

A key thesis is that assessing the privacy impact of information flows requires the values of all five parameters to be specified. Nissenbaum has found that access control rules not specifying the five parameters are incomplete and can lead to problematic ambiguities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, K and Helen Nissenbaum. "What is private about ‘public’ records data?" ''Targeted Submission: Fall Law Reviews''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissenbaum notes that the some kinds of language can lead one’s analysis astray. For example, when the passive voice is used to describe the movement of data, it allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that there is an active agent performing the data transfer. For example, the sentence “Alice had her identity stolen” allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that someone or something did the actual stealing of Alice’s identity. If we say that “Carol was able to find Bob’s bankruptcy records because they had been placed online”, we are implicitly ignoring the fact that someone or some organization did the actual collection of the bankruptcy records from a court and the placing of those records online.

==Example==
Consider the norm: “US residents are required by law to file tax returns with the US Internal Revenue Service containing information, such as, name, address, SSN, gross earnings, etc. under conditions of strict confidentiality.”


Data Subject: A US resident

Sender: The same US resident

Recipient: The US Internal Revenue Service

Information type: tax information

Transmission principle: the recipient will hold the information in strict confidentiality.


Given this norm, we can evaluate a hypothetical scenario and see if it violates the contextual integrity norm:

Hypothetical: “The US Internal Revenue Service agrees to supply Alice’s tax returns to the city newspaper as requested by a journalist at the paper.”

This hypothetical clearly violates contextual integrity because the providing the tax information to the local newspaper would violate the transmission principle under which the information was obtained.

==Technical Applications of Contextual Integrity==
In 2006 Barth, Datta, Mitchell and Nissenbaum presented a formal language that could be used to reason about the privacy rules in privacy law.  They analyzed the privacy provisions of the Grahm Leach Biley act and showed how to translate some of its principles into the formal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barth|first1=Adam|last2=Datta|first2=Anupam|last3=Mitchell|first3=John|last4=Nissenbaum|first4=Helen|title=Privacy and Contextual Integrity: Framework and Applications|journal=Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy|date=2006|pages=184–198|doi=10.1109/SP.2006.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime in the Dominican Republic''' is investigated by the [[Dominican Republic National Police]].

== Crime by type ==
=== Murder ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2012, the Dominican Republic had a murder rate of 22.1 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 2,268 murders in the Dominican Republic in 2012.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the murder rate had significantly declined. There were 1,198 murders in 2017, a rate of 14.9 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2017-homicide-round-up/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegal drug trade ===
The Dominican Republic has become a trans-shipment point for Colombian drugs destined to Europe as well as the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="CIADemo"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dr.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Dominican Republic |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) |accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NYT'' 2000-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; Money laundering via the Dominican Republic is favored by Colombian drug cartels for the ease of illicit financial transactions.&lt;ref name="CIADemo" /&gt; In 2004, it was estimated that 8% of all cocaine smuggled into the United States had come through the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ribando |first=Claire |title=Dominican Republic: Political and Economic Conditions and Relations with the United States. |publisher=CRS Report for Congress |date= 2005-03-05 |url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/46402.pdf |accessdate=2007-05-29 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominican Republic responded with increased efforts to seize drug shipments, arrest and extradite those involved, and combat money-laundering.

=== Robbery ===
Purse snatchers and briefcase thieves are known to work hotel bars and restaurants waiting for unknowing guests to place these items on chairs or under tables.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt; Pools or beaches are attractive areas for thieves.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=16417 "Dominican Republic 2014 Crime and Safety Report", Overseas Security Advisory Council, US State Department, 10 July 2014.] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of crime are drive-by robberies that are normally performed by one or two assailants on a motorcycle, scooter, or even a bicycle.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt; The assailant will drive up and grab anything that is in arm's reach: purses, cellular phones, necklaces, etc..&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt; In metropolitan Santo Domingo the majority of the motorcycle robberies occurred between 8pm and 11pm, with 85 percent of the motorcycles involved having two riders.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt;

=== Kidnapping ===
Kidnapping is an issue in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt; Victims reported that they were approached by men in police uniforms or similar clothing and were told that their identity needed to be verified.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt; Victims were then taken to an undisclosed location and held from a few hours to a couple of days.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt; During that time, abductors would contact family members and demand huge sums of money for the release of their loved ones.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt; Most families paid the amount, and the victims were released unharmed.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt;

== By location ==
=== Santo Domingo ===
High crime areas in the capital include [[Arroyo Hondo, Santo Domingo|Arroyo Hondo]], Naco, [[Gazcue]], [[Cristo Rey, Distrito Nacional|Cristo Rey]] and Villa Agricola.&lt;ref name="DominicanRepublic2014"/&gt;Pantoja

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">The '''Delbhna Nuadat''' were lords of a large section of what is now Athlone in [[County Roscommon]], situated between the [[River Suck|Suca]] and [[River Shannon|Shannon]] rivers. A branch of the larger [[Delbhna]] population group, they were from the early historic era a subject people of the [[Ui Maine]].

There are a handful of references to the Delbhna Nuadat in the annals. In 751 they were defeated at the battle of Bealach Cro by Crimthann King of Ui Maine. Finn mac Arbh, Lord of Delbhna was killed ''"and the Dealbhna were slaughtered about him."'' This battle appears to have been the culmination of a war between the Ui Maine and the Delbhna Nuadat for possession of Athlone.

In 759, Diumasach Lord of Delbhna Nuadat drowned in an incident called ''"The shipwreck of the Dealbhna Nuadhat on Loch Ribh."''

An entry of 1048 states that ''"A predatory excursion was made by the royal heirs or chieftains of Ui-Maine into Dealbhna, where the royal chieftains were all slain, namely, Ua Maelruanaidh, Ua Flannagain, the Cleireach Ua Taidhg, and Mac Buadhachain, royal heir of Dealbhna Nuadhat."''

The chiefs of Delbhna Nuadat eventually took the surname O'Flannagain or O’Flanagan.

With a population of over 123 million in 2017, '''[[Mexico]]''' ranks as the 11th [[List of countries and dependencies by population|most populated country in the world]]. It is the most populous Spanish-speaking country and the third-most populous in the [[Americas]] after United States and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/19308/total-population-in-mexico/ Statistics on the total population in Mexico], International Monetary Fund. October 2012. Retrieved June 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout most of the twentieth century Mexico's population was characterized by rapid growth. Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1%, the demographic transition is still in progress, and Mexico still has a large [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of youths. The most populous city in the country is the capital, [[Mexico City]], with a population of 8.9 million (2016), and its [[metropolitan area]] is also the most populated with 20.1 million (2010). Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country. In total, about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas, meaning that only 21.16% live in rural areas.

The Census Inegi in Mexico is the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía]] (INEGI). The National Population Council (CONAPO), is an institution under the [[Secretary of the Interior (Mexico)|Secretary of the Interior]] in charge of the analysis and research of population dynamics. The [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] (CDI), also undertakes research and analysis of the sociodemographic and linguistic indicators of the [[indigenous peoples in Mexico]].

In 2017, Mexico's [[total fertility rate]] dropped below [[Sub-replacement fertility|replacement-level fertility]] for the first time (i.e., less than 2.1 children born per woman).

In 1900, the Mexican population was 13.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?ID=203|title=From Traitors to Heroes: 100 Years of Mexican Migration Policies|date=1 March 2004|website=Migrationinformation.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of economic prosperity that was dubbed by economists as the "Mexican Miracle", the government invested in efficient social programs that reduced the [[infant mortality]] rate and increased [[life expectancy]]. These measures jointly led to an intense demographic increase between 1930 and 1980. The population's annual growth rate has been reduced from a 3.5% peak in 1965 to 0.99% in 2005. While Mexico is now transitioning to the third phase of [[demographic transition]], close to 50% of the population in 2009 was 25 years old or younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob03&amp;c=3180|title=Población total por grupos quinquenales de edad según sexo, 1950 a 2005|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fertility rate]]s have also decreased from 5.7 children per woman in 1976 to 2.2 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;

The average annual population growth rate of the capital, the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], was the first   in the country at 0.2%. The state with the lowest population growth rate over the same period was [[Michoacán]] (-0.1%), whereas the states with the highest population growth rates were [[Quintana Roo]] (4.7%) and [[Baja California Sur]] (3.4%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob09&amp;c=3186|title=Tasa de crecimiento media anual de la población por entidad federativa, 1990 a 2005|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are two of the least populous states and the last to be admitted to the Union in the 1970s. The average annual [[net migration rate]] of the Federal District over the same period was negative and the lowest of all [[political divisions of Mexico]], whereas the states with the highest net migration rate were Quintana Roo (2.7), [[Baja California]] (1.8) and Baja California Sur (1.6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob62&amp;c=3239|title=Tasas de inmigración, emigración y migración neta por entidad federativa, 1995–2000|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the national annual growth rate was still positive (1.0%) in the early years of the 2000s, the national net migration rate was negative (-4.75/1000 inhabitants), given the former strong flow of immigrants to the United States; an estimated 5.3 million undocumented Mexicans lived in the United States in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=208|title=Mexican Immigration to the U.S.: The Latest Estimates|date=1 March 2004|website=Migrationinformation.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 18.2 million American citizens in the 2000 Census declared having Mexican ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf3.pdf|title=Census Bureau Summary File|website=Census.gov|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of recent years in the 2010s, the net migration rate reached 0, given the strong economy of Mexico and a weakening American economy, causing many of its former residents to return. However, Mexico is the second country in the total number of immigrants to the United States from 1830 to 2000, after Germany.

The Mexican government projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conapo.gob.mx/00cifras/5.htm Proyecciones de la Población de México 2005–2050] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012092602/http://www.conapo.gob.mx/00cifras/5.htm |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Mexican population will grow to about 123 million by 2042 and then start declining slowly. Assumptions underlying this projection include fertility stabilizing at 1.85 children per woman and continued high net emigration (gently decreasing from 583,000 in 2005 to 393,000 in 2050).

The states and the Federal District that make up the Mexican federation are collectively called "[[political divisions of Mexico|federal entities]]". The five most populous federal entities in 2005 were the [[State of Mexico]] (14.4 million), the Federal District (8.7 million), Veracruz (7.1 million), [[Jalisco]] (6.7 million) and [[Puebla]] (5.4 million),  which collectively contain 40.7% of the national population. Mexico City, being coextensive with the Federal District, is the most populous city in the country, while [[Greater Mexico City]], that includes the adjacent municipalities that comprise a [[metropolitan area]], is estimated to be the second most populous in the world (after Tokyo), according to the UN Urbanization Report.

Intense population growth in the northern states, especially along the US-Mexican border, changed the country's demographic profile in the second half of the 20th century, as the 1967 US-Mexico [[maquiladora]] agreement through which all products manufactured in the border cities could be imported duty-free to the US. Since the adoption of NAFTA in 1994, however, which allows all products to be imported duty-free regardless of their place of origin within Mexico, the non-border maquiladora share of exports has increased while that of border cities has decreased,.&lt;ref&gt;Hufbauer GC and Schott, JJ, ''NAFTA Revisited'', Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to decentralization and rapid economic growth in Mexican states (and cities), such as Quintana Roo (Cancun), Baja California Sur (La Paz), Nuevo Leon (Monterrey), Queretaro, and Aguascalientes.  The population of each of these five states grew by more than one-third from 2000-2015, while the whole of Mexico grew by 22.6% in this period.

===UN estimates===
[[Image:Mexicopop.svg|thumb|250px|Mexico's [[population pyramid]] (2009)]]
According to the 2012 revision of the World Population Prospects, the total population was 117,886,000 in 2010, compared to only 28,296,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 30%, 64% of the population was between 15 and 65 years of age, and 6% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2012"&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506065230/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm |date=May 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International migration==

===Immigration to Mexico===
{{Main|Immigration to Mexico}}

Aside from the original Spanish colonists, many Europeans immigrated to Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Non-Spanish immigrant groups included British, Irish, Italian, German, French and Dutch.&lt;ref name="extranjeros"/&gt; Large numbers of Middle Eastern immigrants arrived in Mexico during the same period, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref name="middle"&gt;[http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf Los árabes de México. Asimilación y herencia cultural] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asian Mexican|Asian immigrants]], mostly Chinese, some via the United States, settled in northern Mexico, whereas Koreans settled in central Mexico.&lt;ref name="korea"&gt;[http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/443030.html Conmemoran 100 años de inmigración coreana] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122103834/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/443030.html |date=January 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s Mexico opened its doors to immigrants from Latin America, mainly political refugees from [[Chile]], [[Cuba]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Central America]]. The [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] governments, in power for most of the 20th century, had a policy of granting asylum to fellow Latin Americans fleeing political persecution in their home countries. A second wave of immigrants has come to Mexico as a result of the economic crises experienced by some countries in the region. The Argentine community is quite significant estimated to be somewhere between 11,000 and 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ime.gob.mx/investigaciones/bibliografias/apuesta_politica_gutierrez.pdf|title=Migrantes, votos, remesas|website=Ime.gob.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729203326/http://www.ime.gob.mx/investigaciones/bibliografias/apuesta_politica_gutierrez.pdf|archive-date=29 July 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/coberturaespecial/argentinos/mexico/index.asp Argentinos en México]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070217072117/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/coberturaespecial/argentinos/mexico/index.asp |date=February 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the 2008 Financial Crisis and the resulting economic decline and high unemployment in Spain, many Spaniards have been emigrating to Mexico to seek new opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newamericamedia.org/2013/02/as-spains-economy-worsens-young-adults-flock-to-mexico-for-jobs.php|title=As Spain's Economy Worsens, Young Adults Flock to Mexico for Jobs - New America Media|website=newamericamedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the last quarter of 2012, a number of 7,630 work permits were granted to Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanielparishflannery/2013/04/30/as-spain-falters-spaniards-look-to-latin-america/ | publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2013-04-30|access-date=2015-12-26|title=As Spain Falters, Spaniards Look to Latin America|first1=Nathaniel Parish|last1=Flannery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico is also the country where the largest number of American citizens live abroad, with Mexico City playing host to the largest number of American citizens abroad in the world. The American Citizens Abroad Association estimated in 1999 that a little more than one million Americans live in Mexico (which represent 1% of the population in Mexico and 25% of all American citizens living abroad).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aca.ch/amabroad.pdf American Citizens Abroad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225044115/http://www.aca.ch/amabroad.pdf |date=February 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This immigration phenomenon could well be explained by the interaction of both countries under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), but also by the fact that Mexico has become a popular destination for retirees, especially the small towns: just in the State of Guanajuato, in [[San Miguel de Allende]] and its surroundings, 10,000 Americans have their residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/World/la/displayStory.cfm?story_id=5214922  Retiring Americans, Go south, old man] by The Economist&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrepancies between the figures of official legal aliens and all foreign-born residents is quite large. The official figure for foreign-born residents in Mexico in 2000 was 493,000,&lt;ref name="immigrants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob64&amp;c=3241|title=Población nacida en otro país residente en México por entidad federativa según sexo, 2000|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a majority (86.9%) of these born in the United States (except [[Chiapas]], where the majority of immigrants are from Central America). The six states with the most immigrants are Baja California (12.1% of total immigrants), Mexico City (the ''Federal District''; 11.4%), Jalisco (9.9%), Chihuahua (9%) and Tamaulipas (7.3%).&lt;ref name="immigrants"/&gt;

===Emigration from Mexico===
The national [[net migration rate]] in Mexico is negative, estimated at -4.32 migrant per 1,000 population. The great majority of Mexican emigrants have moved to the United States of America. This migration phenomenon is not new, but it has been a defining feature in the relationship of both countries for most of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="hufbauer"&gt;[http://www.iie.com/publications/chapters_preview/332/08iie3349.pdf Mexico-US Migration] in Nafta Revisited by the International Institute of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Since World Wars I and II, the United States government approved the recruitment of Mexican workers in their territory, and tolerated unauthorized migration to obtain additional farm and industrial workers to fill the necessary spots vacated by the population in war, and to supply the increase in the demand for labor. Nonetheless, the United States unilaterally ended the program as a result of activities of civil rights groups.&lt;ref name="hufbauer"/&gt; In spite of that, emigration of Mexicans continued throughout the rest of the century at varying degrees. It grew significantly during the 1990s and has continued to do so in the first years of the 2000s. In fact, it has been estimated that 37% of all Mexican immigrants to the United States in the 20th century arrived during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="hufbauer"/&gt; In 2000 approximately 20 million American residents identified themselves as either Mexican, Mexican-Americans or of Mexican origin, making it the sixth most cited ancestry of all US residents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-3.pdf The Hispanic Population] in the United States&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the INEGI estimated that about eight million Mexican-born people, which then was equivalent to 8.7% of the population of Mexico itself, lived in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob65&amp;c=3242 Indicadores seleccionados de la población nacida en México residente en Estados Unidos de América, 1970 a 2000].&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the Mexican states sending the greatest numbers of emigrants to the United States were [[Jalisco]] (170,793), [[Michoacán]] (165,502), and [[Guanajuato]] (163,338); the total number of Mexican emigrants to the United States in 2000, both legal and illegal, was estimated at 1,569,157; the great majority of these were men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob67&amp;c=3244 Población emigrante a Estados Unidos de América por entidad federativa según sexo, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 30% of emigrants come from rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob69&amp;c=3246 Distribución porcentual de la población emigrante a Estados Unidos de América por tamaño de la localidad de residencia para cada sexo, 1990 a 1995 y 1995 a 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;  In that same year, 260,650 emigrants returned to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob71&amp;c=3248|title=Población migrante de retorno de Estados Unidos de América por entidad federativa según sexo, 2000|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Pew Hispanic Center]] in 2006, an estimated ten percent of all Mexican citizens lived in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Growing Stream of Illegal Immigrants Choose to Remain Despite the Risks |author=Lizette Alvarez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/us/20veronicaside.html?_r=1&amp; |newspaper=New York Times |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The population of Mexican immigrants residing illegally in the United States fell from around seven million in 2007 to about 6.1 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/apr/24/tp-mexican-migration-appears-to-be-in-reverse/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501131011/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/apr/24/tp-mexican-migration-appears-to-be-in-reverse/ |archivedate=2015-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This trajectory has been linked to the economic downturn which started in 2008 and reduced available jobs, and to the introduction of stricter immigration laws in many States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/opinion/oped/navarrette-the-mexican-reverse-migration-1.3686534|title=Navarrette: The Mexican reverse migration|website=Newsday.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/26/world/americas/mexico-leaving-us/index.html | work=CNN | title=Mexicans feeling persecuted flee U.S. - CNN.com | date=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/la-now-live-a-daily-conversation-with-the-times-newsroom-15.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A.

After the Mexican-American community, [[Mexican Canadian]]s are the second largest group of emigrant Mexicans, with a population of over 50,000.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  A significant but unknown number of [[Mexican settlement in the Philippines|mestizos of Mexican descent]] had migrated to the [[Philippines]] since the era of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] when the Philippines was a territory under the rule of Mexico city.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1637 the military force maintained in the islands consisted of one thousand seven hundred and two Spaniards and one hundred and forty Indians." ~''Memorial de D. Juan Grau y Monfalcon, Procurador General de las Islas Filipinas, Docs. Inéditos del Archivo de Indias, vi, p. 425.'' "In 1787 ''the garrison at Manila consisted of one regiment of Mexicans comprising one thousand three hundred men, two artillery companies of eighty men each, three cavalry companies of fifty men each.''" ''La Pérouse, ii, p. 368.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexicans live throughout Latin America as well as in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

In 2005 Mexico had 187,938 ''localidades'' (lit. "localities" or "settlements"), which are census-designated places, which could be defined as a small town, a large city, or simply as a single unit housing in a rural area whether situated remotely or close to an urban area. A city is defined to be a settlement with more than 2,500 inhabitants. In 2005 there were 2,640 cities with a population between 2,500 and 15,000 inhabitants, 427 with a population between 15,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, 112 with a population between 100,000 and one million, and 11 with a population of more than one million.&lt;ref name="conteo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/proyectos/conteos/conteo2005/default.asp?c=6224|title=II Conteo de población y vivienda 2005|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All cities are considered "urban areas" and represent 76.5% of total population.  Settlements with less than 2,500 inhabitants are considered "rural communities" (in fact, more than 80,000 of those settlements have only one or two housing units). Rural population in Mexico is 22.2% of total population.&lt;ref name="conteo"/&gt;

[[Municipalities of Mexico|Municipalities]] (''municipios'' in Spanish) and [[boroughs of the Mexican Federal District|boroughs]] (''delegaciones'' in Spanish) are incorporated places in Mexico, that is, second or third-level political divisions with internal autonomy, legally prescribed limits, powers and functions. In terms of second-level political divisions there are 2,438 municipalities and Mexico and 16 semi-autonomous boroughs (all within the Federal District). A municipality can be constituted by one or more cities one of which is the ''cabecera municipal'' (municipal seat). Cities are usually contained within the limits of a single municipality, with a few exceptions in which small areas of one city may extend to other adjacent municipalities ''without'' incorporating the city which serves as the municipal seat of the adjacent municipality. Some municipalities or cities within municipalities are further divided into ''delegaciones'' or boroughs. However, unlike the boroughs of the Federal District, these are third-level administrative divisions; they have very limited autonomy and no elective representatives.

Municipalities in central Mexico are usually very small in area and thus coextensive with cities (as is the case of Guadalajara, Puebla and León), whereas municipalities in northern and southeastern Mexico are much larger and usually contain more than one city or town that may not necessarily conform a single urban agglomeration (as is the case of Tijuana).

===Metropolitan areas===
{{Main|Metropolitan areas of Mexico}}

A metropolitan area in Mexico is defined to be the group of municipalities that heavily interact with each other, usually around a core city.&lt;ref name="CONAPO"&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/metodologias/otras/zonas_met.pdf CONAPO Áreas Metropolitanas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501065908/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/metodologias/otras/zonas_met.pdf |date=2011-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a joint effort between CONAPO, [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|INEGI]] and the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) agreed to define metropolitan areas as either:&lt;ref name="CONAPO"/&gt;
*  the group of two or more municipalities in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or under its area of direct influence other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities all of which have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration; or
* a single municipality in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained, (that is, it does not transcend the limits of a single municipality); or
* a city with a population of at least 250,000 which forms a conurbation with other cities in the United States of America.

In 2004 there were 55 metropolitan areas in Mexico, in which close to 53% of the country's population lives. The most populous metropolitan area in Mexico is the ''Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico'', or [[Greater Mexico City]], which in 2005 had a population of 19.23 million, or 19% of the nation's population. The next four largest metropolitan areas in Mexico are [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area|Greater Guadalajara]] (4.1 million), [[Monterrey Metropolitan area|Greater Monterrey]] (3.7 million), [[Metropolitan area of Puebla|Greater Puebla]] (2.1 million) and [[Greater Toluca]] (1.6 million),&lt;ref name="sintesis"/&gt; whose added population, along with Greater Mexico City, is equivalent to 30% of the nation's population. Greater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country since the 1930s until the late 1980s. Since then, the country has slowly become economically and demographically less centralized. From 2000 to 2005 the average annual growth rate of Greater Mexico City was the lowest of the five largest metropolitan areas, whereas the fastest growing metropolitan area was Puebla (2.0%) followed by Monterrey (1.9%), Toluca (1.8%) and Guadalajara (1.8%).&lt;ref name="sintesis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/img/ppt.gif|title=Síntesis de resultados 2005|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Ethnography}}

==Ethnic groups==
Mexico is ethnically diverse. The second article of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution]] defines the country to be a pluricultural state originally based on the [[indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous peoples]] and combined with European heritage through the process of colonization and "[[mestizaje]]".

===Mestizo===
{{main|Mestizos in Mexico}}
[[File:General Porfirio Díaz.JPG|thumb|President [[Porfirio Diaz]] was of Mestizo descent]]
A large majority of Mexicans have been classified as "Mestizos", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a Spanish cultural heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating elements from both indigenous and Spanish traditions. By the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments the "Mestizo identity" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as ''mestizaje'' {{IPA-es|mestiˈsahe|}}. Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity upon the concept of mestizaje.&lt;ref name="Wade 1981:32"&gt;Wade (1981:32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:78–85)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity than a biological one it has achieved a strong influence in the country, with a good number of phenotypically [[white people]] identifying with it, leading to being considered Mestizos in Mexico's demographic investigations and censuses due the ethnic criteria having its base on cultural traits rather than biological ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI |work=Academic investigation |publisher=University of the State of Mexico |year=2005 |accessdate=10 June 2014 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos: while the term ''Mestizo'' is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood, In Mexican society a non-indigenous person can be considered mestizo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartolomé|first=Miguel Alberto|title=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en México". in Coloquio sobre derechos indígenas|url=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf|publisher=IOC|location=Oaxaca|page=2|year=1996|quote=En primer lugar cabe destacar que en México la pertenencia racial no es un indicador relevante ni suficiente para denotar una adscripción étnica específica. [...] Por lo tanto es relativamente factible realizar el llamado tránsito étnico, es decir que un indígena puede llegar a incorporarse al sector mestizo a través de la renuncia a su cultura tradicional y si sus condiciones materiales se lo permiten.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a person with none or a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Alan|editor=Richard Graham|title=The Idea of Race in Latin America: 1870-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjK65boWTxwC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=17 July 2013|date=1 September 2010|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-78888-6|page=73|chapter=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870–1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaefer, Richard T.

The same applied to Blacks and castas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wade|first=Peter|title=Race And Ethnicity In Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NhaCpKqNBEC|accessdate=17 July 2013|date=20 May 1997|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-0987-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo has a different meaning, with it being to refer to the [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]]-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the [[Caste War of Yucatán|caste war]] of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as Mestizos.&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2"&gt;Bartolomé (1996:2)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chiapas the word "Ladino" is used instead of mestizo.&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1997:44–47)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the word Mestizo has different meanings in Mexico, estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which uses a biology-based approach, between one half and two thirds of the Mexican population is Mestizo.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico- Ethnic groups|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/Ethnic-groups|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A culture-based estimate gives the percentage of Mestizos as high as 90%.&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"&gt;[http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dejó de clasificar a la población del país en tres categorías raciales, blanco, mestizo e indígena, y adoptó una nueva clasificación étnica que distinguía a los hablantes de lenguas indígenas del resto de la población, es decir de los hablantes de español.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |date=2013-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, the word Mestizo has long been dropped from popular Mexican vocabulary, with the word even having pejorative connotations,&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2" /&gt; which further complicates attempts to quantify Mestizos via self-identification.

Prior to contact with Europeans the indigenous peoples of Mexico had not had any kind of shared identity.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:75)&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous identity was constructed by the dominant Euro-Mestizo majority and imposed upon the indigenous people as a negatively defined identity, characterized by the lack of assimilation into modern Mexico. Indigenous identity therefore became  socially stigmatizing.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, Judith. 1975. ''Being Indian in Hueyapan: A Study of Forced Identity in Contemporary Mexico''.  New York: Saint Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to help indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society, eventually [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] indigenous peoples completely to Mestizo Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the "Indian problem" by transforming indigenous communities into mestizo communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé, Miguel Alberto. (1996) "Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en México". in Coloquio sobre derechos indígenas, Oaxaca, IOC.[http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf] p.5)&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of "indigena" (indigenous) in Mexico has been defined based on different criteria through history, this means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as "indigenous" varies according to the definition applied. It can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak an Indigenous language, based on this criteria approximately 5.4% of the population is Indigenous.&lt;ref name="inegi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen01&amp;c=3325 |title=Indicadores seleccionados sobre la población hablante de lengua indígena, 1950 a 2005 |website=Inegi.gob.mx |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118010024/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen01&amp;c=3325 |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, activists for the rights of indigenous peoples have referred to the usage of this criteria for census purposes as "statistical genocide"&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:73-74)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:3-4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other surveys made by the Mexican government do count as Indigenous all persons who speak an indigenous language and people who do not speak indigenous languages nor live in indigenous communities but self-identifies as Indigenous. According to this criteria, the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] (Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]] (Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography), state that there are 15.7 million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups,&lt;ref name=CDI1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/cedulas/sintesis_resultados_2005.pdf |title=Síntesis de Resultados |publisher=Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas |year=2006 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which constitute 14.9% of the population in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Defined as persons who live in a household where an indigenous language is spoken by one of the adult family members, and or people who self identified as indigenous ("Criteria del hogar: De esta manera, se establece, que los hogares indígenas son aquellos en donde el jefe y/o el cónyuge y/o padre o madre del jefe y/o suegro o suegra del jefe hablan una lengua indígena y también aquellos que declararon pertenecer a un grupo indígena."[http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=272&amp;Itemid=58])AND persons who speak an indigenous language but who do not live in such a household (Por lo antes mencionado, la Comisión Nacional Para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas de México (CDI) considera población indígena (PI) a todas las personas que forman parte de un hogar indígena, donde el jefe(a) del hogar, su cónyuge y/o alguno de los ascendientes (madre o padre, madrastra o padrastro, abuelo(a), bisabuelo(a), tatarabuelo(a), suegro(a)) declaro ser hablante de lengua indígena.

In this occasion, people who self-identified as "Indigenous" and people who self-identified as "partially Indigenous" were classified in the "Indigenous" category altogheter.&lt;ref name="beta.inegi.org.mx"&gt;[http://www.beta.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/proyectos/enchogares/especiales/intercensal/2015/doc/eic2015_resultados.pdf "Encuesta Intercensal 2015"], “[[INEGI]]”, Mexico, December 2015.

The Mexican constitution not only recognizes the 62 indigenous peoples living in Mexican territory but also grants them autonomy and protects their culture and languages. This protection and autonomy is extended to those Amerindian ethnic groups which have migrated from the United States — like the [[Cherokee]]s and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]] — and [[Guatemala]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. Municipalities in which indigenous peoples are located can keep their normative traditional systems in relation to the election of their municipal authorities. This system is known as ''Usos y Costumbres'', roughly translated as "customs and traditions".

According to official statistics —as reported by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] or CDI— Amerindians make up 10-14%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico,|title=Mexico - History, Geography, Facts, &amp; Points of Interest|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the country's population, more than half of them (5.4% of total population) speak an indigenous language and a tenth (1.2% of total population) do not speak Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POBLACIÓN DE 5 AÑOS Y MÁS POR ENTIDAD FEDERATIVA, SEXO Y GRUPOS LENGUA INDÍGENA QUINQUENALES DE EDAD, Y SU DISTRIBUCIÓN SEGÚN CONDICIÓN DE HABLA INDÍGENA Y HABLA ESPAÑOLA|publisher=INEGI, México|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00li01.pdf|accessdate=2007-12-13|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102103605/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00li01.pdf|archivedate=2008-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Official statistics of the CDI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx|title=Comision Nacional Para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas - México|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that the states with the greatest percentage of people who speak an Amerindian language or identify as Amerindian are [[Yucatán]] (59%), [[Oaxaca]] (48%), [[Quintana Roo]] (39%), [[Chiapas]] (28%), [[Campeche]] (27%), [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] (24%), [[Puebla]] (19%), [[Guerrero]] (17%), [[San Luis Potosí]] (15%) and [[Veracruz]] (15%).

===Arab Mexicans===
{{see also|Arab Mexicans}}
[[File:Carlos Slim Helú.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|[[Carlos Slim]] is of [[Lebanese Mexican|Lebanese descent]].]]
An Arab Mexican is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] citizen of [[Arabic]]-speaking origin who can be of various ancestral origins. The vast majority of Mexico's 1.1 million Arabs are from either [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Syria]]n, [[Iraq]]i, or [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2010}}{{cite web|url=http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/https://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interethnic marriage in the Arab community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the  Arab community in Mexico shows marked [[language shift]] away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic, and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as a first language. Today, the most common Arabic [[surnames]] in Mexico include Nader, Hayek, Ali, Haddad, Nasser, Malik, Abed, Mansoor, Harb and Elias.

Arab immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They came mostly from [[Lebanon]], Syria, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Iraq]] and settled in significant numbers in [[Nayarit]], [[Puebla]], [[Mexico City]] and the Northern part of the country (mainly in the states of [[Baja California]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Nuevo Leon]], [[Sinaloa]], Chihuahua, [[Coahuila]], and [[Durango]], as well as the city of [[Tampico]] and [[Guadalajara]]. The term "Arab Mexican" may include ethnic groups that do not in fact identify as Arab.

During the Israel-Lebanon war in 1948 and during the Six-Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico. They first arrived in Veracruz. Although Arabs made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/https://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration of Arabs in Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, where they have introduced [[Kibbeh]], [[Tabbouleh]] and even created recipes such as ''[[Tacos Árabes]]'' (a.k.a. Tacos al Pastor). By 1765,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Phoenix dactylifera|Dates]], which originated from the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards. The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatecan]] cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverymexico.com/Culture/Arab-Influence-in-Yucatecan-Cuisine/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316235742/http://www.discoverymexico.com/Culture/Arab-Influence-in-Yucatecan-Cuisine/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 March 2008|title=Arab Influence in Yucatecan Cuisine – Mexico Culture – Arab Influence in Yucatecan Cuisine, Culture|date=16 March 2008|website=Discoverymexico.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concentration of Arab-Mexicans is in [[Baja California]] facing the U.S.-Mexican border, esp. in cities of [[Mexicali, Baja California|Mexicali]] in the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]] U.S./Mexico, and [[Tijuana, Baja California|Tijuana]] across from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] with a large [[Arab American]] community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico. 45% of Arab Mexicans are of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent.

The majority of Arab-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the [[Maronite Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-536840/Marin-Guzman-Roberto-and-Zidane.html|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scant number are [[Muslims]] and [[Jews]] of Middle Eastern origins.

Afro-Mexicans are an ethnic group that predominate in certain areas of Mexico. Such as the [[Costa Chica of Oaxaca]] and the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero]], Veracruz (e.g. [[Yanga, Veracruz|Yanga]]) and in some towns in northern Mexico. The existence of blacks in Mexico is unknown, denied or diminished in both Mexico and abroad for a number of reasons: their small numbers, heavy intermarriage with other ethnic groups and Mexico's tradition of defining itself as a "mestizaje" or mixing of European and indigenous. Mexico did have an active slave trade since the early Spanish period but from the beginning, intermarriage and mixed race offspring created an elaborate caste system. This system broke down in the very late Spanish period and after Independence the legal notion of race was eliminated. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past actively or passively eliminating its African one from popular consciousness.

The majority of Mexico's native Afro-descendants are ''Afromestizos'', i.e. "mixed-race". Individuals with significantly high amounts of African ancestry make up a very low percentage of the total Mexican population, the majority being recent black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas. According to the Intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government, Afro-Mexicans make up 1.2% of Mexico's population, the Afro-Mexican category in the Intercensal survey includes people who self-identified solely as African and people who self-identified as partially African. The survey also states that 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous, with 9.3% being speakers of [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]].&lt;ref name="beta.inegi.org.mx"/&gt;

===Asian Mexicans===

Although Asian Mexicans make up less than 1% of the total population of modern [[Mexico]], they are nonetheless a notable minority. Due to the historical and contemporary perception in Mexican society of what constitutes Asian culture (associated with the [[Far East]] rather than the [[Near East]]), Asian Mexicans are of [[East Asian|East]], [[South Asian|South]] and [[Southeast Asian]] descent and Mexicans of [[West Asian]] descent are not considered to be part of the group.

Asian immigration began with the arrival of [[Filipinos]] to Mexico during the Spanish period. For two and a half centuries, between 1565 and 1815, many Filipinos and Mexicans sailed to and from Mexico and the Philippines as sailors, crews, slaves, prisoners, adventurers and soldiers in the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] assisting [[Spain]] in its trade between Asia and the Americas. Also on these voyages, thousands of Asian individuals (mostly males) were brought to Mexico as slaves and were called "Chino",&lt;ref name="Seijas"&gt;{{cite book|author= Tatiana Seijas| title=

She  arrived in [[New Spain]] and eventually she gave rise to the "[[China Poblana]]".

These early individuals are not very apparent in modern Mexico for two main reasons: the widespread ''[[mestizaje]]'' of Mexico during the Spanish period and the common practice of ''Chino'' slaves to "[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]" as ''Indios'' (the indigenous people of Mexico) in order to attain freedom. As had occurred with a large portion of Mexico's black population, over generations the Asian populace was absorbed into the general [[Mestizo]] population. Facilitating this [[miscegenation]] was the assimilation of Asians into the indigenous population. The indigenous people were legally protected from [[chattel slavery]], and by being recognized as part of this group, Asian slaves could claim they were wrongly enslaved.

Asians, predominantly Chinese, became Mexico's fastest-growing immigrant group from the 1880s to the 1920s, exploding from about 1,500 in 1895 to more than 20,000 in 1910.&lt;ref name="Buchenau"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buchenau |first1=Jürgen |date=Spring 2001 |title= Small Numbers, Great Impact: Mexico and Its Immigrants, 1821-1973 |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rgolden/MexicoImmigration.pdf |journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official censuses===
Historically, population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that  a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico's require: the first racial census was made in 1793, being also Mexico's (then known as [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]) first ever nationwide population census. Since only part of its original datasets survive, most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who back in the day used the census' findings as reference for their own works. More than a century would pass until the Mexican government conducted a new racial census in 1921 (some sources assert that the census of 1895 included a comprehensive racial classification;&lt;ref name="fnavarrete"/&gt; however, according to the historic archives of [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|Mexico's National Institute of Statistics]], that was not the case).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beta.inegi.org.mx/proyectos/ccpv/1895 "censo General de la Republica Mexicana 1895"], “[[INEGI]]”, Mexico, Retrieved on 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1921 census was the last time the Mexican government conducted a census that included a comprehensive racial classification, in recent years it has conducted nationwide surveys to quantify most of the ethnic groups who inhabit the country as well as the social dynamics and inequalities between them.

====1793 census====
[[File:Mapa del Virreinato de la Nueva España (1819).svg|thumb|300px|New Spain in 1819, with the boundaries established by the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]]]]
Also known as the "Revillagigedo census" from the name of the Count who ordered that it be conducted, this census was the first nationwide population census of Mexico (then known as the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]). Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, so most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works, such as Prussian geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they don't vary greatly, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos from 21% to 25%, Indians from 51% to 61%, and Africans from 6,000 and 10,000. The estimations given for the total population range from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%–17% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies in their suffering higher mortality rates due to living in remote locations rather than in cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or in being at war with them. For the same reasons, the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greatest variation range between publications, as in some cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf "Consideraciones sobre la población de la Nueva España (1793-1810)"], ''El Colegio de Mexico'', Mexico, Retrieved on 24 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

~&lt;small&gt;Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.&lt;/small&gt;

Regardless of the possible inaccuracies related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside of the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put into considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens or subjects; for example, the censuses made by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.&lt;ref name=scarecrow&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. pp.&amp;nbsp;239–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the censuses made by the [[United States]], which did not include Indigenous peoples living among the general population until 1860, and indigenous peoples as a whole until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/census/native-americans/1790-1930.html "American Indians in the Federal Decennial Census"], Retrieved on 25 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1921 census====
Made right after the consummation of the Mexican revolution, the social context in which this census was conducted makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking to unite all Mexicans in a single national identity. The 1921 census' final results in regards to race, which assert that 59.3% of the Mexican population self-identified as Mestizo, 29.1% as Indigenous, and only 9.8% as White, were then essential in cementing the ''mestizaje'' ideology (which asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races), which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the 20th century and remains prominent nowadays, with extraofficial international publications such as ''[[The World Factbook]]'' and ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' using the 1921 census as a reference to estimate Mexico's racial composition up to this day.&lt;ref name=CIA-Factbook-Quote&gt;{{cite web|title=North America: Mexico|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=11 April 2014|author=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)|location=Ethnic groups:|quote=mestizo (Amerindian-Spanish) 60%, Amerindian or predominantly Amerindian 30%, white 9%, other 1%}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

Nonetheless in recent times, the census' results have been subjected to scrutiny by historians, academics and social activists alike, who assert that such drastic alterations on demographic trends with respect to the 1793 census are impossible and cite, among other statistics, the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://istmo.mx/index.php/2016/07/04/el-mestizaje-es-un-mito-la-identidad-cultural-si-importa/ "El mestizaje es un mito, la identidad cultural sí importa"] ''Istmo'', Mexico, Retrieved on 25 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that the ''mestizaje'' process sponsored by the state was more "cultural than biological", which resulted in the numbers of the Mestizo Mexican group being inflated at the expense of the identity of other races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dimensionantropologica.inah.gob.mx/?p=7401 "Más desindianización que mestizaje.

When the 1921 census' results are compared with the results of Mexico's recent censuses&lt;ref name="beta.inegi.org.mx"/&gt; as well as with modern genetic research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investigacionyciencia.es/revistas/investigacion-y-ciencia/matemticas-del-planeta-tierra-585/el-impacto-del-mestizaje-en-mxico-11442 "El impacto del mestizaje en México"], “Investigación y Ciencia”, Spain, October 2013. Retrieved on 01 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; there is high consistency with respect to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country, with states located in south and south-eastern Mexico having both the highest percentages of population who self-identify as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry. However, this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans, as there are instances in which states that have been shown through scientific research to have a considerably high European ancestry are reported to have very small white populations in the 1921 census, with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango, where the aforementioned census asserts that only 0.01% of the state's population (33 persons) self-identified as "white" while modern scientific research shows that the population of Durango has similar genetic frequencies to those found on [[Ethnic groups of Europe|European peoples]] (with the state's Indigenous population showing almost no foreign admixture either).&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0091270006287586 | volume=46 | issue=5 | title=CYP2D6Genotype and Phenotype in Amerindians of Tepehuano Origin and Mestizos of Durango, Mexico | year=2006 | journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | pages=527–536 | last1 = Sosa-Macías | first1 = Martha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors theorize that the reason for these inconsistencies may lie in the Mestizo identity promoted by the Mexican government, which reportedly led to people who are not biologically Mestizos to identify themselves as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI |work=Academic investigation |publisher=University of the State of Mexico |year=2005 |accessdate=10 June 2014 |language=Spanish |page=196 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html El mestizaje y las culturas regionales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |date=23 August 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The present day====
The following table is a compilation of (when possible) official nationwide surveys conducted by the Mexican government who have attempted to quantify different Mexican ethnic groups. Given that for the most part each ethnic group was estimated by different surveys, with different methodologies and years apart rather than on a single comprehensive racial census, some groups could overlap with others and be overestimated or underestimated.

Of all the ethnic groups that have been surveyed, Mestizos are notably absent, which is likely due the label's fluid and subjective definition, which complicates its precise quantification. However it can be safely assumed that Mestizos make up at least the remaining 30% unassessed percentage of Mexico's population with possibilities of increasing if the methodologies of the extant surveys are considered. As example the 2015 intercensal survey considered as Indigenous Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans altogether individuals who self-identified as "part Indigenous" or "part African" thus, said people technically would be Mestizos. Similarly, White Mexicans were quantified based on physical traits and appearance, thus technically a Mestizo with a percentage of Indigenous ancestry that was low enough to not affect his or her primarily European phenotype was considered to be white. Finally the remaining ethnicities, for being of a rather low number or being faiths have more permissive classification criteria, therefore a Mestizo could claim to belong to one of them by practicing the faith, or by having an ancestor who belonged to said ethnicities.
Nonetheless, contemporary sociologists and historians agree that, given that the concept of "race" has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one and to society's eyes a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered "white" and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered "Indian", a person that identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to, even if biologically it doesn't completely belong to that group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf|access-date=2017-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801102632/http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf#|archive-date=2017-08-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the ''[[de facto]]'' official [[language]] in Mexico being spoken by 98.3% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encuesta Intercensal 2015|publisher=INEGI, México|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexican Spanish]] is spoken in a variety of dialects, accents and variations in different regions across the country.

Some indigenous languages are still being spoken by around 5% of Mexicans according to the latest census, in 2003 the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]] recognized 68 indigenous languages as "national languages", with the "same validity" in all territories and contexts where they are spoken. The indigenous language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Nahuatl]] (1,586,884 speakers in 2010 or 1.5% of the nation's population), followed by [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] (796,405 speakers in 2010 0.8%) spoken [[Yucatán Peninsula]], Mixtecas languages (494,454), Tzeltal (474,298), Zapotecas languages (460,683), Tzotzil (429,168), Otomí (288,052), Totonaca (250,252) Mazateco (230,124), Chol (222,051) and 1,462,857 speakers of other languages. After half a century of rural-to-urban migration, in Mexico City and other major cities large districts and sections use both written and spoken Amerindian languages.

During the first half of the 20th century the government promoted a policy of ''castellanización'', that is, promoting the use of Spanish as a way to integrate indigenous peoples into Mexican society. Later, this policy changed, and since the 1980s the government has sponsored bilingual and intercultural education in all indigenous communities. This policy has mainly been successful in large communities with a significant number of speakers. While some languages, with less than 1,000 speakers, are still facing extinction.

The second most spoken language in Mexico, however, is English. It is used extensively at border areas, tourist centers and large metropolitan areas, a phenomenon arguably caused by the economic integration of North American under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the immigration phenomenon and the return of workers and their families from the United States.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In border cities, American TV and radio waves in English (and Spanish) are received as much Spanish-speaking radio and TV stations from Mexico on the US side of the border, thus a bilingual cross-cultural exchange is at work.

Among the languages brought to the country by immigrants are the [[Venetian language|Venetian]] of [[Chipilo]], and [[Mennonite Low German]] spoken in [[Durango]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. Other languages spoken in Mexico include [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Occitan, Catalan, Basque, Galician, Asturian, Chinese, Hebrew, Korean, Ladino, Plautdietsch, Armenian, Italian, etc. Although some of these may have a greater number of speakers than the national languages, they are not recognized by the government.

==Mexican nationality and citizenship==
{{Main|Mexican nationality law}}
The [[Constitution of Mexico]] grants Mexican nationality based on birth and naturalization. Mexican laws regarding nationality by birth are very open. Mexican nationality by birth is granted to:&lt;ref name=thirty&gt;[http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/fed/9/31.htm?s= Artículo 30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103192800/http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/fed/9/31.htm?s= |date=2008-01-03 }}. Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos.&lt;/ref&gt;
* all those individuals born in Mexican territory,
* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by birth,
* all those individuals born outside Mexico, whose father or mother is Mexican by naturalization,
* all those individuals born aboard Mexican aircraft or sea vessels, whether warships or commercial vessels.

Mexican nationality by naturalization is granted to:&lt;ref name=thirty/&gt;
* foreign citizens granted Mexican nationality by the Secretariat of Government (Ministry of the Interior);
* foreign citizens married to a Mexican national, whether by birth or naturalization.

The Mexican population is predominantly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] (83.9% of the population aged five and older, according to the 2010 census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/Sistemas/temasV2/contenido/sociedad/rel01.asp?s=est&amp;c=22436|title=Volumen y porcentaje de la población según profese alguna religión y tipo de religión, 1895 a 2010|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the percentage representing those who attend church on a weekly basis is lower (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/print.php?Releases%2F1997%2FDec97%2Fchr121097a# |title=Church attendance in Latin America |access-date=2017-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901122224/http://www.ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/print.php?Releases%2F1997%2FDec97%2Fchr121097a# |archive-date=2006-09-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7.6% of the population was classified as [[Protestantism|Protestant]] or Evangelical, 2.5% were classified as "Non-Evangelical Biblical" (a classification that groups [[Adventism|Adventist]]s, [[Mormons]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]), 0.05% as practicing [[Judaism|Jews]], and 4.6% without a religion.&lt;ref name="religion"&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00re01.pdf Población de 5 años y más por entidad federativa, sexo y religión y su distribución según grupos quinquenales de edad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925184950/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2000/definitivos/Nal/tabulados/00re01.pdf |date=September 25, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest group of Protestants are [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] and [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatics]] (classified as Neo-Pentecostals).

The states with the highest percentage of professing Catholics are central states, namely [[Guanajuato]] (96.4%), [[Aguascalientes]] (95.6%) and [[Jalisco]] (95.4%), whereas southeastern states have the lowest percentage of Catholics, namely [[Chiapas]] (63.8%), [[Tabasco]] (70.4%) and [[Campeche]] (71.3%).&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt; The percentage of professing Catholics has been on the decrease over the last four decades, from over 98% in 1950 to 87.9% in 2000. The average annual growth of Catholic believers from 1990 to 2000 was 1.7% whereas that of non-Catholics was 3.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mrel02&amp;c=2583|title=Tasa de crecimiento media anual de la población según credo religioso para cada período decenal, 1950 a 2000|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the average annual population increase over the same time period was 1.8%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mpob08&amp;c=3185|title=Tasa de crecimiento media anual de la población, 1950 a 2005|website=Inegi.org.mx|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the percentage of Catholics in relation to the total population continues to be in overall decline.

Unlike some other countries in Latin America or [[Ibero-America]], the 1857 Mexican Constitution drastically separates Church and State. The State does not support or provide any economic resource to the Church (as is the case in Spain and Argentina),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Argentina/argen94.html#primerapartecap1|title=Argentina: Constitución de 1994|website=pdba.georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church cannot participate in public education (no public school can be operated by a Catholic order, although they can participate in private education). Moreover, the government nationalized all the Church's properties (some of which were given back in the 1990s), and priests lost the right to vote or to be voted for (although in the 1990s they regained the right to vote).

[[File:REAGANBUSHEULOGY2.jpg|thumb|[[George W. Bush]] delivers the eulogy at [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|state funeral]], June 2004]]
A '''eulogy''' (from εὐλογία, ''eulogia'', [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], ''eu'' for "well" or "true", ''logia'' for "words" or "text", together for "praise") is a [[Speech (public address)|speech]] or writing in [[praise]] of a person(s) or thing(s), especially one who recently [[Deceased|died]] or [[retired]] or as a term of endearment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/eulogy?q=eulogy Oxford Dictionaries].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/06/20040611-2.html President Bush's Eulogy at [[Funeral|Funeral Service]] for President Reagan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EulogySpeech.net |url=http://www.eulogyspeech.net |title=Funeral Speech |publisher=Eulogyspeech.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eulogies may be given as part of [[funeral service]]s. They take place in a funeral home during or after a wake. However, some denominations either discourage or do not permit eulogies at services to maintain respect for traditions. Eulogies can also praise people who are still alive. This normally takes place on special occasions like [[birthday]]s, office parties, retirement celebrations, etc. Eulogies should not be confused with [[Elegy|elegies]], which are [[poem]]s written in tribute to the dead; nor with [[Obituary|obituaries]], which are published [[Biography|biographies]] recounting the lives of those who have recently died; nor with [[Obsequy|obsequies]], which refer generally to the [[ritual]]s surrounding funerals. [[Catholic]] priests are prohibited by the rubrics of the Mass from presenting a eulogy for the deceased in place of a [[homily]] during a funeral [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20030317_ordinamento-messale_en.html#II._MASSES_FOR_THE_DEAD The General Instruction of the Roman Missal 382].&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern use of the word ''eulogy'' was first documented in the 15th century and came from the Medieval Latin term ''eulogium'' (Merriam-Webster 2012). ''Eulogium'' at that time has since turned into the shorter ''eulogy'' of today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eulogy |title=Eulogy &amp;#124; Definition of Eulogy by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eulogies are usually delivered by a family member or a close family friend in the case of a dead person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=InspirationalEulogy.com |url=http://www.inspirationaleulogy.com |title=Memorial tribute |publisher=inspirationaleulogy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a living eulogy given in such cases as a retirement, a senior colleague could perhaps deliver it. On occasions, eulogies are given to those who are severely ill or elderly in order to express words of love and gratitude before they die. Eulogies are not limited to merely people, however; places or things can also be given eulogies (which anyone can deliver), but these are less common than those delivered to people, whether living or deceased.

==Famous eulogies==
A successful eulogy may provide comfort or inspiration as well as establish a connection to the person whom the eulogy is in behalf of. The following section will explore some well-known eulogies that have done just that.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]’s eulogy for the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' space shuttle crew]] (1986):

{{Quote
|text=I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The ''Challenger'' crew was pulling us into the future, and we’ll continue to follow them.&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Nastasi |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/10-inspiring-confusing-and-humorous-eulogies-of-the-famous/247698/#disqus_thread |title=10 Inspiring, Confusing, and Humorous Eulogies of the Famous |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Charles Spencer]]’s eulogy for his sister, [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] (1997):

{{Quote
|text=Diana was the very essence of compassion, of duty, of style, of beauty. All over the world she was a symbol of selfless humanity, a standard-bearer for the rights of the truly downtrodden, a truly British girl who transcended nationality, someone with a natural nobility who was classless, who proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic.&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"/&gt;
}}

[[Jawaharlal Nehru]]’s eulogy for [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1948):

{{Quote
|text=The first thing to remember now is that no one of us dare misbehave because we’re angry [sic]. We have to behave like strong and determined people, determined to face all the perils that surround us, determined to carry out the mandate that our great teacher and our great leader had given us, remembering always that if, as I believe, his spirit looks upon us and sees you, nothing would displease his soul so much as to see that we have indulged in any small behavior or any violence.

So we must not do that. But that does not mean that we should be weak, but rather that we should in strength and in unity face all the troubles and difficulties and conflicts must be ended in the face of this great disaster. A great disaster is a symbol to us to remember all the big things of life and forget the small things, of which we have thought too much.&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"/&gt;
}}

[[Ted Kennedy]]'s eulogy for his brother [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (1968):

{{Quote
|text=My brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.

Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today, pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world.

As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him: Some men see things as they are and say why; I dream things that never were and say why not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ekennedytributetorfk.html |title=Address at the Public Memorial Service for Robert F. Kennedy |last=Kennedy |first=Edward M. |date=June 8, 1968 |access-date=October 18, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Different types of eulogies==

There are many different types of eulogies. Some of them are strictly meant to be a biography of the person’s life. The short biography is a simply retelling of what the individual went through in his life. This can be done to highlight major points in the deceased’s life. Another version is by telling a more personal view on what the individual did. It entails retelling memories that are shared between the storyteller and the deceased. Memories, impressions, and experiences are all things that can be included in a retelling of the personal eulogy (Burch, 2006).

In an FBI Intelligence Assessment from 2006, the [[FBI Counterterrorism Division]] provides an overview of white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement and mentions that use of the term came to the agency's attention in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=FBI Counterterrorism Division|title=White Supremacist Infiltration of Law Enforcement|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/402521/doc-26-white-supremacist-infiltration.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=17 October 2006|quote=(U/LES) Since coming to law enforcement attention in late 2004, the term ''ghost skins'' has gained currency among white supremacists to describe those who avoid overt display of their beliefs to blend into society and covertly advance white supremacist causes. One internet posting described this effort as a form of role-playing in which "to create the character, you must get inside the mind of the person you are trying to duplicate."* Such role playing has an application to ad-hoc and organized law enforcement infiltration. At least one white supremacist group has reportedly encouraged ghost skins to seek positions in law enforcement for the capability of alerting skinhead crews of pending investigative action against them.&lt;br/&gt;(U/LES) Leaders in the white supremacist movement have advocated confronting suspected infiltrators and to instruct them to provide their FBI handlers with low level information that will minimally impact the group's activities. Another as yet undocumented infiltration strategy is for members to "walk in" to law enforcement agencies and offer information to determine an agency's interest in the organization.&lt;br/&gt;*(U) http://www.nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghost Aryan Skin Warrior|url=http://nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=4 February 2005|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204162439/http://nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm|archivedate=4 February 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI report on Police infiltration ...

'''''Global South Development Magazine''''' ('''''GSDM''''') is an online magazine of international development issues. The magazine is inspired by the idea of citizen journalism and primarily covers developmental issues of [[developing countries]]. From 2010 to 2015, ''GSDM'' was a quarterly magazine published by a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[non-profit]] development media organisation [http://www.silcreation.org Silver Lining Creation ry]. As of 2018, the magazine is published by Helsinki-based media organization, Global South Media Action.

==History==
The first issue of the quarterly magazine was published in March 2010 dedicating its first cover issue to the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit.&lt;ref&gt;GSDM documents archive: http://www.silcreation.org/apps/documents/&lt;/ref&gt; Since then subsequent issues were published and were made available  online. On 11 September 2011, the magazine team was expanded with an Assistant Editor and a number of other [[special correspondents]]&lt;ref&gt;GSDM expands its team: http://www.silcreation.org/apps/blog/show/9033667-gsdm-expands-its-global-team-fenton-assistant-editor-new-special-correspondents-for-south-to-south-cooperation-development-aid-conflict-states-&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine team claimed that within relatively short period of its inception, their publication had been received very well and still has an influential global readership. ''GSDM's'' distribution was free of charge. In 2012, the [[magazine]] launched a separate [http://gsdmagazine.org website] to archive its published articles and special reports.&lt;ref&gt;Global South Development Magazine: http://www.silcreation.org/globalsouthdevelopmentmag.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''GSDM'' introduced the concept of Development Reporters as an effort to encourage students of development studies and community activists to write about global development issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://gsdmagazine.org/developmentreporter/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Team==
''Global South Development Magazine'' has been run by its [http://www.silcreation.org/globalteamgsdm.htm global editorial team] which by June 2012 consisted 40 professional volunteers from different parts of the world. The magazine has an executive editorial team, five regional editors, a group of special correspondents and numerous country reporters.&lt;ref&gt;Global South Development Magazine Global Editorial team: http://www.gsdmagazine.org/editorial-team/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Covered issues ==
[[Image:Global South Development Magazine April 2012.jpg|thumb|right|April 2012 issue of Global South Development Magazine featuring conflict in [[the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].]]

''GSDM'' has covered many issues that range from development aid to environmental sustainability. On its October 2011 edition, the magazine criticised [[Apple Inc.]] for their poor philanthropy records.&lt;ref&gt;Apple, Steve Jobs and the Developing World: http://www.manojbhusal.net/apps/blog/show/9447989-steve-jobs-apple-and-the-developing-world&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's April 2012 edition was dedicated to [[the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] with an in-depth report on the humanitarian situation in the country.&lt;ref&gt;DRC Diary: Reflections from the field: http://gsdmagazine.org/2012/06/06/drc-diary-a-reflection-from-the-field/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special correspondents==
As of April 2014, 10 special correspondents reported on 10 different development themes prioritised by the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Global Team, GSDM: http://www.gsdmagazine.org/editorial-team/&lt;/ref&gt; Namely the themes were: 
*Women’s issues in Africa
*Global environmental issues
*Climate change
*Global Health
*Livelihood &amp; Global Economic Affairs
*Global Education
*Development Aid 
*Global Peace &amp; Security Issues 
*South-to-South Development Cooperation
*Development &amp; Democracy in Africa
*Food Sovereignty and Rural Livelihoods

==Environmental concerns==
Despite its "print-like" content and popularity, ''GSDM'', reportedly, is not planning to issue the magazine's paper version mostly due to their commitment to environmentally friendly activities and concerns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16798">The prevalence of illegal drug use in the [[Philippines]] is lower than the global average, according to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippines: Duterte’s 100 days of carnage|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/10/philippines-dutertes-hundred-days-of-carnage/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] has claimed that the country could become a "[[narco-state]]". Two of the most used and valuable illegal drugs in the country are [[Methamphetamine|methamphetamine hydrochloride]] (known locally as shabu) and [[Cannabis|marijuana]].&lt;ref name=rappler&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ranada|first1=Pia|title=A look at the state of crime, drugs in the Philippines|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/118004-crime-drugs-philippines|accessdate=April 26, 2016|agency=[[Rappler]]|date=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ddb&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact on Drugs|url=http://www.ddb.gov.ph/research-statistics/46-sidebar/58-facts-on-drugs|publisher=Dangerous Drugs Board|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the United Nations said the Philippines had the highest rate of methamphetamine use in East Asia, and according to a U.S. State Department report, 2.1 percent of Filipinos aged 16 to 64 use the drug&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte-killings-idUSKCN0ZE300?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|title=As Duterte takes over in Philippines, police killings stir fear|last1=Mogato|first1=Manuel|date=June 29, 2016|agency=[[Reuters]]|last2=Chalmers|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on 2008 figures by the Philippines Dangerous Drugs Board&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/wdr2018/prelaunch/1.2_Prevalence_of_drug_use_in_the_general_population_-_national_data.xls|title=Prevalence of Drug use in the General Population - National Data|last=|first=|date=2016|website=United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2016, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime report that 1.1 percent of Filipinos aged 10 to 69 use the drug.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In [[Metro Manila]], most barangays are affected by illegal drugs.&lt;ref name=rappler /&gt;

==Production==

===Marijuana===
{{main article|Cannabis in the Philippines}}

===Methamphetamine production===
Drug syndicates have been producing methamphetamine in small-scale and kitchen-type laboratories to avoid detection by the Philippine authorities since 2010. Usually, drug syndicates rent warehouses for use as drug laboratories. These syndicates have moved towards renting houses in private subdivisions, condominiums and apartments to be used as bases for their illegal drug production. Private properties are becoming more favorable to drug syndicates as sites of illegal drug production.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=Illicit Drug Trafficking|url=http://www.pctc.gov.ph/illicit-drug-trafficking.html|work=Philippine Center on Transnational Crime|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methamphetamine remains more feasible to sell in the Philippines than cocaine, a more costly illegal drug.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Dizon|first=David|title=World's most powerful drug cartel now in PH|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/26/13/worlds-most-powerful-drug-cartel-now-ph|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=ABS-CBNnews.com|date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to its geographical location, international drug syndicates use the Philippines as a transit hub for the illegal drug trade.&lt;ref name=rappler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sy Egco|first1=Joel M.|title=PH center of world drug trade|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/ph-center-of-world-drug-trade/64443/|accessdate=May 7, 2016|work=[[The Manila Times]]|date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some local drug syndicates are also involved in the international illegal drug trade, and utilize drug mules to transport small amounts of illegal drugs to other countries. Some [[overseas Filipino workers]] have been utilized by drug syndicates as [[drug mules]], either knowingly or unknowingly. Most Filipino drug mules, mainly women, are sent to China, where drug convicts will face execution via [[lethal injection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filipino drug mules|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2011/04/201145151543366504.html|agency=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=April 5, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] has been identified as a favorable illegal drug trafficking hub.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Some Filipinos choose to be involved in drug trafficking due to the promise of a high income. Some still participate in such illicit activity because they are forced by certain circumstances. There were reports in the past that some Filipinos, usually women, were forced and blackmailed by drug syndicates to work as drug couriers, and if they refused, their family's safety would be compromised.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|last=Arcangel|first=Xianne|title=Pinoys still being nabbed for drugs abroad despite executions|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/322840/pinoyabroad/worldfeatures/pinoys-still-being-nabbed-for-drugs-abroad-despite-executions|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=GMA News|date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Manila-based firm, Pacific Strategies &amp; Assessments, identified the Philippines as, "not only a transhipment point, but also a key producer of synthetic drugs for all of Asia" in a report made in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Karl|title=Philippines poll 'hit by drugs trade'|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/asia-pacific/philippines-poll-hit-by-drugs-trade|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=The National|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the [[Philippine National Police]] - Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Force and the Philippine Drug Enforcement  confirmed reports that the Mexican [[Sinaloa Cartel]] had started operations in the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;{{sfn|PDEA|2013|p=17}}

===Chinese cartel involvement===
About nine [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Triad (organized crime)|drug cartels]] are involved on most illegal drug trade in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramirez|first1=Robertzon|title=Chinese gangs behind Philippine illegal drug trade|url=http://www.philstar.com/metro/2015/11/27/1526311/chinese-gangs-behind-philippine-illegal-drug-trade|accessdate=May 7, 2016|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|publisher=Philstar|date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Department of State]] found out that Chinese drug cartels are behind the trade of [[Methamphetamine|methamphetamine hydrochloride]] on the Philippines.&lt;ref name=rappler /&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esplanada|first1=Jerry E.|title=Chinese drug syndicates behind drug trade in Philippines, says US|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/41837/chinese-syndicates-behind-drug-trade-in-philippines-says-us|accessdate=May 7, 2016|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president  divulged the names of the members of a large Chinese triad group in an interview with PTV-4 on July 7. The members of the triad group included Chinese drug lords, namely Wu Tuan, aka tatay Co,  Peter Lim, aka tiger balm, and Herbert Colangco, with the three under the protection of [[Marcelo Garbo Jr]], one of the Philippine National Police generals named by Duterte on July 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kabiling|first1=Genalyn|title=Palace reveals Chinese triad involved in illegal drugs|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/palace-reveals-chinese-triad-involved-in-illegal-drugs/|accessdate=July 8, 2016|work=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade value==
In 2010 a U.S. [[International Narcotics Control Strategy Report]] stated that the [[Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency]] Director General estimated the illegal drug trade in the Philippines at $6.4 to $8.4 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/137411.pdf|title=INCSR 2010 Volume 1: Country Reports|page=509|publisher=United States Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs|date=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/pinoyabroad/322840/pinoys-still-being-nabbed-for-drugs-abroad-despite-executions/story/|title=Pinoys still being nabbed for drugs abroad despite executions|date=2013-08-20|publisher=GMA News|author=Xianne Arcangel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party drugs==
[[MDMA]] (ecstasy), one of the [[Club drug|party drugs]], is the third most abused drug, next to cannabis and methamphetamine.{{sfn|PDEA|2012|p=15}}

The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency discovered the production of "[[Fly high (drug)|fly high]]", after a raid on a condominium unit in Makati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Villamente|first1=Jing|title='Fly high' pill a mixture of ecstasy, shabu, viagra|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/fly-high-pill-a-mixture-of-ecstasy-shabu-viagra/71504/|accessdate=May 7, 2016|work=[[The Manila Times]]|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of use of fly high includes [[Insomnia|sleeplessness]], [[loss of appetite]], and [[Hypersexuality|high libido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cupin|first1=Bea|title=PH 'fly high' drug: Lethal mix of ecstasy, shabu|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/58576-fly-high-pdea-drugs|accessdate=May 7, 2016|agency=[[Rappler]]|date=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug use among minors==
[[Intoxicative inhalant|Inhalants]] are commonly used among minors, especially street children.{{sfn|PDEA|2012|p=15}} Street children in the Philippines are most likely to be inhalant abusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Njord|first1=L|last2=Merrill|first2=RM|last3=Njord|first3=R|last4=Lindsay|first4=R|last5=Pachano|first5=JD|title=Drug use among street children and non--street children in the Philippines|journal=Asia Pacific Journal on Public Health|date=April 22, 2016|doi=10.1177/1010539510361515|pmid=20457649|volume=22|pages=203–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign against illegal drugs==
{{recentism|1=section|date=August 2016}}
{{main article|Philippine Drug War}}
[[Rodrigo Duterte]], after his [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|inauguration on June 30]], called a speech full of swearing in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], [[Manila]] and urged people to kill drug pushers in exchange for bounty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte urged people to kill drug addicts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/01/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-urges-people-to-kill-drug-addicts|accessdate=July 8, 2016|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 1, 2016|via=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests===
Most arrests related to illegal drugs involves users of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).&lt;ref name=rappler /&gt;{{sfn|PDEA|2013|p=14}}

===Involvement of government officials and employees===
From 2010 to 2015, 623 government officials and employees were arrested for drug possession, according to the [[Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency]] (PDEA). Of these, 45% were government employees while 30% were elected officials and 25% were police. Several government officials have been arrested for drug possession, like former PDEA Special Enforcement Service director and Lieutenant Colonel [[Ferdinand Marcelino]] but released months later after some clarification in the ongoing investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Elmor P.|title=Drug relate arrests involving gov't officials, employees increasing - PDEA|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/02/03/Government-officials-illegal-drugs-trade.html|accessdate=May 7, 2016|agency=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also alleged involvement of [[Philippine National Police]] generals on drug trade. On July 5, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte named five generals alleged to be involved in drugs: Marcelo Garbo Jr., Joel Pagdilao, Edgardo Tinio, Bernardo Diaz, and Vic Loot. All five claim not to have any involvement in illegal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ranada|first1=Pia|title=Duterte names alleged police generals in drug trade|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/138704-duterte-names-police-generals-drugs|accessdate=July 8, 2016|agency=[[Rappler]]|date=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[I am sorry for my country|''I am sorry for my country'' speech]], President Duterte revealed the names of 150 government officials that have been found to be involved in illegal drug trade. There have also been allegations of government officials' involvement in [[New Bilibid Prison drug trafficking scandal|illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison]].

===Deaths===
A week after Rodrigo Duterte was inaugurated on June 30, 2016, it was reported that about 1,000 drug pushers and users had been killed in police operations and around 1,000 killed in drug-related incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dozens killed in first four days of Duterte's drug war|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/rodrigo-duterte-drug-war-160704152252796.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|agency=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A March 2017 INCSR report by the United States State Department estimated that 6000 extrajudicial killings had resulted from "police actions and vigilantism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/268025.pdf|title=International Narcotics Control Strategy Report|page=244|date=2017-03-01|publisher=United States Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
[[Ifugao]] congressman Teodoro Baguilat and senator [[Leila de Lima]] called for an investigation on the cases of killings of drug pushers by police, due to the alarming rise of deaths of drug pushers in police operations. Baguilat expressed concerns on the rising number of deaths of drug pushers and users that if the rate of deaths of drug pushers and users continue to increase, people will soon be involved in killing suspected drug personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dumlao|first1=Artemio|title=Congress eyes probe on spate of drug killings|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/08/1600744/congress-eyes-probe-spate-drug-killings|access-date=July 9, 2016|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
The  [[New People's Army]] initially supports Duterte's war against drugs, especially on government officials, police, and the military until August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-duterte-drugs/thirty-killed-in-four-days-in-philippine-war-on-drugs-idUSKCN0ZK0UG|title=Thirty killed in four days in Philippine war on drugs|date=July 4, 2016|publisher=|access-date=January 18, 2018|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale '''Japanese migration to Indonesia''' dates back to the late 19th century, though there was limited trade contact between [[Indonesia]] and [[Japan]] as early as the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ShiningJapan"&gt;{{citation|url=http://old.thejakartapost.com/community/japan1.asp |date=2008-04-13|title=Shining Japan: From mercenaries and sex workers to entrepreneurs|last=Harsanto|first=Damar|accessdate=2010-04-23|periodical=The Jakarta Post |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413223548/http://old.thejakartapost.com/community/japan1.asp |archivedate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large population of '''Japanese expatriates in Indonesia''', estimated at 11,263 people {{asof|2009|October|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="MOFA"&gt;{{harvnb|MOFA|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there are also identifiable populations of descendants of early migrants, who may be referred to as '''Nikkei Indonesians''' or '''Indonesian Nikkei'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meguro|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shin|2004|p=83}}; the term "Indonesian Nikkei" is also used therein to refer to Japanese expatriates who have settled permanently in Japan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
Prior to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]'s establishment of their isolationist ''[[sakoku]]'' policy, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) were known to use Japanese mercenaries to enforce their rule in the [[Maluku Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Simon|last=Worrell|title=The world's oldest clove tree|periodical=BBC News|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=2012-06-23|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18551857}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Indonesia's early residents of Japanese descent was [[Saartje Specx]], the daughter of Dutch colonial governor [[Jacques Specx]], who ruled [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]] (present-day [[Jakarta]]) from 1629 to 1632.&lt;ref name="ShiningJapan"/&gt; 1898 colonial government statistics showed 614 Japanese in the Dutch East Indies (166 men, 448 women).&lt;ref name="Shiraishi 1993 8"&gt;{{harvnb|Shiraishi|Shiraishi|1993|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Japanese population grew, a Japanese consulate was established in Batavia in 1909, but for the first several years its population statistics were rather haphazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murayama|1993|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reports showed 782 registered Japanese migrants in Batavia in 1909 (with estimates that there were another 400 unregistered), and 278 (57 men, 221 women) in [[Medan]] in 1910.&lt;ref name="Murayama 1993 90"&gt;{{harvnb|Murayama|1993|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between ca. 1872 and 1940 large numbers of Japanese prostitutes (''[[karayuki-san]]'') worked in brothels of the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;Yamazaki, Tomoko; ''Sandakan Bordell Nr. 8;'' München 2005; {{ISBN|3-89129-406-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 1920s, [[Okinawa]]n fishermen began to settle in [[north Sulawesi]]. There was a Japanese primary school at [[Manado]], which by 1939 had 18 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meguro|2005|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 6,349 Japanese people lived in Indonesia by 1938.&lt;ref name="Fukihara 2007 27"&gt;{{harvnb|Fukihara|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the 1942-1945 [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], roughly 3,000 [[Imperial Japanese Army]] soldiers chose to remain in Indonesia and fight alongside local people against the Dutch colonists in the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]; roughly one-third were killed (among whom many are buried in the [[Kalibata Heroes Cemetery]]), while another one-third chose to remain in Indonesia after the fighting ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatakeyama|Hosaka|2004|pp=676–677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SankeiShimbun"&gt;{{citation |url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/culture/imperial/080119/imp0801191209001-n1.htm |title=秋篠宮ご夫妻、英雄墓地に献花　ジャカルタ |accessdate=2010-04-21 |date=2008-01-19 |periodical=Sankei Shimbun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109002451/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/culture/imperial/080119/imp0801191209001-n1.htm# |archive-date=2009-01-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Japanese manufacturers, especially in the electronics sector, began to set up factories in Indonesia; this sparked the migration of a new wave of Japanese expatriates, mainly managers and technical staff connected to large Japanese corporations.&lt;ref name="ChangingFaces"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/28/changing-faces.html|periodical=The Jakarta Post|date=2008-03-28|accessdate=2010-04-23|title=Changing Faces}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, there was also migration in the opposite direction; many of the Nikkei Indonesians from Sulawesi began migrating to Japan to work in the seafood processing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meguro|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2004}}, there were estimated to be about 1,200 of them living in the town of [[Ōarai, Ibaraki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meguro|2005|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there was a large outflow of Japanese expatriates in 1998, due to the [[Indonesian riots of May 1998|May riots]] and the associated political chaos.&lt;ref name="JakartaShimbun"/&gt; However, a decade later, the Japanese still made up Jakarta's second-largest expatriate community, after the [[Koreans in Indonesia|Koreans]].&lt;ref name="ChangingFaces"/&gt;

==Business and employment==
The Japanese communities in the Dutch East Indies, like those in the rest of colonial Southeast Asia, remained [[prostitution]]-based as late as [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Shiraishi 1993 9"&gt;{{harvnb|Shiraishi|Shiraishi|1993|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnant of this prostitution business can be trace in [[Surabaya]]'s ''Jalan Kembang Jepun'', "the Street of the Japanese Flowers", located in the city's old [[Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2004/07/18/surabaya-all-together-now-kyakya-kembang-jepun.html |periodical=The Jakarta Post |date=2004-07-18 |accessdate=2011-04-19 |title=Surabaya: All together now at Kya-Kya Kembang Jepun |last=Prihandono |first=Omar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009162324/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2004/07/18/surabaya-all-together-now-kyakya-kembang-jepun.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution was outlawed in the Dutch East Indies in 1912, but many Japanese women appear to have continued working in the trade clandestinely.&lt;ref name="Murayama 1993 90"/&gt; However, by the 1930s, the economic focus of the Japanese community had shifted largely towards agriculture, marine industries, and retailing of imported Japanese products.&lt;ref name="Fukihara 2007 27"/&gt; More recent Japanese expatriates are typically investors connected with electronics manufacturing.&lt;ref name="ChangingFaces"/&gt;

==Social integration==
Early Japanese migrants to the [[Dutch East Indies]] were classified as "foreign orientals" by the Dutch government.&lt;ref name="Shiraishi 1993 8"/&gt; This status meant they were subject to restrictions on their freedom of movement, place of residence, and employment. However, in 1898, they were reclassified as "honorary Europeans", giving them formal legal equality with the colonisers and removing those restrictions.&lt;ref name="Shiraishi 1993 9"/&gt; Yet despite this formal equality, local peoples' image of the Japanese people in their midst was still not very positive.&lt;ref name="Shiraishi 1993 8"/&gt; During the World War II occupation of Indonesia, many Japanese officers took local women as concubines.&lt;ref name="ShiningJapan"/&gt; Children born from such relationships, growing up in the post-war period often found themselves the target bullying due to their ancestry, as well as suffering official discrimination under government policies which gave preference to ''[[pribumi]]'' in the hiring of civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fukihara|2007|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jakarta]], Grand Wijaya Center and [[Blok M]] have clusters of businesses catering to Japanese expatriates, including restaurants, supermarkets selling imported food products, and the like; Blok M in particular is noted for its concentration of ''[[izakaya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Jakarta Post |first=Chisato |last=Hara |title=Exploring 'izakaya' in Blok M |url=//old.thejakartapost.com/community/japan3.asp |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2010-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423060317/http://old.thejakartapost.com/community/japan3.asp |archivedate=April 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
759 Japanese living in Indonesia have the right of permanent residency; these consist primarily of Japanese women married to Indonesian men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shin|2004|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bali the number of Japanese residents registered with the Japanese Consulate in Denpasar has increased from 43 in 1987, to 595 in 1995, and further to 1,755 in 2006 and 2,225 in 2010. The consulate receives an annual average of about 100 cases of marriage registration, with over 90 percent of them involving Japanese women who marry local men. It processes between 10 and 12 applications for divorce per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toyota|Thang|2012|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some met their husbands in the context of [[study abroad]], either when the husband-to-be was studying in Japan, or when both were studying in an Anglophone country such as the United States or Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shin|2004|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others came to Indonesia, especially [[Bali]], as tourists, and met their husbands there. Japan is one of the largest sources of tourists in Bali, and many Japanese women married to Indonesian men are settled there; one scholar who studied the phenomenon in 1994 estimated roughly four hundred resided there at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suzuki|1997|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yamashita|2003|pp=87, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of the tourists consist of young urban women; they see Bali not as an exotic destination, but rather a nostalgic one, evoking the past landscape of Japan and a return to their "real selves" which they feel are being stifed by life in Japanese cities. Among these, a few come first as tourists, especially to [[Kuta]] and [[Ubud]], and then after repeat visits, marry a local man.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yamashita|2003|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these visits take the form of "romance tourism" or "[[female sex tourism]]", with women entering into relationships with [[Male prostitution|male]] [[sex worker]]s, known colloquially as "Kuta Cowboys".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toyota|2006|pp=171–172, 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-documentary-captures-kuta-cowboys-gigolo-lifestyles/371509 |periodical=The Jakarta Globe |title=New Documentary Capture’s Kuta Cowboys’ Gigolo Lifestyles |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428014009/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/new-documentary-captures-kuta-cowboys-gigolo-lifestyles/371509 |archivedate=2010-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/05/05/039kuta-cowboys039-strutting-their-stuff-lovelorn-visitors.html|periodical=The Jakarta Post|date=2002-05-05|accessdate=2010-04-26|title='Kuta Cowboys' strutting their stuff for lovelorn visitors}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or less commonly [[English language|English]] when communicating with their husbands, children, and grandchildren, but Indonesian far more commonly than other languages when communicating with other relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shin|2004|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
''[[The Daily Jakarta Shimbun]]'' is Indonesia's only Japanese language newspaper. It was founded in 1998 by Yasuo Kusano, who was formerly the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' bureau chief in Jakarta from 1981 to 1986; he returned to Indonesia after the [[fall of Suharto]], and, finding that many publications banned during the Suharto era were being revived, decided to found a newspaper to provide accurate, in-depth information about Indonesia's new democratisation to Japanese readers. Since then, its circulation has grown from 50 copies to more than 4,000.&lt;ref name="JakartaShimbun"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/30/jakarta-shimbun039-a-bridge-indonesia.html |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-23 |title='Jakarta Shimbun' a bridge to Indonesia |last=Hara |first=Chisato |periodical=The Jakarta Post |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VaS56p10?url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/30/jakarta-shimbun039-a-bridge-indonesia.html |archivedate=2015-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portrayals in Indonesian popular culture centred on Japanese characters include [[Remy Sylado]]'s 1990s [[serial (literature)|novel]] ''Kembang Jepun''. Set during World War II, it tells a story of a [[geisha]] and her Indonesian husband who participates in [[Supriyadi]]'s anti-Japanese uprising. It was reprinted as a full-length book by Gramedia Pustaka Utama in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.okezone.com/read/2009/06/29/285/233827/wartawan-dan-geisha-tertawan-cinta|periodical=[[Media Nusantara Citra]] OkeZone|date=2009-06-29|accessdate=2011-04-20|title=Wartawan dan Geisha Tertawan Cinta|last=Nugroho|first=Sidik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sylado|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another work with a similar theme is Lang Fang's 2007 novel ''Perempuan Kembang Jepun'', from the same publisher, about a 1940s [[geisha]] who becomes the [[polygamy in Indonesia|second wife]] of a Surabaya businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sulistiawan |first=Iwan |title=Lang Fang: Another figure in Indonesia's literature |periodical=The Jakarta Post |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2011-04-20 |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2007/02/20/lang-fang-another-figure-indonesia039s-literature.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607151644/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2007/02/20/lang-fang-another-figure-indonesia039s-literature.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fang|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian martial arts film [[The Raid 2]] depicts a Japanese crime syndicate in Jakarta.

'''Khalidi Library '''(Arabic: المكتبة&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt; الخالدية ''al-Maktaba al-Khalidiyya'') is a [[library]] and [[archive]] located in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. It was established in 1900, under Ottoman rule.

==Overview==
Khalidi Library was established c.1900 as one of [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|Ottoman Palestine's]] first [[public library|public libraries]], consisting primarily of works in Arabic by Hajj Raghib al-Khalidi, an [[qadi|Islamic judge]] and member of the prominent [[Khalidi|Khalidi family]] of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.khalidilibrary.org/indexe.html|title = Welcome to the Khalidi Library in Jerusalem|date = 2015|accessdate = January 11, 2015|website = Khalidi Library|publisher = Friends of the Khalidi Library|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reading Palestine: Printing and Literacy, 1900&amp;ndash;1948|last = Ayalon|first = Ami|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 2004|isbn = 9780292705937|location = Austin, Texas, US|pages = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library originated in the personal collections of books and [[manuscripts]] accumulated by the Khalidi family over the course of several centuries. This makes Khalidi Library one of the largest collections of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] literary and historical documents in the [[Levant]] built by Palestinians.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.aramcoworld.com/issue/199306/a.hidden.treasure.htm|title = Aramco World|last = Ajami|first = Jocelyn M.|date = 1993|work = A Hidden Treasure|access-date = January 19, 2015|issue = Volume 44, Issue 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Khalidi Library holds the largest private collection of manuscripts in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/12/khalidi-library|title = The Khalidi library: Old City, old family, old texts|last = |first = |date = December 29, 2014|work = The Economist|access-date = January 11, 2015|department = Prospero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Khalidi family's long-time prosperity and prominence in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Arab]] society enabled them to collect and preserve one of the finest private libraries in Palestine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each generation of Khalidis made contributions to the collection. Sun Allah al-Khalidi, Chief Secretary to the Religious Court of Jerusalem until his death in 1726, was responsible for securing the foundation of the early collection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shortly before his death, Sun Allah al-Khalidi set up a [[waqf]], bequeathing revenue from his substantial land holdings across Jerusalem to pay for the trusteeship of eighty-five manuscripts in perpetuity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=3402&amp;ed=194&amp;edid=194|title = Within Are Precious Books|date = May 2011|accessdate = January 19, 2015|website = This Week in Palestine|publisher = |last = Tabar|first = Sami}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lawrence Conrad, a British historian who catalogued many of the Khalidi's treasures, the Khalidi patriarchs actively built their manuscript collection by bargaining in the medieval literary markets of [[Cairo]], [[Damascus]], and [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The establishment of the Khalidi Library as a public institution was made possible by a vast sum bequeathed to Hajj Raghib al-Khalidi (1866-1952) by his grandmother, daughter of the [[kazasker]] of Anatolia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to historian Lawrence Conrad, the Khalidi family saw themselves as upholding the inherited tradition of the Greeks and [[Abbasids]] in founding a library to spread their wealth of knowledge.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The announcement of the public opening of the library emphasized this connection between libraries, cultural progress and prosperity by invoking great libraries of the Hellenic and medieval Arab Mediterranean worlds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The year of the Khalidi's public opening is often cited as 1900, however in a recent study, Conrad suggested that the library may have opened a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ottoman Jerusalem|last = Conrad|first = Lawrence|publisher = Altajir World of Islam Trust|year = 2000|isbn = 1901435032|location = London|pages = |editor-last = Auld|editor-first = Sophia|volume = 1|chapter = The Khalidi Library|editor-last2 = Hillenbrand|editor-first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khalidi Library was and continues to be housed in a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]-era building in the Old City of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The building was built in the mid-13th century as the burial site of Amir Husam al-Din Barkah Khan, a military chieftain of [[Kwarizmian kingdom|Kwarizmian]] origin, and his two sons. His daughter married the Mamluk sultan, [[Baibars]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The library was among the first non-Western buildings in Palestine to have an exterior sign with text; its original sign announced its name in both French and Arabic as well as: "within are precious books."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The library was private in that it was formed, funded and managed by the Khalidi family; however, it was open to the public. The introductory statement in the library's first published catalogue emphasized the library's openness to "any person desiring to read."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Books were not allowed to circulate outside of the building.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Khalidi Library operated in this fashion for over half a century, surviving the turbulance of [[1948 Palestine war|1947-1948]], during which the contents of many of Jerusalem's Palestinian libraries, both public and private, [[National Library of Israel#Palestinian books|were transferred to the National Library of Israel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/47-_Over_Due_Books_1.pdf|title = Over Due Books: Returning Palestine's "Abandoned Property," of 1948|last = Mermelstein|first = Hannah|date = Autumn 2011|journal = The Jerusalem Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2015|issue = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Six-Day War]] and the Israeli conquest of East Jerusalem in 1967, the Khalidi Library was closed to the public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The neighboring building, also owned by Khalidi family, was occupied by the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF), and later turned into a [[yeshiva]]. The library itself was saved from similar confiscation after a lengthy legal battle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Haifa Khalidi, a ''mutawilla ''or guardian of the Library, [[Shlomo Goren]], during his time serving as Chief Rabbi of the [[Military Rabbinate]] of the IDF, attempted to purchase the property, but was rebuffed by the Khalidi family.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beginning in 1987, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government figured prominently in securing the future of the Khalidi Library, providing funding for manuscript [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] and renovation of the library building.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Conservation work on the library's 12,000 manuscripts was carried out by Tony Bish of the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 195804|title = Reviewed Work: The Conservation and Preservation of Islamic Manuscripts: Proceedings of the Third Conference of al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation by Yusuf Ibish, George Atiyeh|last = Jacobs|first = David|date = 1997|journal = British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|doi =10.1080/13530199708705649 |pmid = |issue = 2|volume=24|pages=305–319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after beginning conservation work at the Khalidi Library, a separate trove of 29,000 fragments, sections and [[folios]] of manuscripts were discovered in the loft of the library.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Renovation and refitting of the library building took place over two periods, 1991&amp;ndash;1994 and 1995&amp;ndash;1997, and consisted of restoring the Mamluk-era building, building an annex to house Khalidi family archival documents, and installing modern shelving units and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 29785725|title = The Khâlidiyya Library in Jerusalem: 1900&amp;ndash;2000|last = Raymond|first = André|date = 2000|journal = MELA Notes|doi = |pmid = |publisher = Middle East Librarians Association|issue =  71/72 (Fall 2000&amp;ndash;Spring 2001)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khalidi Library is financially supported by a combination of grants, family contributions, and private donations. Since 1989, the Friends of the Khalidi Library (FKL), a [[non-profit organization]] registered in [[Massachusetts]], has acted as a conduit for this support.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.khalidilibrary.org/contactinfoe.html|title = Contact Info|date = 2015|accessdate = February 14, 2015|website = Khalidi Library|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FKL's current chair of the board of trustees is Professor [[Walid Khalidi]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to the Khalidi Library's website, the premises are undergoing renovation once again, and therefore closed to the public.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The renovation is expected to finish sometime in 2015, after which the Library will open to the public for the first time in 47 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reopened Khalidi Library will offer workshops on [[book-binding]], [[islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and manuscript restoration aimed at engaging not only academics, but the wider Jerusalem public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Collection==
The Khalidi Library's first [[Library catalogue|catalogue]] was published in 1900, shortly after the institution's establishment. This first catalogue is significant for the insight it offers into the scholarly interests and literary tastes of the Palestinian elite at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The Khalidi Library continued in the classical tradition of Islamic learning in its collection of religious works and valuable manuscripts. However, the Khalidi Library departed from classical tradition in its accumulation of works concerning the histories and ideas of Europe, "thereby marking a [[wiktionary:nascent|nascent]] cultural trend in Palestine," as noted by historian Ami Ayalon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The original library comprised 2,168 items, of which 1,156 items appeared in the published catalogue and another 1,012 items in an unpublished list.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The collection included both manuscripts and printed works. At least 1,138 printed books existed in the library's collection upon its establishment, the vast majority of which were imported from [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], and Europe. Among these imported works included studies on European history. This collection was expanded over the years to include dictionaries and grammar books on all major European languages, multiple translations of the Bible, the complete works of Plato and Voltaire, texts by Josephus, Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, as well as studies by Western [[Orientalists]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The collection grew to approximately 4,000 items by 1917, and over 7,000 items by 1936.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Khalidi Library has the largest private collection of medieval manuscripts in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the manuscripts are written in Arabic, though there are some in Persian and Turkish. The oldest dated manuscript is an 11th-century treatise on [[sharia]] as written by a member of the [[Maliki|Maliki school]] of Islamic legal thought.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among the most treasured works in the collection are those manuscripts written in the hand of the original author, as opposed to a copyist; these are referred to as ''umm ''or "mother," manuscripts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Makrumahs ''or presentation copies, are another category of treasured works. ''Makrumahs'' were often commissioned for royal libraries, and thus demonstrate especially fine craftsmanship. One ''makrumah'' is a gilded tribute to [[Saladin]], dated to 1201 and grandiloquently titled ''The Spacious Lands of Commendations and the Garden of the Glorious and Praiseworthy Deeds Among the Merits of the Victorious King.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Approximately half of the manuscript collection is composed of religious works; the other half includes subjects such as disparate as medicine, rhetoric, logic, and philosophy. Among the manuscript collection, are documents known as ''[[ijazah]]s,'' permits to teach a certain subject of Islamic knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The library's collection also includes correspondence, private papers, and legal documents from generations of the Khalidi family, including [[Ruhi Khalidi]] and former Mayor of Jerusalem [[Yousef al-Khalidi|Yousef Khalidi]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Least Developed Countries''' ('''LDCs''') is a list of [[developing countries]] that, according to the [[United Nations]], exhibit the lowest indicators of [[socioeconomic]] [[International development|development]], with the lowest [[Human Development Index]] ratings of [[list of sovereign states|all countries in the world]]. The concept of LDCs originated in the late 1960s and the first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in its resolution 2768 (XXVI) of 18 November 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitar.org/resource/sites/unitar.org.resource/files/document-pdf/GA-2767-XXVI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

A country is classified among the Least Developed Countries if it meets three criteria:&lt;ref name=UN2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category/ldc-criteria.html |title=Criteria For Identification Of LDCs |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division|accessdate = 2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Criteria"&gt;UN-OHRLLS [http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/criteria-for-ldcs/ Criteria for Identification and Graduation of LDCs].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Poverty]] – adjustable criterion based on [[Gross national income|GNI]] per capita averaged over three years. {{asof|2018}} a country must have GNI per capita less than [[United States dollar|US$]]1,025 to be included on the list, and over $1,230 to graduate from it.
*[[Human resources|Human resource]] weakness (based on indicators of [[nutrition]], [[health]], [[education]] and adult [[literacy]]). 
*[[Economic Vulnerability Index|Economic vulnerability]] (based on instability of agricultural production, instability of exports of goods and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, handicap of economic smallness, and the percentage of population displaced by natural disasters).

==Overview==
LDC criteria are reviewed every three years by the [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/our-work/committee-for-development-policy.html Committee for Development Policy (CDP)] of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|UN Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC). Countries may "graduate" out of the LDC classification when indicators exceed these criteria in two consecutive triennial reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category/ldc-graduation.html United Nations Development Policy &amp; Analysis Division: Graduation From the LDC Category]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States]] (UN-OHRLLS) coordinates UN support and provides advocacy services for Least Developed Countries. The classification ({{As of|2017|06|lc=on}}) applies to 47 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category.html |title=About the LDC category |work=Least Developed Countries |publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the LDC category was initiated, only four countries have graduated to ''[[developing country]]'' status. The first country to graduate from LDC status was [[Botswana]] in 1994. The second country was [[Cape Verde]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22918&amp;Cr=cape&amp;Cr1=verde "UN advocate salutes Cape Verde’s graduation from category of poorest States"], UN News Centre, 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maldives]] graduated to ''developing country'' status on 1 January 2011, while [[Samoa]] graduated in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category/ldc-graduation.html |title = Timeline of country’s graduation from the LDC category |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division|accessdate = 2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://unohrlls.org/news/samoa-to-gain-developing-country-economic-status-in-january-2014/|title = Samoa To Gain Developing Country Economic Status In January 2014|date = |accessdate = 2015-08-09|website = [[UN-OHRLLS]] via [[Radio Australia]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the UN's fourth conference on LDCs, which was held in May 2011, delegates endorsed a goal targeting the promotion of at least half the current LDC countries within the next ten years.&lt;ref name="Goal2021"/&gt;

There are three countries which presently meet the criteria for LDC status, but have declined to be included in the index, questioning the validity or accuracy of the CDP's data: [[Ghana]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="CDP2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/committee-for-development-policy-handbook-on-the-least-developed-country-category-inclusion-graduation-and-special-support-measures-second-edition/ |title=Handbook on the Least Developed Country Category: Inclusion, Graduation and Special Support Measures |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division|accessdate = 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and abbreviations==
Least developed countries can be distinguished from [[developing country|developing countries]], "less developed countries", "lesser developed countries", or other terms for countries in the so-called [[Third World]]. Although many contemporary scholars argue that "Third World" is outdated, irrelevant or inaccurate, others may use the term "Fourth World" in reference to least developed countries (although [[Fourth World]] is also used to refer to stateless ethnic groups). The term "less economically developed country" (LEDC) is also used today.

However, in order to avoid confusion between "least developed country" and or LEDC "less economically developed country" (which may both be abbreviated as LDC), and to avoid confusion with [[landlocked developing countries|landlocked developing country]] (which can be abbreviated as LLDC), "[[developing country]]" is generally used in preference to "less-developed country".

During a United Nations review in 2018, the UN defined LDCs as countries meeting three criteria, one of which was a three-year average estimate of [[gross national income]] (GNI) per capita of less than US $1,025. Countries with populations over 75 million are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category/ldc-criteria.html |title = Criteria For Identification Of LDCs |publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Development Policy and Analysis Division|accessdate = 2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN conferences on the least developed countries==

There have been four United Nations conferences on LDCs, held every ten years. The first two were in Paris, in 1981 and 1991; the third was in Brussels in 2001.

The Fourth UN Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDC-IV) was held in Istanbul, Turkey, 9–13 May 2011. It was attended by [[Ban Ki-Moon]], the head of the UN, and close to 50 prime ministers and heads of state.  The conference endorsed the goal of raising half the existing Least developed countries out of the LDC category by 2022.  As with the [[Seoul Development Consensus]] drawn up in 2010, there was a strong emphasis on boosting productive capability and physical infrastructure, with several NGOs not pleased with the emphases placed on the private sector.&lt;ref name="Goal2021"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of civil society==
In the process of increasing awareness towards the needs of the LDCs, the importance of the inputs and contributions of the members of the Civil Society were first acknowledged during the NGO Forum held in parallel to the third UN Conference on Least Developed Countries in Brussels in 2001. The importance of civil society and its contributions has also been recognised in the UNGA Resolution 63/227. Post LDC III, civil society actors have been actively engaged and involved in the UN Decision making processes concerning LDCs. They have also been involved in the implementation and follow-up, monitoring and review of the progress made by LDCs and the success of the implementation of the BPoA. For LDC IV, the UN-OHRLLS has entrusted LDC Watch, a global network of LDC Civil Society Organizations (CSOs),
with taking the lead in coordinating the civil society track.

LDC Watch has organised civil society consultations at various levels. At the regional level, in partnership with the UN-OHRLLS and relevant UN agencies, the following three consultations have been organised:
#Africa LDC Civil Society Assembly on 5–6 March 2010, Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) in the lead-up to the official regional review in Africa
#Pacific LDC Civil Society Assembly on 3–6 August 2010, Port Vila (Vanuatu) in parallel to the forty-first official Pacific Islands Forum
#Asia LDC Civil Society Assembly on 22–23 November 2010, Bangkok (Thailand)

These consultations were organised to critically assess the progress made by LDCs in the ten years since the adoption of the Brussels Programme of Action and with the intention of influencing the outcome of LDC IV.

As the LDC Governments and their development partners prepare to gather together for UNLDC IV, members of Civil Society are also preparing to meet during the Civil Society Forum, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110418145425/http://www.ldcwatch.org/csf/] which is going to be held in parallel to the official conference. UN-OHRLLS has mandated [[LDC Watch]] as the lead Civil Society Organization to coordinate the Civil Society track towards the LDC-IV conference. The Forum will open two days before the official conference begins and will continue till the end of the conference. It will bring together NGOs from all the LDCs, as well as representatives from the civil society at all levels including women’s movements, youth movements, trade unions, peasant federations, media personnel and human rights defenders.

==Trade and LDCs==
Issues surrounding global trade regulations and LDCs have gained a lot of media and policy attention thanks to the recently collapsed [[Doha Round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) negotiations being termed a development round. During the WTO's [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005|Hong Kong Ministerial]], it was agreed that LDCs could see 100 percent duty-free, quota-free access to U.S. markets if the round were completed. But analysis of the deal by NGOs found that the text of the proposed LDC deal had substantial loopholes that might make the offer less than the full 100 percent access, and could even erase some current duty-free access of LDCs to rich country markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/hot_issues/issue.cfm?ID=1389 |title=Public Citizen &amp;#124; Global Trade Watch &amp;#124; Global Trade Watch - Hot Issue June 21 - Study shows WTO’s Doha Round proposal would leave many poor countries worse off |publisher=Citizen.org|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unnayan.org/Other/Unnayan_Onneshan_TNLP_Hong_Kong.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfaction with these loopholes led some economists to call for a reworking of the [[Hong Kong]] deal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Dr. Chiedu Osakwe, as of 2001 the Director, Technical Cooperation Division at the Secretariat of the WTO, and adviser to the Director-General on developing country matters, was appointed as the WTO Special Coordinator for the Least Developed Countries beginning in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, [http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr136_e.htm "Moore announces key appointments for development issues"], 1999 Press Releases, Press/136, 13 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He worked closely with the five other agencies that together with the WTO constitute the Integrated Framework of action for the Least Developed Countries. They addressed issues of market access, special and differential treatment provisions for developing countries, participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system, and development questions, especially the interests of developing countries in competition policy.&lt;ref&gt;Osakwe, Chiedu, [http://www.oecd.org/document/40/0,2340,en_2649_33721_35795688_1_1_1_1,00.html "Are WTO Members wrestling an octopus, did they set their sights too high?"], DAC News November–December 2005, [[Development Assistance Committee]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[28th G8 summit]] in [[Kananaskis Improvement District|Kananaskis, Alberta]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] proposed and carried the Market Access Initiative, so that the then 48 LDCs could profit from "trade-not-aid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasil |first=Adria |url=http://stage81.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=140356 |title=NOW Toronto: "Roots runs away: Beaver-clad clothier blames feds’ Africa trade aid for west-end plant closure" (February 12-19, 2004, VOL 23 NO 24 Vasil) |publisher=Stage81.nowtoronto.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134510/http://stage81.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=140356 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Libra Party''' or ''Equal List'' ({{lang-sq|'''Li'''sta e '''B'''a'''ra'''bartë}}) is a [[list of political parties in Albania|political party in Albania]]. It was founded in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albaniannews.com/index.php?idm=9324&amp;mod=2|title=Albanian Daily News|website=www.albaniannews.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Blushi Ben.jpg|thumb|Ben Blushi]]
The party was founded by [[Ben Blushi]], a prominent politician/writer, and [[Mimoza Hafizi]]; both former MPs of the [[Socialist Party of Albania]]. They left the Socialist Party after months of discussions with the leader [[Edi Rama]] and opposed the government's decisions. The pair wanted elections to be held within the party to elect a new leader. In October 2016, after leaving the party they created LIBRA, which in Albanian is an acronym for 'Lista e Barabartë' (The equal list).

Currently both [[Ben Blushi]] and [[Mimoza Hafizi]] serve as Members of the [[Assembly of the Republic of Albania|National Assembly]] from the LIBRA Party.

==Ideology==
Libra means Knowledge, Freedom and Balance. It is a [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] political party with [[Centrism|centrist]] tendencies, which promotes equality and human rights. [[Social liberalism]], [[civic nationalism]] and [[pro-Europeanism]] are its 3 main ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libra.al/|title=Lista e Barabarte|website=libra.al|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes democracy and education and believes that all people should be treated as equal. The main goal is to help reduce poverty and to create a society that lives in harmony and justice.

The following is a list of U.S.-based organizations classified by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) as [[hate group]]s.&lt;ref name=hatemap&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Map|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=December 7, 2015|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/hate-map}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPLC defines ''hate groups'' as those that "... have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their [[wikt:immutable|immutable]] characteristics."&lt;ref name=hatemap/&gt; The SPLC states that: "Hate group activities can include criminal acts, marches, rallies, speeches, meetings, leafleting or publishing." The SPLC adds that "Listing here does not imply that a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity".&lt;ref name="hatemap"/&gt;
Since 1981, the SPLC's Intelligence Project has published a quarterly ''[[Intelligence Report]]'' which monitors what the SPLC considers to be hate groups in the United States.&lt;ref name=intelligencereport&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intelligence-report|title=Intelligence Report|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Intelligence Report'' provides information regarding the organizational efforts and tactics of these groups, and it is cited by a number of scholars as a reliable and comprehensive source on U.S. hate groups.&lt;ref name="McVeigh"&gt;Rory McVeigh.

Some of the listed groups have objected to the SPLC's designation. For example, the [[Family Research Council]] disputed its designation in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frumin|first1=Ben|title=Family Research Council Rips SPLC Over 'Slanderous' Hate Group Designation|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/family-research-council-rips-splc-over-slanderous-hate-group-designation|website=talkingpointsmemo.com|publisher=[[Talking Points Memo]]|accessdate=3 May 2017|date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] disputed the SPLC anti-immigrant designation in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Amy|title=Is the Center for Immigration Studies a hate group, as the Southern Poverty Law Center says?|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/mar/22/center-immigration-studies-hate-group-southern-pov/|website=Politifact Florida|publisher=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|accessdate=3 May 2017|date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPLC's hate group listings have also been criticized by some political observers and prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

In its 2014 annual report, published in March 2015, the SPLC counted 784 "active hate groups in the United States": 72 [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) groups, 142 [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups, 115 [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] groups, 119 [[White power skinhead|racist skinhead]] groups, 113 [[black separatism|black separatist]] groups, 37 [[neo-Confederate]] groups, 21 [[Christian Identity]] groups, and 165 "general hate" groups (subdivided into [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-LGBT]], [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]], [[Holocaust denial]], [[racist music]], radical [[traditionalist Catholic]], [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]], and "other").&lt;ref name=report2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/active-hate-groups-united-states-2014|title=Active Hate Groups in the United States in 2014|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=7 December 2015|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2015 annual report, published in February 2016, the SPLC counted 892 active hate groups in the U.S., an increase from the previous year. Of these, 190 were KKK groups, 94 were neo-Nazi groups, 85 were white nationalist groups, 95 were racist skinhead groups, 19 were Christian Identity groups, 35 were neo-Confederate groups, 180 were black separatist groups, and 184 were classified as "general hate groups" (subdivided into anti-LGBT, anti-Immigrant, Holocaust denial, racist music, and radical traditionalist Catholic groups, with an additional "other" sub-category).&lt;ref name="2015Report"&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/active-hate-groups-united-states-2015 Active Hate Groups in the United States in 2015], Southern Poverty Law Center (February 4, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 analysis by the SPLC, hate groups in general are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref name="splc2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/year-hate-and-extremism|title=The Year in Hate and Extremism|publisher=Southern Poverty Law }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the number of KKK chapters nationwide grew from 72 to 190. The SPLC released a similar report stating that "there were significant increases in Klan as well as [[Black separatism|black separatist]] groups."&lt;ref name="splc2016"/&gt; According to Mark Potok at the SPLC, [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]] speeches "demonizing statements about Latinos and Muslims have electrified the radical right, leading to glowing endorsements from white nationalist leaders such as [[Jared Taylor]] and former Klansman David Duke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anonymous-shut-down-kkk-website_us_5720c204e4b0b49df6a9b333|title=How Anonymous Is Fighting White Supremacy Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 analysis by the SPLC, hate groups in general are on the rise in the United States. it was the third straight year to witness a rise. There were 233 chapters of black nationalist hate groups, such as the Nation of Islam, in 2017, as compared to 193 the previous year. black nationalist hate organisations, grew by 22 percent last year, Neo-Nazi groups, which the year before had numbered 99, saw the largest increase, growing by 22 percent and reaching 121 groups across the country, Anti-government groups grew from 623 in 2016 to 689 last year, Meanwhile, KKK chapters declined drastically, decreasing from 130 in 2016 to 72 last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/hate-groups-grow-straight-year-splc-180221192119355.html|title=Hate groups in US grow for third straight year: SPLC|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neo-Nazism]] consists of post-[[World War II]] social or political movements seeking to revive [[Nazism]] or related ideologies. Common aspects of modern-day Neo-Nazism include hatred and/or fear of minorities such as [[African-Americans|blacks]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[LGBT people|lesbian, gay, and transgender people]], [[Immigration in the United States|non-white immigrants]], and sometimes even [[Christianity|Christians]] but their main hatred is focused on the [[Jewish Americans|Jews]] (their "cardinal enemy")&lt;ref name="McGowan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkInaWFrki4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA9,M1|title=The Radical Right in Germany: 1870 to the Present|author=Lee McGowan|year=2002|publisher=Pearson Education|pages=9, 178|isbn=0582291933|oclc=49785551}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Martin A. 1997.

[[White nationalism]] is a [[political ideology]] that advocates a [[Racialism|racial]] definition of [[national identity]] for [[white people]] (as opposed to [[multiculturalism]]) and a separate all-white [[nation state]].

====Anti-government movement====
In 2016, the SPLC identified 623 groups that belonged to the antigovernment movement; about a quarter of these were part of the [[militia movement]]. A subset within the antigovernment movement is the [[sovereign citizen movement|"sovereign citizen" movement]]. The SPLC states that "Generally, antigovernment groups define themselves as opposed to the '[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], engage in groundless conspiracy theorizing, or advocate or adhere to extreme antigovernment doctrines. Antigovernment groups do not necessarily advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities, though some have. Many warn of impending government violence or the need to prepare for a coming revolution. Many antigovernment groups are not racist."&lt;ref name="Antigov"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180408210912/https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/antigovernment Antigoverment Movement], Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPLC has listed a number of antigovernment groups, including [[Oath Keepers]], various [[3 Percenters]] groups (also styled III%ers), the [[John Birch Society]], Renew America, the [[Moorish Science Temple of America#Twenty-first century|Moorish Science Temple of America 1928]].&lt;ref name="Antigov"/&gt;

The '''Maine Video Activists Network''' (MVAN) is a monthly video newsreel produced by activists throughout the state of [[Maine]] in the [[United States]].  It is an extension of the [[Indymedia]] movement, in which grassroots organizers and average citizens are producing their own media content and distributing it through non-commercial avenues such as the internet, [[Public-access television]], print, and radio.  In the spirit of highly subjective (yet non-commercial and non-corporate) journalism, the Maine Video Activists Network has produced material on a diverse range of topics: [[discrimination]] on college campuses, [[eco-terrorism]] legislation, anti-war activity, [[universal healthcare]], low-income [[community organizing]] and [[direct action]], union organizing, [[hate crimes]], critical mass, disability rights, and student activism.  The program was founded by video activists in [[Lewiston, Maine]], and receives regular contributions from other producers in Biddeford, Freeport, Portland, and Madison.  All of the work behind MVAN is done by unpaid volunteers and the show has been consistently airing on Democracy Player and Maine Public-access television stations since January 2006.

The concept of a '''Malay race''' was originally proposed by the [[Germany|German]] physician [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] (1752–1840), and classified as a [[brown (racial classification)|brown race]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.upenn.edu/Projects/knarf/People/blumen.html University of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johann Frederich Blumenbach|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/People/blumen.html|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Malay'' is a loose term used in the late 19th century and early 20th century to describe the [[Austronesian peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;''Rand McNally’s World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago:1944 Rand McNally  Map: "Races of Mankind" Pages 278–279—On the map, the group called the ''Malayan race'' is shown as occupying an area on the map (consisting mainly of the islands of what was then called the [[Dutch East Indies]], the [[Philippines]], [[Madagascar]], and the [[Pacific Islands]], as well as the continental [[Malay Peninsula]]) identical and coextensive with the extent of the land area inhabited by those people now called [[Austronesians]].&lt;/ref&gt; or to categorize Austronesian speakers into a race.

Since Blumenbach, many anthropologists have rejected his theory of five races, citing the enormous [[Race (classification of human beings)|complexity of classifying races]]. The concept of a "Malay race" differs with that of the [[ethnic Malays]] centered on [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]] and parts of the [[Malay Archipelago]]'s islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Malays (ethnic group)#Etymology}}

The earliest records of the word ''Melayu'' or ''Malayu'' came from a Chinese record that reported a kingdom named Malayu had sent the envoy to the Chinese court for the first time in 645 CE. It was recorded in the book ''[[Tang Huiyao]]'' collected by [[Wang Pu (Song dynasty)|Wang Pu]] during the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Muljana"&gt;Muljana, Slamet, (2006), ''Srivijaya'', Yogyakarta: LKIS, {{ISBN|979-8451-62-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Chinese source mentioned the kingdom of Malayu. Two books were  written by a buddhist monk I-tsing or I Ching (義淨; pinyin Yì Jìng) (634–713),&lt;ref&gt;Junjiro Takakusu, 1896, ''A record of the Buddhist Religion as Practised in India and the Malay Archipelago AD 671–695, by I-tsing'', Oxford, London.&lt;/ref&gt; in his journey from China to India in 671 wherein he reported:
{{quote|"When the northeastern wind blows, we sail leaving Canton heading south.... After sailing for twenty days, we reach the land of [[Srivijaya]]. We stay there for about six months to learn Sabdavidya. The king was very kind to us. He helped send us to the land of Malayu, where we stayed for two months. Later we continued our journey to Kedah .... Sailing northward from Kedah, we reached the island of naked people (Nicobar) .... From here we sailed westward for half a month and finally reached Tamralipti (Indian east coast)"}}

Another source dated from a later period mentioned the name ''Bhumi Malayu'', written in the  [[Padang Roco Inscription]] dated 1286 CE in [[Dharmasraya]], and later in 1347 CE, [[Adityawarman]] edited his own inscription inscribed in the Amoghapasa statue, declaring himself the ruler of ''Malayupura''.&lt;ref&gt;Muljana, Slamet, (2005), ''Runtuhnya Kerajaan Hindu-Jawa dan Timbulnya Negara-Negara Islam di Nusantara'', Yogyakarta: LKIS, {{ISBN|9789798451164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Majapahit]] record, ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' dated 1365 CE, mentioned the lands of ''Melayu'' dominated by Majapahit"&lt;ref&gt;Brandes, J.L.A., (1902), ''Nāgarakrětāgama; Lofdicht van Prapanjtja op koning Radjasanagara, Hajam Wuruk, van Madjapahit, naar het eenige daarvan bekende handschrift, aangetroffen in de puri te Tjakranagara op Lombok''.&lt;/ref&gt; From these records the name ''Malayu'' seems to be identified with the area around the [[Batanghari]] river valley from estuarine to hinterland in present-day [[Jambi]] and parts of [[West Sumatra]] province. The people inhabiting the Eastern coast of Sumatra and parts of the Malay peninsula identified themselves as [[Ethnic Malay|Malay]] with a common language called the [[Malay language]]. After the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century, the Europeans identified the native people living on both coasts of the [[Malacca strait]] as Malay people. This term extended to neighboring peoples with similar traits.

Malays were once referred to as "''Kun-lun'' people" in various Chinese records. ''[[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]]'' originally referred to a fabled mountain range believed to span parts of [[Tibet]] and [[India]]. It was used by the Chinese in reference to black, wavy-haired barbarians of mountains and jungles from the remote part of the geographically known world. The [[Cham (Asia)|Champas]] and [[Khmers]] were called ''Kunlun'' people by the Chinese before the term was applied to the Malays or more accurately [[Austronesians]] as a whole. In 750, [[Jianzhen]] (688–765) noticed the presence of many "[[Brahmans]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and Kunluns in [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]]". The [[Old Book of Tang]] reported that "every year, Kunlun merchants came in their ships carrying valuable goods to trade with the Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The discourse of race in modern China|page= 12|author= Frank Dikötter |isbn= 978-0-8047-2334-3|year= 1992|publisher= C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In his 1775 doctoral [[dissertation]] titled ''De generis humani varietate nativa'' (trams: ''On the Natural Varieties of Mankind''), Blumenbach outlined four main human races by skin color, namely [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] (white), [[Negroid]] (black), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] (red), and [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] (yellow).

By 1795, Blumenbach added another race called 'Malay' which he considered a subcategory of both the Ethiopian and Mongoloid races.  The Malay race belonged to those of a "brown color: from olive and a clear mahogany to the darkest clove or chestnut brown". Blumenbach expanded the term "Malay" to include the native inhabitants of  the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Maluku Islands|Malukus]], [[Sunda Islands|Sundas]],  [[Indochina]], as well as [[Pacific Island]]s like the [[Tahiti]]ans.  He considered a Tahitian skull he had received to be the missing link; showing the transition between the "primary" race, the Caucasians, and the "degenerate" race, the Negroids.

Blumenbach writes:

{{quote|Malay variety. Tawny-coloured; hair black, soft, curly, thick and plentiful; head moderately narrowed; forehead slightly swelling; nose full, rather wide, as it were diffuse, end thick; mouth large, upper jaw somewhat prominent with parts of the face when seen in profile, sufficiently prominent and distinct from each other. This last variety includes the islanders of the Pacific Ocean, together with the inhabitants of the Mariannas, the Philippine, the Molucca and the Sunda Islands, and of the Malayan peninsula.

I wish to call it the Malay, because the majority of the men of this variety, especially those who inhabit the Indian islands close to the Malacca peninsula, as well as the Sandwich, the Society, and the Friendly Islanders, and also the Malambi of Madagascar down to the inhabitants of Easter Island, use the Malay idiom.|&lt;ref&gt;Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, The anthropological treatises of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, translated by Thomas Bendyshe. 1865. November 2, 2006. {{cite web |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/bindon/ant275/reader/blumenbach.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910170007/http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/bindon/ant275/reader/blumenbach.PDF |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Colonial influences==
The view of Malays held by [[Stamford Raffles]] had a significant influence on English-speakers, lasting to the present day. He is probably the most important voice who promoted the idea of a ‘Malay’ race or nation, not limited to the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay ethnic group]], but embracing the people of a large yet unspecified part of the South East Asian archipelago. Raffles formed a vision of Malays as a language-based 'nation', in line with the views of the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement at the time, and in 1809 sent a literary essay on the topic to the Asiatic Society. After he mounted an expedition to the former [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] seat of royalty in the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], he declared it was ‘the source of that power, the origin of that nation, so extensively scattered over the Eastern Archipelago’.&lt;ref name="Raffles1830"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lady Sophia Raffles|title=Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XI5eAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA360|year=1830|publisher=John Murray|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later writings he moved the Malays from a nation to a race.&lt;ref name="MalayIdentity2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reid|first=Anthony| journal=[[Journal of Southeast Asian Studies]]|title=Understanding Melayu (Malay) as a Source of Diverse Modern Identities| volume=32|issue=3|year=2001|pages=295–313|url=|doi=10.1017/S0022463401000157|pmid=19192500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysia==
{{Main|Malaysian Malay|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia}}
In Malaysia, the early colonial censuses listed separate [[ethnic groups]], such as "Malays, Boyanese, Achinese, Javanese, Bugis, Manilamen (Filipino) and Siamese". The 1891 census merged these ethnic groups into the three racial categories used in modern Malaysia—Chinese, ‘Tamils and other natives of India’, and ‘Malays and other Natives of the Archipelago’. This was based upon the European view at the time that race was a biologically based scientific category. For the 1901 census, the government advised the word "race" should replace "nationality" wherever it occurs.&lt;ref name="MalayIdentity2001"/&gt;

After a period of generations of being classified in these groups, individual identities formed around the concept of ''bangsa Melayu'' (Malay race). For younger generations of people, they saw it as providing unity and solidarity against colonial powers, and non-Malay immigrants. The Malaysian nation was later formed with the ''bangsa Melayu'' having the central and defining position within the country.&lt;ref name="MalayIdentity2001"/&gt;

==Philippines==
In the [[Philippines]], many [[Filipino people|Filipino]]s consider the term "Malay" to refer to the indigenous population of the country as well as the indigenous populations of neighboring Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. This conception is due in part to American anthropologist [[H. Otley Beyer]], who had proposed that Filipinos were actually Malays who migrated north from what are now Malaysia and Indonesia. This idea was in turn propagated by Filipino historians and is still taught in many schools. However, the prevalent consensus among contemporary anthropologists, archaeologists, and linguists actually proposes the reverse;{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} namely that ancestors of the [[Austronesian people]]s of the [[Sunda Islands]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Oceania]] had originally migrated south from the Philippines during the prehistoric period from an origin in [[Taiwan]].

==Indonesia==
[[File:Indonesia Ethnic Groups Map English.svg|thumb|right|360px|Ethnic Malay among other ethnic groups in Indonesia. Ethnic Malay is one of the most widely distributed ethnicities in Indonesia. The Malay realm is described in green and other related sub-ethnicities are rendered in darker or lighter green. Malay ethnic groups are depicted as inhabiting the eastern coast of Sumatra and coastal Kalimantan.]]

In [[Indonesia]], the term "Malay" ({{lang-id|Melayu}}) is more associated with [[ethnic Malay]] than 'Malay race'. It is mostly because Indonesia has other [[native Indonesian]] ethnicities that already consolidated and established their culture and identity who believed they had traditions and languages that are very different from coastal [[ethnic Malay|Malay people]]. Thus, making Malay just as one of myriad Indonesian ethnicities, sharing common status with [[Javanese people|Javanese]] (including their sub-ethnic such as [[Osing people|Osing]] and [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]), [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Batak]] tribes, [[Bugi]]s, [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Torajan]], etc.

The term 'Malay race' was first coined by foreign scientists in colonial times. During the [[Dutch East Indies]] era, natives were grouped under the category ''inlanders'' or ''pribumi'' to describe native Indonesians in contrast to Eurasian [[Indo people]] and Asian immigrants ([[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Arab]] and [[India]]n origin). The concept of the Malay race shared in Malaysia and to some degree, the Philippines, also influenced and might be shared by some Indonesians in the spirit of inclusivity and solidarity, commonly coined as ''puak Melayu'' or ''rumpun Melayu''. However, the idea and the degree of 'Malayness' also varies in Indonesia, from covering the vast area of Austronesian people to confining it only within the [[Jambi]] area where the name '[[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]]' was first recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://melayuonline.com/ind/article/read/701 | title = Redefinisi Melayu: Upaya Menjembatani Perbedaan Kemelayuan Dua Bangsa Serumpun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the common identity that binds Malay people together is their [[Malay language|language]] (with variants of dialects that exist among them), [[Islam]] and their culture.&lt;ref name="Melayu Online Theoretical Framework"&gt;{{Cite web

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the racial classification  "Malay race" was introduced in the early twentieth century into the [[anti-miscegenation laws]] of a number of western US states. Anti-miscegenation laws were [[state law]]s that prohibited marriage between [[European American]]s and [[African American]]s and in some states also other non-whites. After an influx of Filipino immigrants, these existing laws were amended in a number of western states to prohibit marriage between Caucasians and Filipinos, who were designated as members of the Malay race, and a number of Southern states committed to [[racial segregation]] followed suit. Eventually, 9 states ([[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Nevada]], [[South Dakota]], [[Utah]], [[Virginia]], and [[Wyoming]]) explicitly prohibited marriage between Caucasians and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peggy Pascoe|Pascoe, Peggy]], "Miscegenation Law, Court Cases, and Ideologies of "Race" in Twentieth Century America, ''[[The Journal of American History]]'', Vol. 83, June 1996, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In California, there was some confusion over whether pre-existing state laws prohibiting marriage between whites and "[[Mongoloid race|Mongolians]]" also prohibited marriage between whites and Filipinos. A 1933 [[Supreme Court of California]] case ''[[Roldan v. Los Angeles County]]'' concluded that such marriages were legal as Filipinos were members of the "Malay race" and were not enumerated in the list of races for whom marriage with whites was illegal. The California legislature soon after amended the laws to extend the prohibition against interracial marriage to whites and Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Rachel F.|last=Moran|title=Interracial Intimacy: The Regulation of Race and Romance|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oFUSEAWBXlAC&amp;pg=PA206 206]|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-226-53663-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Pyong-Gap|last=Min|title=Asian Americans: contemporary trneds and issues|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5PSYZMs8TzEC&amp;pg=PA189 189]|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4129-0556-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anti-miscegenation laws were gradually repealed after the Second World War, starting with California in 1948. In 1967, all remaining bans against interracial marriage were judged to be [[unconstitutional]] by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' and therefore repealed.

'''Mexicayotl''' ([[Nahuatl]] word meaning "Essence of the [[Mexican people|Mexican]]", "Mexicanity"; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Mexicanidad''; see ''[[:wiktionary:-yotl|-yotl]]'') is a movement reviving the indigenous [[religion]], [[philosophy]] and [[traditions]] of [[Mesoamerican chronology|ancient Mexico]] ([[Aztec religion]] and [[Aztec philosophy]]) among the [[Mexican people]].&lt;ref name="Yolotl"&gt;Yolotl González Torres.

==History==
The Mexicayotl movement started in the 1950s with the founding of the group ''Nueva Mexicanidad'' by [[Antonio Velasco Piña]]. In the same years Rodolfo Nieva López founded the ''Movimiento Confederado Restaurador de la Cultura del Anáhuac'',&lt;ref&gt;Lauro Eduardo Ayala Serrano. ''Tiempo Indígena: la construcción de imaginarios prehispánicos''.&lt;/ref&gt; the co-founder of which was [[Francisco Jimenez Sanchez]] who in later decades became a spiritual leader of the Mexicayotl movement, endowed with the [[honorific]] ''[[Tlacaelel]]''. He had a deep influence in shaping the movement, founding the [[In Kaltonal]] ("House of the Sun", also called Native Mexican Church) in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://kalpullichaplin.com/tlakbio7.htm Tlacaelel Francisco Jimenez Sanchez biography]''. In Kaltonal, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards Mexicayotl has grown developing in a web of local worship and community groups (called ''[[calpulli]]'' or ''kalpulli'')&lt;ref name="Rostas"/&gt; and spreading to the [[Mexican Americans]] or [[Chicanos]] in the [[United States]]. It has also developed strong ties with Mexican national identity movements and [[Chicano nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Zotero Citlalcoatl.

{{One source|article|date=February 2010}}

The {{nihongo|'''Mid Night Club'''|ミッド ナイト クラブ|Middo Naito Kurabu}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[street racing]] association that hosted illegal top speed themed races on the [[Bayshore Route]] (known natively as the {{transl|ja|Wangan}}) of the [[Shuto Expressway]] between [[Tokyo]] to [[Yokohama]]. The club was formed in 1987 and was active until 1999.

"Mid Night Club" became one of the most notorious and highly respected clubs of its type, which led to it being featured in over 200 editorial features in most of the leading Japanese auto magazines and even in foreign magazines such as the Danish ''[[Autoviz]]'', the British ''[[Max Power (magazine)|Max Power]]'' and the American ''[[Turbo (magazine)|Turbo]]'' magazine. One of the earliest non-Japanese media referrals was in the first episode of ''[[Jeremy Clarkson's Motorworld]]'' in January 1995, when the presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]], driving his [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] around Japan, stated that his car "is more likely to be seen in the Mid Night Club".&lt;ref&gt;YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthBXJ-Oth0 Jeremy Clarkson Meets Keiichi Tsuchiya "The Drift King"]&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured roughly 30 seconds of amateur footage revealing the typical nature of the club. The combination of its dangerously high racing speed, and aggressive racing style gave street racing in Japan a worldwide notoriety. The club was regarded as one of the longest-running street racing crews in Japan.

==Participation==

To join the club, which was formed in 1987, was not as easy as the other clubs as it was governed by a series of rules and was far better organized. Additionally, unlike in other groups, the ''hashiriya'' ([[street racing|street racer]]) car was to be capable of going over {{convert|250|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, as a racing speed of over {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} was common. As new members are regarded as apprentices for one year, they were required to attend all the meetings.&lt;ref name="later"&gt;From an article{{Which|date=April 2010}} by [[Andy Wilman]], [[Later (magazine)|''Later'']], Jan 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Only 10% of these drivers would qualify for full membership and they would have to leave if they posed a danger to other motorists and to other members.&lt;ref name="later" /&gt; Members would bear the trademark small rectangle "Mid Night Car Special" sticker on their bumpers, a larger sticker on the sun visor area, and sometimes a "Mid Night Racing Team" sticker on the side skirt. The high standard of the drivers made it difficult for the police to catch them, as police cars of the era were limited to {{convert|180|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, a legal requirement set forth by the 1977 Japanese Automotive [[Gentlemen's Agreement]], and thus the police cars could not catch cars that were driving 180 km/h or faster.&lt;ref name="later" /&gt;

On average, there were 30 members in the club, and they met in a designated meeting spot at [[midnight]], as the name implied; races would take place on the [[Bayshore Route|Bayshore]] Wangan route sometimes leading itself to extended portions of the "[[Shuto Expressway]]" for more complicated and intricate top speed runs. The standing/winner of the race would be one of many factors, such as "the ability to no longer see the driver in front" or "to pass a certain highway stop first". Although very secretive in fashion, a member was once heard saying "'[[Drifting (motorsport)|Drifting]]' and '[[autocross]]' is for the weak. We only do maximum velocity."

[[File:BNR32 GT-R Mid Night Club.jpg|thumb|A BNR32 [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|GT-R]] undergoing a Top Speed test, bearing the trademark "Mid Night" logos, circa 1995.]]

It was customary among most racers to watch out for members of other teams displaying Mid Night Club paraphernalia. If a member of another team, or an independent racer was spotted owning a car displaying "Mid Night" stickers/logos that were not part of the actual team's roster, they could face harassment, and in some cases, vandalism inflicted on their cars. There were many reports of non-member cars wearing the logos being defaced/damaged to a state of disrepair because of the attempt to fabricate the stickers to falsely announce their membership in the club.

In order to organize a meetup, a Mid Night Club leader would place an ad in a [[Tokyo]] local newspaper, under the "[[Classifieds]]" section. Usually, it would read something entirely different than any sort of racing meeting, in order to not draw unwanted attention from law enforcement. The subject of the ad would have been discussed at the previous meetup, so that the team members could look up the ad and specifically meet up at the exact location in order to begin racing, at the exact time. An example of the ad would read something like this:

{{quote|For sale: Small handbags at discount prices. For more information, I am available for meetup at Daikoku Parking Area on Thursday, between 11PM and 2AM. Thank you.}}

The members would look up at the ad in the specific newspaper given by the leader (which is a small-scale newspaper or local city newspaper) and meet at the scheduled spot and organize the racing events. Daikoku PA was the most visited parking area for designated meet-ups of the team and today, it is an exclusive PA for street racing gathering.

As full-fledged members' cars were capable of performing over {{convert|320|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, the cars were usually boasting over 400&amp;ndash;600 [[Brake horsepower|bhp]], in order to maintain a 350km/h speed through the Wangan straight stretch for well over 15 minutes at a time. One member, originally training to be a doctor before settling on running his family's business, was rumored to be spending over {{USD|2 million|link=yes}} on the rebuilding and modification of his [[Porsche 911]] Turbo known as the "Yoshida Specials 930". The Porsche, with an output of 700 bhp on a stroked 3.6 Liter Turbo flat six, had a long-running rivalry with an Air Breathing Research (ABR) Hosoki Z-Car that made 680 bhp on an [[Nissan_L_engine#L2.9_.7E_3.2|L30ETT]] custom setup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oppositelock.kinja.com/wangans-infamous-blackbird-porsche-930-turbo-1520243773]&lt;/ref&gt; The drivers' professions and personal information were never revealed, as by club policy, members were not allowed to ask the other members about personal information nor professions or to reveal them to other members (and, in the case that the few members were friends, they were obligated to keep silent about it).&lt;ref name="later" /&gt; Only ''[[Max Power (magazine)|Max Power]]'', in 1995, revealed the professions of two drivers: one, a [[Mazda RX7 FD3S|RX-7 FD3S]] owner, was a property developer; the other, who drove a [[Nissan Skyline GT-R#R32|Skyline GT-R R32]], ran his family car sales business. Many affluent and well known Japanese "[[Car tuning|tuning]]" shop founders are rumoured to be original members, however.

==End of the club==

The Mid Night Club was disbanded in 1999 when [[Bōsōzoku]] gang members were waiting to "play" with the club as they were racing down the expressway. A few of the members accepted the challenge, however. Since the members drove at very high speeds, and they accidentally entered a high traffic zone, it culminated in a huge [[Multiple-vehicle collision|chain-reaction crash]] with the deaths of two Bōsōzoku members and eight motorists hospitalized; six of them were innocent drivers on the highway. As it was club policy to refrain from endangering or injuring any other motorist, no matter a racer, nor an innocent bystander, this incident resulted in the club being disbanded immediately and forever.&lt;ref name="later" /&gt; Since then there have been numerous imitators, but with tighter traffic laws making things difficult, most such groups have since been disbanded.

Despite being no longer in existence, many automotive media still cite the gang as an inspiration to more street racing gangs, such as the June 2008 issue of ''Max Power'', which ran an article about a street racer gang in [[London]] who claim to race in town centers rather than on expressways. However, the Mid Night Club is highly regarded for being a club which put pedestrian safety before their own. Many automotive enthusiasts credit the club with a high sense of morality and honor due to its immediate disbandment post-disaster.

The club members seclude themselves in secrecy to this day, many refusing to talk or even mention the club under any circumstances.

The name is derived from the [[Min River (Fujian)|Min River]] in Fujian. Min varieties are not [[mutually intelligible]] with each other or with any other varieties of Chinese.

There are many Min speakers among [[overseas Chinese]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. The most widely spoken variety of Min outside Fujian is Southern Min (Minnan), also known as [[Hokkien|Hokkien-Taiwanese]] (which includes [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] and [[Amoy dialect|Amoy]]).

==History==
The Min homeland of Fujian was opened to Chinese settlement by the defeat of the [[Minyue]] state by the armies of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in 110 BC.{{sfnp|Norman|1991|pp=328}}
The area features rugged mountainous terrain, with short rivers that flow into the [[South China Sea]].
Most subsequent migration from north to south China passed through the valleys of the [[Xiang River|Xiang]] and [[Gan River|Gan]] rivers to the west, so that Min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=210, 228}}
As a result, whereas most [[varieties of Chinese]] can be treated as derived from [[Middle Chinese]], the language described by [[rime dictionary|rhyme dictionaries]] such as the ''[[Qieyun]]'' (601 AD), Min varieties contain traces of older distinctions.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=228–229}}
Linguists estimate that the oldest layers of Min dialects diverged from the rest of Chinese around the time of the [[Han dynasty]].{{sfnp|Ting|1983|pp=9–10}}{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=33, 79}}
However, significant waves of migration from the [[North China Plain]] occurred:{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=120}}
* The [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]]  during the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], particularly the [[Disaster of Yongjia]] in 311 AD, caused a tide of immigration to the south.
* In 669, [[Chen Zheng (Tang dynasty)|Chen Zheng]] and his son [[Chen Yuanguang]] from [[Gushi County]] in [[Henan]] set up a regional administration in [[Fujian]] to suppress an insurrection by the [[She people]].
* [[Wang Chao (Tang dynasty)|Wang Chao]] was appointed governor of Fujian in 893, near the end of the [[Tang dynasty]], and brought tens of thousands of troops from [[Henan]].  In 909, following the fall of the Tang dynasty, his son [[Wang Shenzhi]] founded the [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min Kingdom]], one of the [[Ten Kingdoms]] in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern Min varieties:
# A non-Chinese substratum from the original languages of [[Minyue]], which Norman and Mei Tsu-lin believe were [[Austroasiatic]].{{sfnp|Norman|Mei|1976}}{{sfnp|Norman|1991|pp=331–332}}
# The earliest Chinese layer, brought to Fujian by settlers from [[Zhejiang]] to the north during the Han dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1991|pp=334–336}}
# A layer from the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period, which is largely consistent with the phonology of the ''Qieyun'' dictionary.{{sfnp|Norman|1991|p=336}}
# A [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary layer]] based on the [[koiné language|koiné]] of [[Chang'an]], the capital of the [[Tang dynasty]].{{sfnp|Norman|1991|p=337}}
Laurent Sagart (2008) shows that Norman and Mei Tsu-lin analysis of an Austroasiatic substratum in Min is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Sagart"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis proposed by Jerry Norman and Tsu-Lin Mei arguing for an Austroasiatic homeland along the middle Yangtze has been largely abandoned in most circles, and left unsupported by the majority of Austroasiatic specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, James R. (2016). "[https://www.academia.edu/26296118/Kra-Dai_and_the_Proto-History_of_South_China_and_Vietnam Kra-Dai and the Proto-History of South China and Vietnam]", p. 30.

Min is usually described as one of seven or ten groups of [[varieties of Chinese]] but has greater dialectal diversity than any of the other groups.  The varieties used in neighbouring counties, and in the mountains of western Fujian even in adjacent villages, are often mutually unintelligible.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=188}}

Early classifications, such as those of [[Li Fang-Kuei]] in 1937 and [[Yuan Jiahua]] in 1960, divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=49}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}}
However, in a 1963 report on a survey of Fujian, Pan Maoding and colleagues argued that the primary split was between inland and coastal groups.  A key discriminator between the two groups is a group of words that have a [[lateral consonant|lateral]] initial {{IPA|/l/}} in coastal varieties, and a voiceless fricative {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in inland varieties, contrasting with another group having {{IPA|/l/}} in both areas.  Norman reconstructs these initials in [[Proto-Min]] as voiceless and voiced laterals that merged in coastal varieties.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}}{{sfnp|Branner|2000|pp=98–100}}

===Coastal Min===
The coastal varieties have the vast majority of speakers, and have spread from their homeland in Fujian and eastern Guangdong to the islands of [[Taiwan]] and [[Hainan]], to other coastal areas of southern China and to Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=232–233}}
Pan and colleagues divided them into three groups:{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=52}}
* [[Eastern Min]] (Min Dong), centered around the city of [[Fuzhou]], the capital of Fujian province, with [[Fuzhou dialect]] as the prestige form.
* [[Pu-Xian Min]] is spoken in the city of [[Putian]] and the county of [[Xianyou County]].  Li Rulong and Chen Zhangtai examined 214 words, finding 62% shared with [[Quanzhou dialect]] (Southern Min) and 39% shared with Fuzhou dialect (Eastern Min), and concluded that Pu-Xian was more closely related to Southern Min.{{sfnp|Li|Chen|1991}}
* [[Southern Min]] (Min Nan) originates from the south of Fujian and the eastern corner of Guangdong. In popular usage, Southern Min usually refers to dialects of the [[Hokkien|Quanzhang]] type, which originated in southern Fujian (around [[Quanzhou]], [[Zhangzhou]] and [[Xiamen]]) and spread to Southeast Asia, where they are known as Hokkien, and [[Taiwan]], where they are known as [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=232–233}} [[Zhenan Min]] of [[Cangnan County]] in southern [[Zhejiang]] is also of this type.{{sfnp|Zhang|1987}} The dialects of the [[Chaoshan]] region of eastern Guangdong, including [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and [[Shantou dialect]]s, have difficult mutual intelligibility with the [[Amoy dialect]].{{sfnp|Simons|Fennig|2017|loc=Chinese, Min Nan}} Most [[Thai Chinese]] speak Teochew varieties.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}}
The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) distinguished two further groups, which had previously been included in Southern Min:{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=71}}
* [[Leizhou Min]], spoken on the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] in southwestern Guangdong.
* [[Hainanese]], spoken on the island of Hainan. These dialects feature drastic changes to initial consonants, including a series of [[implosive consonant]]s, that have been attributed to contact with the [[Tai–Kadai languages]] spoken on the island.{{sfnp|Lien|2015|p=169}}
Coastal varieties feature some uniquely Min vocabulary, including pronouns and negatives.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=233–234}}
All but the Hainan dialects have complex [[tone sandhi]] systems.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=239}}

===Inland Min===
Although they have far fewer speakers, the inland varieties show much greater variation than the coastal ones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=234–235}}
Pan and colleagues divided the inland varieties into two groups:{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=52}}
* [[Northern Min]] (Min Bei) is spoken in [[Nanping]] prefecture in Fujian, with [[Jian'ou dialect]] taken as typical.
* [[Central Min]] (Min Zhong), spoken in [[Sanming]] prefecture.
The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) included a further group:{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=71}}
* [[Shao-Jiang Min]], spoken in the northwestern Fujian counties of [[Shaowu]] and [[Jiangle County|Jiangle]], were classified as [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] by Pan and his associates.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=233}} However, [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] suggested that they were inland varieties of Min that had been subject to heavy [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] or Hakka influence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=235, 241}}

Although coastal varieties can be derived from a [[proto-language]] with four series of stops or affricates at each point of articulation (e.g. {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/dʱ/}}), inland varieties contain traces of two further series, which Norman termed "softened stops" due to their reflexes in some varieties.{{sfnp|Norman|1973}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=228–230}}{{sfnp|Branner|2000|pp=100–104}} Inland varieties use pronouns and negatives cognate with those in Hakka and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=233–234}} Inland varieties have little or no tone sandhi.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=239}}

==Vocabulary==
Most Min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other Chinese varieties, but there is also a significant number of distinctively Min words that may be traced back to proto-Min.
In some cases a semantic shift has occurred in Min or the rest of Chinese:

* *tiaŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; 鼎 "wok".  The Min form preserves the original meaning "cooking pot", but in other Chinese varieties this word (MC ''tengX'' &gt; ''dǐng'') has become specialized to refer to ancient ceremonial tripods.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=231}}
* *dzhən&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; "rice field".  In Min this form has displaced the common Chinese term ''tián'' 田.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=58}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=231–232}}  Many scholars identify the Min word with ''chéng'' 塍 (MC ''zying'') "raised path between fields", but Norman argues that it is cognate with ''céng'' 層 (MC ''dzong'') "additional layer or floor", reflecting the [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace]]d fields commonly found in Fujian.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=59–60}}
* *tšhio&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; 厝 "house".{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=47}}  Norman argues that the Min word is cognate with ''shù'' 戍 (MC syuH) "to guard".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=232}}{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=33}}
* *tshyi&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; 喙 "mouth".  In Min this form has displaced the common Chinese term ''kǒu'' 口.{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=41}}  It is believed to be cognate with ''huì'' 喙 (MC ''xjwojH'') "beak, bill, snout; to pant".{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=33}}

Norman and Mei Tsu-lin have suggested an Austroasiatic origin for some Min words:

* *-dəŋ&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; "shaman" may be compared with [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''đồng'' (/ɗoŋ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/) "to shamanize, to communicate with spirits" and [[Mon language|Mon]] doŋ "to dance (as if) under demonic possession".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=18–19}}{{sfnp|Norman|Mei|1976|pp=296–297}}
* *kiɑn&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; 囝 "son" appears to be related to Vietnamese ''con'' (/kɔn/) and Mon kon "child".{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=63}}{{sfnp|Norman|Mei|1976|pp=297–298}}

However, Norman and Mei Tsu-lin suggestion is rejected by Laurent Sagart (2008).&lt;ref name="Sagart" /&gt; Moreover, the Austroasiatic predecessor of modern Vietnamese language has been proven to originate in the mountainous region in Central Laos and Vietnam, rather than in the region north of the [[Red River delta]].&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"&gt;Chamberlain, J.R. 1998, "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/chamberlain1998origin.pdf The origin of Sek: implications for Tai and Vietnamese history]", in The International Conference on Tai Studies, ed. S. Burusphat, Bangkok, Thailand, pp. 97-128. Institute of Language and Culture for Rural Development, Mahidol University.&lt;/ref&gt;
. In other cases, the origin of the Min word is obscure.  Such words include *khau&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; 骹 "foot",{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=44}} *-tsiɑm&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; 䭕 "insipid"{{sfnp|Norman|1981|p=56}} and *dzyŋ&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; 𧚔 "to wear".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=232}}

==Writing system==
{{see also|Foochow Romanized|Written Hokkien}}
When using [[Chinese characters]] to write a non-Mandarin form, standard practice is to use characters that correspond etymologically to the words being represented, and to invent new characters for words with no evident ancient Chinese etymology or in some cases for alternative pronunciations of existing characters, especially when the meaning is significantly different.  [[Written Cantonese]] has carried this process out to the farthest extent of any non-Mandarin variety, to the extent that pure Cantonese vernacular can be unambiguously written using Chinese characters.  Contrary to popular belief, a vernacular written in this fashion is not in general comprehensible to a Mandarin speaker, due to significant changes in grammar and vocabulary and the necessary use of large number of non-Mandarin characters.

A similar process has never taken place for any of the Min varieties and there is no standard system for writing Min, although some specialized characters have been created.  Given that Min combines the Chinese of several different periods and contains some non-Chinese vocabulary, one may have trouble finding the appropriate Chinese characters for some Min vocabulary. In the case of [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], there are also indigenous words borrowed from [[Formosan languages]], as well as a substantial number of loan words from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Min spoken in Singapore and Malaysia has borrowed heavily from [[Malay language|Malay]] and, to a lesser extent, from [[English language|English]] and other languages.  The result is that cases of Min written purely in Chinese characters does not represent actual Min speech, but contains a heavy mixture of Mandarin forms.

Attempts to faithfully represent Min speech necessarily rely on [[romanization]], i.e. representation using Latin characters.  Some Min speakers use the Church Romanization ({{zh|c=教會羅馬字|p=Jiaohui Luomazi}}). For [[Hokkien]] the romanization is called [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] (POJ) and for [[Fuzhou dialect]] called [[Foochow Romanized]] (Bàng-uâ-cê, BUC). Both systems were created by foreign missionaries in the 19th century (see [[:zh-min-nan:|Min Nan]] and [[:cdo:|Min Dong Wikipedia]]). There are some uncommon publications in mixed writing, using mostly Chinese characters but using the [[Latin alphabet]] to represent words that cannot easily be represented by Chinese characters.

{{History of Burma}}

The '''Myinsaing Kingdom''' ({{lang-my|မြင်စိုင်းခေတ်}} {{IPA-my|mjɪ̀ɴzáɪɴ kʰɪʔ|}}) was the kingdom that ruled central [[Burma]] (Myanmar) from 1297 to 1313. Co-founded by three brothers from [[Myinsaing]],&lt;ref name=gc-209&gt;Coedès 1968: 209&lt;/ref&gt; it was one of many small kingdoms that emerged following the collapse of [[Pagan Empire]] in 1287. Myinsaing successfully fended off the [[Second Mongol invasion of Burma|second Mongol invasion]] in 1300–01, and went on to unify central Burma from [[Tagaung, Mandalay|Tagaung]] in the north to [[Pyay|Prome]] (Pyay) in the south. The brothers' co-rule ended between 1310 and 1313, with the death of the two elder brothers. In 1315, the central Burmese state split into two rival states of [[Pinya Kingdom|Pinya]] and [[Sagaing Kingdom|Sagaing]]. Central Burma would not be reunified until the rise of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] five decades later.

==History==
===First Mongol invasion (1277–87)===
{{see also|First Mongol invasion of Burma}}

The origins of the Myinsaing period can be traced back to the late Pagan period. By the 1270s, the [[Pagan Dynasty]], which had ruled the [[Irrawaddy river|Irrawaddy valley]] and its periphery for over two centuries, was on its last legs. Between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivatable land had been donated to religion, and the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen.&lt;ref name=vbl-119-120&gt;Lieberman 2003: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the end of Pagan came in 1277 when the [[Mongol Empire]] first invaded northernmost Pagan territories (present-day [[Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture|Dehong]] and [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]] prefectures, [[Yunnan]]). The Mongols proceeded to invade northern Burma in 1283–85, occupying down to [[Tagaung]]. King [[Narathihapate]] fled to Lower Burma.&lt;ref name=geh-65-68&gt;Harvey 1925: 65–68&lt;/ref&gt; In the next two years, while the king negotiated a ceasefire and eventually a surrender with the Mongols, the defence of central Burma passed to the army led by three brothers named [[Athinkhaya]], [[Yazathingyan]] and [[Thihathu]] from [[Myinsaing]].&lt;ref name=mha-72-73&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war rise (1287–97)===
On 1 July 1287, the newly minted Mongol vassal Narathihapate was assassinated by one of his sons.&lt;ref name=yt-1-149-3&gt;Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 149, fn#3&lt;/ref&gt; All the regions in the country, which had not already revolted, broke away. The Mongols invaded central Burma to reinstate their vassal state but were driven back by the brothers' small but disciplined army. Without a king on the Pagan throne, the brothers were now the de facto leaders of central Burma. It was only in May 1289 that one of Narathihapate's sons [[Kyawswa of Pagan|Kyawswa]] emerged as king. But Kyawswa, the former viceroy of [[Dala Township|Dala]] (modern Yangon), had no power base in the upcountry, and controlled little outside of Pagan.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Than Tun 1959: 121): Kyawswa at most might have controlled six districts of the [[Minbu]] granary region, which was of less importance than the Kyaukse granary under control by the three brothers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyawswa tried to make the best of the situation. To win their loyalty, the king appointed the three brothers viceroys of [[Myinsaing]], [[Mekkhaya]] and [[Pinle]]. The appointments made little impression. According to an inscription dated 16 February 1293, the brothers claimed that they were the ones who defeated the Mongol invaders, and that they were equal to the king of Pagan.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-121&gt;Than Tun 1959: 121&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, they agreed to march to Lower Burma when King [[Wareru]] of [[Mottama|Martaban]] (Mottama) became a vassal of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Their army attacked Martaban in 1293–94 but were driven back. Still, it left no doubt as to who held the real power in central Burma.

===Takeover (1297)===
The brothers further consolidated power in the following years. The youngest brother, Thihathu, was the most ambitious and blatant. He was not satisfied with a mere viceroy title; he assumed the royal titles of ''hsinbyushin'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|ဆင်ဖြူရှင်}}, "Lord of White Elephant") in 1295 and ''mingyi'' ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းကြီး}}, "Great King") in 1296.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-122/&gt; Alarmed, Kyawswa finally decided to seek protection of the Mongols. In January 1297, he sent his eldest son [[Theingapati]] to Tagaung, and offered submission. On 20 March 1297, Emperor [[Temür Khan]] recognised Kyawswa as King of Burma and conferred titles on the brothers as Kyawswa's subordinates.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-119-120&gt;Than Tun 1959: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers resented the new arrangement, and eventually decided to risk a Mongol intervention. With the help of the dowager queen [[Pwa Saw]], they overthrew Kyawswa on 17 December 1297.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-119-120/&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-74&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Mongol invasion (1300–01)===
{{see also|Second Mongol invasion of Burma}}

The brothers now braced for a Mongol reprisal. But the expected response did not come. The Mongols learned of the overthrow only in June-July 1298 but the Yunnan government, which did not have sufficient troops to undertake an invasion, took no action. By May 1299, the brothers were reasonably confident that the invasion, if at all, would not come until the next dry-season at the earliest. They allowed their puppet king [[Saw Hnit]] to receive his first audience on 8 May 1299, and more importantly, executed Kyawswa and Theingapati on 10 May 1299.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-121/&gt; The Mongols still took no action, ignoring the execution of their vassal king and crown prince. The brothers became bolder, and decided to challenge the Mongol rule in northern Burma itself. In January 1300, the Burmese army led by Athinkhaya seized lightly manned southernmost Mongol garrisons in [[Singu]] and [[Kanbalu Township|Male]], only 70 km from Tagaung.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-122&gt;Than Tun 1959: 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongol government could not ignore the situation any more. On 22 June 1300, the emperor declared [[Kumara Kassapa]], a son of Kyawswa, the rightful king of Burma, and ordered an invasion. In the following dry season, a 12,000-strong Mongol army invaded, and despite taking heavy losses managed to reach Myinsaing on 25 January 1301. But Myinsaing's defences held, and the Mongols were persuaded to call off the attack on receipt of a considerable bribe on 6 April 1301. The Mongol government was dissatisfied with the outcome but pursued no further action. They withdrew from northern Burma entirely on 4 April 1303.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-122/&gt;&lt;ref name=tt-1964-277-278&gt;Than Tun 1964: 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry zone power===
Myinsaing was now the undisputed power in central dry zone of the country. At Pagan, Saw Hnit remained as "king" but in reality, he was now a mere governor. In the north, the brothers took over Tagaung but could not go any farther north as several [[Shan states]] now dominated the entire arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. In the south, they gained nominal allegiance of the rulers of [[Pyay|Prome]] (Pyay) and [[Taungoo|Toungoo]] (Taungoo). They did not attempt to recover Lower Burma, which was now [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Ramanya]], the coastal kingdom founded by the ethnic [[Mon people|Mons]].

The triumvirate's rule lasted for a few more years in spite of Thihathu's ambitions. The youngest brother assumed a royal title in 1306, and proclaimed himself king on 20 October 1309.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-122/&gt; The proclamation ended the charade of Saw Hnit's nominal status as king.&lt;ref name=mha-75&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 75&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not known what the two elder brothers made of the proclamation, after Athinkhaya's death in 1310, Thihathu emerged as the primary leader of central Burma. Yazathingyan faded into the background, and died two years later.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Chronicles ''[[Zatadawbon Yazawin]]'', ''[[Maha Yazawin]]'' and ''[[Yazawin Thit]]'' all say Yazathingyan died in 674 ME (28 March 1312 to 28 March 1313). But ''[[Hmannan Yazawin]]'' (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 369) says that he died in 1303. ''Hmannan'' is incorrect. According to a contemporary inscription per (Than Tun 1959: 123), Athinkhaya died on 13 April 1310 and the two younger brothers were still alive.&lt;/ref&gt;

The undisputed reign lasted about three years. In 1315, Thihathu's eldest biological son [[Sawyun|Saw Yun]] set up a rival base in [[Sagaing]]. By 1317, Saw Yun had survived two attacks by his father's forces, and the central dry zone was again divided: the [[Sagaing Kingdom]] in the north and the [[Pinya Kingdom]] in the south.&lt;ref name=hy-1-375-376&gt;Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 375–376&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The Myinsaing government was headed by the triumvirate. Although Myinsaing, Mekkhaya and Pinle were all capitals, judging by where they chose to defend against the Mongols, their hometown of Myinsaing appeared to have been the most important one. Like the Pagan government, the Myinsaing government relied on its vassal rulers for the governance of the peripheral regions. The key vassal rulers were:

The political unity the brothers achieved in central Burma fragile, and did not last long in any case. The kingdom split into two in 1315. Central Burma would not be reunited until five decades later (1364–67).

==Economy==
Myinsaing was primarily an agrarian economy. Unlike Pagan, it possessed no coastal ports, and could not conduct any maritime trade. The brothers tried to rebuild the dry zone's agrarian base. First, after the evacuation of Mongols in 1303, the brothers were able to bring all three main granaries of the country, Kyuakse, Minbu and Mu, under their rule. Secondly, they attempted to tackle the problem they inherited from Pagan kings: too much valuable land was donated to religion, and the crown could not collect revenue. They followed the tactic first used by King [[Kyaswa]] (r. 1235–51), which checked the accuracy of the donation records of the lands.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-120&gt;Than Tun 1959: 120&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, they could not solve the problem overnight. Six decades later, King [[Thadominbya|Thado Minbya]], a great grandson of Thihathu, would still be dealing with the issue.

==Legacy==
Myinsaing was the first central Burmese polity that arose out of the ashes of the fallen Pagan Empire. Its main legacies were keeping middle Burma independent, and preserving Pagan's cultural traditions. Unlike elsewhere in mainland Southeast Asia, the Tai-Shan peoples and languages did not come to dominate central Burma. The brothers, who might have been half-Shan, nonetheless saw themselves as the heirs of Pagan kings, propagated Pagan's cultural traditions, and rebuilt a state, albeit a fragile one, stretching from Tagaung in the north to Prome to the south. The fragile state would break up soon after but the Ava Kingdom, which would reunify the middle country in the 1360s, had its origins in Myinsaing.

==Historiography==
===Chronicle reporting differences===
Various royal chronicles report a generally similar outline of events but a number of differences also exist. Contemporary inscriptions show that the birth order and death order of the brothers given in the ''[[Yazawin Thit]]'' chronicle are both correct while other chronicles contain errors.

===Colonial era scholarship===
According to the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial era]] scholarship, this was the Age of the Three Shan Brothers ({{lang-my-Mymr|ရှမ်းညီနောင်သုံးဦးခေတ်}}), modifying the term used in the chronicles ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းညီနောင်သုံးဦးခေတ်}}, lit. "Age of the Three Royal Brothers"). The colonial scholarship says it was the start of the [[Shan people|Shan]] period in Upper Burma that would last to the mid-16th century. The assessment of the ethnicity of the brothers as Shan was first made by the British historian [[Arthur Purves Phayre]] in the late 19th century, and his assertion was propagated by later Burma historians.&lt;ref name=maat-1998-881&gt;Aung-Thwin 1998: 881&lt;/ref&gt; Phayre deemed [[Theinkha Bo]], the father of the brothers, an ethnic Shan since the chronicles say he was a son of ''[[saopha|sawbwa]]'' of [[Binnaka]]. But the historian Michael Aung-Thwin has rejected the assertion, given that no historical evidence of any kind exists to support the claim.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Aung-Thwin 1996: 884–885): Arthur Phayre was the first one to make the assertion, based purely on the chronicles' use of ''sawbwa'', equating the office with ethnicity. GE Harvey (Harvey 1925: 76) inserted the word "Shan", in what he claimed was the direct quote from Hmannan, which says no such thing. In all, no historical evidence of any kind (in Burmese, Shan or anything else) that indicates the ethnicity of their father or the three brothers exists.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York Guitar Show''' was an annual, two-day, vintage guitar exhibition and sale scheduled on the third weekend in September and held at the Mary Help of Christians Church on E. [[12th Street (Manhattan)|12th St.]] and [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]] in [[New York City]]. Over the span of a 15-year period (1986–2000) the New York Guitar Show was the only regularly scheduled vintage guitar event dedicated entirely to charity in the United States. Originally started by Ken and Kathy Heer, [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] music dealers (Saint Mark's Music Exchange) in 1983-84 at a midtown Manhattan hotel as a for profit event, the production was purchased by Skip Henderson, an ex-social worker turned vintage guitar dealer (City Lights Music) from [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], moved to the Mary Help of Christians church auditorium at E.12th St. and Ave. A, and changed into a not for profit venture primarily to support the [[AIDS Resource Foundation for Children]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. Henderson later went on to establish the non-profit [[Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]] to assist rural black churches in Mississippi.

The New York Guitar Show was also a venue for a Saturday night performance series which Henderson produced over the lifespan of the event. These shows featured an eclectic array of performers such as [[Nokie Edwards]] of [[the Ventures]], guitar maker [[Semie Moseley]], [[Junior Brown]], [[The LeRoi Brothers]], [[Lonnie Pitchford]], [[Elliot Easton]] of [[The Cars]], [[YouTube]] favorites [[The Otis Brothers]] featuring Bob Guida (an early financial backer of the event), and numerous others. In 1996 as Henderson became more involved with the activities of the Mt. Zion Fund, production of the show was transferred to another vintage guitar dealer James Pasch, with the contractual stipulation that it remain a fund raising event for the AIDS Resource Foundation for Children. 
 
Primarily because of its [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] location, the event was known for attracting a diverse crowd of notable musicians and figures from New York City such as [[Billy Idol]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Willy DeVille]], and many others.

In 2013 Mary Help of Christians Church, the original site of the guitar show, was sold for $41 million and demolished despite protests from Greenwich Village historic preservationists.

The '''Olomouc language island''' was a [[German language|German]]-speaking area within the [[Czech language|Czech]]-speaking area of [[central Moravia]]. It centered on the city of [[Olomouc]], including the city centre, south and west suburbs and several villages on the south and the west. These areas also hosted Czech communities. The Olomouc language island ceased to exist after the [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] in 1945 and 1946.

== History ==

During the second half of the 19th century Olomouc was a German city with a significant Czech minority. German villages were near Olomouc (Neředín, Nová Ulice, Povel, Nové Sady, Nový Svět, Nemilany, Kyselov, Slavonín, Hněvotín and Nedvězí). During the time when Karl Brandhuber was the city's mayor, the Czech minority was culturaly suppressed. After the end of the [[First World War]] the surrounding areas were merged with the Olomouc and relative harmony obtained between the two groups. After the [[Second World War]], however, the German community from Olomouc and German villages were expelled.

== After expulsion ==

Former German inhabitants from Olomouc established a club, Heimatverband Olmütz und Mittelmähren in [[Nördlingen]] and made a connection among these people. The club publishes ''Olmützer Blätter'' magazine.

'''Public duties''' are performed by military personnel, and usually have a ceremonial or historic significance rather than an overtly operational role.

==Denmark==
{{main|Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron}}
{{main|Royal Life Guards (Denmark)}}
[[File:Amalienborg.1.jpg|thumb|Royal Life Guards at Amalienborg Palace]]
There are two regiments in Denmark, who provide soldiers for public duties, the [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guard regiment]] and [[Guard Hussar Regiment (Denmark)|Guard Hussar Regiment]]. 

The [[Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron]] provide mounted escorts for the [[Monarchy of Denmark| Royal family]] and foreign dignitaries, and carry ceremonial services for the Royal Danish Army. 

The [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] provide a permanent guard at the Amalienborg Palace, Kastellet (part of the old fortification of Copenhagen), Rosenborg Castle/garrison of the Royal Life Guards in Copenhagen and the garrison of Høvelte. On occasions guard is kept at Fredensborg Palace, Marselisborg Palace, Gråsten Palace, Christiansborg Palace and other locations inside the Danish realm.
 
==Germany==
The ''Wachregiment Berlin'' was founded in early 1921. In addition to genuine security duties, the unit was used for ceremonial public duties in the capital. The regiment was disbanded in June 1921 and shortly after was revived as ''Kommando der Wachtruppe'' (lit. Headquarters Guard Troop). 

The ''Wachtruppe'' comprised seven companies, each drawn from one of the seven active army divisions. Each company served for three months before returning to its parent division. In this way, the Wachtruppe represented the whole [[Reichswehr]].

The ''Kommando'' was based at Moabit Barracks, and every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, performed a modest [[Guard Mounting|changing of the guard]] ceremony for the public. On each Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, the entire ''Wachtruppe'', accompanied by the regimental band, marched from the barracks through the [[Brandenburg Gate]] and to the Berlin War Memorial, providing a greater spectacle for public view.

In 1934, the unit was renamed ''Wachtruppe Berlin'' and in 1936, a headquarters and administration company were added. In June 1937, the unit was again renamed ''Wach Regiment Berlin''. Postings were now done by individuals, not entire companies, and each man served six-month tours of duty. The unit provided escorts and Guards of Honour for State Visits, Conferences and even the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].

In 1939, the unit was reorganized as the [[Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland]]. While equipped as a field unit, the regiment also maintained a public duties detachment in the capital. The ceremonial guard was pressed into service during the July bomb plot in 1944 and helped round up conspirators in the capital. 

In 1957, the post-war [[Bundeswehr]] established the [[Wachbataillon]], a tri-service unit, for ceremonial duties.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Queen's Guard}}
===London===
Three [[infantry]] [[battalions]] of the [[British army]] are currently tasked with the provision of Public Duties. Two of these are from the [[Foot Guards]] of the [[Household Division]], and one (since 1996) is a [[line infantry]] battalion. The former are normally based at [[Wellington Barracks, London|Wellington Barracks]] in central [[London]], within a short distance of [[Buckingham Palace]], and at [[Victoria Barracks, Windsor|Victoria Barracks]] in [[Windsor Castle]], while the latter is at the [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow]]. Permanent Public Duties [[Guards Incremental Companies|companies]] of the [[Foot Guards]] also supplement these men.

Apart from providing the [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[St James's Palace]], and the [[Tower of London]] Guard, the Public Duties battalions occasionally also provide the [[Windsor Castle]] Guard, which is otherwise provided by the battalion based at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. From 1783 to 1973, the Guards provided a nightly detachment called the [[Bank Picquet]] for guard duty at the [[Bank of England]].

===Edinburgh===
Public duties are also carried out in [[Edinburgh]], although not as frequently as in London. Prior to 2002, sentries were permanently stationed at the entrance to [[Edinburgh Castle]], but these were withdrawn due to cost-cutting measures. Today, sentries are posted during the evenings between 6 pm and 9 am, and throughout the week that HM The Queen spends in Edinburgh at both the castle and the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]]. Sentries are also posted at the castle during the month of the [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo]] prior to each performance, with the regiment forming a [[guard of honour]] at the end of each performance.

Unlike in London, there is no permanently based foot guards battalion stationed in Edinburgh, so public duties are performed by one of the resident line infantry/rifles battalions. However, as part of the [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]] plan, the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Balaklava Company]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]] will be reduced to a single incremental company to be based permanently in Scotland for public duties.

==Canada==
Public duties are performed in [[Ottawa]], the capital of [[Canada]]. The primary ceremonial duties involve mounting guard at the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]] and at [[Rideau Hall]], the official residence of the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]. These are performed primarily by the two Canadian regiments of foot guards (the Governor General's Foot Guards/Ottawa, and the Canadian Grenadier Guards/Montreal), detachments of which are formed into the [[Ceremonial Guard]]. However, as in London, it is possible that any Canadian regiment could serve in this capacity on authority of the Chief of Defence Staff. The guard at Parliament Hill and Rideau Hall are mounted daily from early June until late August, with the first parade usually on the Friday before [[Canada Day]]. The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]], a Canadian Primary Reserve Unit, have often been called upon to perform additional public duties in Ottawa since their inception in 1872. Recently, the Ceremonial Guard has also been tasked to mount sentries on the Cenotaph, at Elgin and Wellington St.

==United States==
===Washington, D.C.===
Probably the best-known U.S. military unit to regularly engage in public duties is the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] ("The Old Guard") of the [[U.S. Army]]. Since April 6, 1948, the regiment is tasked with perpetually guarding the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The regiment also regularly takes part in [[White House]] ceremonies, including at [[state visit]]s.

The other U.S. military services have their own ceremonial units.

{{Serbs}}

The '''[[Serbs]]''' are a small [[community]] in '''[[Bulgaria]]''', most of whom are [[emigrants]]. Many of them are [[athletes]] and [[businessmen]] that have expatriated to Bulgaria in the last two decades.

==Numbers==
* According to the National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration Issues by the Bulgarian Government, there are 313 local Serbs in the country, most of whom are old political emigrants.&lt;ref name="Етнически малцинствени общности"&gt;Национален съвет за сътрудничество по етническите и интеграционните въпроси.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
During the [[Byzantine Bulgaria|Byzantine rule in Bulgaria]], the Serbs invaded Byzantine territory in 1149. Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (1143-1180) forced the rebellious Serbs to vassalage (1150–52) and settled some Serbian [[PoW]]s around Sofia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hungary and the Fall of Eastern Europe 1000-1568|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmZmOkfkr9oC&amp;pg=PA16|year=1988|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-85045-833-6|pages=16–|quote=John Comnenus also settled Serbian prisoners as stratioti military colonists around Izmit, while Manuel Comnenus similarly settled Serbs around Sofia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman times===
The village [[Brakevtsi]] was settled also by Serbs in late Ottoman times, after the local population had emigrated to [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Антон Страшимиров, "Книга за българите" София, Библиотека "Вечни книги на България", Изд-во "Сибия", 1995, София, стр. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 Brakevtsi was ceded to Serbia.

===19th century Bulgaria===
In the 1880 Bulgarian census, in which native language was registered, 1,894 Serbs were counted with the following Districts having a notable number of Serbian-speakers:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">'''Sex Industry Network''' (also known as '''SIN''') is a peer-based, not for profit organisation, funded by SA Health, a [[South Australia]] government organisation. Its aim is to maintain low rates of [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), [[Blood-borne disease|blood borne viruses]] (BBVs) and [[HIV]] among [[sex workers]] and their clients in South Australia.

SIN provides safer sex supplies such as [[condoms]] and [[Personal lubricant|lube]] and delivers outreach to brothels, parlours, private and street based sex workers.

==History==
SIN was formed out of the Prostitutes Association of South Australia (PASA), a group formed in 1986 by sex workers.&lt;ref name="SIN Jennings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=S.|title=Sex Industry Network – best practice sex worker organisation|url=http://pag.aids2014.org/Abstracts.aspx?AID=2116|website=pag.aids2014.prog|publisher=20th International AIDS Conference|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time community groups from priority populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users) were being funded to deliver HIV prevention information and education within communities as part of Australia’s partnership approach to HIV/AIDS. In 1987, PASA received a grant from the SA Health Commission to conduct a three-month HIV/AIDS education project with sex workers called the ‘Travelling Parlour Show’. Several sex workers received training to become ‘peer educators’ and joined with a nurse from the [[sexually transmitted infection]]s clinic and took their education and information sessions to the workplaces of sex workers across the metropolitan area of [[Adelaide]].

In 1989, PASA and the AIDS council of South Australia (ACSA) joined forces to develop an ongoing HIV/AIDS education project with the sex workers of South Australia.&lt;ref name="Scarlet Alliance SIN"&gt;{{cite web|title=June 2010 "The House of Ill Repute – 21 Years of SIN" Adelaide|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/media/News_Item.2010-05-21.4545 |website=scarletalliance.org.au|publisher=Scarlet Alliance|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has had several name changes including ‘the PASA project’ and ‘SWIPE’ but has been known as the SA Sex Industry Network or SIN since 1994.&lt;ref name="Same Memory, SA State Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Industry Page 5|url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=670|website=samememory.sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia State Library|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SIN was a founding member and continues to be an active member of [[Scarlet Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Prostitution Hope Ditmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hope Ditmore|first1=Melissa|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volume 2|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313329702|page=431|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5WyPfynlwMC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=Prostitutes+Association+of+South+Australia+%2B+PASA#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitutes%20Association%20of%20South%20Australia%20%2B%20PASA&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ACSA became insolvent and SIN was temporarily closed.&lt;ref name="Star Observer Ozturk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ozturk|first1=Serkan|title=SA Govt Forces Closure of AIDS Council|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/sa-govt-forces-closure-of-aids-council/107340|accessdate=12 October 2014|publisher=Star Observer|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet Alliance supported a group of volunteer sex workers in South Australia to keep limited services going while new arrangements were negotiated with the funding bodies. The SA health department agreed to fund  Scarlet Alliance to complete ACSA’s original contract.&lt;ref name=SWOP&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Organisations|url=http://www.swop.org.au/links|website=swop.org.au|publisher=SWOP Sex Workers Outreach Project|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political advocacy==
SIN has supported Labor MP [[Steph Key]]'s attempts to decriminalize prostitution in South Australia. In 2012, the decriminalisation bill was defeated by one vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ Selling sex in the city: Adelaide's illegal prostitution industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011002615/https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2017, an improved bill which had support of sex workers, the working women's centre and unions was introduced into the upper house. The decriminalisation of sex work bill &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/B/CURRENT/STATUTES%20AMENDMENT%20(DECRIMINALISATION%20OF%20SEX%20WORK)%20BILL%202015_HON%20MICHELLE%20LENSINK%20MLC.aspx/ Decriminalisation of Sex Work Bill (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  passed the upper house 13 votes to 8. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-06/sa-sex-work-decriminalisation-marathon-debate/8682738/ Sex work decriminalisation one step closer in South Australia after marathon debate]&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2017, the lower house was set to debate the bill, however time ran out, resulting in a further delay to any progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7859">A '''slumlord''' (or '''[[slum]] landlord''') is a derogatory term for a [[landlord]], generally an [[absentee landlord]] with more than one property, who attempts to maximize profit by minimizing spending on [[property maintenance]], often in deteriorating neighborhoods, and to tenants that they can intimidate. Severe [[Affordable housing|housing shortage]]s allow slumlords to charge higher rents, and when they can get away with it, to break rental laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-17/illegal-accommodation-network-targets-backpackers-and-students/5605572|title=Slumlords cramming 14 people into two-bedroom flats in illegal accommodation network|author=Dylan Welch|work=7.30|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=18 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney’s slum dodge landlords: Inside our city’s worst accommodation rentals|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/sydneys-slum-dodge-landlords-inside-our-citys-worst-accommodation-rentals/story-fni0cx12-1226978318360|author=Miles Godfrey|work=Daily Telegraph|date=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many of these neighborhoods are often populated by poor minorities, the term "[[ghetto]] landlord" has also been used. A "retail slumlord" is one who keeps a [[shopping mall]] in a bad shape until the government buys or confiscates it.    

The phrase ''slumlord'' first appeared in 1953, coined by Newsday Reporter Edward G. Smith,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} though the term ''slum landlord'' dates to 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/?term=slum Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
{{POV section|date=June 2015}}
Traditionally, [[real estate]] is seen as a long-term investment to most buyers. Especially in the [[developed country|developed world]], most landlords will properly maintain their properties even when doing so proves costly in the short term, in order to attract higher rents and more desirable tenants in the long run. A well-maintained property is worth more to potential buyers.

In contrast, slumlords usually do not contract with [[property management]] services, do very little or no maintenance on their property (ordinarily, just enough to meet minimum local requirements for habitability), and in turn offer low rent rates to lure tenants who will not (or cannot) pay high rent (and/or who might not pass [[background check]]s, such as persons on a sex offender registry). Slumlords of this kind typically do not enter into long-term lease agreements, doing only the minimum term required by law (e.g. month-to-month), and as such prosecute many [[eviction]]s.  It is also frequent for the slumlord to receive rent in cash to avoid disclosing it for tax purposes. Thus, in the United States, slumlords would normally not participate in government-subsidized programs such as [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]], due to the requirements both to report all income received and to keep properties well-maintained.

A slumlord may also hope that his property will eventually be purchased by a government for more money than it is worth as a part of [[urban renewal]], or by investors as the neighborhood in which it is situated undergoes [[gentrification]]. In [[Johannesburg]], regions suffering from [[urban decay]] frequently have landlords whom the government believes exploit their tenants, making them stay in buildings that fail to meet fire codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6531&amp;catid=88&amp;Itemid=266|title=Strategies to stop slumlords|date=20 April 2011|work=Joburg.org.za|publisher=City of Johannesburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, local councils deal with private landlords; without adequate scrutiny this can result in landlords being able to fill properties below rental code with subsidized tenants.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]],'' "Landlords from Hell," Channel 4, 5 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some slumlords are more interested in profit they have acquired through property "[[flipping]]," a form of [[speculation]], than they are in acquiring any profit through rental income. Slumlords with this "business model" may not maintain their properties at all or pay municipal [[property tax]]es and fines they tend to accrue in great quantities. Knowing it will take years for a municipality to condemn and seize, or possibly tear down, a property, the slumlord may count on selling it before this happens. Such slumlords may not even bother to keep up with their mortgage payments if they become equity-rich but cash-poor or if they feel that they can sell the property before it goes into foreclosure and is taken by their lender, typically a six- to eight-month process at the quickest.

===Black market renting===
In locations with [[rent control]] and where there is [[Landlord and Tenant Acts|legal protection]] of tenants, some landlords may rent out properties illegally. For instance, in the United Kingdom, there has arisen a practice of illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]],'' BBC, 4 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]],'' 30 Aug 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner. Specialised black-market dealers assist the property owners with such transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/svd-avslojar-systematisk-forsaljning-av-svartkontrakt_8146104.svd ”Hyrestvåan är din för 300 000”] (in Swedish, ”The rental one-bedroom [apartment] is yours for 300 000 [SEK]”), [[Svenska Dagbladet]], 5 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
People who have negative opinions of slumlords hold them primarily responsible for causing declining local property values and for the eventual creation of whole neighborhoods of shanty buildings. Some of these people say that slumlords leech away the "wealth" of the poor with little regard either to the future generations or the welfare of their current tenants. In effect, they thus consider slumlording a force running exactly counter to "[[gentrification]]." Whereas gentrification describes the result of a plurality of local landlords making decisive improvements to rental properties which add value to their rental units, justify hiking rent rates,  eliminate less-affluent tenants and generally raise neighborhood property values, slumlording naturally results in a gradual general decay in living conditions, public safety, neighborhood prestige, and, ultimately, property values.

Those defending slumlords assert that such property owners of poorly-maintained, declining-value properties offer a "valuable service" for those who care more about price than quality.  Economist [[David Osterfield]] wrote, "... the slumlord, regardless of his motives, helps the poor make the best of their bad situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Government, the Market and the Poor|url=http://fee.org/freeman/detail/the-government-the-market-and-the-poor|author=Osterfield, David|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tolstoyan movement''' is a [[social movement]] based on the philosophical and religious views of Russian novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828&amp;ndash;1910). Tolstoy's views were formed by rigorous study of the [[ministry of Jesus]], particularly the [[Sermon on the Mount]].

Tolstoy expressed "great joy" that groups of people "have been springing up, not only in Russia but in various parts of Europe, who are in complete agreement with our views."&lt;ref name=Historytoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/print/65306 |title=Tolstoy's Guiding Light|author=Charlotte Alston |year=2010| publisher=[[History Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author also thought it was a mistake to create a specific movement or [[doctrine]] after him, urging individuals to listen to their own [[conscience]] rather than blindly follow his. In regard to a letter he received from an adherent, he wrote:

{{quote|To speak of "Tolstoyism," to seek guidance, to inquire about my solution of questions, is a great and gross error. There has not been, nor is there any "teaching" of mine. There exists only the one eternal universal teaching of the Truth, which for me, for us, is especially clearly expressed in the Gospels...I advised this young lady to live not by my conscience, as she wished, but by her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Is Religion? And Other New Articles and Letters|author=Tolstoy, Leo |year=1878 |pages=170–172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hOdqw2dNEDkC&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22tolstoyism%22&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Beliefs and practices==
[[File:Tolstoy organising famine relief in Samara, 1891.jpg|thumb|Tolstoy organising famine relief in Samara, 1891.]]
[[:Category:Tolstoyans|Tolstoyans]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]:''Толстовцы'', ''Tolstovtsy'') identify themselves as [[Christian]]s, but do not generally belong to an institutional [[Christian Church|Church]]. Tolstoy was a harsh critic of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], leading to his [[excommunication]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;''Church and State''. L Tolstoy&amp;nbsp;— On Life and Essays on Religion, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoyans tend to focus more on following the [[Ministry of Jesus|teachings of Jesus]], rather than on his [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]] or [[divinity]].

They attempt to live an [[asceticism|ascetic]] and [[simple living|simple life]], preferring to be [[vegetarian]], non-smoking, [[Teetotalism|teetotal]] and [[chastity|chaste]]. Tolstoyans are considered [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifists]] and advocate [[nonresistance]] in all circumstances. Tolstoy's understanding of what it means to be Christian was defined by the Sermon on the Mount and summed up in five simple propositions:
# [[Love your enemies]]
# Do not be angry
# Do not fight evil with evil, but return evil with good (an interpretation of [[turning the other cheek]])
# Do not lust
# Do not take oaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tolstoyan Nonresistance |author=Gerard Bane |url= |newspaper=A Pinch of Salt (Issue 23)|date=2011|page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They do not support or participate in the [[government]] which they consider immoral, violent and corrupt. Tolstoy rejected the state (as it only exists on the basis of physical force) and all institutions that are derived from it - the police, law courts and army. Thus, many now regard them as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=17–20 |url= |quote=Leo Tolstoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Tolstoy's ideas have had some influence on [[anarchist]] thought, specifically on [[anarcho-pacifism]].  They were also cited as an inspiration by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] in the formation of his own philosophy of nonviolence from both [[Jainism and Hinduism]].

===Vegetarianism===
The [[History of vegetarianism|vegetarian movement]] started in Europe in the 19th century. The first [[Vegetarian Society]] was founded in Manchester in 1847. Tolstoy became a prominent influence on the movement. He became vegetarian, along with his two daughters in 1885. His relevant essay ''The First Step'' (1892),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Tolstoy |first= Leo |authorlink= Leo Tolstoy |title= The First Step |year= 1892 |accessdate= 2016-05-21 |url= http://www.ivu.org/history/tolstoy/the_%20first_step.html |quote= ... if [a man] be really and seriously seeking to live a good life, the first thing from which he will abstain will always be the use of animal food, because ... its use is simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to the moral feeling -- killing}}. Preface to the Russian translation of [[Howard Williams (humanitarian)|Howard William's]] [http://www.ivu.org/history/williams/index.html ''The Ethics of Diet'']&lt;/ref&gt; and others were promoted by vegetarian societies internationally.

His vegetarianism was part of a Christian  philosophy of non-violence that he developed. At that time, vegetarian restaurants were few, and they often served as meeting spaces for Tolstoyans, and other social reformers. The movement was mostly [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|ovo-lacto vegetarian]] at the time.

According to the medical science at the time, mostly influenced by German medicine, vegetarianism was seen as unhealthy. On the other hand, the vegetarians usually highlighted the physical strength and sporting abilities of vegetarians.&lt;ref&gt;CHARLOTTE ALSTON, [http://theibtaurisblog.com/2014/06/09/tolstoy-and-vegetarianism/ Tolstoy and Vegetarianism.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groups and colonies==

===Africa===
[[File:Gandhi Tolstoy Farm.jpg|thumb|Mohandas K. Gandhi and other residents of Tolstoy Farm, 1910]]
[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] set up a cooperative colony called Tolstoy Farm near [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, having been inspired by Tolstoy's ideas. The colony comprising {{convert|1,100|acre|km2}} was funded by the Gandhian [[Herman Kallenbach]] and placed at the disposal of the [[Satyagraha|satyagrahis]] from 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tolstoyfarm.com/the_past.htm |title=Tolstoy Farm|publisher=South African Historical Journal, No. 7|date=November 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===America===
[[Ernest Howard Crosby]] was a notable Tolstoyan in the United States. He was a supporter of the Christian Commonwealth Colony in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which was established in 1896 by a number of [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]] and comprised {{convert|932|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapiro.anthro.uga.edu/Lamar/images/PDFs/publication_90.pdf|title=Commonwealth, Georgia|publisher=The Georgia Archaeological Site File (GASF)|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509081527/http://shapiro.anthro.uga.edu/Lamar/images/PDFs/publication_90.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents were also influenced by the views of [[Henry George]] and [[Edward Bellamy]].&lt;ref name=Historytoday /&gt;

===Europe===
In Russia censorship meant that many of Tolstoy’s non-fiction works in the 1880s and 1890s were published abroad first, either in Russian or in translation, delaying the author's influence in his country of birth. However, with [[Vladimir Chertkov]] (1854&amp;ndash;1936) as a key promoter of Tolstoy's ideas, a movement started over the 1890s. The movement continued to grow after the writer’s death and was at its strongest in the years immediately following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolutions of 1917]] with agricultural communities established in the provinces of [[Smolensk Oblast|Smolensk]], [[Tver Oblast|Tver]], [[Samara Oblast|Samara]], [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]], [[Perm Oblast|Perm]] and [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]]. The Tolstoyan communities that proliferated between 1917 and 1921 were eventually wiped out or stripped of their independence as [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation]] and ideological purges got under way in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name=Historytoday /&gt; Colonies, such as the [[Life and Labor Commune]], relocated to [[Siberia]] to avoid being liquidated. Several Tolstoyan leaders, including [[Yakov Dragunovsky]] (1886-1937), were put on trial and then sent to the [[Gulag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Chatfield]], [[Ruzanna Iliukhina]] ''Peace/Mir: An Anthology of Historic Alternatives to War'' 	Syracuse University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0815626010}},  (p.245, 249-250).&lt;/ref&gt;

In England John Coleman Kenworthy of the [[Brotherhood Church]] established a colony at [[Purleigh]], [[Essex]] in 1896. This community closed a few years later but its residents spawned the [[Whiteway Colony]] in Gloucestershire and [[Stapleton Colony]] in Yorkshire, both of which are still going today.&lt;ref name=Historytoday /&gt; Although given Whiteway soon abandoned Tolstoy's principles, it has been regarded by many, including [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] who visited in 1909, as a failed Tolstoyan experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An American looks at Gandhi: essays in satyagraha, civil rights, and peace|author=Hunt, James D.|year=2005|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNvTdX52nw8C&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=blackburn%20colony%20tolstoyan&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:nl:Johannes van der Veer|Johannes van der Veer]] was the key figure in the Dutch Tolstoyan movement. In the Netherlands two colonies were started, a short-lived one at [[Bussum]] in [[North Holland]] and a more successful one at nearby [[Blaricum]].&lt;ref name=Historytoday /&gt; The reasons attributed to the failure of Tolstoyan communities across Europe have included the personal incompatibility of the participants and a general lack of practical agricultural experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page=257 |pages= |url= |quote=Tolstoyism and Tolstoyan colonies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent followers==
One of the prominent followers of Tolstoy was the celebrated philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. His interest in Tolstoy began in the First World War after he read his book, ''The Gospel in Brief''. He carried this book with him everywhere and recommended it to others.

In particular, the pacifism of Tolstoy was very influential.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Alexander Fodor]] wrote, "We know that [Tolstoy’s] pacificism, his advocacy of passive resistance to evil through nonviolent means, has had incalculable influence on pacificist movements in general and on the philosophical and social views and programs of Mahatma Gandhi, [[Martin Luther King]], and [[Cesar Chavez]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everseradio.com/ernest-hilberts-introduction-to-the-maude-translation-of-leo-tolstoys-war-and-peace-issued-as-part-of-the-canterbury-classics-series/ Ernest Hilbert’s Introduction to the Maude Translation of Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.] TOLSTOY, Leo. War and Peace, translated by Aylmer and Louise Maude. San Diego: Canterbury Classics / Baker and Taylor, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another prominent follower of Tolstoy's teachings was [[Dorothy Day]], an American social activist, and a founder of the pacifist [[Catholic Worker Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter G. Moss, [http://www.wisdompage.com/WisdomFromRussia.doc WISDOM FROM RUSSIA: THE PERSPECTIVES OF DOROTHY DAY AND THOMAS MERTON. (DOC file)] 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of '''women in Vietnam''' was subject to many changes throughout the [[history of Vietnam]]. They have taken on varying roles in society, including warriors, nurses, mothers and wives. There have been many advances in [[women's rights]] in [[Vietnam]], such as an increase in women representation in government, as well as the creation of the [[Vietnam Women's Union]] in 1930.

Many scholars state that Vietnam was a dominantly [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] society prior to Chinese rule, which brought in [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] values.&lt;ref name="VietAmCatholics-p32" /&gt; Although Chinese rule for the most part ended before the 2nd century, most of the Chinese values and institutions were continued by following Vietnamese dynasties. During the 19th century, Vietnam was dominated by [[French Indochina|French rule]]. Many women were temporarily married to European men during this period, with both parties seeing the union as mutually beneficial.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments rose in Vietnam that eventually led to the end of French rule in 1954 and divided Vietnam into two along the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|seventeenth parallel]].&lt;ref name="vietventures.com" /&gt; There have been many accounts that nationalism increased women's rights with it, and many women participated in the revolution against French rule.&lt;ref name="Turley" /&gt;

The role of women in warfare and outside the home continued to increase throughout the 20th century, especially during the [[Indochina Wars]]. During and after the [[Vietnam War]], the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] made efforts to increase women's rights, equity, and representation in government. This included the creation of job quotas during the 1960s, which required that women occupy a certain percentage of jobs in different sectors.&lt;ref name="Werner" /&gt;

Women's rights have continued to increase in contemporary Vietnam, and women have increasingly held leadership positions. Currently, [[Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh]] is the first woman to be acting President of Vietnam, following the death of [[Trần Đại Quang]]. Additionally, [[Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân]] was elected as [[Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam|Chairwoman]] of the [[National Assembly (Vietnam)|National Assembly of Vietnam]] in March 2016, the first time a woman has ever held the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/vietnam-elects-first-chairwoman-parliament-032726345.html?ref=gs|title=Vietnam elects first chairwoman of parliament|access-date=2016-10-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026001454/https://www.yahoo.com/news/vietnam-elects-first-chairwoman-parliament-032726345.html?ref=gs|archivedate=2016-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://baoapbac.vn/english/politics/201603/nguyen-thi-kim-ngan-elected-as-first-woman-national-assembly-chair-670031/|title=Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan elected as first woman National Assembly chair|newspaper=Báo Ấp Bắc|access-date=2016-10-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026231227/http://baoapbac.vn/english/politics/201603/nguyen-thi-kim-ngan-elected-as-first-woman-national-assembly-chair-670031/|archivedate=2016-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still an influence of gender roles and cultural influence in Vietnam today, which persists both inside the domestic home as well as outside in the socioeconomic sphere.

==History before the Vietnam War==

===Early history and Chinese rule===
According to William S. Turley, "the role of women in traditional Vietnamese culture was determined [partly] by&amp;nbsp;... indigenous customs bearing traces of matriarchy",&lt;ref name="WomenCommunRevVietnam-p793n1"&gt;Turley, William S., ''Women in the Communist Revolution in Vietnam'', in ''Asian Survey'', vol. 12, no. 9, September, 1972, p.&amp;nbsp;793 n.&amp;nbsp;1 (DOI 10.2307/2642829) (author asst. prof. gov't, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), in ''JStor'', as accessed December 29, 2013 (database){{Subscription or libraries}}.&lt;/ref&gt; affecting "different social classes"&lt;ref name="WomenCommunRevVietnam-p793n1" /&gt; to ying degrees".&lt;ref name="WomenCommunRevVietnam-p793n1" /&gt; According to Chiricosta, the legend of [[Âu Cơ]] is said to be evidence of "the presence of an original 'matriarchy' in North Vietnam and [it] led to the [[kinship#Descent rules|double kinship system]], which developed there&amp;nbsp;.... [and which] combined matrilineal and patrilineal patterns of family structure and assigned equal importance to both lines."&lt;ref&gt;Chiricosta, Alessandra, ''Following the Trail of the Fairy-Bird: The Search For a Uniquely Vietnamese Women's Movement'', in Roces, Mina, &amp; Louise P. Edwards, eds., ''Women's Movements in Asia'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;125 and see p.&amp;nbsp;126 (single quotation marks so in original).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[North Vietnam]], sovereign state until merged with South Vietnam in 1976}}{{Efn|[[Patrilineality|Patrilineal]], belonging to the father's lineage, generally for inheritance}}

In 111 B.C., Chinese armies claimed the territory called Nam Viet and tried to integrate it into the Han Empire. During this time, [[Confucianism]] was the official ideology, the Chinese language was primarily spoken, and the Chinese occupation had enormous influence on literature and art creations.&lt;ref name="vietventures.com"/&gt; However, there was resistance to the Chinese rule. According to [[Peter C. Phan]], that "the first three persons leading insurrections against China were women&amp;nbsp;... {{Nowrap|suggest[s]&amp;nbsp;...}} that ancient Vietnam was a matriarchal society"&lt;ref&gt;Phan, Peter C., ''Vietnamese-American Catholics'' (New York or Mahwah, New Jersey: Paulist Press, 2005 ({{ISBN|0-8091-4352-6}})), p.&amp;nbsp;12 and see pp.&amp;nbsp;13 &amp; 32 (author prof. Catholic social thought, Georgetown Univ.) (the "three persons" apparently being the sisters Trung Trac and Trung Nhi in A.D. 40, per p.&amp;nbsp;12, &amp; Trieu Au in A.D. 248, per p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;/ref&gt; and "the ancient Vietnamese family system was most likely matriarchal, with women ruling over the clan or tribe"&lt;ref name="VietAmCatholics-p32"&gt;Phan, Peter C., ''Vietnamese-American Catholics'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; until the Vietnamese {{Nowrap|"adopt[ed]&amp;nbsp;...}} the patriarchal system introduced by the Chinese",&lt;ref name="VietAmCatholics-p32" /&gt; although "this patriarchal system&amp;nbsp;... was not able to dislodge the Vietnamese women from their relatively high position in the family and society, especially among the peasants and the lower classes",&lt;ref name="VietAmCatholics-p32" /&gt; with modern "culture and legal codes&amp;nbsp;... [promoting more] rights and privileges" for women than in Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Phan, Peter C., ''Vietnamese-American Catholics'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiricosta said that other scholars relied on "this 'matriarchal' aspect of the myth to differentiate Vietnamese society from the pervasive spread of Chinese Confucian patriarchy"&lt;ref&gt;Roces, Mina, &amp; Louise P. Edwards, eds., ''Women's Movements in Asia'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;125 and see p.&amp;nbsp;125 n.&amp;nbsp;2 (single quotation marks so in original).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Confucianism]], ethics and philosophy derived from Confucius}} and that "resistance to China's colonization of Vietnam&amp;nbsp;... [combined with] the view that Vietnam was originally a matriarchy&amp;nbsp;... [led to viewing] women's struggles for liberation from (Chinese) patriarchy as a metaphor for the entire nation's struggle for Vietnamese independence."&lt;ref&gt;Roces, Mina, &amp; Louise P. Edwards, eds., ''Women's Movements in Asia'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;125 (parentheses so in original).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karen G. Turner, in the 3rd century A.D., [[Lady Triệu]] {{Nowrap|"seem[ed]&amp;nbsp;...}} to personify the matriarchal culture that mitigated Confucianized  patriarchal norms&amp;nbsp;.... [although] she is also painted as something of a freak&amp;nbsp;... with her&amp;nbsp;... savage, violent streak."&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Karen G., ''"Vietnam" as a Women's War'', in Young, Marilyn B., &amp; Robert Buzzanco, eds., ''A Companion to the Vietnam War'' (Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, hardback 2002 ({{ISBN|0-631-21013-X}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96 but see p.&amp;nbsp;107 (author Turner prof. history, Holy Cross College, &amp; sr. research fellow, East Asian legal studies, Harvard Law School).&lt;/ref&gt; A female military leader who managed, for a time, to successfully resist the Chinese state of Eastern Wu during its occupation of Vietnam, she is quoted as saying, "''I'd like to ride storms, kill [[Killer whale|sharks]] in [[South China Sea|the open sea]], drive out the aggressors, reconquer the country, undo the ties of serfdom, and never bend my back to be the concubine of whatever man.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[:vi:Nguyễn Khắc Viện]] (1913-1997), ''Vietnam, a long history'', The Gioi Publishers, reprinted 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helle Rydstrøm -Embodying Morality: Growing Up in Rural Northern Vietnam - Page 179 2003 "Among the Chinese, Trieu Thi Trinh was portrayed as a monster with three-meter long breasts and riding an elephant .."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trưng sisters===
{{Main|Trưng Sisters}}
In A.D. 40, the [[Trưng Sisters]] Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị led a rebellion to get rid of Tô Định, the corrupt Chinese governor occupying Vietnam. They were daughters of a Lạc lord in Giao Chỉ (now Northern Vietnam) and widows of aristocrats. They successfully formed their own kingdom in [[Mê Linh]], where Trưng Trắc was proclaimed queen, and a capital was built for her".&lt;ref name="TrungSisRebelGrndWarIntntnlEncyc-p898c1" /&gt; While ruling in Mê Linh, the sisters abolished taxes, which had been especially cruel under Tô Định. They were defeated in A.D. 43 by [[Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)|Ma Yuan]], a Chinese general, but are still regarded as female military heroes and national heroines.&lt;ref name="Womack"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sarah Womack |year=1995 |title=The remakings of a legend: women and patriotism in the hagiography of the Tru'ng sisters |journal=Crossroads |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=31–50 |jstor=40860533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Donald M. Seekins, an indication of "the strength of matriarchal values"&lt;ref name="TrungSisRebelGrndWarIntntnlEncyc-p898c1"&gt;Seekins, Donald M., "Trung Sisters, Rebellion of (39–43)", in Sandler, Stanley, ed., ''Ground Warfare: An International Encyclopedia'' (Santa Barbara California: ABC-Clio, hardcover 2002 ({{ISBN|1-57607-344-0}})), vol. 3, p.&amp;nbsp;898, col. 1 (author of Seekins of Meio University).&lt;/ref&gt; was that a woman, Trưng Trắc, with her younger sister Trưng Nhị, raised an army of "over 80,000 soldiers&amp;nbsp;.... [in which] many of her officers were women",&lt;ref name="TrungSisRebelGrndWarIntntnlEncyc-p898c1" /&gt; with which they defeated the Chinese.&lt;ref name="TrungSisRebelGrndWarIntntnlEncyc-p898c1" /&gt; According to Keith Weller Taylor, "the matriarchal flavor of the time is&amp;nbsp;... attested by the fact that Trưng Trắc's mother's tomb and spirit temple have survived, although nothing remains of her father",&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith Weller, ''The Birth of Vietnam'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983 ({{ISBN|0-520-04428-2}})), p.&amp;nbsp;39 (n.&amp;nbsp;176 omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; and the "society of the Trung sisters" was "strongly matrilineal".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotations: Taylor, Keith Weller, ''The Birth of Vietnam'', ''op. cit.'', p.&amp;nbsp;338.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, even though the Trưng sisters are remembered for their military skills and bravery, they have also been used to confirm women's societal role in a different manner. Some historians have focused on their physical beauty and emphasized their devotion to family as well as Trưng Trắc's romantic relationship with her husband, Lạc lord Thi Sach.&lt;ref name="Womack"/&gt; As an iconic symbol of Vietnamese patriotism, they were used to show how weak Vietnamese men are even in comparison to Vietnamese women, as the Vietnamese men under Tô Định "bowed their heads, folded their arms, and served the northerners; how shameful is this in comparison with the two Trung sisters, who were women!"&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Sï Liên, Dai Viet sir ky toàn thw, 3, lb. Cited in ''The Birth of Vietnam'' by Keith Weiler Taylor (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ma Yuan's defeat of the Trưng sisters, the Chinese maintained domination over Vietnam for more than a thousand years. They established a bureaucracy that emphasized Confucianism, and they focused on educating Vietnam's ruling class with Chinese literature and ideas.&lt;ref name="Womack"/&gt; Chinese rule ended in 939 AD when the Vietnamese army, under the direction of [[Ngô Quyền]], defeated the Chinese army, which was already troubled by chaos within China.&lt;ref name="vietventures.com"&gt;[http://vietventures.com/Vietnam/history_vietnam.asp "Vietnam History, People, Economy, Geography, Government."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730201524/http://www.vietventures.com/vietnam/history_vietnam.asp |date=2014-07-30 }} N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lý dynasty]] was established in 1010, and ruled until 1225. The Ly dynasty continued many of the political, social, and economic institutions that were imposed by the country's former Chinese rulers. For example, only males of the noble class could attend school and become members of the civil service. The Vietnamese continued to fight against Chinese influence, but in 1407 the country was once again under Chinese Rule. They re-won independence in 1428, when the Vietnamese [[Lê dynasty]] was created.&lt;ref name="vietventures.com"/&gt;

===European rule===
France desired trading freedom in Vietnam. They also wanted to bring more missionaries into the country. The Nguyen dynasty disliked French involvement in Vietnam, and executed several missionaries and Vietnamese coverts. This spurred the French Emperor, [[Napoleon III]], to attack Vietnam and attempt to force the court to accept the title of "French protectorate." The French were successful despite the resistance they encountered, and by the 1880s Vietnam was officially a French [[protectorate]].&lt;ref name="vietventures.com"/&gt;

Vietnamese women were often married to European men. This was particularly true in the upper-class, where marriage to a European male was seen as an opportunity for advancement. Often, this marriage was a temporary arrangement. A Vietnamese women married a European man for a certain amount of time. Since objects like clothes, coins, or jewelry were given in exchange for sex, women could make a profit in this way. When their European husband left, the woman were often remarried. This was seen as a profitable arrangement for most parties. In fact, Vietnamese nobles had "thought it no Shame or Disgrace to marry their daughters to English and Dutch Seamen, for the Time they were to stay in Tonquin, and often presented their Son in Law pretty hand- somely at their departure, especially if they left their Wives with Child."&lt;ref name="Andaya"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbara Andaya |year=1998 |title=From temporary wife to prostitute: sexuality and economic change in Early Modern Southeast Asia |journal=[[Journal of Women's History]] |volume=9 |pages=11–34 |doi= 10.1353/jowh.2010.0225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the marriage and subsequent departure of a foreign husband was seen as an opportunity for social advancement, and there wasn't a stigma surrounding the "abandoned wife." There was almost an aura surrounding a woman who married a foreign man, rather than a stigma. It was believed that "When [a trader] wants to depart he gives whatever is promised, and so they leave each other in friendship and she may then look for another man as she wishes in all propriety, without scandal."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;0H. A. van Foreest and A. de Booy, eds., De Vierde Schipvaart derNederlanders naar Oost-IndiÃ" onder Jacob Wilkens en Jacob van Neck (1599-1604) (The Hague: Linschoten Vereeniging, 1980), 223; and Hamilton, A New Account, 2:115.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to many historians, European men perceived Southeast Asian women as beautiful, but immodest and not concerned with chastity.&lt;ref&gt;9 Edward H. Schäfer, The Vermilion Bird: Tang Images of the South (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), 80; Blair and Robertson, eds., The Philippine Islands, 97-98; and Dampier, A New Voyage, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; This facilitated an environment more open to rape and abduction. European religious leaders began blaming East Asian women for being prostitutes, and the temporary marriages came to be seen as shameful instead of honorable. They were labeled as "prostitutes" and assumed to be of the lower-classes. Historian Barbara Andaya said that although "well into the nineteenth century Europeans continued to take [[concubines]], the tendency to see concubines akin to prostitutes meant that the standing of the temporary wife had been fundamentally eroded." &lt;ref name="Andaya"/&gt;

===Vietnamese Nationalist movement===
In 1930, urban intellectual elites began to talk about women's ability to escape their confined social sphere through novels like Nhat Linh's Noan Tuyet, in which the heroine escapes from a marriage she was coerced into and wins social approval for it. The heroine's true love was a member of the nationalist party.  According to this book and other authors like Phan Boi Chau, there was an evident link between the nationalist movement and an increase in women's rights. Following the nationalist military leadership of the Trung sisters, other women became heavily involved in non-communist nationalist movements, especially in the Vietnam Nationalist Party. By the end of the 1930s, women's liberation had become a common topic in the literature written by urban intellectual elites, and women had entered political life.&lt;ref name="Turley"&gt;Turley, William S. "Women in the Communist Revolution in Vietnam." Asian Survey 12.9 (1972): 793-805. JSTOR. Web. 30 Mar. 2014. &lt;{{cite journal |jstor=2642829 |title=Archived copy }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lao Dong party (Vietnam Worker's Party) was created in 1945 after the Indochinese Party was dissolved. It was led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] until his death, and controlled the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Lao Dong Party claims to have advanced women's rights by publicizing Vietnamese women's achievements and allowing women to serve in the government and [[communist]] delegations. The party advocated and pushed for greater equality between the sexes, and said that the prior wave of women's liberation movements in the upper bourgeoisie during the 1930s was more of an advocacy for quick divorce, and did not attempt to liberate women as a whole.&lt;ref name="Turley"/&gt; It said,

"petty-bourgeois feminists reduced the cause of the inequality of the sexes and the bondage of women to economic dependence. They timidly suggested that the woman be trained in certain trades 'in keeping with her femininity and not detrimental to her mission as a mother.' (Dam Phuong, The Woman and the Family, 1929). This 'sacred mission' was in fact but domestic slavery, the drudgrey that was the lot of women in patriarchal families, which the feminists did not dare to oppose. And they hardly dared to mention this 'risky' question: that of liberation from foreign rule."&lt;ref&gt;Dam Phuong, The Woman and the Family, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationalist movements like the Lao Dong Party used the liberation of women to show where they planned to lead the country and emphasized the poor rights for women during colonial rule and under French influence. These nationalist movements stressed the idea that women were oppressed under the French occupation and espoused the idea that liberation for women could only come through a nationalist revolution. They recognized that gender equality was an issue that cut across social lines and could be used to build nationalist support. However, when the Party Central Committee was asked to rank the ten "essential tasks of the revolution," it ranked equal rights for women as ninth and its stance on women's rights was intentionally vague.&lt;ref name="Turley"/&gt;

Even so, women did participate in the revolution against the French that occupied Vietnam. They served as nurses, guides, couriers, and propagandists. Although they were not allowed in the regular army, they fought in militia and guerrilla units on the home front. The slogan for women in the Resistance was "Let women replace men in all tasks in the rear, which was an accurate description of their main role in the Revolution- laboring in the agricultural sector as Vietnamese men fought for Vietnam's independence from the French. The Revolution did not result in immediate empowerment, as only 10 of the 403 seats in the 1946 -1960 Nationalist Assemblies were occupied by women. It did spread feminist ideology, however.&lt;ref name="Turley"/&gt;

The French left Vietnam in 1954, after an eight-year war that split Vietnam in half at the seventeenth parallel. The Vietminh were in the North, and the French and those who supported them were in the south. The North became a communist society, while the South was anti-communist and received support from the United States. Rising unrest in the South, because of religious and social intolerance by President Ngo Dinh Diem, created an opportunity for North Vietnam to try reclaiming the South. This led to a long and bloody conflict, in which American troops became very involved. In 1975, the Communist government was able to take over South Vietnam, despite the American bombing of Northern cities. This division did not remain for long, though, and the two sides were united in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976.

==Vietnam War (1955–1975)==
{{Main|Vietnam War}}

===Gender relations before the Vietnam War===
The Woman's Union of the 1930s pushed for women's interests and managed to extend paid maternity leave for government employees. The Woman's Union also received a governmental guarantee that they would be consulted before the government implemented any policies that could affect women's health.&lt;ref name="Andaya"/&gt; The Woman's Union is one of the few organizations that pushed for such change, and they experienced pushback on their efforts. The paid maternity leave for government employees, which was extended from three to six months, was changed back to three months a few years after its passing. Vietnam was slowly extending greater rights to females. In 1949, the state of Vietnam was created during the first Indochina War, in which Vietnam attempted to gain independence from France. A move towards equality was evident in the original constitution of the 1949 Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which stated that "women are equal to men in all respects." The Constitution also contained clauses calling for paid maternity leave and equal pay for equal work. The 1959 Marriage and Family Law made further progress as it worked on ending systems of concubines, child marriage and forced marriage. While these changes occurred in large part because socialist leaders wanted women to be able to work in the industrial and agricultural sectors, they did promote rapid change in women's traditional roles. Under the socialist regime, both male and female literacy increased.&lt;ref name="Goodkind, Daniel 1995"&gt;Goodkind, Daniel. "Rising gender inequality in Vietnam since reunification." Pacific Affairs (1995): 342-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in war===
Women played a significant role in defending Vietnam during the [[Indochina Wars]] from 1945 to 1975. They took roles such as village patrol guards, intelligence agents, propagandists, and military recruiters.  Historically, women have become "active participants" in struggles to liberate their country from foreign occupation, from Chinese to French colonialists. This character and spirit of Vietnamese women were first exemplified by the conduct of the Trung sisters, one of the "first historical figures" in the [[history of Vietnam]] who revolted against [[First Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese control]].

North Vietnamese women were enlisted and fought in the combat zone and provided manual labor to keep the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] open. They also worked in the rice fields in North Vietnam and Viet Cong-held farming areas in South Vietnam's Mekong Delta region to provide food for their families and the communist war effort. Women were enlisted in both the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong guerrilla insurgent force in South Vietnam. Some women also served for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong intelligence services. In South Vietnam, many women voluntarily serve in the [[ARVN]]'s Women's Armed Force Corps (WAFC) and various other Women's corps in the military. Some, like in the WAFC, fought in combat with other soldiers. Others have served as nurses and doctors in the battlefield and in military hospitals, or served in South Vietnam or America's intelligence agencies.

During the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] Vietnamese women were used for propaganda images on both sides, as the Vietnamese released pictures of Vietnamese women militia with captured Chinese male troops while the Chinese released pictures of injured Vietnamese women prisoners being treated well by Chinese. The Chinese held 1,636 Vietnamese prisoners and the Vietnamese held 238 Chinese prisoners; they were exchanged in May–June 1979.&lt;ref name="Chan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjMiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+five+operations+in+May+and+June,+all+detainees+(1,636+Vietnamese+and+238+Chinese)+were+repatriated+under+the&amp;dq=In+five+operations+in+May+and+June,+all+detainees+(1,636+Vietnamese+and+238+Chinese)+were+repatriated+under+the&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ktiwU4HtOaq-8gHtuIGAAw&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA|title=China and international organizations: participation in non-governmental organizations since 1971|first=Gerald|last=Chan|year=1989|edition=illustrated|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=|location=|isbn=0195827384|page=80|pages=|quote=|accessdate=May 22, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919180109/http://books.google.com/books?id=KjMiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+five+operations+in+May+and+June,+all+detainees+(1,636+Vietnamese+and+238+Chinese)+were+repatriated+under+the&amp;dq=In+five+operations+in+May+and+June,+all+detainees+(1,636+Vietnamese+and+238+Chinese)+were+repatriated+under+the&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ktiwU4HtOaq-8gHtuIGAAw&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA|archivedate=September 19, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Military Law Review"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=19iwU8vFM8ee8gGc7oBY&amp;id=Okda-jGljS4C&amp;dq=by+the+national+Red+Cross+societies+of+the+two+countries+had+been+carried+out%2C+with+1%2C636+Vietnamese+and238+Chinese&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=1%2C636+|title=Military Law Review, Volumes 119-122|volume=Volumes 27-100 of DA pam|others=Contributors United States.

The 238 Chinese male soldiers surrendered after getting separated from their main unit during the withdrawal from Vietnam and became surrounded by Vietnamese. After surrendering, they were transferred by the Vietnamese soldiers to a prison. The Chinese prisoners reported that they were subjected to torturous and inhuman treatment, such as being blindfolded and having their bodies bound and restrained with metal wire. Vietnamese women soldiers made up one-third of the guards who held the Chinese male prisoners captive in the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tibet.woeser.com/?p=34974|title=民 间 藏 事 » 转:突围——我的中越战争回忆录（有图）|work=woeser.com|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429104004/http://tibet.woeser.com/?p=34974|archivedate=29 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese arranged for foreign journalists to take photographs of Chinese male soldiers held captive by Vietnamese women militia with Type-56 rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.360doc.com/content/12/0330/15/39427_199314840.shtml |title=突围：我的中越战争回忆录 |website=360doc.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2016-06-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817230526/http://www.360doc.com/content/12/0330/15/39427_199314840.shtml |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vietnam News Agency|Vietnam Pictorial]] published a collage contrasting a photo of a Vietnamese female fighter and a Chinese male prisoner with an earlier photo of a Vietnamese female fighter and American male prisoner for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthedarkroom.org/coldwarcamera/gulliver-and-the-guerrilla|title=In The Darkroom|work=inthedarkroom.org|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511050215/http://inthedarkroom.org/coldwarcamera/gulliver-and-the-guerrilla|archivedate=11 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's roles during the Vietnam War===
{{Main|Women in the Vietnam War}}
Vietnam split into two parts, North and South Vietnam, in 1954. The revolutionary socialist government in the North wanted to enhance social equity, sometimes by improving women's rights. The 1960 Marriage and Family Law, for example, banned forced marriage, child marriage, wife beating, and concubinage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mai, T., and T. Le. Women in Vietnam. N.p.: Hanoi: Foreign Languages House, n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The regime also focused on moving women outside of the home. They did this for the purpose of industrial development. They promoted the power of the Women's Union, which pushed for women's rights but also rallied support for the Communist government's new laws. The government of North Vietnam influenced the role of women during the war of reunification during the mid-1960s, when mobilizing women was viewed as crucial to winning the war. During this time, the Women's Union encouraged women to fulfill three main responsibilities. These were: encouraging their male relatives to fight in the war, taking all of the household burdens on themselves, and taking jobs in the industrial and agricultural workforces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1967, the Communist Party's Central Committee called for formal quotas in employment.&lt;ref name="Werner"/&gt; The commission asked that women occupy at least 35 percent of all jobs, and 50-70 percent of jobs in education. Most of these quotas were filled by the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[Vietnam War]] lasted from 1956 to 1975. In 1967, with the Vietnam War well under way, the Communist Party's Central Committee in North Vietnam passed resolution 153. This resolution passed formal job quotas, requiring women to hold a minimum of 35% of all jobs and 50–70% of job in the educational sector. They passed this resolution because, with so many Vietnamese men away at war, they needed more women to support the economy.&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;Jayne Werner, "Women, Socialism, and the Economy of Wartime North Vietnam," Studies in Comparative Communism, vol. 16 (1981), pp. 165-90. {{doi|10.1016/0039-3592(81)90005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar infiltration occurred in the political arena, where the "percentage of women on people's councils, the major administrative bodies, increased at the provincial, district, and commune levels from 22.8, 20.8, and 16.5 percent in 1965 to 34.8, 40.0, and 40.9 percent by 1972." Although this was the greatest involvement of women in the political sphere in Vietnam's history, men maintained their hold on leadership positions across the board, not only in the political arena. When the war ended, female involvement decreased, actually sinking below its pre-war involvement rates.&lt;ref name="Goodkind, Daniel 1995"/&gt;

Several laws influenced women's rights in the time period following the Vietnam war and reunification. The Family Law of 1986 doubled the length of [[maternity leave]] from three to six months, while the 1988 Council of Minster's Decision number 163 gave the Women's Union the right to be involved in any decision relevant to the welfare of women or children. However, the desire for economic efficiency under the free market reforms of the new regime caused some of these reforms to be scaled back. Maternity leave, for example, was shortened to four months when employers began complaining that they lost money by hiring women. There are no other organizations like the Women's Union, as the Vietnamese government is very careful about the nongovernmental organizations they allow to exist. The Vietnamese Women's Association exists largely to increase the power of the Communist Party, so it is not always able to fully support women's interests.&lt;ref name="Goodkind, Daniel 1995"/&gt;

===Gender relations in post-war Vietnam===
In Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s, the newly-powerful socialists promoted equal access to education for men and women. The reunification of North and South Vietnam after the Vietnam War, in 1976, also allowed women to take on leadership roles in politics.&lt;ref name="Goodkind, Daniel 1995"/&gt; One author said that Vietnam during the 1980s was "a place where, after exhausting work and furious struggle, women can be confident that they travel the path which will some day arrive at their liberation."&lt;ref&gt;Arlene Eisen, Women and Revolution in Vietnam (London: Zed Books, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some historians have argued that women's advocates in Vietnam "have been weakened in the post-reunification era due in part to the implementation of free market reforms in a nondemocratic political context."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goodkind, Daniel|title=The Vietnamese Double Marriage Squeeze |journal=International Migration Review|volume=31.1|date=1997|pages=108–127|jstor=2547260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resource constraints were detrimnental to women's rights, as was the political atmosphere after the war. The new state implemented free market economics but political participation was not expanded. The tight political atmosphere and resource-constraints weakened the Vietnam Women's Union, which was accustomed to speaking on behalf of women under Vietnam's single-party rule. After the war was over, it was no longer seen as a crucial organization by the government.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Political reunification also resulted in the end of the quota system and the subsequent decrease in women in the National Assembly. There was also an increase in [[occupational segregation]] as women returned to more roles within the home and men returned from the war.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, S. Country Gender Analysis: Vietnam. Hanoi: Swedish International Development Authority, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Free-market policies known as the [[Đổi Mới]] put female-headed households in rural areas at a disadvantage by limiting their access to credit.&lt;ref&gt;Tran, T. "The Direct Loan of Capital from the Bank to Develop Production and Gender Equality." Vietnam Social Sciences. N.p.: n.p., 1992. 25-36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in contemporary society==
[[File:VNese country wedding.jpg|thumb|310x310px|Traditional Vietnamese country wedding ceremony]]Women occupy both the domestic and outside sector in contemporary Vietnam. Women's participation in the economy, government, and society has increased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the domestic sphere, little progress has been made to improve gender relations. Traditional [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] values have continued to persist, as well as a continued emphasis on the family unit. This has comprised the main criticism of Vietnam Women's Union, an organization that works towards advancing women's rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, recent shifts in Vietnam's [[Human sex ratio|sex ratio]] show an increased number of men outnumbering women, which many researchers have stated to in part be caused by the [[two-child policy]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Family===

==== Marriage ====
Following their colonization by European powers, many lost their standing and were placed in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]. Instead of being involved in their society, women worked as trade intermediaries and were expected to marry and become housewives.&lt;ref&gt;Lockard, Craig A. Southeast Asia in World History. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in gender roles became a new cultural practice and lasted for years until the Vietnam War, when women in rural Vietnam became discouraged from marrying and female singlehood became a growing trend. A common belief was that after the mid-twenties, women were considered undesirable and marriage was a way of life. The cap for marriage was at this age because after this time, women could no longer bare children, a necessity for the survival of the family name. In addition, the notion of "a one-person, self-sufficient household was not very acceptable" &lt;ref name="Rural North Viet Nam 2002"&gt;Werner, Jayne Susan, and Khuat Thu Hong. "Too Late to Marry: Failure, Fate or Fortune? 
Female Singlehood in Rural North Viet Nam." In Gender, Household, State: đỏ̂i Mới in Việt Nam, 89-110. Ithaca, N.Y.: Southeast Asia Program, Cornell University, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and was looked at as selfish and lonely. After the age of twenty-five, single women enter a period where they "make the transition from temporary to permanent non-marriage." &lt;ref name="Rural North Viet Nam 2002" /&gt; As they go through this period, society perceived them as being "wishful" or even "regretful".&lt;ref name="Rural North Viet Nam 2002" /&gt; However, when women were interviewed, nearly all showed no sign of remorse from rejecting marriage proposals during their prime ages for marriage. They were happy with their decision to opt out of a possible "miserable" life with a husband.&lt;ref name="Rural North Viet Nam 2002" /&gt;

Familial obligations, especially during the Vietnam War, forced many women to put off marriage until they reached an age where they were viewed as "unfavorable". From a young age, the eldest child of a Vietnamese family had a variety of obligations to uphold. One of which was having to care for their younger siblings. During time of war, it was difficult for the parents to overlook agricultural labor while taking care of all their children.&lt;ref name="Rural North Viet Nam 2002" /&gt; If the eldest daughter were to be married off, the family would lose a hand of labor. Because of this obligation, women rejected offerings of marriage. After the war, women continued to help around the household and replaced the men they lost in combat. Although many still had proposals for marriage, they believed that it was fate that they had been single for that long and that they were meant for singlehood. The gender imbalance that followed the Vietnam War was also a cause in the rise of single women. It was hard for them because men living in rural areas were hesitant to marry them. In addition, those who work at state farms and forestry stations were stationed in remote areas. This limited women from socializing with the opposite sex.

Studies have shown there are marriage discrepancies between rural and urban areas in Vietnam today. According to Nguyen et al., women from rural areas were shown to enter marriage at a younger age than women from urban areas.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Furthermore, evidence has shown that there is a difference in marital and familial values between north and south Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; According to one study, these differences between the north and south regions are likely due to their separation during the mid-20th century, as well as the degree of socialist or western influences on the north and south, respectively. The cultural differences between northern and southern Vietnam include "marriage rituals, family living arrangement, household composition, and premarital sexual behaviors" according to a study by Teerawichitchainan et al.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teerawichitchainan|first=Bussarawan|last2=Knodel|first2=John|last3=Loi|first3=Vu Manh|last4=Huy|first4=Vu Tuan|date=2010-01-01|title=The Gender Division of Household Labor in Vietnam: Cohort Trends and Regional Variations|jstor=41604338|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|volume=41|issue=1|pages=57–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic role====
{{Duplication|section=yes|date=March 2015}}
[[Confucianism]]'s emphasis on the family still impacts Vietnamese women's lives, especially in rural areas, where it espouses the importance of premarital female virginity and condemns abortion and divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen Khac Vien (1975) Confucianism and Marxism in Vietnam, in: David Marr &amp; Jayne Werner (Eds) Tradition and Revolution in Vietnam, pp. 15–52 (Berkeley, Indochina Resources Center).&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2006 study, over the past decades, little progression in gender relations have been made. Household chores and labor are still primarily performed by Vietnamese women; however, women in Vietnam have shown increased influence in familial decisions, such as household budgets and the education of the children. In terms of childcare responsibility, men have shown an increased participation at the earlier ages of childcare, though women overall still bear the main responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knodel|first=John|last2=Loi|first2=Vu Manh|last3=Jayakody|first3=Rukmalie|last4=Huy|first4=Vu Tuan|date=2005-03-01|title=Gender Roles in the Family|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17441730500125888|journal=Asian Population Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=69–92|doi=10.1080/17441730500125888|issn=1744-1730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are seen primarily as mothers, and are considered to have shown "respect" to their husband's lineage if they give birth to a boy.&lt;ref&gt;Rydstrøm, Helle. "Sexual desires and ‘social evils’: young women in rural Vietnam." Gender, Place and Culture 13, no. 3 (2006): 283-301.&lt;/ref&gt; While patrilineal ancestor worship shows girls as "outside lineage" (''họ ngoại''), it consider boys to be "inside lineage" (''họ nội''). Vietnamese society tends to follow the ancestral line through males, pushing women to the periphery. Vietnam has a two child policy. Some families want at least one boy, but would prefer two boys to two girls, so they use ultrasound machines to determine the baby's sex to later abort female offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Yi et al., "Causes and Implications of the Recent Increase in the Reported Sex Ratio of Birth in China," Population and Development Review, vol. 19 (June 1993), pp. 283-302; Daniel Goodkind, "Rising Sex Ratios at Birth in Confucian Asia: A Summary of Interpretive Puzzles" (Unpublished manuscript, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The main religion in Vietnam are traditional folk beliefs (see [[Vietnamese folk religion]]). This is not an organized religion, however it does adopt many Confucian views. One of the main views that it takes from Confucius is the Patrilineal Society. Men are the head of the family and more their lineage is to be protected.  As it pertains to motherhood, Vietnam women are seen as and used primarily as mothers. Female virginity is of extreme importance, especially in rural areas, and the Society condemns abortion and female divorce. If a women wants to show respect to her husband, the best way she can do that is to bear him a son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23501757|title=Vietnam: Where saying 'I love you' is impossible - BBC News|work=bbc.com|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817012538/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23501757|archivedate=17 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several patterns in birth rates amongst Vietnamese women. In one 2008 study by Nguyen et al., most women were found to have given birth by the time they reached age 20. However, the same study has found that the higher education level a woman received, the later the age at which she gives birth to her first child.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luc|first=Nguyen|last2=Thang|first2=Nguyen Minh|last3=Swenson|first3=Ingrid|last4=San|first4=Pham Bich|date=1993-07-01|title=Selected determinants of fertility in vietnam: age at marriage, marriage to first birth interval and age at first birth|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/selected-determinants-of-fertility-in-vietnam-age-at-marriage-marriage-to-first-birth-interval-and-age-at-first-birth/E4E28F535BF43E24E5D5378111B54B96|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|volume=25|issue=3|pages=303–310|doi=10.1017/S0021932000020642|issn=1469-7599|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114170608/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/selected-determinants-of-fertility-in-vietnam-age-at-marriage-marriage-to-first-birth-interval-and-age-at-first-birth/E4E28F535BF43E24E5D5378111B54B96|archivedate=2016-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Domestic violence ====
The issue of [[domestic violence]] has faced scrutiny in Vietnam. In 2007, Vietnamese legislation passed the Law on Prevention and Control Domestic Violence, which reported that 32% of Vietnamese women have suffered sexual violence from their spouses, while 54% of women in Vietnam have suffered from emotional violence. Speculation has rose on the viability of divorce as a solution to those in situations of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is due to the prevalent local attitudes and measures taken towards preventing divorce in order to preserve the family unit, rather than helping victims escape domestic abuse. Additionally, surveys have indicated that 87% of domestic violence victims in Vietnam do not seek support for their situation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vu|first=Ha Song|last2=Schuler|first2=Sidney|last3=Hoang|first3=Tu Anh|last4=Quach|first4=Trang|date=2014-07-03|title=Divorce in the context of domestic violence against women in Vietnam|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2014.896948|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|volume=16|issue=6|pages=634–647|doi=10.1080/13691058.2014.896948|issn=1369-1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International marriage ====

=== Sex ratio ===
Recent studies have shown a shift in Vietnam's [[sex ratio]] to match that of other countries in the region, where proportions are uneven and men outnumber women. In 2006, the sex ratio was found to be 110 men per 100 women throughout Vietnam, higher than the established normal sex ratio of 106 men per 100 women. Researchers have pointed to the preference for a small family size, which stems from Vietnam's two-child policy, preference for sons, and increase in ultrasound and abortion usage for the cause of the sex ratio shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pham|first=Bang Nguyen|last2=Hall|first2=Wayne|last3=Hill|first3=Peter S.|last4=Rao|first4=Chalapati|date=2008-01-01|title=Analysis of Socio-Political and Health Practices Influencing Sex Ratio at Birth in Viet Nam|jstor=25475446|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|volume=16|issue=32|pages=176–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sex-selective abortions ====
In 1988, Vietnam introduced its "[[two-child policy]]." This policy was introduced because of the population size of Vietnam. However, because of the policy, if a woman gave birth to a son first, the chances of her having a second child dropped dramatically even if she desired to have more children. If a woman gave birth to a daughter first, she was more than likely to have a second child even if she did not wish to have additional children. This is because families in most cases would rather have at least one boy. To ensure the sex of children in recent years, Vietnamese families have increasingly been using ultrasound technology and enhancing and developing the produced images. This often leads to the abortion of female offspring.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1995|title=Vietnam's one-or-two-child policy in action|journal=[[Population and Development Review]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=85–111|jstor=2137414?|author=Daniel M. Goodkind}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 20th century, economist [[Amartya Sen]] has noted the recent advent of sex-selective abortions to further increase the phenomenon of "missing women" worldwide. This notion alludes to the worsening of the women-to-men ratio, with men continuing to outnumber women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amartya|first=Sen|date=2003-12-04|title=Missing women—revisited|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7427/1297|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=327|issue=7427|pages=1297–1298|doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7427.1297|issn=0959-8138|pmc=286281|pmid=14656808|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717115447/http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7427/1297|archivedate=2017-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Female mortality ====
Since 1970, overall child mortality rates have declined. However, contrary to nearby countries such as India and China, male child mortality rates have shown to be higher than female child mortality rates most years from 1970-2000. In a study done by Pham et al., boys are 30% more likely than girls to die before a specified age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pham|first=Thong Le|last2=Kooreman|first2=Peter|last3=Koning|first3=Ruud H.|last4=Wiersma|first4=Doede|date=2012-06-19|title=Gender patterns in Vietnam’s child mortality|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-012-0425-9|journal=Journal of Population Economics|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=303–322|doi=10.1007/s00148-012-0425-9|issn=0933-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Overall literacy rates across Vietnam are high, with access to education being relatively equal between males and females. However, regional differences are still apparent, especially amongst the mountainous northern regions. For example, in one study, the region of [[Lai Châu Province|Lai Chau]] was found to have a literacy rate for men double that of the women's literacy rate in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Kristy|date=2000-01-01|title=The higher education system in Vietnam|url=http://www.nzdl.org/gsdl/collect/literatu/index/assoc/HASH2125.dir/doc.pdf|journal=World Education News and Reviews|volume=13|issue=3|pages=5–6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012224744/http://www.nzdl.org/gsdl/collect/literatu/index/assoc/HASH2125.dir/doc.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a gender gap in education, with males being more likely to attend school and sustain their education than females.&lt;ref&gt;Project of Children Statistics, 1989. Profiles of Children and Women zn Vietnam (Nhung van de ve tre em va phu nu Viet Nam) (Hanoi: General Statistical Office, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Women and men tend to be segregated into different jobs, with more women serving in educational, communications, and public services than men.

=== Economy ===
In contemporary Vietnam, there has been significant economic advancement for women, especially for middle-class Vietnamese women. Middle-class women have increasingly become more involved in the workforce sector outside of the house, with 83% of "working-age women" being involved in the labor force.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=KRISTY|date=2011-01-01|title=Vietnam case study (preliminary findings): Women in educational leadership and management|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/14087152/sem313_17_eng.pdf|journal=A paper presented during the Gender Equality in Education: Looking beyond parity.

And although under 10% of women in the labor force work in textile industry, 80% of laborers in the textile industry are women.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Truong|first=Thi Thuy Hang|date=2008-09-01|title=Women’s Leadership in Vietnam: Opportunities and Challenges|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/588432|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=34|issue=1|pages=16–21|doi=10.1086/588432|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average wage in the country of  Vietnam was US$1,540 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/business/menwomen-wage-gap-widens-in-vietnam-3283.html|title=Men-women wage gap widens in Vietnam &amp;#124; Business &amp;#124; Thanh Nien Daily|date=2013-03-07|website=Thanhniennews.com|accessdate=2016-06-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630122227/http://www.thanhniennews.com/business/menwomen-wage-gap-widens-in-vietnam-3283.html|archivedate=2016-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, studies showed "that women earn 13% less than men."&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilo.org/hanoi/Informationresources/Publicinformation/Pressreleases/WCMS_206104/lang--en/index.htm|title=Despite high labour force participation rate for women, gender pay gap on the rise|date=2013-03-07|language=en|access-date=2016-11-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810141012/http://www.ilo.org/hanoi/Informationresources/Publicinformation/Pressreleases/WCMS_206104/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=2016-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 survey on workers’ salaries carried out by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) in enterprises nationwide revealed that female workers’ salaries are only 70-80% of their male colleagues’.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The global average gender pay gap is hovering around seventeen percent&lt;ref name="WCMS_206104"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/hanoi/Informationresources/Publicinformation/Pressreleases/WCMS_206104/lang--en/index.htm|title=Despite high labour force participation rate for women, gender pay gap on the rise|date=7 March 2013|work=ilo.org|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510085829/http://www.ilo.org/hanoi/Informationresources/Publicinformation/Pressreleases/WCMS_206104/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Nguyen Kim Lan, ILO national project coordinator, the only 2 occupational fields where pay is equal is in logistics, and household care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/business/menwomen-wage-gap-widens-in-vietnam-3283.html|title=Men-women wage gap widens in Vietnam|work=thanhniennews.com|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630122227/http://www.thanhniennews.com/business/menwomen-wage-gap-widens-in-vietnam-3283.html|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the disparity is that companies view women as wanting to stay at home and perform more gender role duties .More than seventy percent of laborers in Vietnam are women. The International Labour Organizations recently stated that the gender pay gap has started to increase, according to the ILO Global Wage Report during the 2012-13 period, compared to 1999-2007.&lt;ref name="WCMS_206104" /&gt; A two percent increase in the gap was recorded in Vietnam in the period.&lt;ref name="WCMS_206104" /&gt;

=== Politics ===
Women's participation in the National Assembly is at its lowest since 1997.&lt;ref name="vn.undp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vn.undp.org/content/dam/vietnam/docs/Publications/31204_Women_s_Representation_in_Leadership_in_Viet_Nam.pdf|title=Women's Representation in Leadership in Vietnam|website=Vn.undp.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-06-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005416/http://www.vn.undp.org/content/dam/vietnam/docs/Publications/31204_Women_s_Representation_in_Leadership_in_Viet_Nam.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little progress has been made to move ahead of the 30% average of women's representation in Vietnam. Within the Vietnam Communist Party, women's membership has slowly climbed, and in 2010 was 33%. This is a significant increase from 2005 when women's membership was only 21.9%.  Despite this increase, the membership of women in the party is still less than men. Additionally, the number of women leaders in key positions such as in the Politburo, Central Committee and the Secretariat remains low.&lt;ref name="vn.undp.org" /&gt; On the regional level, women occupy 23% of district positions, as well as 23% of municipal positions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Like the United Nation Millennium Development Goals, the Vietnamese government has also developed their own set of goals committed to increasing the percent of women in government, which in 2011 was still at 30%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vn.undp.org" /&gt; One example of Vietnam's efforts to improve women representation are in the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women, which set goals to be reached by 2010.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, Vietnam has fallen short of many of its stated goals. There are several reasons that the government has not been able to meet its quota to have more women in government.  The reasons include factors such as "inadequate government regulations, lack of implementation of existing policies, cultural factors, and inherent systemic bias towards men."&lt;ref name="vn.undp.org" /&gt; Many women that want to engage in politics are often discouraged because of age-related training eligibility criteria and a retirement age that is five years earlier than males, with males having a retirement age of 60 and women having a retirement age of 55.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vn.undp.org" /&gt; Workplace attitudes are challenges for women to achieve their aspiration of  leadership positions. Unlike males, women are harassed much more in their occupations,  and promotion is dependent upon the supervisors discretion and how he feels about gender promotion. There are few women role models for young women to follow or to be inspired by. Many women in Vietnam do not see themselves as becoming leaders because there a lack of female leaders to look up to.  This occurs because of messages that are expressed socially in media, home, and education.&lt;ref name="vn.undp.org" /&gt;

Currently, the position of the Vice President of Vietnam is held by [[Đặng Thị Ngọc Thịnh]], with this being the highest office to be held by a woman in Vietnam. However, most data has pointed to a majority of positions in recent office terms being held by men. For example, during the 2002 to 2007 term, all of the minister positions comprising the government cabinet were held by men. These statistics have constituted many leaders advocating for greater representation for women in leader positions.  To implement this goal, a National Strategy on Gender Equality was recently implemented in 2011 through to 2020.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Human trafficking ===
{{Main|Human trafficking in Vietnam}}
Since the 1980s, some women from Vietnam have become victims of [[Bride kidnapping|kidnapping]], the bride-buying trade, and [[Human trafficking in the People's Republic of China|human trafficking]] and [[Prostitution in China|prostitution]] in [[China]].,&lt;ref name="WSJ2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wright.edu/~tdung/bride_vn.htm|title=Vietnamese Women are Kidnapped and Later Sold in China as Brides|last2=Lee-Young|first2=Joanne|date=3 August 1999|last3=Forney|first3=Matt|last1=Marshall|first1=Samantha|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119021150/http://www.wright.edu/~tdung/bride_vn.htm|archivedate=19 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan, South Korea, and in the cases of human trafficking, prostitution and [[sexual slavery]], [[Cambodia]].  The present-day struggle of the Vietnamese female victims of "[[International marriage agency|bride-brokers]]" can be summarized by the larger-than-life poem known as "[[The Tale of Kieu]]," which narrates the story of a female protagonist of Vietnam who was purchased by foreigners and was violated, yet kept fighting back against her captors and offenders.&lt;ref name="WSJ2" /&gt;

The main human rights issue in Southeast Asia is [[Human trafficking]]. According to one study, Southeast Asia is a large source of human trafficking, with many individuals who fall victim to human trafficking being sent to Australia.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=J. J.|year=2010|title=Migration and people trafficking in Southeast Asia|url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=846187365487985;res=IELHSS|journal=Trends &amp; Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice|publisher=Canberra, Australia: Australian Institute of Criminology|volume=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam, as well as other countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and the Philippines, are major source countries for human trafficking.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Southeast Asian countries preference for boys over girls is further tipping the balance between the sexes in the region, already skewed by a strong bias for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21566321/ns/health-childrens_health/t/vietnams-desire-baby-boys-skews-gender/#.VHtgoNyGtBU|title=Vietnam's desire for baby boys skews gender|date=31 October 2007|work=nbcnews.com|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306211944/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21566321/ns/health-childrens_health/t/vietnams-desire-baby-boys-skews-gender/#.VHtgoNyGtBU|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend has led to increased trafficking of women. While many of the victims that are a part of human trafficking are forced/kidnapped/enslaved, others were lured in under the assumption that they were getting a better job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issues.cc/complaints/human-trafficking/human-trafficking-in-southeast-asia|title=Human Trafficking - Human Trafficking In SouthEast Asia|work=issues.cc|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327084454/http://www.issues.cc/complaints/human-trafficking/human-trafficking-in-southeast-asia|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a policy brief on human trafficking in Southeast Asia, although victims include girls, women, boys, and men, the majority are women. Women tend to be more highly targeted by traffickers due to the fact that they are seeking opportunity in an area of the world where limited economic opportunities are available for them. Unskilled and poorly educated women are commonly led into human trafficking. According to the [[UNODC]] report, the numbers for women and men in forced labor may be skewed due to the fact that only a few countries released the numbers for adult men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/human-trafficking/|title=UNODC - Human Trafficking|work=unodc.org|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715092225/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/human-trafficking/|archivedate=15 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However what is known is that women are trafficked the most. The main causes of human trafficking in Southeast Asia are universal factors such as poverty and globalization. Industrialization is arguably also another factor of human trafficking. Many scholars argue that industrialization of booming economies, like that of [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], created a draw for poor migrants seeking upward mobility and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries.These migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the cheap labor from within its borders. A high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking cheap labor creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive. The sex industry emerged in [[Southeast Asia]] in the mid 20th century as a way for women to generate more income for struggling migrants and locals trying to support families or themselves. Sex industries first catered to military personnel on leave from bases but as military installations began to recede the industry turned its attention to growing tourism. Even as the industry is looked down upon today there is still a large underground market that is demanding from traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/regions/south_and_central_asia|title=HumanTrafficking.org - Regions: South &amp; Central Asia|work=humantrafficking.org|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530221901/http://www.humantrafficking.org/regions/south_and_central_asia|archivedate=30 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2009, 6,000 women, as well as younger girls, were found to be in the human trafficking statistic. The majority of the women and girls are trafficked to China, 30% are trafficked to Cambodia, and the remaining 10% are trafficked to the destinations across the world.&lt;ref&gt;The trafficking of women and children from Vietnam.

===Vietnam Women's Union===
[[File:Vietnamese women in canthao district.jpg|thumb|251x251px|Members of Vietnam Women's Union attending a [[Disaster preparedness|Disaster Preparedness]] workshop in Can Thao district, southern Vietnam]]In recent decades, [[Vietnam]] has stressed the importance of gender equality. To address this goal, the Vietnam Women's Union, an organization founded in 1930 under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnam Communist Party]], has pursued the advancement of women in many arenas; however, they also stress many aspects of Confucian doctrine that keeps a male-dominated hierarchy in place. As of 2000, their membership has expanded to 11 million, which compromises for 60% of the female population in Vietnam over the age of 18. Because of their large membership, the Vietnam Women's Union has frequently been regarded as the representative for women in politics. Therefore, the VWU frequently advises during the policy-making of gender-related or women's issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, their role has been disputed due to its shortcomings in promoting women's right effectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuler|first=Sidney Ruth|last2=Anh|first2=Hoang tu|last3=Ha|first3=Vu Song|last4=Minh|first4=Tran Hung|last5=Mai|first5=Bui Thi Thanh|last6=Thien|first6=Pham vu|date=2006-01-01|title=Constructions of Gender in Vietnam: In Pursuit of the 'Three Criteria'|jstor=4005524|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|volume=8|issue=5|pages=383–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the Vietnam Women's Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoilhpn.org.vn/?Lang=EN|title=Hội liên hiệp Phụ nữ - Việt nam|work=hoilhpn.org.vn|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802030459/http://hoilhpn.org.vn/?Lang=EN|archivedate=2 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased paid maternity leave and received a promise that they would be asked before the government implemented any policies that could potentially affect the welfare of women. However, the increased maternity leave was restored to its original length a few years later. While there are limits in the Vietnam Women's Union that prohibit gender change in certain areas, there does not seem to be other organized civil society groups that are fighting for women's rights. Two areas that have seen little change throughout recent decades are the roles women play in the family, specifically motherhood, and the human rights problems women traditionally face in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsnam.html|title=Military Women in Vietnam|work=aug.com|accessdate=17 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619094058/http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsnam.html|archivedate=19 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Vietnam Women's Union was appointed to head the planning of a new legislation, a Law on Gender Equality, which set out to equalize conditions between both genders.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The legislation included several stipulations, including laws pertaining to retirement age for both men and women. The law was in its final legislation processes in 2006, with it going into effect mid 2007.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Kristy|date=2009|title=Obliged to Mother, Required to Retire: Gender, Class, Equality and Retirement Rights in Vietnam.|journal=Conference Papers -- American Sociological Association|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2007/wom1593.doc.htm|title=NEW LAW ON GENDER EQUALITY WILL GREATLY IMPROVE VIET NAM’S LEGAL REGIME FOR WOMEN’S ADVANCEMENT, ANTI-DISCRIMINATION COMMITTEE TOLD {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-10-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105170007/http://www.un.org/press/en/2007/wom1593.doc.htm|archivedate=2016-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
Their focus on Confucian values which uphold a male-dominated hierarchy has received criticism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In numerous studies, the VWU has been criticized for its lack of action against gender norms while placing too much emphasis on family structure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waibel|first=Gabi|last2=Glück|first2=Sarah|date=2013-07-01|title=More than 13 million: mass mobilisation and gender politics in the Vietnam Women's Union|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13552074.2013.802148|journal=Gender &amp; Development|volume=21|issue=2|pages=343–361|doi=10.1080/13552074.2013.802148|issn=1355-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while their efforts have worked towards improving women's status, the VWU faces criticism for their lack of advocacy towards women's power.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
