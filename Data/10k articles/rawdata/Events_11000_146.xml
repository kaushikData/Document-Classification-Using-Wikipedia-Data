      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13843">The precise definitions of and punishments for '''aggravated sexual assault''' vary from nation to nation and state to state.

In the United States of America, it is a felony sexual offense governed by laws that vary from state to state. Typically, it is "a [[sexual assault]] that maims, wounds, or disfigures the victim, or involves a victim who is physically or mentally incapacitated." It may also "include a sexual assault that is aided or abetted by another person, occurs during commission of another crime, or involves use of a deadly weapon. Local laws should be consulted for specific requirements and applicable penalties."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/aggravated-sexual-assault/|title=Aggravated Sexual Assault Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related is '''aggravated rape''' which in the USA is "an offense of rape that is committed under circumstances which render the offense more heinous... An aggravated rape is different from a forcible rape." The severity can be affected by the age of the victim, a blood relationship between the accused and the victim, the offender being armed with a weapon, and more than one offender raping the victim. "Rape which occurs during commission of specified crimes, such as assault and battery by means of dangerous weapon, constitutes aggravated rape, punishable by harsher penalties than simple rape. [Commonwealth v. Williams (1987) 23 Mass App 716, 505 NE2d 233, 1987 Mass App LEXIS 1786]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It can also be defined as "oral, vaginal, or anal opening of a person's orifices without consent or will. The offender uses force, fear, or violence. The perpetrator uses a person's physical injuries as a way to rape the individual, uses death or kidnapping, uses a deadly weapon, or is aided by one or more people."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rape Reference: A Resource For People At Risk|last=Harrison and Gilbert|first=Maureen and Steve|publisher=Excellent Books|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sentencing ==
In the United States, a defendant convicted of aggravated sexual assault is generally sentenced to time in jail. How much time the defendant receives is determined by a judge who considers the severity and quantity of the assault or assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=072000050HArt%252E+11+Subdiv%252E+5&amp;ActID=1876&amp;ChapterID=53&amp;SeqStart=14600000&amp;SeqEnd=16100000 |title=720 ILCS 5/ Criminal Code of 2012. |website=www.ilga.gov |access-date=2016-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423131533/http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=072000050HArt.+11+Subdiv.+5&amp;ActID=1876&amp;ChapterID=53&amp;SeqStart=14600000&amp;SeqEnd=16100000 |archivedate=2016-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-traumatic stress ===
When people are abused they tend to push aside the memories of the event. The victim may begin to [[relive the event]] and experience anxiety. After a person experiences aggravated sexual assault they experience a sense of fear and [[Learned helplessness|helplessness]]. It may also lead to the victim being impaired in a social environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Childhood sexual abuse: a reference handbook|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual disorder ===
Children who have been subject to aggravated sexual assaulted tend to develop a sexual disorder. A person who has felt powerless as a child may be confused over the differences between affection, sex and abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Depression ===
An individual who has been subjected to aggravated sexual assaulted as a child may experience depression, typically more often and to a greater degree than any other person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Depression is a sense of sadness, and can cause a person to isolate themselves from society, and lose interest in activities they once enjoyed.&lt;ref name="Effects of Sexual Assault and Rape"/&gt; Symptoms of depression include feeling worthless, hopeless, a change in eating habits, irrational anger or anxiety. Depression can also lead to suicide or thoughts on suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Depression|url=http://www.aftersilence.org/depression.php|website=After Silence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court cases ==
([[R v Cuerrier]]), was a Supreme Court of Canada in 1998, ruled that intentionally exposing a sexual partner to [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] , without letting them know is considered aggravated sexual assault. Currier was aware of being HIV positive and how the diseases can be transmitted, but did not want to reveal that he is HIV positive because he lived in a small community. He began to have a relationship with a woman in which they frequently engaged in sexual activities. Weeks within their relationship, the woman began to question about sexual transmitted diseases, Curreier told her that he took a test a few months ago and was tested HIV negative and did not mentions his current HIV status. During the same time, Currier begin to have an other sexual relationship with a woman and when she asked about Sexual Transmitted Diseases he did not mention that he was infected. She then discovered that Currier had HIV and ended the relationship. He then was charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault. That is then when the Supreme Court determined that if a person with HIV does not disclose that they are infected it is considered aggravated sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidslaw.ca/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2.Cuerrier1998summary.pdf|title=Summary: R. v.

'''Alyoshenka''' ({{lang-ru|Алёшенька}}, diminutive of the Russian male first name [[Alexey]]) or the '''Kyshtym Dwarf''' is believed by many to be a prematurely born female baby with many deformities found in the village of Kaolinovy, near [[Kyshtym]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], Russia in May 1996. Subsequently, the remains were lost. Only photos and videos of the corpse survive. Various supernatural and mystical speculation arose; sceptics regard the information about its existence as nothing more than [[urban legends]].

== Discovery ==

A small human foetus, Alyoshenka was found by an elderly woman, Tamara Vasilyevna Prosvirina. The foetus had an unusual appearance, giving rise to rumours of its [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin. The local population readily supported this rumour, collecting fees from reporters for interviews&amp;nbsp;– at least two Japanese companies ([[Asahi TV]] and [[MTV Japan]]) made documentaries about the remains.

== Physical appearance ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alyoshenka.jpg|thumb|right|A screenshot from the police videotape documenting the autopsy of Aleshenka's corpse.]] --&gt;
Alyoshenka was a greyish foetus about 25 centimetres (9.8&amp;nbsp;in) in length. Its hairless head had a number of dark spots. The eyes were large, occupying most of the face. It breathed through a small nose below the eyes.

== Later incidents ==

Somewhere between a few days to a month after the discovery, Tamara Prosvirina was admitted to a hospital or psychiatric hospital (details vary on this) for treatment, and in some accounts the remains were passed to the local ''[[militsiya]]'' (police) by a neighbour. In most accounts, once the body was given to authorities in order to get DNA testing, it "disappeared" and Prosvirina's family was unable to retrieve it from authorities. In 1999, Prosvirina was killed in a car accident in an attempt to escape from the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelpress.ru/newspapers/chelrab/archive/09-07-2005/3/A104381.DOC.shtml|script-title=ru:Алешенька или Аленушка?

== Speculation ==

Little is known about what happened to the remains, and accounts of Alyoshenka's death and appearance vary greatly. A local [[ufologist]] claimed that the corpse was taken away by a [[UFO]] inhabited by members of Alyoshenka's  species.  Some sceptics hold that it was bought by a wealthy collector of curiosities. A doctor from the local hospital who had allegedly seen the corpse reported that it corresponded to a normal 20- to 25-week human [[foetus]], born prematurely. It could have lived for several hours, but not several weeks, contrary to Prosvirina's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelpress.ru/newspapers/aif/archive/13-08-2003/3/31.shtml|script-title=ru:Гуманоид Алешенька - жертва аборта|trans-title=Humanoid Alyoshenka is a victim of Abortion|language=ru|date=13 August 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311013625/http://www.chelpress.ru/newspapers/aif/archive/13-08-2003/3/31.shtml|archivedate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing ==

Bendlin decided initially that this was the mummified remains of a child and took it to Dr Irina Yermolaeva for analysis. She stated that it wasn’t a hoax in that it was a genuine mummified body that was once living tissue. Her conclusions though were that it was a premature child that was deformed, something which could be attributed to the far reaching fall-out of the [[Kyshtym disaster|1957 Kyshtym Disaster]].

On 15 April 2004, scientists made an official statement that the "Kyshtym creature" was a premature female human infant, with severe deformities. However, other experts and eyewitnesses said it could not have been a human as there were too many differences (up to 20 were counted) in the skeleton that varied from a human being, especially in regard to the skull.

However Bendlin's clinical assistant, Lyubov Romanowa, who herself had seen many deformities in children stated that "they had never seen anything like this", and that she believed that it was "not of human origin". She said the differences were just too many, not least of which the amount of bones on the head that consisted of four in total that had sharp edges which were "completely different to a human being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metimeforthemind.com/aleshenka-alien-baby-or-victim-of-1957-kyshtym-disaster.html|title=Aleshenka – Alien Baby Or A Tragic Victim Of The 1957 Kyshtym Disaster 40 Years Later?|author=|date=|work=metimeforthemind.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to genetic experts at the [[Moscow]] Vavilov Institute of General Genetics, [[Genetic testing|DNA analysis]] of the clothes Alyoshenka was wrapped in revealed evidence that his DNA was of unknown origin. It was also tested for radiation, but did not show high radiation levels.&lt;ref name=UnexplainedFiles&gt;{{Cite episode|title=|series=''[[The Unexplained Files]]''|season = 2|number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://strangedaze.doomby.com/pages/aleshenka-alien-dwarf-or-human.html Aleshenka the Kyshtym dwarf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507052150/http://strangedaze.doomby.com/pages/aleshenka-alien-dwarf-or-human.html |date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2018 study on the similar [[Atacama skeleton]] found an extremely high number of mutations for bone &amp; muscle formation, suggesting that such major mutations, although extremely rare, are possible.

The books follow various American girls throughout both [[List of American Girl characters#BeForever|historical]] eras (''BeForever'' and ''Girls of Many Lands'')&lt;ref name="Wolitzer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/Wolitzer-t.html?_r=0|title=Meet Julie - Megan McDonald - Robert Hunt - Book Review|last=Wolitzer|first=Meg|date=11 November 2007|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[List of American Girl characters#Girl of the Year dolls|Girl of the Year]]'' line of characters from contemporary settings.&lt;ref name="Morgenegg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865622415/Book-review-American-Girl-of-the-Year-Grace-shares-her-adventures-in-Paris.html?pg=all|title=Book review: American Girl of the Year 'Grace' shares her adventures in Paris|last=Morgenegg|first=Faith|date=21 February 2015|work=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History Mysteries==
A related series entitled '''History Mysteries''', also known as '''Mysteries Through Time''' and/or '''Mysteries through History''' was released by American Girl in 1999 and discontinued in 2004. The series comprises a total of 22 books by various authors and forms a companion series to the popular American Girl books; unlike BeForever, Girl of the Year and other lines, they do not come with any doll or toy and acts as a stand-alone novel set in a particular period in American history. The characters were generally older, ranging from ages ten to fourteen, and the books were marketed as for ages ten and up. Many of the authors from this series later moved on to write for the main Historical Character/BeForever series.

Several books from the series were later re-released in digital form by [[Open Road Integrated Media]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5843">'''Bulletproof hosting''' is a service provided by some domain hosting or [[web hosting]] firms that allows their customer considerable leniency in the kinds of material they may upload and distribute.  This leniency has been taken advantage of by [[Spam (electronic)|spammers]]&lt;ref name=CIO&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/492113/In_China_Puts_a_Spammer_in_Business "In China, $700 Puts a Spammer in Business: It's a great deal, if you're a spammer."], ''[[CIO (magazine)|CIO]]'', 2009-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; and providers of online gambling or [[illegal pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/12/AR2008111200658_2.html?sid=ST2008111801165&amp;s_pos= McColo referred to as "bulletproof hosting"], [[Washington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many service providers have [[Terms of Service|terms of service]] that do not allow certain materials to be uploaded or distributed, or the service to be used in a particular way, and may suspend a hosting account, after a few complaints, to minimize the risk of their IP [[Subnetwork|subnet]] being blocked by anti-[[spam (electronic)|spam]] filters using [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) address-based filtering. Additionally, some service providers may have ethical concerns that underpin their service terms and conditions.

Often, a bulletproof host allows a content provider to bypass the laws or contractual terms of service regulating Internet content and service use in its own country of operation, as many of these 'bulletproof hosts' are based 'overseas' (relative to the geographical location of the content provider).

Many if not most 'bulletproof hosts' are in [[China]],&lt;ref name=CIO/&gt; other parts of [[Asia]], and [[Russia]]/Russia's surrounding countries, though this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honeynet.org/node/138 REAL WORLD FAST-FLUX EXAMPLES], [[The Honeynet Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[McColo]], responsible for 2/3rds of the world's spam when taken down, was US based.

Bulletproof hosting providers have a high rate of turnover, as many hosting providers choose to shut down, whether forcibly or voluntarily, if their alternative would be to compromise client freedom (as this is their main selling point).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shahzad|first1=Sunil|title=Bulletproof Hosting|url=http://www.blueangelhost.com/blog/bulletproof-hosting/|publisher=BlueAngelHost|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CryptoLocker ransomware attack'''  was a [[cyberattack]] using the ''CryptoLocker'' [[ransomware]] that occurred from 5 September 2013 to late May 2014. The attack utilized a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] that targeted computers running [[Microsoft Windows]],&lt;ref name=ars-cryptolocker /&gt; and was believed to have first been posted to the Internet on 5 September 2013.&lt;ref name=bbc241213&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelion|first=Leo|title=Cryptolocker ransomware has 'infected about 250,000 PCs'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25506020|accessdate=24 Dec 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=24 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It propagated via infected email attachments, and via an existing [[Gameover ZeuS]] [[botnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.avast.com/c-cryptolocker | title = CryptoLocker | accessdate = 14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When activated, the malware [[Encryption|encrypted]] certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA [[public-key cryptography]], with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then displayed a message which offered to decrypt the data if a payment (through either [[bitcoin]] or a pre-paid cash voucher) was made by a stated deadline, and it threatened to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline was not met, the malware offered to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in bitcoin. There was no guarantee that payment would release the encrypted content.

Although CryptoLocker itself was easily removed, the affected files remained encrypted in a way which researchers considered unfeasible to break. Many said that the [[ransom]] should not be paid, but did not offer any way to recover files; others said that paying the ransom was the only way to recover files that had not been [[Backup|backed up]]. Some victims claimed that paying the ransom did not always lead to the files being decrypted. 

CryptoLocker was isolated in late May 2014 via [[Operation Tovar]], which took down the [[Gameover ZeuS]] [[botnet]] that had been used to distribute the malware. During the operation, a security firm involved in the process obtained the database of private keys used by CryptoLocker, which was in turn used to build an online tool for recovering the keys and files without paying the ransom. It is believed that the operators of CryptoLocker successfully extorted a total of around $3 million from victims of the trojan. Other instances of encryption-based ransomware that have followed have used the "CryptoLocker" name (or variations), but are otherwise unrelated.

== Operation ==
CryptoLocker typically propagated as an [[email attachment|attachment]] to a seemingly innocuous e-mail message, which appears to have been sent by a legitimate company.&lt;ref name="securityweek131119"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.securityweek.com/cryptolocker-infections-rise-us-cert-issues-warning | title=Cryptolocker Infections on the Rise; US-CERT Issues Warning | work=SecurityWeek |date=19 November 2013| accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Zip (file format)|ZIP file]] attached to an email message contains an executable file with the filename and the icon disguised as a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file, taking advantage of Windows' default behaviour of hiding the [[filename extension|extension]] from file names to disguise the real .EXE extension. CryptoLocker was also propagated using the [[Gameover ZeuS]] trojan and botnet.&lt;ref name=krebs2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=details /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-cryptolocker&gt;{{cite web|title=Cryptolocker: How to avoid getting infected and what to do if you are|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243537/Cryptolocker_How_to_avoid_getting_infected_and_what_to_do_if_you_are_|work=Computerworld|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When first run, the [[Payload (computing)|payload]] installs itself in the [[User profiles in Microsoft Windows|user profile]] folder, and adds a key to the [[Windows Registry|registry]] that causes it to run on startup. It then attempts to contact one of several designated command and control servers; once connected, the server generates a [[RSA numbers#RSA-2048|2048-bit]] [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] key pair, and sends the [[public-key cryptography|public key]] back to the infected computer.&lt;ref name=ars-cryptolocker /&gt;&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrams|first=Lawrence|title=CryptoLocker Ransomware Information Guide and FAQ|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptolocker-ransomware-information|work=[[Bleeping Computer]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The server may be a local [[Proxy server|proxy]] and go through others, frequently relocated in different countries to make tracing them more difficult.&lt;ref name=sophos-cryptolocker&gt;{{cite web|title=Destructive malware "CryptoLocker" on the loose – here's what to do|url=http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/10/12/destructive-malware-cryptolocker-on-the-loose/|work=Naked Security|publisher=Sophos|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-cryptolocker /&gt;

The payload then encrypts files across local hard drives and [[drive mapping|mapped network drives]] with the public key, and logs each file encrypted to a registry key. The process only encrypts data files with certain [[File extension|extensions]], including  [[Microsoft Office]], [[OpenDocument]], and other documents, pictures, and [[AutoCAD]] files.&lt;ref name=cw-cryptolocker /&gt; The payload displays a message informing the user that files have been encrypted, and demands a payment of 400 [[United States dollar|USD]] or [[Euro]] through an anonymous pre-paid cash voucher (i.e. [[Green Dot Corporation|MoneyPak]] or [[Ukash]]), or an equivalent amount in [[bitcoin]] (BTC) within 72 or 100 hours (while starting at 2 BTC, the ransom price has been adjusted down to 0.3 BTC by the operators to reflect the fluctuating value of bitcoin),&lt;ref name="zdnet-bitcoinprice" /&gt; or else the private key on the server would be destroyed, and "nobody and never{{sic}} will be able to restore files."&lt;ref name=ars-cryptolocker /&gt;&lt;ref name=details /&gt; Payment of the ransom allows the user to download the decryption program, which is pre-loaded with the user's private key.&lt;ref name=details /&gt; Some infected victims claim that they paid the attackers but their files were not decrypted.&lt;ref name=securityweek131119 /&gt;

In November 2013, the operators of CryptoLocker launched an online service that claimed to allow users to decrypt their files without the CryptoLocker program, and to purchase the decryption key after the deadline had expired; the process involved uploading an encrypted file to the site as a sample and waiting for the service to find a match; the site claimed that a match would be found within 24 hours. Once found, the user could pay for the key online; if the 72-hour deadline passed, the cost increased to 10 bitcoin.&lt;ref name=nw-cryptolockersecondchance&gt;{{cite web|title=CryptoLocker crooks charge 10 Bitcoins for second-chance decryption service|url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/84174|work=NetworkWorld|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcw-moremoney&gt;{{cite web|title=CryptoLocker creators try to extort even more money from victims with new service|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060640/cryptolocker-creators-try-to-extort-even-more-money-from-victims-with-new-service.html|work=PC World|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Takedown and recovery of files ===
On 2 June 2014, the [[United States Department of Justice]] officially announced that over the previous weekend, [[Operation Tovar]]—a consortium constituting a group of law enforcement agencies (including the [[FBI]] and [[Interpol]]), security software vendors, and several universities, had disrupted the [[Gameover ZeuS]] [[botnet]] which had been used to distribute CryptoLocker and other malware. The Department of Justice also publicly issued an [[indictment]] against the Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev for his alleged involvement in the botnet.&lt;ref name=krebs2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/06/operation-tovar-targets-gameover-zeus-botnet-cryptolocker-scourge/|title=‘Operation Tovar’ Targets ‘Gameover’ ZeuS Botnet, CryptoLocker Scourge|author=Brian Krebs|publisher=Krebs on Security|date=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-whambam&gt;{{cite news|title=Wham bam: Global Operation Tovar whacks CryptoLocker ransomware &amp; GameOver Zeus botnet|url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/cybercrime-and-hacking/23980/wham-bam-global-operation-tovar-whacks-cryptolocker-ransomware-gameover-zeus-botnet|accessdate=18 August 2014|work=Computerworld|agency=IDG|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703092912/http://blogs.computerworld.com/cybercrime-and-hacking/23980/wham-bam-global-operation-tovar-whacks-cryptolocker-ransomware-gameover-zeus-botnet|archive-date=3 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doj-takedown&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Leads Multi-National Action Against “Gameover Zeus” Botnet and “Cryptolocker” Ransomware, Charges Botnet Administrator|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/June/14-crm-584.html|accessdate=18 August 2014|work=Justice.gov|agency=U.S. Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the operation, the Dutch security firm Fox-IT was able to procure the database of private keys used by CryptoLocker; in August 2014, Fox-IT and fellow firm FireEye introduced an online service which allows infected users to retrieve their private key by uploading a sample file, and then receive a decryption tool.&lt;ref name=krebs-recover&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krebs|first1=Brian|title=New Site Recovers Files Locked by Cryptolocker Ransomware|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/08/new-site-recovers-files-locked-by-cryptolocker-ransomware/|website=Krebs on Security|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=takedown&gt;{{cite news|title=Cryptolocker victims to get files back for free|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28661463|accessdate=18 August 2014|agency=BBC News|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While security software is designed to detect such threats, it might not detect CryptoLocker at all, or only after encryption is underway or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yumasun.com/news/local/article_f38f14e8-4f50-11e3-8165-0019bb30f31a.html The Yuma Sun, on a CryptoLocker attack]: "... was able to go undetected by the antivirus software used by the Yuma Sun because it was Zero-day malware"&lt;/ref&gt; If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would limit its damage to data.&lt;ref name=malwarebytes&gt;{{cite web|last=Cannell|first=Joshua|title=Cryptolocker Ransomware: What You Need To Know, last updated 06/02/2014|url=http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2013/10/CryptoLocker-ransomware-what-you-need-to-know/|work=Malwarebytes Unpacked|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=register /&gt; Experts suggested precautionary measures, such as using software or other security policies to block the CryptoLocker payload from launching.&lt;ref name=ars-cryptolocker&gt;{{cite web|title=You’re infected—if you want to see your data again, pay us $300 in Bitcoins|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/youre-infected-if-you-want-to-see-your-data-again-pay-us-300-in-bitcoins/|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=details /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-cryptolocker /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-cryptolocker&gt;{{cite web|title=CryptoLocker attacks that hold your computer to ransom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/19/cryptolocker-attacks-computer-ransomeware|work=The Guardian|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{cite web|last=Leyden|first=Josh|title=Fiendish CryptoLocker ransomware: Whatever you do, don't PAY|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/18/cryptolocker_ransmware|work=The Register|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the nature of CryptoLocker's operation, some experts reluctantly suggested that paying the ransom was the only way to recover files from CryptoLocker in the absence of current backups ([[Off-line storage|offline]] backups made before the infection that are inaccessible from infected computers cannot be attacked by CryptoLocker).&lt;ref name=securityweek131119 /&gt; Due to the length of the key employed by CryptoLocker, experts considered it practically impossible to use a [[brute-force attack]] to obtain the key needed to decrypt files without paying ransom; the similar 2008 trojan Gpcode.AK used a 1024-bit key that was believed to be large enough to be computationally infeasible to break without a concerted [[distributed computing|distributed]] effort, or the discovery of a flaw that could be used to break the encryption.&lt;ref name=details /&gt;&lt;ref name=pcw-moremoney /&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet-2"&gt;{{cite web|title = Blackmail ransomware returns with 1024-bit encryption key|url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1251|first = Ryan|last = Naraine|date = 6 June 2008 |accessdate = 25 October 2013 |work = [[ZDnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="securityfocus"&gt;{{cite web|title = Ransomware resisting crypto cracking efforts|url = http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11523|work = [[SecurityFocus]]|first = Robert|last = Lemos|date = 13 June 2008 |accessdate = 25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sophos]] security analyst Paul Ducklin speculated that CryptoLocker's online decryption service involved a [[dictionary attack]] against its own encryption using its database of keys, explaining the requirement to wait up to 24 hours to receive a result.&lt;ref name=pcw-moremoney /&gt;

== Money paid ==
In December 2013, [[ZDNet]] traced four bitcoin addresses posted by users who had been infected by CryptoLocker, in an attempt to gauge the operators' takings. The four addresses showed movement of 41,928 BTC between 15 October and 18 December, about US$27 million at that time.&lt;ref name="zdnet-bitcoinprice"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/cryptolockers-crimewave-a-trail-of-millions-in-laundered-bitcoin-7000024579/|title=CryptoLocker's crimewave: A trail of millions in laundered Bitcoin|author=[[Violet Blue]]|date=22 December 2013|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey by researchers at the [[University of Kent]], 41% of those who claimed to be victims said that they had decided to pay the ransom, a proportion much larger than expected; Symantec had estimated that 3% of victims had paid and Dell SecureWorks had estimated that 0.4% of victims had paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of online survey by Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Cyber Security at the  University of Kent in Canterbury|url=http://www.cybersec.kent.ac.uk/Survey2.pdf|work=kent.ac.uk|publisher=University of Kent in Canterbury|accessdate=25 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308080430/http://www.cybersec.kent.ac.uk/Survey2.pdf|archive-date=8 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the shutdown of the botnet that had been used to distribute CryptoLocker, it was calculated that about 1.3% of those infected had paid the ransom; many had been able to recover files which had been backed up, and others are believed to have lost huge amounts of data. Nonetheless, the operators were believed to have extorted a total of around $3 million.&lt;ref name=takedown /&gt;

In September 2014, further clones such as CryptoWall and [[TorrentLocker]] (whose payload identifies itself as "CryptoLocker", but is named for its use of a [[registry key]] named "[[BitTorrent|Bit Torrent]] Application"),&lt;ref name=eset-torrentlocker&gt;{{cite web|title=TorrentLocker now targets UK with Royal Mail phishing|url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/09/04/torrentlocker-now-targets-uk-royal-mail-phishing/|publisher=ESET|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; began spreading in Australia; the ransomware uses infected e-mails, purportedly sent by government departments (e.g. [[Australia Post]] to indicate a failed parcel delivery) as a payload.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
[[File:Arthur Rothstein, Boy building a model airplane as girl watches, FSA camp, Robstown, Texas, 1942.jpg|thumb|Boy building a model airplane]]
'''DIY ethic''' refers to the ethic of [[self-sufficiency]] through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert. Literally meaning "[[do it yourself]]", the DIY ethic promotes the idea that anyone is capable of performing a variety of tasks rather than relying on paid specialists. The DIY ethic requires that the adherent seeks out the knowledge required to complete a given task. The term can refer to a variety of disciplines, including [[home improvement]], [[first aid]] or [[creative work]]s.

Rather than belittling or showing disdain for those who engage in manual labor or skilled crafts, DIY champions the average individual seeking such knowledge and expertise. Central to the ethic is the empowerment of individuals and communities, encouraging the employment of alternative approaches when faced with bureaucratic or societal obstacles to achieving their objectives.

== Punk culture ==

In the [[punk subculture]], the DIY ethic is tied to [[punk ideology]] and [[anticonsumerism]]. It supports the rejection of [[consumer culture]], using existing systems or existing processes that would foster dependence on established societal structures. According to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Byrne]], Jeremy Deller (2010) [http://www.davidbyrne.com/news/press/articles/modernpainters_2010.php ''Audio Games''], in ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', March 1, 2010. "I think I embrace a bit of the punk aesthetic that one can express oneself with two chords if that’s all you know, and likewise one can make a great film with limited means or skills or clothes or furniture. It’s just as moving and serious as works that employ great skill and craft sometimes. Granted, when you learn that third chord, or more, you don’t have to continue making 'simple' things, unless you want to. Sometimes that’s a problem."&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the earliest example of this attitude was the punk music scene of  the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/1/69|title = Oxford Journal of Design History Webpage|accessdate = 2007-09-24|quote = "Yet, it remains within the subculture of punk music where the homemade, A4, stapled and photocopied fanzines of the late 1970s fostered the ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) production techniques of cut-n-paste letterforms, photocopied and collaged images, hand-scrawled and typewritten texts, to create a recognizable graphic design aesthetic."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging punk bands such as [[Death (protopunk band)|Death]], who recorded their earliest demos in a bedroom without any professional equipment, began to record their music, produce albums, merchandise, distribute and promote their works independently, outside the established music industry system. So extreme was their desire for independence that they often performed at  [[basement show]]s in [[residential]] homes rather than at traditional [[Music venue|venue]]s in order to avoid [[sponsor (commercial)|corporate sponsorship]] and ensure their creative freedom. Since many venues tend to shy away from more [[experimental music]], houses and other private venues were often the only places these bands could play.

[[Riot grrrl]], associated with [[third-wave feminism]], also adopted the core values of the DIY punk ethic by leveraging creative ways of communication through [[zines]] and other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bennet | first = Andy | author-link = | last2 =Peterson | first2 =Richard A. | author2-link = | title = Music scenes: local, translocal and virtuas | pages = 116–117 | year = 2004 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zrGa3vYOoZgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;sig=rBBTiX8e-j6Q0u57_HabZje6gJQ&amp;q=do%20it%20yourself%20riot%20grrrl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of the DIY punk ethic can also work collectively. For example, punk impresario [[David Ferguson (impresario)|David Ferguson]]'s [[David Ferguson (impresario)#CD Presents|CD Presents]] was a DIY [[concert production]], [[recording studio]], and [[record label]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Jarrell | first = Joe | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Putting Punk in Place--Among the Classics | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | pages = PK–45 | date = 26 September 2004 | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/09/26/PKGVR8RVV91.DTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German punk band [[:de:Mono für Alle!|Mono für Alle!]] perfected the mass production of the self-made DIY album. Their album included a tinkered wooden cover and sold over 6000 units from their website and other alternative sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monofueralle.de/urheberrecht.html MONO FÜR ALLE ! - Meinung zum Urheberrecht]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DIY punk ethic also applies to [[simple living|simple everyday living]], such as:

* Learning bicycle repair rather than taking a bike to a mechanic's shop. (See also: [[Bicycle cooperative]].)
* Sewing, repairing, or modifying clothing rather than buying new clothes.
* Vegetable gardening.
* Reclaiming recyclable products by [[dumpster diving]].

Some educators also engage in DIY teaching techniques, sometimes referred to as [[Edupunk]].

==Music==
{{Main|DIY music}}
{{see also|Independent music}}
Commercial DIY music has its origins in the mid 1970s [[punk rock]] scene.{{r|diyspace}} It developed as a way to circumnavigate the mainstream [[music industry]].{{r|albini}} By controlling the entire production and distribution chain, DIY music bands can develop a closer relationship between artists and fans. The DIY ethic gives total control over the final product without need to compromise with record labels.{{r|albini}}

== Skateboarding and cycling==

In the skateboarding culture, DIY [[skateparks]] are parks or skate spots made by skaters themselves. That involves woodworking, concrete work and a vast variety of craftsmanship to build the most original and creative spaces to skate.

The most world-renowned, and probably first, DIY skatepark ever built was [[Burnside Skatepark]], located in Portland, OR. Built without permission by skateboarders and later sanctioned by the city, Burnside is the preeminent example of action.  The Park appears in the movie [[Free Willy]] in 1993 and years after that, in 1999, the park is part of [[Tony Hawk]]'s [[Tony Hawk (series)]] video game. In 2007, it becomes the epicenter for [[Gus Van Sant]]'s [[Paranoid Park (film)]].

After that the culture spread over and other parks started to appear. Philadelphia's [[FDR Skatepark]], San Diego's [[Washington Street (San Diego)|Washington Street]], San Pedro's [[Channel Street]], Seattle's [[Marginal Way]], St Louis' [[U.S. Route 61|King's Highway]] and most recently Portland's [[Brooklyn Street Skate Spot]].

The DIY skateboarding culture made its way to Europe, Brazil's [[Praça Duó]] and other parts of the world, being the main style and theme for [[Pontus Alv]]'s unique approach to skateboarding film making in ''[[Strongest of the Strange]]''.

DIY bicycle projects can include creative ways to revamp or transform your bike,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/diy-bicycle-projects 24 Imaginative DIY Bicycle Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; but are primarily built on empowering cyclists to understand how their bikes work and how easy they are to fix themselves in order to make cycling an even easier transportation option.  Cycling has also seen an explosion of DIY-style shops ("[[bike co-op]]s"), such as the Bicycle Kitchen in Los Angeles, where anyone can come in and be mentored by a volunteer and get access to tools for maintaining and modifying their own bicycle.

== Around the world ==

=== United Kingdom ===

Having originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the form of the [[free festival movement]], mutating through protest camps (thus incorporating elements of earlier radical tendencies such as the beat and peace movements) and into punk through bands such as [[Crass]], [[Do it yourself|DIY]] culture became something of a recognised movement in the 1990s in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where the protest (the direct action) and party (the festival) converged. The prime example of this movement was the [[Exodus Collective]]. This development constituted a significant cross-pollination of pleasure and politics resembling the anti-disciplinary politics of the 1960s. During the 1990s, demonstrating the desire for an economy of mutual aid and co-operation, the commitment to the non-commodification of art, the appropriation of digital and communication technologies for free community purposes, and the commitment to alternative technologies such as [[biodiesel]]. From 1991–1997 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government  cracked down on [[squatting]], [[animal rights]] activists, [[green politics|greens]], [[Irish Traveller|travellers]], as well as [[Rave party#1990s: United Kingdom|raves]], parties and [[dance]] culture.

In 1994, the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] which contained several sections designed to curtail the growing [[free party]] and [[M11 link road protest|anti-road]] [[protest]] movements (sometimes embodied by [[rave]]rs and [[Irish Traveller|traveller]]s). It empowered [[police]] to arrest citizens who appeared to be preparing to hold a rave, waiting for a rave to start, or attending a rave.

=== United States ===

DIY culture in the [[United States]] can be linked to many of the same philosophies of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of the 1900s, which sought to reconnect people with hands-on activities and the aesthetics associated with them. This was in direct opposition to the prevailing [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] which was moving many aspects of the culture's aesthetics away from the hand-made artisan-created styles of the past and toward a [[mass-produced]] sleek modern vision of the future. DIY culture in the US arguably evolved from a simple cost-saving activity of the 1940s and 1950s to an increasingly radical political activity which stood against the increasingly visible trends of mass-production, conspicuous consumerism, waste, and the industrial [[corporate]] philosophy of [[planned obsolescence]]. DIY culture in the US is a current and evolving loose coalition of various individuals. There are many members of DIY culture with distinct and [[activist]] philosophies and goals, such as Betsy Greer who coined the term [[Craftivism]] in 2003. There are also many people with a staunch neutrality of political and social issues adopted by other members of the DIY movement. The largest group fall into an area somewhere between these two opposites, as varied in the spectrum of political and social philosophy as members of any large and thriving [[subculture]].

In John Isaacson's book ''Do-It-Yourself Screenprinting'', published by Portland, Oregon's [[Microcosm Publishing]], who gained fame by publishing and distributing a wide variety of [[zines]], Jason Munn is quoted in a "[[screen printing|screenprinter]] profile" as relating to the medium as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I loved the idea of designing or illustrating something and doing the printing myself. Most of my time is spent in front of the computer so the printing is a great way to get my hands dirty again, so to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, John: ''Do-It-Yourself Screenprinting'' Microcosm Publishing, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9770557-4-6}} Page 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern society, it is uncommon for people to go more than a part of a day without interacting with [[computers]] or other modern technology.  This leads to disconnect between the person and the physical world around them - including other people - and is a secondary significant motivating force in leading people to embrace DIY culture.

Carla Sinclair, [[Editor in Chief]] of ''[[Craft (magazine)|Craft]]'' attempts to describe the DIY community: "This DIY renaissance embraces crafts while pushing them beyond traditional boundaries, either through technology, irony, irreverence, and creative recycling, or by using innovating materials and processes...the new craft movement encourages people to make things themselves rather than buy what thousands of others already own. It provides new venues for crafters to show and sell their wares, and it offers original, unusual, alternative, and better-made goods to consumers who choose not to fall in step with mainstream commerce."&lt;ref&gt;Various: ''Craft Magazine, Vol.1, Issue 1. O'Reilly Media, 2006. {{ISBN|0-596-52728-4}} Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Lupton embellishes these thoughts in her book [[D.I.Y. Design It Yourself]]: "Around the world, people are making things themselves in order to save money, to customize goods to suit their exact needs and interests, and to feel less dependent on the corporations that manufacture and distribute most of the products and media we consume. On top of these practical and political motivations is the pleasure that comes from developing an idea, making it physically real, and sharing it with other people."&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, Ellen: ''D.I.Y. Design It Yourself'' Princeton Architectural Press, 2006. {{ISBN|1-56898-552-5}} Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The articulation of both Isaacson and Lupton is that DIY activities and culture not only are unique in a modern world of consumerism, they give pleasure to its members simply due to the lack of corporate control or thoughts of profit and marketability which are often assigned to the act of creation outside the world of [[fine art]].

These views are not universal or without variation, however. In Tsia Carson's introduction to her book 'Craftivity: 40 Projects for the DIY Lifestyle,' she muses that "the kind of agency one gains over their life by making their things is certainly powerful, heady stuff. But I can't honestly say that is ''why'' I make things. Do I make things for spiritual reasons? I wonder if I'm ready to speak of crafting as a form of meditation when I compare the [[crochet]] hats I make for my daughter's stuffed monkey to venerable practices like making Tibetan sand [[mandalas]]. We make things for two reasons: pleasure and because we can."&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Tsia: ''Craftivity: 40 Projects for the DIY Lifestyle'' HarperCollins Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-06-084130-0}} Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; While some ascribe political or social context to their DIY activities, others ascribe personal or spiritual dimensions.

Matt Maranian, author of 'Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living,' a guide to making your own home decor specifically intended not to look like it was purchased in any store, illustrates another aspect of DIY culture: "Pad is not a book for the helpless, the aimless, or the clueless, Pad is a book for the empowered, the inspired, and the creative. It's a book for people who forge their own trail, and who know how to make the very most of what they have at hand&amp;nbsp;— or can find cheaply. Pad is the guerrilla approach to home decorating."&lt;ref&gt;Maranian, Matt ''Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living'' Chronicle Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8118-2653-8}} Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt articulates the sense of community and subculture present in DIY culture, perhaps even hinting at a kind of intellectual succession from a society deemed "helpless...aimless...clueless."

The first lines of Amy Spencer's 'DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture' sum up the juxtaposition of DIY culture's aspects by pointing out "the DIY movement is about using anything you can get your hands on to shape your own cultural entity: your own version of whatever you think is missing in mainstream culture. You can produce your own zine, record an album, publish your own book&amp;nbsp;— the enduring appeal of this movement is that anyone can be an artist or creator. The point is to get involved."&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Amy ''DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture'' Marion Boyars Publishers, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-7145-3161-8}} Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet ===

Technological developments, new internet platforms, applications and innovations in the last ten years have made it easier for artists, makers and creators of all types to circumvent professional studios and create high-quality work themselves. Developments in media [[software]] and the proliferation of [[high-speed internet]] access have given artists of all ages and abilities from across the globe, the opportunity to make their own films, records, or other creative content, and distribute it over the web. Such works were usually displayed on a private homepage, and gained popularity through word-of-mouth recommendations or being attached to [[chain letters]] (known as [[viral distribution]]).

Sites like [[Newgrounds]] and [[DeviantArt]] allow users to post their art and receive community critique, while [[Instructables]] allows DIYers to exhibit their works in an instructional [[how-to]] format. It is becoming common for content creators to share and receive compensation for their work online. Musicians can distribute their wares over the internet, independently of commercial funding, using the same computer they used to record.

'''Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun''' have been held at museums in several countries, notably the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, United States, Canada, Japan, and France.

The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] had sparked widespread interest in [[ancient Egypt]] when they were [[KV62|discovered between 1922 and 1927]], but most of them remained in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] until the 1960s, when they were first exhibited outside of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Epic"&gt;Melani McAlister, ''Epic Encounters: Culture, Media, and U.S. Interests in the Middle East Since 1945'' (2005), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these exhibitions, relics from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] are among the most travelled artifacts in the world. Probably the best-known tour was the ''Treasures of Tutankhamun'' from 1972 until 1981.

Other exhibitions have included ''Tutankhamun Treasures'' in 1961 and 1967, ''Tutankhamen: The Golden Hereafter'' beginning in 2004, ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' beginning in 2005, and ''Tutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs'' in 2008. Permanent exhibitions include the ''Tutankhamun Exhibition'' in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], United Kingdom, which contains replicas of many artifacts.

==Ownership and normal display==
[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Musée127.JPG|thumb|One of the golden shrines, now on display in the [[Egyptian Museum]].]]
All of the artifacts exhumed from the Tutankhamun tomb are, by international convention, considered property of the Egyptian government.&lt;ref&gt;Zahi A. Hawass, ''The Golden Age of Tutankhamun: Divine Might and Splendor in the New Kingdom'' (2004), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these pieces are normally kept at the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]; the only way for them to be shown internationally is by approval of Egyptian authorities. Although journalists and government officials generally support the tours, some Egyptians argue that the artifacts should remain on display in their own country, where Egyptian school-children would have greater access to them, and where the museum's exhibit would attract foreign tourists.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt;

==''TutTreasures'' (1961–67)==
The first travelling exhibition of a substantial number of Tutankhamun artifacts took place from 1961 to 1966. The exhibition, titled ''Tutankhamun Treasures'', initially featured 34 smaller pieces made of gold, alabaster, glass, and similar materials.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;"Tutankhamun Treasures", ''Art international: Volume 6'' (1962), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The portions of the exhibition occurring in the United States were arranged by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and organized by Dr. [[Froelich Rainey]], Director of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], with the assistance of Dr. [[Sarwat Okasha]], Minister of Culture and National Guidance of the [[United Arab Republic]].&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt; The exhibit travelled to 18 cities in the United States and six in Canada.&lt;ref name = Malek&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/4semmel.html| first= Jaromir |last = Malek| title = Some thoughts inspired by a current exhibition:'Tutankhamun: His Tomb and Treasures'| location = Brno, Czech Rep.| date = January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition had a public purpose in mind, to "stimulate public interest in the [[UNESCO]]-sponsored salvage program for Nubian monuments threatened by the [[Aswan Dam]] project".&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overseas"&gt;Institute of International Education, ''Overseas: Volume 1'' (1961), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition opened in November 1961 at the Smithsonian's [[National Gallery of Art]], in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;

==''The Treasures of Tutankhamun'' (1972–1981)==
[[File:Tutanchamun Maske.jpg|thumb|right|The iconic [[Tutankhamun's mask|burial mask of Tutankhamun]] was among the most popular pieces in the Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition.]]
The genesis of the ''Treasures of Tutankhamun'' exhibition reflected the changing dynamic of [[Middle-East]] relations.

===United Kingdom===
It was first shown in London at the [[British Museum]] in 1972. After a year of negotiations between Egypt and the United Kingdom, an agreement was signed in July 1971. Altogether, 50 pieces were chosen by the directors of the British Museum and the [[Cairo Museum]] to be shown at the exhibition, including 17 never before displayed outside Egypt. For insurance purposes, the items were valued at £9.06&amp;nbsp;million. In January 1972, they were transported to London on two civilian flights and one by the [[Royal Air Force]], carrying, among other objects, the gold [[Tutankhamun's mask|death mask of Tutankhamun]]. Queen [[Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]] officially opened the exhibition on March 29, 1972. More than 30,000 people visited in its first week. By September, 800,000 had been to the exhibition, and its duration was extended by three months because of the popularity. When it did close on December 31, 1972, 1.6&amp;nbsp;million visitors had passed through the exhibition doors. All profits (£600,000) were donated to [[UNESCO]] for conserving the temples at [[Philae]], Egypt.&lt;ref name="zaki"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tutankhamun Exhibition at the British Museum in 1972: A historical perspective|first=Assaad A.|last=Zaki|journal=Journal of Tourism Theory and Research|volume=3|number=2|pages=79-88|year=2017|doi=10.24288/jttr.312180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Treasures of Tutankhamun'' was the most popular exhibition in the museum's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/past_exhibitions/1972/archive_tutankhamun.aspx|title=Treasures of Tutankhamun|publisher=The British Museum|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a landmark achievement in [[Egypt–United Kingdom relations]].&lt;ref name="zaki"/&gt; The exhibition moved on to other countries, including the USSR, US, Canada, and West Germany.

===United States===
Egyptian cultural officials initially stalled prospects of an American tour, as Egypt was then more closely aligned with the Soviet Union, where fifty pieces had toured in 1973.&lt;ref name="Epic"/&gt; However, relations thawed later that year when the U.S. interceded on Egypt's behalf to prevent the total destruction of Egypt's [[Third Army (Egypt)|Third Army]] during a military conflict with [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Epic"/&gt; U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]] thereafter visited Egypt, becoming the first American President to do so since the [[Second World War]], and personally prevailed upon Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] to permit the artifacts to tour the United States – with the U.S. tour including one more city than the Soviet tour had included, and several additional pieces.&lt;ref name="Epic"/&gt; The showing was the largest of Tutankhamun's artifacts, with 53 pieces.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; 

[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] organized the U.S. exhibition, which ran from November 17, 1976, through September 30, 1979. More than eight million attended.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Classical Bearings: Interpreting Ancient History and Culture'' (1998), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan's exhibition was designed to recreate for visitors the drama of the 1922 discovery of the treasure-filled tomb. Included along with original objects excavated from the tomb were reprints from [[glass plate]] negatives in the Metropolitan’s collection of the expedition photographer [[Harry Burton (Egyptologist)|Harry Burton]]'s photographs documenting the excavation's discoveries step by step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/MacManus_Tutankhamun_records_b18131165.pdf Finding aid for the Irvine MacManus records related to "Treasures of Tutankhamun" exhibition, 1975-1979] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian described the exhibit as one of the initial "blockbuster exhibits" which sparked the museum community's interest in such exhibitions.&lt;ref name = SIMarket/&gt;

After the six U.S. tour locations were named, San Francisco citizens bombarded the Mayor's Office with inquiries as to why the tour was not coming there. As a result, museum trustees flew to Egypt to meet with the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, where they worked out a mutual agreement for a seventh stop. Profits after exhibition expenses resulted in $10+ million going to the Egyptian Museum for refurbishing.&lt;ref name="Tut in SF"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[David P. Silverman|Silverman]]|first=Harold, Editor|title=The Treasures of Tutankhamun in San Francisco|year=1979|publisher=California Living Books|isbn=0-89395-014-9|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other museums to host the exhibition===
After the exhibition left London in 1972, it toured the USSR from 1973–1975.
*[[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]], Moscow (December 1973– May 1974)
*[[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg (July 1974– November 1974)
*[[National Art Museum of Ukraine]], Kiev (January 1975– March 1975)

During the years 1976 to 1979 the exhibition was shown in the United States. While at the following venues, the exhibit attracted more than eight million visitors: (NGA)
*[[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C. (November 17, 1976 – March 15, 1977) – 836,000 visitors in over 117 days&lt;ref name = SIMarket&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.si.edu/opanda/Reports/SICMarketing.pdf| title = Audience Building: Marketing Art Museums| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| date  = October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City (December 15, 1978 – April 15, 1979)
*[[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]], [[San Francisco]], California (June 11 – September 30, 1979)

After the Exhibit left the U.S. it went to:
*[[Art Gallery of Ontario]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada (November 1 – December 31, 1979)
*[[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]], Berlin, West Germany (February 16 – May 26, 1980)
*''Kölnisches Stadtmuseum'', Cologne, West Germany (June 21 – October 19, 1980)
*[[Haus der Kunst]], Munich, West Germany (November 22 – February 1, 1981)

*[[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg|Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]], Hamburg, West Germany (May 15 – July 19, 1981)

While the exhibition was on display in San Francisco, Police Lieutenant George E. LaBrash suffered a minor stroke as he guarded the treasures after hours. He later filed a [[lawsuit]] against the city on the theory that his injury had resulted from the legendary [[Curse of the pharaohs]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081360,00.html Chatter]", ''[[People Magazine]]'', Vol. 17, No. 4 (February 1, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' (2004-2011)==
Originally entitled ''Tutankhamen: The Golden Hereafter'', this exhibition is made up of fifty artifacts from Tutenkhamun's tomb as well as seventy funerary goods from other [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] tombs. The tour of the exhibition began in 2004 in [[Basel, Switzerland]] and went to [[Bonn, Germany]] on the second leg. The European tour was organized by the Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA), and the Egyptian Museum in cooperation with the [[Antikenmuseum Basel]] and [[Sammlung Ludwig]]. [[Deutsche Telekom]] sponsored the Bonn exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/716/he1.htm |title=Under Tut's spell |work=Al-Ahram Weekly |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' consists of the same items from the Germany and Switzerland tour but in a slightly different exhibition. Of the 50 artifacts from the Tutankhamun tomb fewer than ten were repeated from the 1970s exhibition. This exhibition began in 2005, and was directed by Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, together with Arts and Exhibitions International and [[National Geographic Society|the National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref name="AEI"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition overview===
The initial American leg of the ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' exhibition attracted estimated three million visitors, and was displayed in the following venues:
*[[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] – June 16 to November 15, 2005
*[[Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale]] – December 15, 2005 to April 23, 2006
*[[Field Museum of Natural History]] – May 26, 2006 to January 1, 2007
*[[Franklin Institute]] – February 3 to September 30, 2007

From November 15, 2007, to August 31, 2008, the exhibition was shown in [[The O2 (London)|The O2]], London. It then stayed for eight months in [[Dallas]], Texas, at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] (October 2008 – May 2009), and for nine months at the [[De Young Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] from June 27, 2009 to March 28, 2010. From April 23, 2010, to January 11, 2011, the exhibition was shown at the [[Discovery Times Square Exposition]] in New York City.

In 2011 the exhibition visited Australia for the first time, opening at the [[Melbourne Museum]] in April for its only Australian stop where it achieved the highest touring exhibition box office numbers in the country's history before Egypt's treasures return to Cairo in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingtutmelbourne.com.au/home.html |title=Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs |publisher=Kingtutmelbourne.com.au |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/whatson/coming-soon/tutankhamun |title=Melbourne Museum: Tutankhamun |publisher=Museumvictoria.com.au |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-06/tutankhamun-exhibition-smashes-box-office-records/3714930 |title=Tutankhamun exhibition smashes box office record|publisher= ABC News |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artifacts on display===
''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' displays actual items excavated from tombs of ancient Egyptian Pharaohs. From 130 authentic artifacts presented, 50 were found specifically during the excavations of Tutankhamun's tomb. The exhibition includes 80 exhibits from the reigns of Tutankhamun's immediate predecessors in the Eighteenth dynasty, such as [[Hatshepsut]], whose trade policies greatly increased the wealth of that dynasty and enabled the lavish wealth of Tutankhamun's burial artifacts. Other items were taken from other royal graves of the 18th Dynasty (dating 1555 [[BCE]] to 1305 [[BCE]]) spanning Pharaohs [[Amenhotep II]], [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Thutmose IV]], among others. Items from the largely intact tomb of [[Yuya]] and [[Tjuyu]] (King Tut's great-grandparents; the parents of [[Tiye]] who was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]) are also included. [[Yuya]] and [[Tjuyu]]'s tomb was one of the most celebrated historical finds in the Valley of the Kings until Howard Carter's discovery in 1922. This exhibition does not include either the gold death mask that was a popular exhibit from ''The Treasures of Tutankhamun'' exhibition, or the mummy itself. The Egyptian Government has determined that these artifacts are too fragile to withstand travel, and thus they will permanently remain in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article409075.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12|title=CT scan may solve Tutankhamun death riddle|author=Jenny Booth|work=The Times |location=UK |date=January 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mummy of Tutankhamun is the only known mummy in the Valley Of The Kings to still lie in its original tomb, [[KV62]].

===History===
''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'' was expected to draw more than three million people.&lt;ref name="AEI"/&gt; The exhibition started in Los Angeles, California, then moved to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]]. The exhibition then moved to London&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/tutankhamun/article2624036.ece Return of the King (''Times Online'')] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616044834/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/tutankhamun/article2624036.ece |date=June 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before finally returning to Egypt in August 2008. Subsequent events have propelled an encore of the exhibition in the United States, beginning with the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] in October 2008 which hosted the exhibition until May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallasmuseumofart.org/Dallas_Museum_of_Art/index.htm |title=Dallas Museum of Art Website |publisher=Dallasmuseumofart.org |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tour continued to other U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ilm6sCZestVa2WGI2D5pyovNphdA Tut Exhibit to Return to US Next Year]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026035620/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ilm6sCZestVa2WGI2D5pyovNphdA |date=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dallas the exhibition moved to the [[de Young Museum]] in [[San Francisco]], to be followed by the [[Discovery Times Square Exposition]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famsf.org/tut/ |title=Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs, King Tut Returns to San Francisco, June 27, 2009 – March 28, 2010 |publisher=Famsf.org |accessdate=July 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120032414/http://famsf.org/tut/ |archivedate=January 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs'' (2008-2013)==
This exhibition, featuring completely different artifacts to those in ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs'', first ran at the Ethnological Museum in Vienna from March 9 to September 28, 2008 under the title ''Tutankhamun and the World of the Pharaohs''.

==Exhibitions of replicas==
Several exhibitions have been established which feature replicas of Tutankhamun artifacts, rather than real artifacts from archaeological sites.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; These provide access to pieces of comparable appearance to viewers living in places where the real artifacts have not circulated. The first replica exhibition, a copy of the entire tomb of Tutankhamun, was built only a few years after the discovery of the tomb. This replica was temporary, staged by Arthur Weigall for the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]], in 1924.&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; Modern replica exhibitions exist in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], Dorset, England, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada, United States, and even in [[Cairo]], Egypt (where the replica exhibition is intended to reduce the overwhelming traffic to the real locations).&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt; A travelling exhibition of replicas titled ''Tutankhamun: His Tomb and Treasures'', featuring several hundred pieces, has been shown in [[Zürich]], [[Brno]], Munich, and [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name = Malek/&gt;

===Tutankhamun Exhibition, Dorchester===
The ''Tutankhamun Exhibition'' in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], Dorset, England, is a permanent exhibition set up in 1986 by  Michael Ridley as a re-creation of the tomb of the ancient Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]]. The exhibition does not display any of the actual treasures of Tutankhamun, but all artifacts are recreated to be exact facsimiles of the actual items. Original materials have been used where possible, including gold. The story line is based around the famous English archaeologist [[Howard Carter]]. The Exhibition reveals history from Carter's point of view as he entered the tomb in [[Valley of the Kings]] in November 1922.

==== Exhibition sections ====
*The entry section of the Exhibition displays general information about Tutankhamun's life and death.
*[[Tutankhamun's mummy]]. A life-size model of the mummy is displayed. The exhibitors claim that it took more than two years to recreate the mummy. X-ray pictures taken from the real mummy helped to make an exact copy.
*The ante-chamber contains replicas of furniture and Tutankhamun's personal items he had been buried with.
*The burial chamber exhibits replicas of the sarcophagus and coffin of Tutankhamun.
*The Treasure Hall shows recreations of statues and jewels found within the tomb of Tutankhamun. [[Anubis Shrine|Sitting statue of Anubis]], the Golden Throne, Gold Death Mask and statue of guardian goddess [[Selkit]] are displayed among other items.

=== ''Discovering Tutankhamun'' Exhibition, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford===
The ''Discovering Tutankhamun'' exhibition at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, England, was a temporary exhibition, open from July until November 2014, exploring [[Howard Carter]]’s excavation of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922. Original records, drawings and photographs from the [[Griffith Institute]] are on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashmolean Museum|url=http://www.ashmolean.org/exhibitions/discovertut/|work=Ashmolean website|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete records of the ten year excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun were deposited in the [[Griffith Institute]] Archive at the [[University of Oxford]] shortly after Carter's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Griffith Institute Archive|url=http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/discoveringTut/|work=Griffith Institute Archive|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A replica death mask was displayed along with replicas of other items from the tomb.

'''Foreign Affair: The Farewell Tour''' (also known as the '''Foreign Affair World Tour''') was the fifth [[concert tour]] of American singer, [[Tina Turner]]. The tour supported her seventh studio album ''[[Foreign Affair (Tina Turner album)|Foreign Affair]]''. The tour was Turner's first stadium tour and only reached European countries. Overall, the tour drew in nearly four million spectators&amp;mdash;breaking the record for a European tour that was previously set by [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name="jet"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1990-11-26 |title=Tina ends European tour and will take a year off |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |volume=79 |issue=7 |page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=tina%20turner%20foreign%20affair%20tour%20breaks%20record&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour is notable as Turner's only tour to not reach North America. Since the tour was considered a farewell tour (at that time), Turner wanted to exclusively tour Europe to thank her fans for supporting her career after she left [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner|The Revue]].

==Background==
The tour was advertised as a "farewell" tour as Turner began to concentrate on potential acting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1990-07-09 |title=Tina Turner: Still sexy and going strong |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |volume=78 |issue=13 |page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jq8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=tina%20turner%20foreign%20affair%20tour&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=tina%20turner%20foreign%20affair%20tour&amp;f=false | quote ="This is definitely my last tour [...] and I mean it!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview, Turner stated,&lt;ref name="jet"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"I've always thought this would be the final one but I must admit I now have mixed feelings. I'm the first woman to fill all these stadiums and the feeling from all those fans night after night was fantastic. I don't want to close that door completely. I'm going away for about a year and when I'm ready to return, I just hope the fans will want whatever I have to offer"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turner would return to touring in 1993 with her North American tour, "[[What's Love? Tour]]"

The '''Formula Volkswagen Germany''' was a short-lived [[single seater|single-seater]] category in [[Germany]] between 2001 and 2003.

==History==
The Formula Volkswagen was launched in 2000 as the new [[Formula Vee]] by [[Volkswagen Motorsport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top10: Die Formel Volkswagen im Detail|url=http://www.motorsport2000.de/news+191+Top10+Die%2BFormel%2BVolkswagen%2Bim%2BDetail.html|website=Motorsport2000|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reynard Motorsports]] constructed the chassis while the engine was derived from the Volkswagen [[Formula 3]] engine. The initial race was run at the [[Salzburgring]] on June 10, 2001. The race was won by Belgian youngster Philip Cloostermans. Cloostermans finished second in the standings of the first season, behind Walter Lechner Jr..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formel VW: Sieg für Cloostermans|url=http://www.motorsport2000.de/news+936+Formel+VW+Sieg%2Bf%FCr%2BCloostermans.html|website=Motorsport2000|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season an updated Formula Volkswagen chassis was presented. The new car had aerodynamic updates to more resemble the dimensions of a Formula 3 car. The racing format was also different for the 2002 season. Instead of one race each weekend, there were now two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Formel VW: Mit geändertem Fahrzeug in die Saison 2002|url=http://www.motorsport2000.de/news+1883+Formel+VW+Mit+ge%E4ndertem+Fahrzeug+in+die+Saison+2002.html|website=Motorsport2000|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series struggled to attract more than fifteen competitors each weekend.

'''Galway African Film Festival''' (GAFF) is an annual African film festival taking place in [[Galway]] on the west coast of [[Ireland]] in late May / early June to coincide with [[Africa Day]] an annual commemoration on 25 May of the 1963 founding of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU).&lt;ref&gt;Okoth, Assa. ''A History of Africa: African nationalism and the de-colonisation process''. East African Education Publisher Ltd, 2006, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to showcase the wealth and diversity of African film that would otherwise be inaccessible to Galway audiences.
Secondly, the Festival aims to reflect and celebrate the culturally diverse profile of Galway society, the city with the highest percentage (2.8%) of people from African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/census2006results/volume_5/vol_5_2006_complete.pdf|title=Server Error 404 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Festival is organised by the [http://www.galwayowc.org Galway One World Centre] in collaboration with the [http://www.filmschool.ie Huston School of Film &amp; Digital Media] and the [http://www.gfs.ie Galway Film Society]. Venues for screenings of films have included the [[Town Hall Theatre (Galway)|Town Hall Theatre]], Huston School of Film &amp; Digital Media, and Nuns Island Theatre.
The Festival is supported by [[Irish Aid]], Galway City Arts Office, [[Galway City Council]] and the ''[[Galway Advertiser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/69411/galway-african-film-festival|title=Galway African Film Festival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/83369/hard-decisions-in-approving-arts-grants-to-ninety-three-groups|title=Hard decisions in approving arts grants to ninety-three groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==
The Festival offers a big variety of genres of African Cinema, including documentaries, children's films, shorts, classic and contemporaries. The films are normally not on general release within the Republic, thereby providing people in Ireland an opportunity to see the continent of Africa through a perspective that is different from [[Hollywood]] . Guests at the Festival have included [[Keith Shiri]] (''Africa at the Pictures'', London), Alex Ogou (Lead Actor, ''Clouds over Conakry''), [[Tandeka Matatu]] (Producer, ''Jerusalema'') and Andrew Webber (Editor, ''Mirror Boy'').
Films in 2010 included ''The Figurine Araromire'' (Nigeria), ''Mascarades'' (France/Algeria) and ''A Sting in a Tale'' (Ghana),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/26365 |title=Africa at the movies|work=Galway Advertiser|date=20 May 2010 |author=Andrews, Kernan |accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2011, the festival included acclaimed movies ''Benda Bilili'' (Congo), ''Microphone'' (Egypt) and ''The Atlete'' (Ethiopia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Advertiser.ie |url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?referral=other&amp;pnum=&amp;refresh=4Fo102YtqD08&amp;EID=c60bbabc-15bc-4b0d-b87a-c02416d7ba43&amp;skip= |title=Fourth Annual Galway African Film Festival to take place in May|work= Galway Advertiser|date= 12 May 2011|page= 9 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 highlights included ''Viva Riva'', an award-winning Congolese drama, two Egyptian films about the [[Arab Spring]] of 2011 and an Ethiopian / UK co-production, ''Town of Runners''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Kernan, [http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/52076/galway-african-film-festival "Galway African Film Festival"], ''Galway Advertiser'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9093">The '''gasoline pill''' or '''gasoline powder''' is claimed to turn [[water]] into [[gasoline]], which can be used to run a [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]]. The gasoline pill is one of several claims of [[Free energy suppression|suppressed invention]]s that circulate as [[urban legend]]s. Usually these urban legends allege a [[conspiracy theory]] that the [[oil industry]] seeks to suppress the technology that turns water to gasoline. The proposed schemes are chemically impossible.

==Guido Franch==
In the [[United States]], the best known claim to have created a gasoline pill was the work of one Guido Franch, who was active from the 1950s through the 1970s. Franch called the resulting liquid ''Mota fuel'', ''mota'' being [[atom]] spelled backwards.

'''Guido Franch''' was a [[blue collar]] worker who lived in [[Livingston, Illinois|Livingston]], [[Illinois]]. His invention was a green powder that was added to water, which he claimed had actually been invented by a fictitious German scientist named Dr. Alexander Kraft. Franch took money from a number of small [[investment|investors]] who read about his claims in the ''National Tattler'' or a similar publication. In what became a frequent motif, he claimed that the water-into-gasoline powder formula could not be disclosed for fear that the oil industry would have it suppressed. Franch, when pressed into providing samples of his transmutation powder, produced samples of green [[food coloring]].

As a result of his activities, Franch was prosecuted several times for fraud. His first trial in 1954 resulted in his acquittal when a prosecution witness admitted that it might be possible that "mota fuel" worked. His second trial in 1979 resulted in his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/589/is-there-a-pill-that-can-turn-water-into-gasoline "Is there a pill that can turn water into gasoline?"] at ''[[The Straight Dope]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other water-to-gasoline "inventors"==

In 1916, [[Louis Enricht]] claimed to have a water to gasoline pill. Enricht was convicted of fraud in a related case, claiming to have a method for extracting gasoline from [[peat]], and served time in [[Sing Sing]] prison. (The [[Fischer-Tropsch process]], which can accomplish this, had not been invented yet.) In 1917, John Andrews pitched a water to gasoline powder to the [[United States Navy]]. Andrews disappeared after making his pitch, but it turned out that he had returned to [[Canada]], where he was serving in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].&lt;ref name="focus"&gt;FOCUS, Volume 1, Number 10 (December 31, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Ramar Pillai]] from South India ([[Tamil Nadu]]) claimed to be able to transmute water to gasoline by a herbal formula that he claimed was the result of a miraculous bush. Pillai obtained {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of land to cultivate his bush,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Ball| first=Philip| authorlink = Philip Ball| title=Burning water and other myths| url= http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-13.html| work= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] News| date= September 14, 2007| doi = 10.1038/news070910-13| accessdate= 2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact it turned out that he was using [[sleight of hand]] to substitute [[kerosene]] for the liquid he claimed to have derived from the bush. In October of 2016 Pillai and an associate were convicted of fraud and sentenced to 3 years of [[Penal labour|Rigorous Imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remember herbal fuel man Ramar Pillai? 20 years later he gets convicted for that fraud |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remember-herbal-fuel-man-ramar-pillai-20-years-later-he-gets-convicted-fraud-51371 |accessdate=5 July 2018 |agency=The News Minute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Wang Hongcheng announced his [[Hongcheng Magic Liquid]], which could turn regular water into fuel with just a few drops. His announcement was widely covered by Chinese media, and he was even given public funding for a company that never released a product. Years later, in 1994, the Chinese government declared that superstition and pseudoscience was rising in China and that it would start efforts to stop it. One of those efforts was to publish an article critical of Hongcheng in ''[[Science and Technology Daily]]'', thus turning the tide of public opinion against him. Hongcheng was investigated, put on trial, and condemned 10 years to prison for fraud and deceit.

Between 1992 and 2007 a businessman called Tim Johnston managed to garner over $100 million from investors, principally in Australia and New Zealand, for the promotion of a "magic pill that cut emission and made fuel last longer". Registered in the Virgin Islands, his company Firepower finally collapsed. No assets could be retrieved and no evidence of the much-vaunted fuel tablet could be found. Despite the illusory nature of the product, the company had attracted high profile and prestigious promoters and investors from the arenas of Government, Military, sport and show business.&lt;ref name="Firepower"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/business/smoking-out-firepower-kidnap-extortion-and-money-long-gone-20100129-n41d.html Smoking out Firepower], at "[[Sydney Morning Herald]]" (January 30th 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical Impossibility==

A gasoline pill is chemically impossible. Gasoline is a [[Hydrocarbon#Petroleum|hydrocarbon fuel]]; this means it consists of a mixture of molecules made up of carbon and hydrogen (e.g. [[Octane]] C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;). Water on the other hand consists of hydrogen and oxygen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). It would be necessary to introduce 8 parts carbon for every 9 parts of water to make any conversion of the form 
: 9 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + X → C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; + 9 O
work, where X is the gasoline pill. The claims discussed here do not address the source of carbon [[Chemical equation#Balancing chemical equations|needed to make up the balance]], and instead propose that just a small amount of X would suffice, which is impossible due to [[Conservation of mass#Mass conservation in chemistry|conservation of mass]]. Also note that [[Triple-alpha process|nuclear processes]] only found inside stars would be necessary to transmute hydrogen into carbon.

==Gasoline pills in fiction==

The storyline of the 1943 [[Laurel and Hardy]] film, [[Jitterbugs]], revolves around a con man ([[Bob Bailey (actor)|Bob Bailey]]) selling gas pills during the fuel rationing days of WWII.

In the 1949 motion picture ''Free For All'', [[Robert Cummings]] starred as a scientist who claimed to have invented a pill that turned water into gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041389/ ''Free For All''] entry at the [[IMDb]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1940s television/radio show [[People are Funny]] performed a stunt in which an unsuspecting crowd at [[Hollywood and Vine]] were sold "Atom Pills" at a quarter apiece. A "scientist" claimed that one pill could do the work of a hundred gallons of gasoline. When the stunt was revealed, few of the dozens who had fought to buy the pills came up to get their money back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linkletter|first=Art|title=People are Funny|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1960|pages=13–14|chapter="People Are Funny"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the television [[sitcom]] ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', [[Jethro Bodine]] claimed to have devised a water to gasoline pill that ran the Clampetts' old truck on water.

In an episode of the 1960s American [[sitcom]] ''[[The Munsters]]'', The Sleeping Cutie, Grandpa invents a gasoline pill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653101/ IMDB episode listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s American Science Fiction television show, "[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]]", Season 3, Episode 12: Where Are They?
Original Air Date—13 December 1960: " In 1917, a stranger calling himself Charles Elton appears to government officials in Washington, D. C. and demonstrates a pill that costs 2 cents that can turn 10 gallons of water into a fuel that can power an auto engine. After his successful exhibition, the stranger vanishes. The FBI and Secret Service searched for months and could never find him."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0507859/ entry at the]  [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt; Misleadingly, this episode presents the story as factual.

In [[E.L. Doctorow]]'s historical novel ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'', [[Henry Ford]] must deal with a man claiming to have invented a water-to-gasoline pill; possibly a reference to Louis Enricht.

In episode 254 of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[The Computer Wore Menace Shoes]]," Homer is trapped on a mysterious island with, among others, a ''Number 27'' who is trapped there because she knows how to turn water into gasoline.

==Early career==
Papadopoulos was an unpaid intern at the [[Hudson Institute]] from 2011 to 2015 specializing in the eastern Mediterranean and later worked as a contract research assistant to a senior fellow at the institute.&lt;ref name=short/&gt;&lt;ref name=contacts&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Young|first1=Karen |title=GOP foreign policy elites don’t know whether they’ll serve if Trump is president|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/gop-foreign-policy-elite-doesnt-know-whether-theyll-serve-if-trump-is-president/2016/04/15/5cd1e87c-0016-11e6-b823-707c79ce3504_story.html |accessdate=October 30, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He described himself as an "oil, gas, and policy consultant" on his [[LinkedIn]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/who-is-george-papadopoulos/index.html|title=Who is George Papadopoulos?|last1=Herb|first1=Jeremy|last2=Cohen|first2=Marshall|date=October 30, 2017|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Papadopoulos authored [[op-ed]] pieces in Israeli publications. In one, published in the ''[[Arutz Sheva]]'', Papadopoulos argued that the U.S. should focus on its "stalwart allies" [[Israel]], [[Greece]], and [[Cyprus]] to "contain the newly emergent Russian fleet"; in another, published in ''[[Ha'aretz]]'', he contended that Israel should exploit its natural gas resources in partnership with Cyprus and Greece rather than [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.819951 | date= October 30, 2017 | accessdate = October 30, 2017 | title =Trump Campaign Adviser Who Pled Guilty to Lying to FBI Has Surprising Ties to Israeli Settlers | first1=Amir | last1= Tibon | first2= Alison Kaplan | last2= Sommer | work = Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directed an international energy center at the London Centre of International Law Practice.&lt;ref name="ModelUN"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/03/21/meet-the-men-shaping-donald-trumps-foreign-policy-views/|title=One of Trump’s foreign policy advisers is a 2009 college grad who lists Model UN as a credential|last=Ryan|first=Missy|date=March 22, 2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=November 1, 2017|last2=Mufson|first2=Steven|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September of 2015 Papadopoulos left the Hudson Institute and joined Energy Stream, a London energy consultancy, as an oil and gas consultant for four months before joining Ben Carson's Presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;NBC News, "Who Is George Papadopoulos? Energy Expert and Junior Trump Staffer Sought to Be Russia Power Broker by Alex Johnson," Oct.30.2017, Updated Oct.31.2017.

Beginning in December 2015, Papadopoulos served on the National Security and Foreign Policy Advisory Committee for [[Ben Carson]]'s campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=111655 | publisher=The American Presidency Project | accessdate=October 30, 2017 | date=December 8, 2015| title= Dr. Ben Carson Announces Foreign Policy Advisers }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the Carson campaign in February 2016.&lt;ref name=short/&gt; Following his indictment, he was described by ''[[HuffPost]]'' as "a little-known, little-qualified 30-year-old."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-papadopoulos-big-deal_us_59f72de7e4b077d8dfcb085b|title=Robert Mueller Flipped A Trump Campaign Adviser.

== Involvement in Donald Trump's presidential campaign ==
In late 2015, Papadopoulos sent his resumé to the [[Ben Carson]] presidential campaign, which hired him as a foreign policy adviser for three months, December 2015 through February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/5002832/george-papadopoulos-guilty-plea-indictment/|title=The Short, Happy Political Career of George Papadopoulos|last=Edwards|first=Haley Sweetland|date=October 31, 2017|work=Time|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court records, Papadopoulos joined Trump's foreign policy adviser team as a volunteer adviser in early March 2016. [[Sam Clovis]], who at the time was national co-chairman of Donald Trump's campaign team, approved him as an adviser. In his campaign job interview on March 6, Clovis allegedly told Papadopoulos that one of the campaign's foreign policy priorities was to improve U.S.-Russia relations, though Clovis later denied saying that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-clovis/former-trump-campaign-adviser-denies-encouraging-aide-on-russia-dealings-idUSKBN1D02MT|title=Former Trump campaign adviser denies encouraging aide on Russia dealings|last1=Lynch|first1=Sarah N.|last2=Hosenball|first2=Mark|date=October 31, 2017|agency=Reuters|accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Trump announced Papadopoulos as one of his campaign's foreign policy advisers on March 21, 2016, in an interview with the editorial board of ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="ModelUN"/&gt; Trump, reading from a list, said: "He’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy".&lt;ref name=short/&gt;

Employed at that time with the [[London Centre of International Law Practice]] (LCILP), Papadopoulos returned to London and, on March 14, 2016, was part of an LCILP visiting delegation to the [[Link Campus University]] in Rome. There he met [[Joseph Mifsud]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Lee.  "The Maltese Phantom of Russiagate", Real Clear Investiagations, May 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; who was at the time a teacher at the [[University of Stirling]] in Scotland; Mifsud, who was born in Malta, had connections to high-ranking Russian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/george-papadopoulos-who-joseph-mifsud-professor-697441|title=Who is Joseph Mifsud, the professor in the George Papadopoulos investigation?|last=Kutner|first=Max|date=October 31, 2017|work=Newsweek|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="missing"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7213113/joseph-mifsud-missing-dead-trump-russia-probe/|title=Professor accused of being link between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin ‘missing and may be DEAD’|last=Hodge|first=Mark|date=September 9, 2018|work=The Sun|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 24, Papadopoulos met with Mifsud in London, who brought along with him a Russian woman, Olga Polonskaya, whom Mifsud falsely identified as Putin's niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/who-is-george-papadopoulos/index.html|title=Who is George Papadopoulos?|first1=Jeremy|last1=Herb|first2=Marshall|last2=Cohen|publisher=CNN|access-date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drinks/&gt; On April 26, at a breakfast meeting at the Andaz London Liverpool Street hotel, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had information that the Russians have "dirt" on [[Hillary Clinton]] in the form of thousands of e-mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43488581|title=Joseph Mifsud: The mystery professor behind Trump Russia inquiry|last1=Sweeney|first1=John|last2=Bowen|first2=Innes|date=March 21, 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-mueller-papadopoulos-russia-probe-20180817-story.html|title=Mueller says George Papadopoulos lied during Russia probe|last1=Hsu|first1=Spencer S.|last2=Helderman|first2=Rosalind S.|date=August 18, 2018|work=The Washington Post|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In September 2018, a court filing said that Mifsud was "missing", had not been heard from in months, and "may be deceased".&lt;ref name = "missing"/&gt;)

From March to August 2016, Papadopoulos "was identified as having contacts with senior members of the Trump campaign on at least a dozen occasions."&lt;ref name="FactCheck"/&gt; Papadopoulos's wife, then his fiancée, said in 2017 that his job in the campaign was to set up meetings with foreign leaders and that he had been in regular contact with high-ranking campaign officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/george-papadopoulos-fiance-trump-fbi-simona-magiante-2017-12|title=Fiancée of Trump campaign official who lied to FBI says he was 'constantly in touch' with top Trump officials|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos sent emails concerning meeting with Putin to at least seven campaign officials. Clovis, as Trump national campaign co-chairman, encouraged Papadopoulos to fly to Russia to meet with agents of the [[Russian Foreign Ministry]], after Papadopoulos had been told that Russia had "dirt" on Clinton it wanted to share with Trump's campaign.&lt;ref name="who's who"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whos-who-in-the-george-papadopoulos-court-documents/2017/10/30/e131158c-bdb3-11e7-97d9-bdab5a0ab381_story.html |title=Who’s who in the George Papadopoulos court documents |first=Rosalind S. |last=Helderman |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCNewsPlea&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-campaign-adviser-george-papadopoulos-pleads-guilty-lying-n815596 |title=Secret Guilty Plea of Ex-Trump Campaign Adviser George Papadopoulos Reveals Russian Ties |author= Tom Winter and Tracy Connor |publisher= [[NBC News]] | date=October 30, 2017 | accessdate=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTGuilty&gt;{{cite news |first1=Matt |last1=Apuzzo | first2= Michael S. |last2=Schmidt |authorlink1=Matt Apuzzo |authorlink2=Michael S.

On or about May 10, 2016, at London’s Kensington Wine Rooms, Papadopoulos told the top Australian diplomat to the United Kingdom, [[Alexander Downer]], that Russia was in possession of emails relating to Clinton. In July, after the DNC hacking had become known, the Australians told U.S. authorities about Papadopoulos's comment, leading the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] to open a [[counterintelligence]] investigation into the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump presidential campaign]] on July 31, 2016.&lt;ref name=drinks&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/how-fbi-russia-investigation-began-george-papadopoulos.html|title=How the Russia Inquiry Began: A Campaign Aide, Drinks and Talk of Political Dirt|last=LaFraniere|first=Sharon|date=December 30, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 30, 2017|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Apuzzo|first3=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/joe-hockey-discussed-downers-russia-revelations-with-fbi-20180101-h0c58c.html|title=Joe Hockey discussed Alexander Downer's Russia revelations with FBI|last=Wroe|first=David|date=January 2, 2018|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=January 2, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadopoulos later said that he had told the Greek Foreign Minister, Nikos Kotzias, during a meeting in late May 2016, that the Russians had Clinton-related emails. He said his "biggest regret" was not immediately reporting Mifsud's comment to U.S. intelligence, and the "stupidest thing I did was actually gossiping about it with foreign diplomats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/us/politics/george-papadopoulos-interview-trump.html|title=Excerpts From the New York Times Interview With George Papadopoulos|date=September 7, 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenationalherald.com/212864/papadopoulos-told-kotzias-that-the-russians-had-hillarys-emails/|title=Papadopoulos Told Kotzias that the Russians Had Hillary’s Emails|date=September 12, 2018|work=The National Herald|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between March and September 2016, Papadopoulos made at least six requests for Trump or representatives of his campaign to meet in Russia with Russian politicians. In May, campaign chairman [[Paul Manafort]] forwarded one such request to his deputy [[Rick Gates (political consultant)|Rick Gates]], saying "We need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips. It should be someone low-level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."

In an interview about [[Russia–United States relations]] with [[Interfax]] in September 2016, Papadopoulos said that [[Barack Obama]] had failed to follow through on his promises to cooperate with Russia, and asserted that the U.S. had made insufficient joint efforts with Russia against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interfax.com/interview.asp?id=704556|title=George Papadopoulos: Sanctions have done little more than to turn Russia towards China|last=Baygarova|first=Ksenia|date=September 30, 2016|agency=Interfax|access-date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As foreign policy adviser during Trump's campaign, Papadopoulos helped set up a New York meeting between Trump and [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], the Egyptian president.&lt;ref name=drinks/&gt; On January 20, 2017, just hours before Trump was going to be inaugurated, Papadopoulos and incoming [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Reince Priebus]] met with [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Greek Defense Minister]] [[Panos Kammenos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kammenos ‘confident of close cooperation’ with Trump administration|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/215454/article/ekathimerini/news/kammenos-confident-of-close-cooperation-with-trump-administration|publisher=''Kathimerini''|accessdate=November 1, 2017|date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, 2017, shortly following Trump's inauguration as President, Papadopoulos met with the head of Israel's [[Shomron Regional Council]], [[Yossi Dagan]], in Washington D.C.

Senator [[Richard Burr]], the chair of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] that is investigating [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], said in October 2017 that the panel was interested in Papadopoulos because he had sent e-mails attempting to set up meetings between Trump and Putin.&lt;ref name="silva20oct"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silva |first1=Christianna |title=Russia Update: Senate investigators consider meeting with Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos |url=http://www.newsweek.com/russia-update-senate-investigators-consider-meeting-george-papadopoulos-trump-690000|accessdate=October 21, 2017|work=[[Newsweek]] |date=October 20, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recipients of emails about outreach to the Russian government reportedly were Clovis, [[Corey Lewandowski]], Manafort, Gates, representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ivan Timofeev, and others.&lt;ref name="who's who" /&gt;

Papadopoulos was interviewed by FBI agents on January 27, 2017, regarding any Trump campaign connections with Russia.  After the interrogation, Papadopoulos deactivated his [[Facebook]] account, which contained correspondences with Russians, and created a new account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/10/30/george_papadopoulos_charged_by_robert_mueller_was_suspiciously_bad_at_facebook.html |title=The Trump Campaign Adviser Who Pleaded Guilty Was Very Bad at Facebook |first=April |last=Glaser |date=October 30, 2017 |access-date=October 31, 2017 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos was arrested at [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington-Dulles International Airport]] on July 27, 2017, and detained overnight for his arraignment the following day.

The '''Good To Go Tour''' is a British multi-artist package [[concert tour]] that features a mix of established acts from the American punk/rock/ska/pop genres and rising UK bands.

==History==
The first Good To Go Tour took place in October 2005 and presented Southern California's rock superheroes, [[The Aquabats]], in their first tour of England alongside [[Never Heard Of It]], one of the America's most successful wholly independent rock bands. The bill was completed by [[Army of Freshmen]] (who joined for a few dates following a two-week tour with the Grammy nominated [[Bowling for Soup]]), and [[Sonic Boom Six]], Manchester's genre-defying female-fronted rockers.

The tour aims to deliver exciting and diverse line ups so that fans can learn to rely on the Good To Go Tour name to bring them the best in American and British music. "The whole point of this tour," said founder Ed Sellers, "is to have something that fans can look forward to, that they know will bring them interesting and fun line ups. The choices of bands are diverse enough to bring together fans from different musical backgrounds, but close enough that everyone can enjoy an entertaining and exciting show and maybe find a band that they didn't know a lot about before."

The Good To Go Tour also promises to stay true to its support of smaller, independent British bands. As an outlet to offer upcoming UK acts the opportunity to share the stage with established American acts that they might have been influenced by, the tour has given local bands in many towns some great opportunities. It works both ways too, allowing the tour an access to the street level promotion and enthusiastic word of mouth that can be invaluable in building a local buzz amongst fans, particularly with the advent of social networking sites such as [[MySpace]].

==The beginning==
Whilst not called a Good To Go Tour, 2004's Brand New Hero Records Tour was a precursor to what eventually became the Good To Go Tour. In September/October 2004, this twelve date UK tour featured [[The Littlest Man Band]], [[Suburban Legends]] and [[Army Of Freshmen]], who made a return the following year as part of the first Good To Go Tour.

'''govWorks Inc.''' was a [[dot-com company]] that was founded in 1998 by [[Kaleil Isaza Tuzman]], Tom Herman and Chieh Cheung. It went bankrupt when the [[dot-com bubble]] burst in 2000. govWorks's rise and fall is documented in the 2001 [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Startup.com]]''. The firm, originally known as Public Data Systems, produced software to help government clients track contracts and purchasing functions. As the Internet boom accelerated, the company transitioned toward becoming an Internet [[web portal]].

During the company's existence, cities such as [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], showed interest in using its services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Service on Net is Considered for Collecting Taxes and Fees |work=The Buffalo News |date=2000-10-05 |author=Levy, Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey was also conducted by ''[[The Economist]]'' which concluded that people preferred to pay fees owed to the government over the Internet due to its convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Survey of Government and The Internet |work=The Economist |date=2000-06-24 |author=Symonds, Matthew }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, govWorks’ couldn’t overcome some of the most common challenges faced by start-up companies and is ranked by Cnet.com as one of the top ten dot-com failures of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/1990-11136_1-6278387-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210101028/http://www.cnet.com/1990-11136_1-6278387-1.html |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The govWorks website was relaunched in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/308105&lt;/ref&gt; The current iteration of govWorks is related to its predecessor in name only. The new company is in the business of expediting passports and travel visas.


== History ==

The company was founded in May 1998 with 8 employees and was originally known as Public Data Systems.  The service delivery model for govWorks which was inspired by Tuzman after he found a two-year-old parking ticket in his New York City apartment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/1025/entrepreneurs-jumptv-kit-digital-startup-the-sequel.html | work=Forbes | first=Christopher | last=Steiner | title=Startup.com: The Sequel | date=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to offer a service that provided the ability for people to pay city fees through their Internet portal.  The initial launch of govWorks.com online services to select markets occurred in October 1999 in key cities in Massachusetts and Connecticut with a full scale rollout planned in early 2000.

The firm set out to provide a website portal to allow citizens in local communities to access, pay or apply for city services, jobs or receive community information.&lt;ref&gt;http://fcw.com/Articles/1999/09/23/GovWorkscom-launching-link-to-local-services.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other dot-com companies of the time, the services provided by govWorks.com appeared to have a well-defined business plan, a market in need of a service and offered access to city services with ease through their website portal.  However, like so many others, govWorks’ mismanagement, demand for capital, speed to market and a lack of proper service execution eventually contributed to the failure of the company.  In January 2001, Tuzman and his investors sold the company to [[First Data Corporation]].

According to public statements by govWorks.com co-founder Tom Herman, the sale resulted in a loss for the founders and investors.  The company had burned through approximately $60 million in venture capital during its three years of existence.

Just a few months after the founding of govWorks.com, interest in the company was strong and govWorks.com employee count grew to 30 employees as of August 1998 and by October 1998, the company had 70 employees. The Startup.com movie showcased a business culture with energy and excitement; people were interested in joining the company with the hope of getting in at the beginning stages of another dot-com success story.  As additional capital investment came into the company and as the company neared its full scale rollout in 2000, the company expanded further with headcount from 120 employees in January 2000&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documentaryfilms.net: http://www.documentaryfilms.net/Reviews/StartUp/&lt;/ref&gt; to over 250 employees in April 2000.  However, as depicted in the movie, govWorks.com suffered from a number of organizational power struggles&lt;ref&gt;metreo.com: http://www.symphony-metreo.com/news/articles/FT2/FT-Shutdown.html&lt;/ref&gt; and governance issues that would eventually lead to the company’s demise.

Towards the end of 2000, when it was clear that the company was hemorrhaging money and not able to fully execute its planned services, the company dramatically reduced its headcount to 60 employees in November 2000 in an attempt to stem the $1 million per month&lt;ref&gt;metreo.com: http://www.symphony-metreo.com/news/articles/FT2/FT-Shutdown.html&lt;/ref&gt; in overhead expenditures.  The company was sold to First Data Corporation in January 2001.
The documentary film, Startup.com which was released by Artisan in May 2001, won the Grand Prize at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;metreo.com: http://www.symphony-metreo.com/news/articles/FT2/FT-Shutdown.html&lt;/ref&gt; and accumulated $765,000 in initial box office receipts.

== Affiliated Companies ==

Collectively, corporate governance of govworks.com was associated with thirty one (31) for-profit and not-for-profit companies and institutions from a variety of market sectors, including:

[[Chase (bank)|Chase Manhattan]], [[Hyatt Legal Services]], [[Stanford University]], Jackson Securities, [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], New York City Investment Fund, [[Mayfield Fund]], Corradini &amp; Company, The Duberstein Group, [[Barnes &amp; Thornburg]], [[Sapient Corporation]], [[Vestar Capital Partners]], Urban Health Initiative, [[Harvard University]], [[JumpStart]], The ASHOKA Foundation, Public Allies, Kirshenbaum Bond Partners, MassHysteria.com, [[Chrysler Corporation]], Into Networks, Endeavor Fund, [[Sportsline.com]], Vignette, Premier Asset Management, Star Media Networks, Patagon.com, COTESA, S.A. de C.V., Chrysalis Capital, First International Resources Inc., ISI Emerging Markets.

== Competitors ==
One of the strongest competitors to govWorks.com was [[Atlanta]]-based EzGov.com.  As depicted so famously in the movie, co-founder of EzGov Bryan Mundy was invited by Tuzman to come and tour govWorks’ offices prior to either company releasing their software.  Similar to govWorks, EzGov offered software to local governments and municipalities to allow citizens to pay parking tickets, taxes and obtain other city services on-line 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;http://fcw.com/Articles/1999/11/09/Ezgov-launches-nationwide-portal.aspx?p=1&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2001, Mundy and Erin Johansen, 26, of Ontario, Canada died of smoke inhalation during a fire in Mundy's Atlanta, GA home.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.philly.com/2001-01-19/news/25308502_1_e-commerce-solutions-internet-track-team&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to EzGov, govWorks had other competitors; some of whom offered the same or similar service as govWorks but at a much lower cost or in some cases free, as the competitor service models relied on alternate forms of financing versus govWorks’ client-funded approach.

== Bankruptcy Filing ==
In March 2001, govWorks.com officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2001/03/09/govworks-files-for-bankruptcy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the filing, the company listed assets worth an approximate $8 million and liabilities of $40 million from the more than $70 million it raised through venture capital. Boalt Holdings, LLC acquired the domain and brand assets in 2017.

== Current Ownership ==
[https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2018/03/06/4-lessons-cmos-can-learn-from-this-brands-resurrection/#336b0fd96085 govWorks was relaunched] in January 2018.

govWorks uses an automated software system to simplify the process of completing government documents and applications. The govWorks brands [http://PassportCenter.com PassportCenter.com], [http://PassportRenewal.com PassportRenewal.com] and [http://TravelVisa.com TravelVisa.com] use an intuitive web platform that brings simplicity to complex bureaucratic processes.

== Signs and symptoms ==
{{Main|Signs and symptoms of HIV/AIDS}}
There are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency and AIDS.&lt;ref name=AIDS2010GOV/&gt;

=== Acute infection ===
[[File:Symptoms of acute HIV infection.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=A diagram of a human torso labelled with the most common symptoms of an acute HIV infection|Main symptoms of acute HIV infection]]
The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome.&lt;ref name=M121/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; Many individuals develop an [[influenza-like illness]] or a [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis-like illness]] 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diseases and disorders|year=2008|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=Tarrytown, NY|isbn=978-0-7614-7771-6|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HRJOElZch8C&amp;pg=PA25 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include [[fever]], [[lymphadenopathy|large tender lymph nodes]], [[pharyngitis|throat inflammation]], a [[rash]], headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is [[maculopapular]], classically.&lt;ref name=Deut2010/&gt; Some people also develop [[opportunistic infections]] at this stage.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or [[diarrhea]] may occur.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Neurological symptoms of [[peripheral neuropathy]] or [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] also occurs.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt;

Due to their [[Nonspecific symptoms#Types|nonspecific]] character, these symptoms are not often [[Medical diagnosis#Pattern recognition|recognized]] as signs of HIV infection.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; --&gt; Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common [[infectious disease]]s with overlapping symptoms.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; --&gt; Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting with an [[Fever of unknown origin|unexplained fever]] who may have risk factors for the infection.&lt;ref name=M118&gt;Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010). Chapter 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical latency ===
The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV.&lt;ref name=AIDS2010GOV/&gt; Without treatment, this second stage of the [[Natural history of disease|natural history]] of HIV infection can last from about three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evian|first=Clive|title=Primary HIV/AIDS care: a practical guide for primary health care personnel in a clinical and supportive setting|year=2006|publisher=Jacana|location=Houghton [South Africa]|isbn=978-1-77009-198-6|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WauaC7M0yGcC&amp;pg=PA29|edition=Updated 4th |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 20&amp;nbsp;years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles B.

Although most [[HIV-1]] infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cells ([[T helper cell]]s) without [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]] for more than 5 years.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt;&lt;ref name=LT2010/&gt; These individuals are classified as "HIV controllers" or [[long-term nonprogressors]] (LTNP).&lt;ref name=LT2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blankson JN | title = Control of HIV-1 replication in elite suppressors | journal = Discovery Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 46 | pages = 261–6 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20350494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment, known as "elite controllers" or "elite suppressors".&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Walker2007/&gt; --&gt; They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.&lt;ref name=Walker2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker BD | title = Elite control of HIV Infection: implications for vaccines and treatment | journal = Topics in HIV Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 134–6 | date = Aug–Sep 2007 | pmid = 17720999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome===
[[File:Symptoms of AIDS.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=A diagram of a human torso labelled with the most common symptoms of AIDS|Main symptoms of AIDS.]]

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined in terms of either a CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are [[pneumocystis pneumonia]] (40%), [[cachexia]] in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and [[esophageal candidiasis]].&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Other common signs include recurrent [[respiratory tract infection]]s.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt;

&lt;!--Opportunistic infections --&gt;
[[Opportunistic infections]] may be caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], and [[parasite]]s that are normally controlled by the immune system.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmes CB, Losina E, Walensky RP, Yazdanpanah Y, Freedberg KA | title = Review of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-related opportunistic infections in sub-Saharan Africa | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 652–62 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12594648 | doi = 10.1086/367655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person's environment.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; These infections may affect nearly every [[biological system|organ system]].&lt;ref name=Complications2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chu C, Selwyn PA | title = Complications of HIV infection: a systems-based approach | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 395–406 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21322514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--AIDS related cancers --&gt;
People with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[Burkitt's lymphoma]], [[primary central nervous system lymphoma]], and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=Deut2010/&gt; Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20% of people with HIV.&lt;ref name=M169&gt;Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010). Chapter 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The second most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4%.&lt;ref name=M169/&gt; Both these cancers are associated with [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|human herpesvirus 8]] (HHV-8).&lt;ref name=M169/&gt; Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).&lt;ref name=M169/&gt; [[Conjunctiva|Conjunctival cancer]] (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mittal R, Rath S, Vemuganti GK | title = Ocular surface squamous neoplasia - Review of etio-pathogenesis and an update on clinico-pathological diagnosis | journal = Saudi Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–86 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 24227983 | pmc = 3770226 | doi = 10.1016/j.sjopt.2013.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Systemic symptoms --&gt;

== Transmission ==
{{Risk of acquiring HIV}}
HIV is transmitted by three main routes: [[human sexual activity|sexual contact]], significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as [[vertical transmission]]).&lt;ref name=TransmissionM2007/&gt; There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to [[feces]], nasal secretions, saliva, [[sputum]], sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.&lt;ref name=AFP2007k&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kripke C | title = Antiretroviral prophylaxis for occupational exposure to HIV | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–6 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17708137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to be [[Coinfection|co-infected]] by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as [[HIV superinfection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Kuyl AC, Cornelissen M | title = Identifying HIV-1 dual infections | journal = Retrovirology | volume = 4 | pages = 67 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17892568 | pmc = 2045676 | doi = 10.1186/1742-4690-4-67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual ===
&lt;!--Overview --&gt;

Two [[Subtypes of HIV|types of HIV]] have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was originally discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more [[virulence|virulent]], more [[infectivity|infective]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert PB, McKeague IW, Eisen G, Mullins C, Guéye-NDiaye A, Mboup S, Kanki PJ | title = Comparison of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infectivity from a prospective cohort study in Senegal | journal = Statistics in Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 573–93 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12590415 | doi = 10.1002/sim.1342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 as compared with HIV-1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reeves JD, Doms RW | title = Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 83 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1253–65 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12029140 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-83-6-1253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hiv replication cycle.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|HIV replication cycle]]

After the virus enters the body there is a period of rapid [[viral replication]], leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood.&lt;ref name=Piatak&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piatak M, Saag MS, Yang LC, Clark SJ, Kappes JC, Luk KC, Hahn BH, Shaw GM, Lifson JD | title = High levels of HIV-1 in plasma during all stages of infection determined by competitive PCR | journal = Science | volume = 259 | issue = 5102 | pages = 1749–54 | date = March 1993 | pmid = 8096089 | doi = 10.1126/science.8096089 | bibcode = 1993Sci...259.1749P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. The acute [[viremia]] is almost invariably associated with activation of [[cytotoxic T cell|CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells]], which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or [[seroconversion]]. The CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell counts recover. A good CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pantaleo G, Demarest JF, Schacker T, Vaccarezza M, Cohen OJ, Daucher M, Graziosi C, Schnittman SS, Quinn TC, Shaw GM, Perrin L, Tambussi G, Lazzarin A, Sekaly RP, Soudeyns H, Corey L, Fauci AS | title = The qualitative nature of the primary immune response to HIV infection is a prognosticator of disease progression independent of the initial level of plasma viremia | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 254–8 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 8990195 | pmc = 19306 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.1.254 | bibcode = 1997PNAS...94..254P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by depleting [[T helper cell|CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells]]. This weakens the immune system and allows [[opportunistic infection]]s. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases.&lt;ref name="pmid16679064"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hel Z, McGhee JR, Mestecky J | title = HIV infection: first battle decides the war | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 274–81 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16679064 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2006.04.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by [[cytotoxic T cell]]s accounts for CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell depletion, although [[apoptosis]] may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Deenan |last=Pillay |first2=Anna Maria |last2=Genetti |first3=Robin A. |last3=Weiss|editor-first=Arie J. |editor-last=Zuckerman |display-editors=etal  |title=Principles and practice of clinical virology |year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-51799-4|page=905 |chapter=Human Immunodeficiency Viruses |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4il2mF7JG1sC&amp;pg=PA905|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.&lt;ref name="pmid15365095"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehandru S, Poles MA, Tenner-Racz K, Horowitz A, Hurley A, Hogan C, Boden D, Racz P, Markowitz M | title = Primary HIV-1 infection is associated with preferential depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes from effector sites in the gastrointestinal tract | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 200 | issue = 6 | pages = 761–70 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15365095 | pmc = 2211967 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20041196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells express the [[CCR5]] protein which HIV uses as a [[co-receptor]] to gain access to the cells, whereas only a small fraction of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the bloodstream do so.&lt;ref name="pmid15365096"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenchley JM, Schacker TW, Ruff LE, Price DA, Taylor JH, Beilman GJ, Nguyen PL, Khoruts A, Larson M, Haase AT, Douek DC | title = CD4+ T cell depletion during all stages of HIV disease occurs predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 200 | issue = 6 | pages = 749–59 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15365096 | pmc = 2211962 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20040874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[CCR5#CCR5-Δ32|specific genetic change]] that alters the [[CCR5]] protein when present in both [[chromosomes]] very effectively prevents HIV-1 infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olson WC, Jacobson JM | title = CCR5 monoclonal antibodies for HIV-1 therapy | journal = Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 104–11 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19339948 | pmc = 2760828 | doi = 10.1097/COH.0b013e3283224015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV/AIDS is diagnosed via laboratory testing and then staged based on the presence of [[AIDS defining clinical condition|certain signs or symptoms]].&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; HIV screening is recommended by the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] for all people 15&amp;nbsp;years to 65&amp;nbsp;years of age including all pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moyer VA | title = Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 159 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–60 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23698354 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-159-1-201307020-00645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness.&lt;ref name=Deut2010/&gt; In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.&lt;ref name=Deut2010/&gt;

=== HIV testing ===
Most people infected with HIV develop specific [[antibodies]] (i.e. [[seroconversion|seroconvert]]) within three to twelve weeks after the initial infection.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-[[RNA]] or [[P24 antigen#Antigen tests|p24 antigen]].&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Positive results obtained by antibody or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;

Antibody tests in children younger than 18&amp;nbsp;months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of [[Maternal Passive Immunity#Naturally acquired passive immunity|maternal antibodies]].&lt;ref name=ChildDiag2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kellerman S, Essajee S | title = HIV testing for children in resource-limited settings: what are we waiting for? | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = e1000285 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20652012 | pmc = 2907270 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing.&lt;ref name=ChildDiag2010/&gt; In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009, between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status.&lt;ref name=UN2011Eighty&gt;UNAIDS 2011 pg. 70–80&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% of men and women in Sub-Saharan countries were tested&lt;ref name=UN2011Eighty/&gt; which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.&lt;ref name=UN2011Eighty/&gt;

===Classifications===
Two main clinical staging systems are used to classify HIV and HIV-related disease for [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] purposes: the [[WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease]],&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; and the [[CDC classification system for HIV infection]].&lt;ref name=CDCCase2008/&gt; The CDC's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the WHO's staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.&lt;ref name=M121/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDCCase2008/&gt;

The World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; Since then, the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times, with the most recent version being published in 2007.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO case definitions of HIV for surveillance and revised clinical staging and immunological classification of HIV-related disease in adults and children|pages=6–16|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/HIVstaging150307.pdf|format=PDF|year=2007|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-159562-9|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031044253/http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/HIVstaging150307.pdf|archive-date=October 31, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO system uses the following categories:
* Primary HIV infection: May be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;
* Stage I: HIV infection is [[asymptomatic]] with a CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; May include generalized lymph node enlargement.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;
* Stage II: Mild symptoms which may include minor [[Mucous membrane|mucocutaneous]] manifestations and recurrent [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s. A CD4 count of less than 500/µl.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;
* Stage III: Advanced symptoms which may include unexplained [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[diarrhea]] for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung, and a CD4 count of less than 350/µl.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;
* Stage IV or AIDS: severe symptoms which include [[toxoplasmosis]] of the brain, [[candidiasis]] of the [[esophagus]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[bronchus|bronchi]] or [[lung]]s and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. A CD4 count of less than 200/µl.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;

The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV, and updated it in 2008 and 2014.&lt;ref name=CDCCase2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider E, Whitmore S, Glynn KM, Dominguez K, Mitsch A, McKenna MT | title = Revised surveillance case definitions for HIV infection among adults, adolescents, and children aged &lt;18 months and for HIV infection and AIDS among children aged 18 months to &lt;13 years--United States, 2008 | journal = MMWR.

Recommendations and Reports | volume = 63 | issue = RR-03 | pages = 1–10 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24717910 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system classifies HIV infections based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms, and describes the infection in five groups.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Clas/&gt; In those greater than six years of age it is:&lt;ref name=CDC2014Clas/&gt;
* Stage 0: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test
* Stage 1: CD4 count ≥ 500&amp;nbsp;cells/µl and no AIDS defining conditions
* Stage 2: CD4 count 200 to 500&amp;nbsp;cells/µl and no AIDS defining conditions
* Stage 3: CD4 count ≤ 200&amp;nbsp;cells/µl or AIDS defining conditions
* Unknown: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications

For surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.&lt;ref name="M121"/&gt;

In 1983, two separate research groups led by [[Robert Gallo]] and [[Luc Montagnier]] declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallo RC, Sarin PS, Gelmann EP, Robert-Guroff M, Richardson E, Kalyanaraman VS, Mann D, Sidhu GD, Stahl RE, Zolla-Pazner S, Leibowitch J, Popovic M | title = Isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4599 | pages = 865–7 | date = May 1983 | pmid = 6601823 | doi = 10.1126/science.6601823 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..865G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montagnier &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barré-Sinoussi F, Chermann JC, Rey F, Nugeyre MT, Chamaret S, Gruest J, Dauguet C, Axler-Blin C, Vézinet-Brun F, Rouzioux C, Rozenbaum W, Montagnier L | title = Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4599 | pages = 868–71 | date = May 1983 | pmid = 6189183 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.6189183 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..868B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in [[Virus structure|shape]] to other [[human T-lymphotropic virus]]es (HTLVs) his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the [[lymph node]]s of the neck and [[asthenia|physical weakness]], two characteristic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).&lt;ref name="Basavapathruni_2007"/&gt; As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Aldrich R, Wotherspoon G |title=Who's who in gay and lesbian history |year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-22974-6|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KA7_1s6w-QC&amp;pg=PA154 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910.&lt;ref name=Worobey2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Worobey M, Gemmel M, Teuwen DE, Haselkorn T, Kunstman K, Bunce M, Muyembe JJ, Kabongo JM, Kalengayi RM, Van Marck E, Gilbert MT, Wolinsky SM | title = Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7213 | pages = 661–4 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18833279 | pmc = 3682493 | doi = 10.1038/nature07390 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7213/pdf/nature07390.pdf | bibcode = 2008Natur.455..661W }} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of [[colonialism]] and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of [[prostitution]], and the accompanying high frequency of [[genital ulcer disease]]s (such as [[syphilis]]) in nascent colonial cities.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Sousa JD, Müller V, Lemey P, Vandamme AM | title = High GUD incidence in the early 20 century created a particularly permissive time window for the origin and initial spread of epidemic HIV strains | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = e9936 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20376191 | pmc = 2848574 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009936 | editor1-last = Martin | editor1-first = Darren P. | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...5.9936S }}&lt;/ref&gt; While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] causing genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers, to the degree that, as of 1928, as many as 45% of female residents of eastern [[Kinshasa]] were thought to have been prostitutes, and, as of 1933, around 15% of all residents of the same city had [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=Sousa2010 /&gt;

{{main|Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS}}
[[File:Ryan White.jpg|thumb|alt=A teenage male with the hand of another resting on his left shoulder smiling for the camera|[[Ryan White]] became a [[poster child]] for HIV after being expelled from school because he was infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ryan-White |title=Ryan White, an American AIDS Victim |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |date=November 7, 2013 |access-date=July 16, 2015 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722112020/http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ryan-White |archive-date=July 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including [[shunning|ostracism]], [[Social rejection|rejection]], discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior [[consent]] or protection of [[confidentiality]]; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the [[quarantine]] of HIV infected individuals.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS2006Ch4"/&gt; Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name="Ogden"&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Ogden J, Nyblade L |website=[[International Center for Research on Women]] |year=2005 |title=Common at its core: HIV-related stigma across contexts |url=http://www.icrw.org/docs/2005_report_stigma_synthesis.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=February 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217044825/http://www.icrw.org/docs/2005_report_stigma_synthesis.pdf |archive-date=February 17, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories:
* ''Instrumental AIDS stigma''—a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness.&lt;ref name=Herek1999&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Herek GM, Capitanio JP |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |year=1999 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/abs99_sp.pdf |format=PDF |title=AIDS Stigma and sexual prejudice |access-date=March 27, 2006 |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=1130–1147 |doi=10.1177/0002764299042007006 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409034211/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/abs99_sp.pdf |archive-date=April 9, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Symbolic AIDS stigma''—the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease.&lt;ref name="Herek1999" /&gt;
* ''Courtesy AIDS stigma''—stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV/AIDS or HIV-positive people.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Snyder M, Omoto AM, Crain AL |title=Punished for their good deeds: stigmatization for AIDS volunteers |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |year=1999 |pages=1175–1192 |volume=42 |issue=7 |doi=10.1177/0002764299042007009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with homosexuality, [[bisexuality]], [[promiscuity]], prostitution, and [[Intravenous drug use (recreational)|intravenous drug use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=A.K. |title=Population and society |publisher=Concept Pub.

In many [[Developed country|developed countries]], there is [[AIDS and homosexuality|an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality]], and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice, such as [[homophobia|anti-homosexual]]/[[biphobia|bisexual]] attitudes.&lt;ref name="Herek2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herek GM, Capitanio JP, Widaman KF | title = HIV-related stigma and knowledge in the United States: prevalence and trends, 1991-1999 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 92 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–7 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11867313 | pmc = 1447082 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.92.3.371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male-male sexual behavior, including sex between uninfected men.&lt;ref name="Herek1999" /&gt; However, the dominant mode of spread worldwide for HIV remains heterosexual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Cock KM, Jaffe HW, Curran JW | title = The evolving epidemiology of HIV/AIDS | journal = AIDS | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1205–13 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22706007 | doi = 10.1097/QAD.0b013e328354622a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation, it became legal for people with AIDS to marry in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China relaxes laws on love and marriage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1439403/China-relaxes-laws-on-love-and-marriage.html |access-date=October 24, 2013 |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=August 21, 2003 |author=Richard Spencer |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108082647/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1439403/China-relaxes-laws-on-love-and-marriage.html |archive-date=November 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12&amp;nbsp;million [[AIDS orphan]]s.&lt;ref name=M117/&gt; Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.&lt;ref name=Greener&gt;{{Cite book| author = Greener R| year = 2002| title = State of The Art: AIDS and Economics| chapter = AIDS and macroeconomic impact| editor = S, Forsyth| pages = 49–55| publisher = IAEN| url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACP969.pdf| deadurl = no| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121012090520/http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACP969.pdf| archive-date = October 12, 2012| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to work after beginning treatment for HIV/AIDS is difficult, and affected people often work less than the average worker. [[Unemployment]] in people with HIV/AIDS also is associated with [[suicidal ideation]], memory problems, and social isolation. Employment increases [[self-esteem]], sense of dignity, confidence, and [[quality of life]] for people with HIV/AIDS. Anti-retroviral treatment may help people with HIV/AIDS work more, and may increase the chance that a person with HIV/AIDS will be employed (low quality evidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson R, Okpo E, Mngoma N | title = Interventions for improving employment outcomes for workers with HIV | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = CD010090 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26022149 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010090.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for [[government spending|public expenditures]] such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.&lt;ref name=Greener /&gt;

At the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households having a person with HIV/AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.&lt;ref name="WBank"&gt;

Some religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=BBC18102011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|title=Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'|date=October 18, 2011|access-date=October 18, 2011|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018164909/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|archive-date=October 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synagogue Church Of All Nations]] advertised an "anointing water" to promote God's healing, although the group denies advising people to stop taking medication.&lt;ref name=BBC18102011 /&gt;

=== Criminal transmission ===
{{Main|Criminal transmission of HIV}}
Criminal transmission of HIV is the [[intention (criminal law)|intentional]] or [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] infection of a person with the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the United States, have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV-Specific Criminal Laws|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html|website=cdc.gov|access-date=November 22, 2014|date=June 30, 2014|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031203041/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html|archive-date=October 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic.

===Misconceptions===
{{Main|Misconceptions about HIV/AIDS|Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories}}

Several discredited [[conspiracy theories]] have held that HIV was created by scientists, either inadvertently or deliberately. [[Operation INFEKTION]] was a worldwide Soviet [[active measures]] operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS. Surveys show that a significant number of people believed – and continue to believe – in such claims.&lt;ref name="infektion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boghardt|first=Thomas|title=Operation INFEKTION  Soviet Bloc Intelligence and Its AIDS Disinformation Campaign|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/soviet-bloc-intelligence-and-its-aids.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|year=2009|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230328/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/soviet-bloc-intelligence-and-its-aids.html|archive-date=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS research}}
HIV/AIDS research includes all [[medical research]] which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS along with fundamental research about the nature of [[HIV]] as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.

Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral [[health interventions]] such as [[sex education]], and [[drug development]], such as research into [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]], [[HIV vaccines]], and [[antiretroviral drugs]]. Other medical research areas include the topics of [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], [[post-exposure prophylaxis]], and [[circumcision and HIV]]. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/eval/indicators/index.htm|title=Indicators - Program Evaluation - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/community-based-indicators|title=Community-Based Indicators for HIV Programs — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/data/en/|title=Data and statistics|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Hanami'''''|花見||"flower viewing"}} is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying  the transient beauty of flowers; flowers ("hana") are in this case almost always referring to those of the [[cherry]] ("[[sakura]]") or, less frequently, [[Prunus mume|plum]] ("ume") trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=T2blg2Kw_zcC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=hanami#v=onepage&amp;q=hanami&amp;f=false|page=12|title=Introduction to Japanese culture |first= Daniel |last=Sosnoski| publisher= Tuttle Publishing|year= 1996 |isbn= 0-8048-2056-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of March to early May, cherry trees bloom all over Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weathermap.co.jp/sakura/ |title=Cherry blossom forecast|publisher= Weather Map|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around the first of February on the island of [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.okinawastory.jp/en/special/sakura_2011/sakura_index.html |title=Okinawa Cherry Festivals |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722120334/http://www.okinawastory.jp/en/special/sakura_2011/sakura_index.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{Nihongo|blossom forecast|桜前線|sakura-zensen||"[[cherry blossom front]]"}} is announced each year by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency|weather bureau]], and is watched carefully by those planning ''hanami'' as the blossoms only last a week or two.

In modern-day Japan, ''hanami'' mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. In some contexts the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] term {{Nihongo||観桜|kan'ō|view-cherry}} is used instead, particularly for festivals. ''Hanami'' at night is called {{nihongo||夜桜|yozakura||"night sakura"}}. In many places such as [[Ueno Park]] temporary [[paper lantern]]s are hung for the purpose of ''yozakura''.  On the island of Okinawa, decorative electric lanterns are hung in the trees for evening enjoyment, such as on the trees ascending Mt. Yae, near [[Motobu, Okinawa|Motobu Town]], or at the [[Nakijin Castle]].

A more ancient form of ''hanami'' also exists in Japan, which is enjoying the [[plum]] blossoms (梅 ''[[ume]]'') instead, which is narrowly referred to as {{nihongo||梅見|umemi|plum-viewing}}. This kind of ''hanami'' is popular among older people, because they are calmer than the sakura parties, which usually involve younger people and can sometimes be very crowded and noisy.

==History==
{{quote box|align = left|quote=In these spring days,&lt;br&gt;when tranquil light encompasses&lt;br&gt;the four directions,&lt;br&gt;why do the blossoms scatter&lt;br&gt;with such uneasy hearts?|source=[[Ki no Tomonori]] (c. 850 – c. 904)&lt;ref&gt;''Pictures of the heart: the hyakunin isshu in word and image'', University of Hawaii Press, 1996, By Joshua S. Mostow, page 105&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The practice of ''hanami'' is many centuries old. The custom is said to have started during the [[Nara period]] (710&amp;ndash;794) when it was ''[[ume]]'' blossoms that people admired in the beginning. But by the [[Heian period]] (794&amp;ndash;1185), sakura came to attract more attention and ''hanami'' was synonymous with sakura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHf8lxLOYsUC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Hanami+nara#v=onepage&amp;q=Hanami%20nara&amp;f=false|page=12|title=Mizue Sawano: The Art of the Cherry Tree|author= Brooklyn Botanic Garden |publisher= Brooklyn Botanic Garden|year= 2006 |isbn= 1-889538-25-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, in both [[waka (poetry)|waka]] and [[haiku]], "flowers" meant "sakura."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120325x1.html Sakura: Soul of Japan]", "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120325x2.html Petals 'perfect beyond belief' stir poetic]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 25 March 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inoki, Linda, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120325x3.html Tracing the trees in a long national love affair]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 25 March 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hanami'' was first used as a term analogous to cherry blossom viewing in the Heian era [[novel]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Although a [[wisteria]] viewing party was also described, the terms "hanami" and "flower party" were subsequently used only in reference to cherry blossom viewing.

Sakura originally was used to divine that year's harvest as well as announce the rice-planting season. People believed in ''[[kami]]'' inside the trees and made offerings. Afterwards, they partook of the offering with [[sake]].

[[Emperor Saga]] of the Heian period adopted this practice, and held flower-viewing parties with sake and feasts underneath the blossoming boughs of sakura trees in the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]]. [[Poetry|Poems]] would be written praising the delicate flowers, which were seen as a metaphor for life itself, luminous and beautiful yet fleeting and ephemeral. This was said to be the origin of Hanami in Japan.

{{Quote box

The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court, but soon spread to [[samurai]] society and, by the [[Edo period]], to the common people as well. [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts.

The teasing proverb {{Nihongo|''dumplings rather than flowers''|[[wikt:花より団子|花より団子]]|hana yori dango}} hints at the real priorities for most cherry blossom viewers, meaning that people are more interested in the food and drinks accompanying a hanami party than actually viewing the flowers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGb4zNqYj10C&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=%22hana%20yori%20dango%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hana%20yori%20dango%22&amp;f=false |page=175|title=Japanese Proverbs and Sayings |first= Daniel Crump |last=Buchanan |publisher= University of Oklahoma Pres|year= 1973 |isbn= 0-8061-1082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qQPWtyEP23kC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22HANA+YORI+DANGO%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22HANA%20YORI%20DANGO%22&amp;f=false |page=41|title=Tigers, Devils, and Fools: A Guide to Japanese Proverbs |first= Edward |last=Trimnell |publisher= Beechmont Crest Publishing|year= 2004 |isbn= 0-9748330-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees!'' is a popular saying about hanami, after the opening sentence of the 1925 short story "Under the Cherry Trees" by [[Motojirō Kajii]].

==Today==
The Japanese people continue the tradition of ''hanami'', gathering in great numbers wherever the flowering trees are found. Thousands of people fill the parks to hold feasts under the flowering trees, and sometimes these parties go on until late at night. In more than half of Japan, the cherry blossoming days come at the same time as the beginning of school and work after vacation, and so welcoming parties are often opened with ''hanami''. Usually, people go to the parks to keep the best places to celebrate ''hanami'' with friends, family, and company coworkers many hours or even days before. In cities like Tokyo, it is also common to have celebrations under the sakura at night. ''Hanami'' at night is called ''yozakura'' (夜桜, "night sakura"). In many places such as [[Ueno Park]], temporary paper lanterns are hung to have yozakura.

The [[cherry blossom front]] is forecast each year, previously by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] and now by private agencies, and is watched with attention by those who plan to celebrate hanami because the blossoms last for very little time, usually no more than two weeks. The first cherry blossoms happen in the [[subtropical]] southern islands of [[Okinawa]], while on the northern island of [[Hokkaido]], they bloom much later. In most large cities like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, the cherry blossom season normally takes place around the end of March and the beginning of April. The television and [[newspaper]]s closely follow this cherry blossom front, as it slowly moves from South to North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Akasegawa |first= Genpei | authorlink= Genpei Akasegawa |year=2000 | title= Sennin no sakura, zokujin no sakura: Nippon kaibo kiko |language= Japanese |publisher= JTB Nihon Kotsu Kosha Shuppan Jigyokyoku |isbn= 978-4-533-01983-8 |quote=As cherry blossom front comes up, the whole Japan goes into a war; we just can't sit home and let it go.|url=http://www.ktv.co.jp/hanami/2005/daily/050420.html |location=Osaka Seikei University, [[Kyoto]], Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 blossoms were scheduled to open in Fukuoka on March 21st, in Kyoto March 27th, in Tokyo March 26th and Sapporo May 1st. &lt;ref&gt;|url=https://www.foodiesgolocal.com/cuisine-and-culture/the-food-file/hanami-sakura-food-drink-cherry-blossoms.html &lt;/ref&gt;|
The ''hanami'' celebrations usually involve eating and drinking, and playing and listening to music. Some special dishes are prepared and eaten at the occasion, like ''[[dango]]'' and ''[[bento]]'', and [[sake]] is commonly drunk as part of the festivity.

Smaller ''hanami'' celebrations take place in Taiwan, Korea,&lt;!--This is contentious; see Cherry blossom#South Korea --&gt; the Philippines, and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.seoul.go.kr/today/news/event/1243608_3328.html | title=''Spring flower festival events'' | publisher=[[Seoul]] Metropolitan Government | accessdate=August 18, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202003621/http://english.seoul.go.kr/today/news/event/1243608_3328.html | archivedate=February 2, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, ''hanami'' has also become very popular. In 1912, Japan gave 3,000 sakura trees as a gift to the United States to celebrate the nations' friendship. These trees were planted in [[Washington, D.C.]], and another 3,800 trees were donated in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/cherry/cherry-blossom-history.htm |title=HISTORY OF THE CHERRY TREES |publisher=National Park Service, United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sakura trees continue to be a popular tourist attraction, and every year, the [[National Cherry Blossom Festival]] takes place when they bloom in early spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/ | title=National Cherry Blossom Festiva | publisher= Official Site | accessdate=August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Macon, Georgia]], another cherry blossom festival called the [[International Cherry Blossom Festival]] is celebrated every spring. Macon is known as the Cherry Blossom Capital of the World, because 300,000 sakura trees grow there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbfmacon.com/index.php?saturday,_march_24th | title=International Cherry Blossom Festival Online | publisher= Official Site | accessdate=August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], the Annual Sakura [[Matsuri]] Cherry Blossom Festival takes place in May, at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.org/abo/pressroom/special/2007/2007hanami.html |title=''Brooklyn Botanic Garden Celebrates Hanami'' |publisher=Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn, New York |accessdate=August 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808145320/http://www.bbg.org/abo/pressroom/special/2007/2007hanami.html |archivedate=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This festivity has been celebrated since 1981, and is one of the Garden's most famous attractions. Similar celebrations are also held in [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jasgp.org/sakura/ | title=''Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival of Greater Philadelphia'' | publisher= Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia, [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] | accessdate=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other places through the United States.

The largest collection of sakura in the United States is in [[Newark, New Jersey]]'s [[Branch Brook Park]], whose over 5,000 cherry trees of 18 varieties attract 10,000 visitors a day during its annual Cherry Blossom Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.essexcountyparks.org/parks/branch-brook-park/faqs | title=Branch Brook Park FAQs | accessdate=March 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Di Ionno|first1=Mark|title=The story behind Branch Brook Park's cherry blossom trees|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/the_story_behind_branch_brook_parks_cherry_blossom.html|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=The Star-Ledger|date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanami is also celebrated in several European countries. For example, in Finland people gather to celebrate hanami in Helsinki at Roihuvuori. Local Japanese people and companies have donated 200 cherry trees which are all planted in [[Kirsikkapuisto]]. Those cherry trees usually bloom in mid-May.

In [[Rome]], in Italy, the hanami is celebrated in the park of the Eur, where are a lot of cherry trees were donated by Japan in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rerumromanarum.com/2015/04/passeggiata-del-giappone.html|title="Passeggiata del Giappone"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Stockholm there is an annual [http://sivertlindblom.se/folio/offentliga-arbeten/exteriorer/kungstradgarden-norra-delen-1997-98/ &lt;nowiki&gt;festivity in Kungsträdgården [22]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] where a lot of people celebrate hanami.

The IMCTC has stated that its primary objective is to protect Muslim countries from all terrorist groups and terrorist organizations irrespective of their sect and name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UAE joins Muslim military alliance to fight terrorism|url = http://7days.ae/uae-joins-muslim-military-alliance-fight-terrorism/77577|website = 7DAYS UAE|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Turkey joins Saudi-led Islamic military alliance against terrorism |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkey-joins-saudi-led-islamic-military-alliance-against-terrorism_407008.html |website=TodaysZaman |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219094948/http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkey-joins-saudi-led-islamic-military-alliance-against-terrorism_407008.html |archivedate=2015-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UAE joins 34-nation anti-terrorist military coalition {{!}} The National|url = http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/uae-joins-34-nation-anti-terrorist-military-coalition|website = www.thenational.ae|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMCTC affirmed that it would operate in line with the [[United Nations]] and [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) provisions on terrorism.&lt;ref name=Aaj&gt;{{Cite web|title = Islamic military alliance|url = http://aaj.tv/2015/12/islamic-military-alliance/ |website = Aaj News|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the press conference to launch the IMCTC, Mohammad bin Salman said it would "coordinate" efforts to fight terrorism in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. He said, "There will be international coordination with major powers and international organisations ... in terms of operations in Syria and Iraq."&lt;ref name ="Reuters"/&gt;

To date, all members are countries with [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]-dominated governments. The alliance does not include any countries with [[Shia Islam|Shia]]-dominated governments, such as Iran, Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref name=AFP_20151215/&gt; According to a Euronews report, some analysts see formation of the alliance as part of Saudi Arabian efforts to take the leading role in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in [[Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|rivalry with Iran]].&lt;ref name=euronews_20151215/&gt;

In March 2016 it was reported that Saudi Arabia had asked General Raheel Sharif, Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, to become commander-in-chief of the Islamic Military Alliance once he had retired from the Pakistan Army at the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi Arabia 'wants' Gen Raheel Sharif to command 34-nation Saudi alliance |first=Ali |last=Zain |url= https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/headline/is-gen-raheel-sharif-going-to-command-saudi-arabia-led-34-country-anti-terrorism-alliance/ |newspaper=Daily Pakistan |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Saudi Arabia's original announcement of the alliance on 15 December 2015 listed 34 countries as participants,&lt;ref name=formation/&gt; each also a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and forming about 60% of all [[member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC member states]]. As of November, 2017, there are 41 member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://imctc.org/English|title=Home|website=imctc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
;State&lt;br&gt;
*{{flag|Bangladesh}}: Bangladesh was one of the early members to join the alliance doing so on 15 December 2015. The country confirmed its membership in a joint statement by the founder nations that stated "a duty to protect the Islamic nation from the evils of all terrorist groups and organizations whatever their sect and name which wreak death and corruption on earth and aim to terrorize the innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/bangladesh-%E2%80%98joins%E2%80%99-riyadh-based-anti-terrorism-coalition-187609|title=Bangladesh in 34-state Islamic military alliance|date=15 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2015/dec/16/bangladesh-joins-saudi-backed-anti-alliance|title=Bangladesh joins Saudi-backed anti-IS alliance|publisher=[[Dhaka Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samakal.net/2015/12/15/1783|title=Bangladesh joins Saudi-led 'Islamic military alliance'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flag|China}}: China has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the alliance to fighting terrorism and appreciated Saudi efforts to create alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China backs Islamic Military Alliance to fight terrorism|url=http://www.arabnews.com/world/news/852756|accessdate=2015-12-19|work=Arab News|date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flag|Egypt}}: Egypt's [[Al-Azhar University]] called the alliance's formation "historic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's Azhar says Saudi decision to form Islamic military alliance 'historic'|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/173597/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Azhar-says-Saudi-decision-to-form-Islamic-m.aspx|accessdate=17 December 2015|work=Ahram Online|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flag|Germany}}: Germany's defense minister Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the  alliance against terrorism  but also stressed that it should be a part of the Vienna process involving all countries fighting against IS like the U.S., Europe, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, but also including Iran and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Germany welcomes 34-state Islamic military alliance against terrorism|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/r-germany-welcomes-34-state-islamic-military-alliance-against-terrorism-2015-12|website = Business Insider|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flag|Malaysia}}: Malaysian Defence Minister [[Hishammuddin Hussein]] expressed support for the alliance, but ruled out any military support from Malaysia.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

*{{flag|Pakistan}}: After initial ambiguity Pakistan welcomed the initiative; its government confirmed its participation and stated that the country is waiting for further details in order to decide the extent of its participation in the different activities of the alliance. Although the Commander in Chief of the IMCTC, Gen Raheel Sharif only agreed to command upon the condition that Iran must be the part of this Alliance.&lt;ref name="Baqir Sajjad Syed"/&gt;

*{{flag|Turkey}}: Turkey's Prime Minister [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] called it the "best response to those who are trying to associate terror and Islam".

*{{flag|United States}}: The new alliance has been welcomed by the United States, with then U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Ash Carter]] saying, "We look forward to learning more about what Saudi Arabia has in mind in terms of this coalition. But in general it appears it is very much in line with something we've been urging for quite some time, which is greater involvement in the campaign to combat ISIL by Sunni Arab countries.&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Reuters"/&gt;

;Other
* {{flagdeco|Ba'athist Iraq}} [[Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order]]: [[Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri]] the leader of the Naqshbandi Army released a statement in 2016 praising the alliance and calling on what he called [[Mujahideen]] to fight Shia militias in Iraq backed by Iran, while also saying "We consider everything that is happening in Iraq from Iran, its agents, militias, and its security apparatus, is the responsibility of the United States". He added: "If it [U.S.] did not move to save Iraq and its people from Iran's hegemony, control and occupation, and to stop bloodshed, destruction, burning and the changing demographic, then Iraqi people should resist [the occupation]."&lt;ref&gt;http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/04/07/Saddam-s-top-aide-appears-calls-to-line-up-against-Iran.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Due to the dominance of the alliance by states having majority [[Sunni]] Muslim populations, it has been called "a [[Shia–Sunni relations|sectarian coalition]]" by Hakeem Azameli, a member of the Security and Defense Commission in the Iraqi parliament.&lt;ref name=signalng/&gt;&lt;ref name=euronews_20151215&gt;{{cite news|author1=Serguei Doubine |author2=Behnam Masoumi |author3=Riad Muasses|author4=Rita Del Prete|title=What do Russia and Iran think about Saudi Arabia's coalition initiative?|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/12/15/what-do-russia-and-iran-think-about-saudi-arabia-s-coalition-initiative/|accessdate=17 December 2015|work=euronews|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP_20151215&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey joins Sunni 'anti-terrorist' military coalition |url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-joins-sunni-anti-terrorist-military-coalition-.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=92529&amp;NewsCatID=352 |accessdate=17 December 2015|agency=Agence France-Presse |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Oman, an [[Ibadi]]-dominant country and friend of Iran has joined the alliance. Lebanon has also supported the alliance. Other countries who are part of the alliance or support it that have cordial or friendly relations with Iran include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kuwait, Libya, Pakistan and Indonesia. More likely, the absence of Iran and Iraq from the alliance is due to the [[Iran–Saudi Arabia relations|political tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/851666|title=To join alliance, Iran ‘must change policy’|author=|date=17 December 2015|website=arabnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'' story, McCain, who was a member of the Senate Commerce Committee during the period when Iseman was lobbying the committee, developed a close personal relationship with Iseman.&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt; The ''New York Times'' came under intense criticism for the article because of its use of anonymous sources and its timing.

In December 2008, Iseman filed a [[US$]]27 million [[defamation]] lawsuit against ''The New York Times'', alleging that the paper falsely communicated an illicit romantic relationship between her and McCain.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Fletcher |author2=Cooper, Alan |title=BREAKING NEWS: Lobbyist Vicki Iseman files $27M suit against New York Times |url=http://www.valawyersweekly.com/weeklyedition/2008/12/30/lobbyist-vicki-iseman-files-27m-suit-against-new-york-times/ |work=[[Virginia Lawyers Weekly]] |date=30 December 2008 |accessdate=31 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105043018/http://www.valawyersweekly.com/weeklyedition/2008/12/30/lobbyist-vicki-iseman-files-27m-suit-against-new-york-times/ |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Times'' said they "fully stood behind the article" and the story was "true and accurate".&lt;ref name="Johnston A15"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= December 30, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The lawsuit was settled in February 2009 with no money changing hands between the parties. However, as a condition of the settlement ''The New York Times'' printed an unusual "Note to Readers" stating that ''The Times'' had not intended to allege any affair.

==McCain and the FCC==
McCain wrote letters in 1998 and 1999 to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] encouraging it to uphold marketing agreements allowing a television company to control two stations in the same city, a position which Iseman had been advocating on behalf of her client Glencairn Ltd. (now [[Cunningham Broadcasting]]).&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt; McCain also introduced a bill to create tax incentives for minority ownership of stations, which several businesses Iseman represented were seeking.&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt;

In February 1999, McCain and Iseman attended a small fund-raising dinner with several clients at a [[Miami]]- area home of a cruise - line executive, then flew back to Washington along with a campaign aide on the corporate jet of Paxson Communications (now [[ION Media Networks]]), one of her clients.&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt; Later in 1999, Iseman requested McCain to write to the FCC urging it to reach a speedy decision in a case involving Paxson Communications. Iseman, according to an email sent to ''The Times'', provided McCain's staff with the information to write the letter.  McCain's two letters to the FCC resulted in [[William Kennard]], the FCC chairman, issuing a rare public rebuke to McCain for his interference in FCC deliberations.&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt;

McCain also frequently denied requests from Iseman and the companies she represented, including attempts in 2006 to break up cable packages, something opposed by companies she represented. His proposals for satellite distribution of local television stations also failed to match the desires of Iseman's clients.&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt;

Iseman said she never received special treatment from McCain's office, and McCain said he never demonstrated favoritism to Iseman or her clients. During a phone call to [[Bill Keller]], executive editor of ''The New York Times'', he said, "I have never betrayed the public trust by doing anything like that."&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt;

Iseman's clients contributed tens of thousands of dollars to McCain's campaigns.&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt;

==Alleged concerns about alleged romantic relationship with McCain==
{{wikinews|John McCain denies romantic relationship with lobbyist}}
According to ''The Times'' story, Iseman began visiting McCain's offices and campaign events so frequently in 2000 that his aides were "convinced the relationship had become romantic". One staff member supposedly asked, "Why is she always around?"&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt;

According to ''The Times'' narrative, staff aides also worried that McCain's relationship with Iseman would receive negative media attention due to the letters McCain wrote to government regulators on her behalf, especially since McCain's campaign stressed his probity and included proposals for more stringent regulation of [[lobbying in the United States]]. The ''Times'' story never explicitly alleged that an affair took place and Daniel Schnur, McCain's 2000 communication director with no current connection to the campaign, called ''The Times'' account "highly implausible".&lt;ref name="CNN022208" /&gt;

==McCain's aides allegedly intervene to "save McCain from himself"==

''The New York Times'' and ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that unnamed staff members began a campaign to "save McCain from himself" by restricting Iseman's access to McCain during the course of the 2000 presidential primary.  According to the ''Washington Post'' story published the same day as ''The New York Times'' story, Weaver met with Iseman at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)]] to tell Iseman not to see McCain anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Jeffrey H.

Supposedly, an unnamed campaign adviser was instructed to keep Iseman away from McCain at public events, and plans were made to limit her access to his offices. It was reported that campaign associates confronted McCain directly about the risks he was taking with campaign and career. McCain allegedly admitted he was behaving inappropriately and promised to distance himself from Iseman. Concerns about the relationship eventually receded as the campaign continued.&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt;

==Response from McCain's campaign==

On February 20, the night before the article appeared in the printed newspaper, but just after the story was available online, the McCain presidential campaign issued the following statement: "It is a shame that ''The New York Times'' has lowered its standards to engage in a hit-and-run smear campaign. John McCain had a 24-year record of serving our country with honor and integrity. He has never violated the public trust, never done favors for special interests or lobbyists, and he will not allow a smear campaign to distract from the issues at stake in this election. Americans are sick and tired of this kind of gutter politics, and there is nothing in this story to suggest that John McCain has ever violated the principles that have guided his career."&lt;ref name="NYT022108" /&gt; A McCain campaign adviser added that the report "reads like a tabloid gossip sheet".&lt;ref name="FOX02210"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert S. Bennett]], whom McCain had hired to represent him in this matter, defended McCain's character. Bennett, a registered Democrat, was the special investigator during the [[Keating Five]] scandal that ''The Times'' revisited in the article. Bennett, who was coincidentally on Fox News' ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'' program to promote his autobiography shortly after the paper published the story on their website, said that he fully investigated McCain back then and suggested to the [[Senate Ethics Committee]] to not pursue charges against McCain.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And if there is one thing I am absolutely confident of, it is John McCain is an honest and honest man. I recommended to the Senate Ethics Committee that he be cut out of the case, that there was no evidence against him, and I think for the New York Times to dig this up just shows that Senator McCain's public statement about this is correct. It's a smear job. I'm sorry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bob Bennett Reacts to New York Times Story on John McCain | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331651,00.html| accessdate = 2008-02-25 | date = February 21, 2008 |publisher = Fox News Channell |author1=Sean Hannity |author2=Alan Colmes }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCain spoke in a press conference the following day saying, "I'm very disappointed in the article. It's not true." He stated he never showed favoritism for her clients: "At no time have I ever done anything that would betray the public trust." He went on to characterize Iseman as a friend but no closer than other lobbyists. Both he and his wife strenuously denied any impropriety. He said he wasn't aware of the meeting Weaver had with Iseman nor of any concerns among his staff about his association.&lt;ref name="WP022108"&gt;{{cite web

==Ethics of publication questioned ==

''The Times''' decision to publish the article while relying almost entirely on anonymous sources has raised ethical questions relating to the story's veracity and importance.

[[George Stephanopoulos]], an ''[[ABC News]]'' correspondent, said that — while damaging — as long as the sources remain anonymous this story will not throw the campaign off course. He quoted McCain aides that they will go after ''The New York Times'' "with extreme aggression — if the newspaper was going to act like a partisan they were going to treat them as a partisan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' publisher [[Mort Zuckerman]] said, "I don't think that there is enough acknowledged sourcing for this story." Commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] raised the question about why the paper had endorsed McCain on January 25, 2008 for the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] nomination if they had information that alleged an inappropriate relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Several [[conservative]] voices, who had recently criticized McCain, came to his defense. [[L.

== Follow-up article ==
On February 23, ''The New York Times'' followed up their original article with an article on McCain's efforts to help a client of Iseman's before the FCC. According to the article, "In late 1998, Senator John McCain sent an unusually blunt letter to the head of the Federal Communications Commission, warning that he would try to overhaul the agency if it closed a broadcast ownership loophole."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/us/politics/23lobby.html?pagewanted=print Files and McCain Letter Show Effort to Keep Loophole] By STEPHEN LABATON February 23, 2008 ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Former staffer to President [[Bill Clinton]] and current [[Hillary Clinton]] supporter [[Lanny Davis]] said the article "had no merit". Stating that he did not support McCain's bid for the White House, Davis, who had himself lobbied for the same cause Iseman lobbied McCain for, said that McCain only wrote a letter to the FCC to ask them to "act soon" and refused to write a letter that supported the sale of the television station the article talked about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = McCain disputes report of lobbyist relationship | url=http://washingtontimes.com/article/20080222/NATION/813344605/1002| accessdate = 2008-02-25 | date = February 22, 2008 |publisher = The Washington Times|author1=Ralph Z.

== Defamation lawsuit and settlement ==
In December 2008, Iseman filed a [[US$]]27 million [[defamation]] lawsuit against ''The New York Times'', alleging that the paper falsely communicated an illicit romantic relationship between her and McCain.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt;  ''The Times'' said they "fully stood behind the article" and the story was "true and accurate".&lt;ref name="Johnston A15"/&gt;

In February, 2009, the lawsuit was settled with no money changing hands between the parties. From ''The Times'' coverage of the settlement: "On Thursday, the two sides released a joint statement saying: 'To resolve the lawsuit, Ms. Iseman has accepted The Times's explanation, which will appear in a Note to Readers to be published in the newspaper on Feb. 20, that the article did not state, and The Times did not intend to conclude, that Ms. Iseman had engaged in a romantic affair with Senator McCain or an unethical relationship on behalf of her clients in breach of the public trust.' That statement was published on The Times's Web site, as was a statement from Ms. Iseman's lawyers. They wrote, in part: 'Had this case proceeded to trial, the judicial determination of whether she is entitled to the protections afforded a [[privacy|private citizen]] would have been the subject of a ferocious, pivotal battle, with Ms. Iseman insisting on her status as a private person and The New York Times asserting that she had entered the [[public figure|public arena]], and was therefore fair game.'" (The public/private Wikipedia links provided in the quote are for information, not legal, purposes.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/business/media/20lawsuit.html?scp=4&amp;sq=iseman%20settlement&amp;st=cse "Libel Suit Against The Times Ends"] by Richard Pérez-Peña, ''The New York Times'', Feb. 19, 2009. Retrieved 2-22-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Iseman's lawyers for the published the statement were [[Rodney A. Smolla]] is an attorney, and Dean of the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]]. W. Coleman Allen, Jr. is a trial lawyer with [[Allen, Allen, Allen &amp; Allen]], based in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/business/media/20lawyers.html?ref=media "Statement From Iseman’s Lawyers"] ''The New York Times'', Feb. 19, 2009. Retrieved 2-22-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iseman spoke out personally against ''The New York Times'' story for the first time during a March 2, 2009, interview on ''[[The Early Show]]'', where she vehemently denied having an affair with McCain, and said of the story, "Any assertions that there was anything inappropriate, ethically or professionally or personally are just not true."&lt;ref name="CBS0302"&gt;{{Citation  | title = Lobbyist Denies Affair With McCain | newspaper = [[CBS News]]  | date = 2009-03-02  | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/02/earlyshow/main4837723.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iseman criticized the way the story was handled, and felt the newspaper became so invested in proving it was true that it became "out of control." She also said the entire story appeared to be based on a single source, who she claimed was John Weaver, a McCain political consultant she believed was offended when Iseman criticized a speech Weaver may have written. She said of Weaver's influence on the story, "[it] all went back to one singular person, a political operative who had left the senator's campaign under acrimonious circumstances. ... All roads lead back to him."&lt;ref name="CBS0302" /&gt; Weaver, who was quoted in the original ''Times'' story saying he met with Iseman after concerns were raised about her presence in the campaign, previously said he did not speak to the paper without permission from the McCain campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cillizza |first=Chris |title=The Fix: John Weaver Speaks |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2008-02-21 |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/02/john_weaver_speaks.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015125651/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/02/john_weaver_speaks.html |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6279">'''Kneecapping''' is a form of malicious wounding, often as [[torture]], in which the victim is injured in the [[knee]]. The injury is typically inflicted by a low-velocity [[ballistic trauma|gunshot]] to the [[popliteal fossa|knee pit]] with a [[handgun]]. The term is considered a misnomer by medical professionals because only a very small minority of victims suffer damage to the [[patella|kneecap]]. A review of eighty kneecapping victims found that only two had a fractured kneecap. Some victims have their [[elbow]]s and [[ankle]]s shot as well.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|pp=740–741}}

== Treatment ==
The severity of the injury can vary from simple [[soft tissue]] damage to a knee joint fracture with [[neurovascular bundle|neurovascular]] damage. The latter requires several weeks in hospital and intensive [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient]] [[physical therapy|physiotherapy]] for recovery.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|pp=740–741}} If the damage is too great, [[amputation]] might be necessary,{{sfn|Williams|1997|p=79}} but this rarely occurs. In Northern Ireland thirteen individuals had their legs amputated as a consequence of limb punishment shootings over the duration of [[the Troubles]].{{sfn|Graham|Parke|2004|p=229}} In the long term it is estimated that one out of five victims will walk with a [[limp]] for the rest of their lives.{{sfn|Conroy|1980}}

== History ==
During [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], paramilitaries considered themselves to be law enforcers in their own areas. They used limb punishment shootings to punish drug pushers and child molesters. If the crime was considered to be grave, the victim was also shot in the ankles and elbows, leaving them with six gunshot wounds (colloquially known as a six pack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Duncan|title=Northern Ireland kneecapping victim 'shot four times'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/10056251/northern-ireland-kneecapping-victim-shot-four-times|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=BBC Newbeat|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2,500 people were victims of these punishment shootings through the duration of the conflict. Those who were attacked carried a [[social stigma]] with them.{{sfn|Williams|1997|pp=78–80}}

The [[Red Brigades]], an [[Italy|Italian]] militant organization, employed these punishment shootings to warn their opponents. They used the method to punish at least 75 people up to December 1978.{{sfn|Orsini|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8dx0xaO__78C&amp;pg=PT13 13], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8dx0xaO__78C&amp;pg=PT121 121]}} More recently this kind of punishment shooting has been employed by [[Hamas]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] to silence their political opponents.{{sfn|Amnesty International UK|2009}}{{sfn|Amnesty International Ireland|2009|p=3}}

The [[Bangladesh Police]] have started kneecapping in the country since 2009 to punish the opposition and preventing them from participating in protests against the government. [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) has published a report on kneecapping in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/29/bangladesh-stop-kneecapping-detainees|title=Bangladesh: Stop ‘Kneecapping’ Detainees|date=29 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In The [[United Kingdom]] although not too common apart from [[Northern Ireland]], when kneecappings have occurred elsewhere a sawn-off or double barrelled shotgun is more likely the choice of firearm due to its easy availability over other weapons among criminals.

==Use as metaphor==
As a [[metaphor]]  "kneecapping" suggests being limited by external imposition in a way that prevents full freedom of movement or utilization of resources.

[[File:Irma_2017-09-06_1745Z.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Hurricane Irma]] is the most powerful tropical cyclone ever recorded in the British Virgin Islands.]]
The '''list of British Virgin Islands hurricanes''' includes all [[tropical cyclone]]s which have struck the [[British Virgin Islands]] which caused at least hurricane force winds ({{convert|74|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on|lk=out}} or greater) to affect at least some part of the Territory.  Hurricanes which passed close to the Territory but which only caused wind speeds of tropical storm force or below are not included.  

Every known hurricane to strike the Territory except one ([[Hurricane Lenny]], 1999) or possibly two (hurricane of 1916) have been [[Cape Verde hurricane]]s.  As a result, even though hurricane season technically runs from 1 June through 30 November, virtually all of the hurricane strikes occur in the month of September.&lt;ref&gt;Since 1900 the only exceptions to this have been Hurricane Bertha and Hurricane Jose (and Hurricane Lenny, which was a non-Cape Verde hurricane).&lt;/ref&gt;  

For the period that reasonably reliable records exist, hurricanes strike the Territory on average approximately once every 8 years, although that includes strikes which only affected the northernmost (and lightly populated) island of [[Anegada]].  

In the twentieth century the British Virgin Islands experienced 13 hurricanes, but they came largely in two clusters.  The Territory experienced five hurricanes from 1916 to 1932 (inclusive), and then only one during the next 57 years.  But then between 1989 and 1999 (inclusive) seven hurricanes struck the Territory (including six in the space of four years from 1995-1999).  That was then followed by another 11 year hiatus without any hurricane strikes.  

Twice in recent times the Territory has experienced a rapid double-strike: in 1995 [[Hurricane Luis]] was followed nine days later by [[Hurricane Marilyn]], and in 2017 [[Hurricane Irma]] was followed fourteen days later by [[Hurricane Maria]].

[[File:Croke park 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A rugby union match taking place at [[Croke Park]] during the 2007 Six Nations Championship]]
The following is a list of non-[[Gaelic games]] played at [[Croke Park]] (formerly ''Jones's Road''). The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] formerly prohibited the playing of ''[[List of Gaelic Games terminology#F|foreign sports]]'' at GAA-owned stadiums under [[Rule 42]] of its rule book.
{{Quote|Grounds controlled by Association units shall not be used or permitted to be used, for horse racing, greyhound racing, or for field games other than those sanctioned by Central Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaelicfootball.eusu.ed.ac.uk/documents/GAA%20Official%20Guide%202003.pdf 2003 GAA Guide showing pre-2005 wording of Rule 42] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816230315/http://gaelicfootball.eusu.ed.ac.uk/documents/GAA%20Official%20Guide%202003.pdf |date=16 August 2011 }} University of Edinburgh GFC. Retrieved on 17-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;|Rule 42|''GAA rule book''}}

While this wording remains as the current Rule 5.1(b), a footnote now reads:
{{Quote|(Note: Central Council shall have the power to authorise the use of Croke Park for games other than those controlled by the Association.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2011_Part_1.pdf Current GAA rules, p56] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606232335/http://gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2011_Part_1.pdf |date=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Rule 5.1(b)|''Official Guide''}}

In practice the rule was only applied to the sports of [[association football|soccer]] and [[rugby union|rugby]], which were perceived to be rivals to the playing of Gaelic games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/the-odd-couple-soccer-and-gaa-remain-bitter-enemies-51143.html The odd couple: Soccer and GAA remain bitter enemies] The [[Irish Independent]]. Published on 24-03-07. Retrieved on 24-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cricket]] was also banned, but Croke Park is too small for a cricket field. As such, several games of [[American football]] have been played with rule 42 in force, as well as a boxing match and a baseball game. The rule was officially relaxed in 2005 for the duration of the reconstruction of [[Lansdowne Road]], to allow for the playing of Republic of Ireland [[Republic of Ireland national football team|soccer]] and Irish [[Ireland national rugby union team|rugby]] internationals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0416/gaa.html GAA Congress Rule 42 decision welcomed] [[RTÉ]].ie. Published on 16-04-05. Retrieved on 24-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic of Ireland soccer and Ireland rugby internationals moved into the new [[Aviva Stadium]] on the former Lansdowne Road site upon its opening in May 2010; the last international in either sport at Croke Park was the rugby team's [[2010 Six Nations Championship|2010 Six Nations]] home fixture with [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] on 20 March.

On 17 June 2010 the [[Australia national cricket team]] had a training session in Croke Park ahead of their [[One Day International]] against [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2010/0520/265330-crokepark_australia/ RTÉ report of Australian cricket visit]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Man, the State, and War''''' is a 1959 book on [[international relations]] by [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] academic [[Kenneth Waltz]]. The book is influential within the field of [[international relations theory]] for establishing the three 'images of analysis' used to explain conflict in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Kenneth N. Waltz's Political Realism Wins James Madison Lifetime Achievement Award In Political Science|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/00/03/kennethWaltz.html|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=25 April 2012|author=Jason Hollander|date=Mar 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waltz's three images of international relations==
Waltz's initial contribution to the field of international relations was his 1959 book, ''Man, the State, and War'', which classified theories of the [[causes of war]] into three categories, or levels of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Kenneth N. Waltz's Political Realism Wins James Madison Lifetime Achievement Award In Political Science|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/00/03/kennethWaltz.html|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=25 April 2012|author=Jason Hollander|date=Mar 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waltz refers to these levels of analysis as "images," and uses the writings of one or more classic political philosophers to outline the major points of each image. Each image is given two chapters: the first mainly uses the classical philosopher's writings to describe what that image says about the cause of war; the second usually consists of Waltz analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of that image.

===First image: Individuals===

The first image argues that wars are often caused by the nature of particular statesmen and political leaders such as state leaders -- examples like [[Napoleon]] or [[Saddam Hussein]] -- or by human nature more generally. This is basically consistent with [[Classical realism (international relations)|Classical Realism]], which dominated the International Relations discipline at the time of ''Man, the State, and War'' but which Waltz would contest more fully in his next book, ''[[Theory of International Politics]]''.

===Second image: States===

Theories of war that fall under the rubric of Waltz's second image contend that wars are caused by the domestic makeup of states. A prime example that Waltz refers to is [[Lenin]]'s theory of [[imperialism]], which posits that the main cause of war is rooted in the need for [[capitalist]] states to continue opening up new markets in order to perpetuate their economic system at home. A more familiar example in the Western world today is the notion that non-democratic states, because of their internal composition, start wars.

===Third image: International system===

Waltz next assesses the first two images as being less influential in general than the third image, yet ultimately necessary in understanding the causes of War. Waltz concludes his 1959 book ''Man, the State, and War'' with a final explanation of the three images. The third image describing the framework of world politics and the first and second, determining the forces that create the policies of a state. The third image posits that the cause of war is found at the systemic level; namely, that the [[anarchy (international relations)|anarchic]] structure of the international system is the root cause of war. In this context, "anarchy" is not defined as a condition of chaos or disorder but rather one in which there is no sovereign body that governs the interactions between autonomous nation-states. Put differently, unlike in domestic society where citizens can theoretically rely on law enforcement agencies to protect their persons and property, if a state is invaded and calls "911" it can't be sure anyone will answer. Similarly, whereas when two citizens have a dispute they can appeal to the courts to render a verdict and, more importantly, the law enforcement agencies to enforce the court's ruling, there is no body above nation-states that is capable of: establishing rules or laws for all the states, deciding how these apply in specific cases, and compelling the states to honor the court's ruling. As a result, if an issue at stake is important enough to a state, it can achieve a satisfactory outcome only by using its [[Power (international relations)|power]] to impose its will on another state(s). The realization that, at any point in time any state can resort to armed force, forces each state always be prepared for that contingency. These themes are fleshed out more fully in ''Theory of International Politics'' which, as the title suggests, lays out a theory for international politics as a whole rather than the narrower focus on what causes war.

In October 2009, Dennis LeRoy Anderson of [[Proctor, Minnesota|Proctor]], [[Minnesota]] received widespread media attention for being arrested in a [[Driving under the influence|DWI]] case involving a '''motorized recliner'''.&lt;ref name="LCN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Riding a [[recliner]] which he had earlier fitted with a lawnmower engine, Anderson crashed into a car after leaving a local bar, where he had drunk a number of beers. The driver was convicted and the chair was confiscated by the police. The police auctioned the recliner away on Do-Bid.com for $3,700, which was much less than the price it had originally seemed to generate. Though widely reported to be a [[La-Z-Boy]], the chair was in fact not of this brand.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

==Incident==
62-year-old Dennis LeRoy Anderson fitted his recliner with a lawnmower engine, wheels and steering wheel, which allowed the chair to reach up to 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) per hour.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He had also installed a stereo, cup holders, headlights and a power antenna. On August 31, 2009, he left a local bar in [[Proctor, Minnesota|Proctor]], [[Minnesota]], after having drunk eight or nine beers, and crashed into a car in the parking lot. When the police picked him up, his [[blood alcohol content]] was measured at 0.29 percent. Anderson was sentenced to 180 days in jail and was fined $2,000. The jail time, and half the fine, was made [[probation]]al.&lt;ref name="FindLaw"/&gt;

According to Minnesota law, a "motor vehicle" is taken to mean "every vehicle that is self-propelled and every vehicle that is propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires."&lt;ref name="FindLaw"/&gt; This means that a driver of any motorized vehicle, even a recliner, is liable under DWI legislation. Anderson's blood alcohol content was three times over the legal limit for the state. In addition to this, vehicles can also be confiscated if the driver has a blood alcohol level over 0.2, or has a prior DWI conviction from the last 10 years. Anderson, in addition to having a blood alcohol level well over that limit, also had a prior conviction.&lt;ref name="FindLaw"/&gt;

==Auction==
On October 29, Proctor police put the seized chair up for auction on [[eBay]], as a motorized [[La-Z-Boy]].&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt; The auction was to run for five days, with an opening bid at $500. By November 2{{spaced ndash}}one day before bidding was to end{{spaced ndash}}the item had reached $43,700. It was then that the police department was contacted by La-Z-Boy corporation pointing out that the chair was not their product and request that the description to be accordingly changed. The police had simply used the description employed by the media. The request was fulfilled but eBay pulled the item from their listings, and the listing had to start anew.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The chair was finally auctioned off successfully for a third time. A Duluth area resident placed the winning $3,700 bid. The chair had been put up for online auction twice before, but those sales fell through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegazette.com/2010/04/21/minnesotas-dwi-chair-auctioned-for-3700/ Minnesota’s ‘DWI chair’ auctioned for $3,700 | TheGazette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18979">The '''Münster Diocesan Feud''' ({{lang-de|Münsterische Stiftsfehde}}), or simply '''Münster Feud''', was a dispute that took place between 1450 and 1457 over the appointment to the [[Bishopric of Münster|bishop's throne in Münster]], and hence the rule of the [[Diocese of Münster|diocese]]. The opposing candidates were [[Walram of Moers]] and [[Eric I of Hoya|Eric of Hoya]]. They were supported by their families with Count [[John V of Hoya|John of Hoya]] and Archbishop [[Dietrich II of Moers]] at their respective heads. In addition, there were also external allies. Within the diocese the ''[[Stände]]'', namely the [[cathedral chapter]] and the town of [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]], played an independent role at times. In the end neither candidate was able to succeed to the office.

== Background ==
[[File:Moers-Grafschaft.png|thumb|189px|Coat of arms of the counts of Moers]]
[[File:Hoya-wappen.png|thumb|189px|Coat of arms of the counts of Hoya]]
The Diocese of Münster was one of the largest and most important ecclesial territories in the northwest German area. In the [[Late Middle Ages]] the bishop's thrones in the region were predominantly filled by members of comital families or the families of hereditary [[noblemen]] (''Edelherren''). These families, like the [[County of Mark|counts of the Mark]], attempted to secure episcopal seats for their sons. Even less powerful families took the opportunity to increase their influence, at least occasionally, over an ecclesial territory. To this group belonged the [[House of Lippe|lords of Lippe]], who occupied the bishop's throne in [[Bishopric of Paderborn|Paderborn]] several times. The [[County of Hoya|counts of Hoya]] were successful in the [[Bishopric of Osnabrück]]. In the [[Bishopric of Minden]] this was true of the houses of [[County of Diepholz|Diepholz]] and [[Schaumburg-Lippe|Schaumburg]]. In the mid-15th century, however, the [[County of Moers|counts of Moers]] were foremost in this regard. Especially after [[Dietrich of Moers]] had become [[Archbishop of Cologne]], the family was able to secure the majority of the bishop's seats in the northwest German area. Their main rival in the Bishopric of Münster was the Hoya family.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, some of the [[prince-bishop]]s, most recently [[Otto IV of Hoya]], had expanded their territory and got rid of smaller internal lordships. By contrast it was clear that the bishops in the 13th and 14th centuries had largely lost control of their capital, Münster. The city acted independently almost as if it were a rich [[imperial immediacy|imperially immediate]] city. In addition, the ''[[Stände]]'', the [[cathedral chapter]], knights and towns had gained influence and sharply reduced the power of the bishops.

After the death of Bishop Otto IV, Dietrich of Moers succeeded in getting his brother, [[Henry II of Moers]], into the Münster bishopric against the will of the city of Münster. After the archbishop, due to internal diocesan disputes, had secured the Bishopric of Osnabrück for Erich of Hoya, he placed Henry there as administrator. He oriented his policy sharply towards his brother's interests and supported him strongly during the [[Feud of Soest]]. The House of Hoya, who also held the bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Verden|Verden]] and Minden, saw the counts of Moers as intruders in their own area of interest. Apart from the [[Archdiocese of Cologne]], Münster and Osnabrück, the House of Moers ruled Paderborn and parts of the [[Bishopric of Utrecht]]. The warlike stance of Henry in supporting his brother did not help the diocese, rather it resulted in a sharp increase in its debt and a decline in prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 171–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Start of the conflict ==
Within the diocese, the estates were in open revolt by Henry's death. From now on, the aspirations of the House of Moers ran into resistance. Despite that, Dietrich did everything possible to continue to occupy Münster with a member of his family. As a successor he had provided his brother Walram of Moers, but this brought him into conflict with the House of Hoya. John of Hoya had not forgotten that Dietrich of Moers was exchanged for members of his family. In particular, he had not forgotten his own six years imprisonment in connection with the fighting around Osnabrück. He wanted to make his brother, Erich of Hoya, successor.

In addition to the two main rivals for the episcopacy, there were other contenders. The town of Osnabrück strongly supported [[Conrad III of Diepholz|Conrad of Diepholz]]. He was the [[cathedral provost]] (''Dompropst'') in Osnabrück and a nephew of the Bishop of Utrecht, [[Rudolph of Diepholz]]. He supported the candidacy, but arrived too late to actively promote his nephew.

Dietrich of Moers gave away large bribes to win a majority in the cathedral chapter for his brother. He had, until recently been a supporter of the [[Council of Basel]], before he changed sides to the Roman [[curia]]. Dietrich succeeded in getting the majority of the cathedral chapter on side at a meeting in [[Hausdülmen]] on 15&amp;nbsp;July 1450. But John of Hoya campaigned for his brother, Erich. He won over the citizens of the city of Münster and the nobility to his cause. Within the city he was mainly supported by the guilds and the commoners, while the hereditary patricians on the council did not want confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

John of Hoya was elected by the secular estates as the diocesan administrator (''Stiftsverweser''). He was to officiate until the Pope had appointed a bishop acceptable to both citizens and lords. In a letter to the Pope they explained their reasons for this unusual procedure were that Walram was allegedly responsible for two murders as well as other crimes in the past. By contrast, Erich of Hoya had led a supposedly blameless life and had had an academic education. A minority of thirteen canons and all the clergy of the city supported this position. In Osnabrück, John of Hoya, succeeded his brother [[Albert of Hoya]] to become the administrator. Thus, the position of the family was further strengthened in the battle for the Diocese of Münster.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 176&lt;/ref&gt;

As administrator, John of Hoya brought most of Münster's [[royal castle]]s (''Landesburgen'') under his control. In order to reduce his own costs as far as possible, he seized the estates of the bishop and income of the [[cathedral canon]]s (''Domherren''). In addition, he introduced an [[excise duty]] on trade goods. The supporters of Walram in the cathedral chapter were prepared to negotiate in this eventuality. An agreement was reached that the Hoyas largely honoured, according to which at the next ''[[Landtag]]'' all the estates would appeal to the Pope to award the office of bishop to Erich of Hoya. In return the canons were guaranteed their former rights and income. The ''Landtag'' approved this arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann I von Kleve (1419-1481).jpg|thumb|John of Cleves was one of the most important supporters of the Hoya party.]]
In January 1451, John of Hoya captured [[Hausdülmen|Dülmen Castle]] which had opposed him. Meanwhile, in ignorance of the unanimous support of the estates for Hoya, Pope [[Pope Nicholas V]] had appointed Walram of Moers as bishop. The town of responded to this by asking for a legal opinion from the [[University of Erfurt]]. Their judgement was that the estates did not have to accept the decision of the Pope because the Pope would not have known of Walram's unsuitability for the post.&lt;ref name="Kohl_177"&gt;Kohl (1999), 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoya family were also supported by the [[Duchy of Cleves]]. Duke [[John I of Cleves-Mark|John of Cleves]] hoped thereby to weaken the power of the Archbishop of Cologne. On 11&amp;nbsp;June 1451, the Treaty of Haus Dülmen was signed, sealing an alliance between Cleves and John of Hoya. As a reward for his support in the battle against Walram of Moers Cleves was given the estates of Dülmen and [[Stromberg Castle|Stromberg]]. Cleves was not just a valuable military ally. Also important was his advocacy through [[Philip III of Burgundy|Philip of Burgundy]], an uncle of the duke, in Rome. Following the signing of the treaty, Cleves declared war on Walram of Moers.&lt;ref name="Kohl_177"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the role of Burgundy see: ''Burgund und das Reich: Spätmittelalterliche Außenpolitik am Beispiel der Regierung Karls des Kühnen (1465–1477).'' Munich, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day news arrived in Münster that Emperor [[Frederick III (HRR)|Frederick III]] had conferred the [[regalia]] on Walram. After Walram had also received Papal confirmation, he removed several of his opponents from their high church offices and had the supporters of his opponent placed under a Papally-ordained [[interdict]]. Those affected appealed again to the University of Erfurt. The university judged the measures taken by Walram and the Archbishop of Cologne to be invalid. Philip of Burgundy intervened on behalf of the Hoya faction, writing a letter to Rome. Before taking any further steps, Rome decided to wait and see what position [[Nicholas of Cusa]] would take in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outbreak of fighting == 
[[File:Nicholas of Cusa.jpg|thumb|Cusa failed in his attempt to prevent an outbreak of fighting on behalf of the Pope.]]
Meanwhile, in the diocese, the feud broke out in the form of smaller operations. Most of the [[Upper Diocese of Münster|upper diocese]] was subsequently dominated by the Hoya faction; Walram only possessed the area around [[Ahaus]], [[Vreden]] and [[Ottenstein (Ahaus)|Ottenstein]].

Nicholas of Cusa was probably expected to instruct the Pope to replace both the earlier episcopal candidates with Conrad of Diepholz. Nicholas of Cusa, however, expressed opposition to the Hoyas. With the fall of Vreden, Walram also lost his last town in the Diocese of Moers. He notified Cusa on 21 January 1452 of his willingness to renounce the bishopric, provided it was possible to remove keep the Hoyas out and to make Conrad of Diepholz bishop instead.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter was supported ''inter alia'' by his uncle, Bishop Rudolph of Utrecht. From now on the Hoyas encountered increasingly strong military action, for example at the Siege of Ahaus. At the start of 1452 a mercenary arm defeated Hoya and the Münster troops and took large numbers of prisoners. On 2&amp;nbsp;February the supporters of Diepholz declared a feud against their opponents. Walram pledged the latter the remaining settlements he owned - Ahaus and Ottenstein - to Rudolph of Utrecht. In the diocese itself, sympathy grew for Conrad of Diepholz, whose candidature appeared to be an increasingly attractive alternative to the former aspirants. The estates sought therefore, on 6&amp;nbsp;October 1452 in [[Coesfeld]], to reach a compromise, in order to get rid of both Walram of Moers and Erich of Hoya. All episcopal decisions since the death of Bishop Henry were declared null and void. In any case, these peace attempts failed. One reason was probably that John of Cleves continued to support Erich of Hoya.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

John of Hoya, who had previously left the town, returned to Münster. Supported by the lower levels of the town of Münster, John of Hoya transferred the diocesan regency in 1453 ''de jure'' to his brother Erich, so that the latter could prove himself as regent. Although the mayors of the towns opposed this, they eventually had to accept it under pressure from their townsfolk. Erich of Hoya was thereupon rendered homage in all the towns.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread of the conflict ==
This pitched the conflict into a new phase. Rudolph of Utrecht declared a feud against the town of Münster and its three allies on 7&amp;nbsp;July 1453. He succeeded in capturing the town of Vreden which, shortly thereafter was retaken by John of Hoya. Rudolph of Utrecht took advantage of disputes in the enemy camp and took a number of towns. Against the background of the triumphant advance of his opponent, in 1454 John of Hoya forced the re-election of the town council in Münster which was sympathetic to his cause. The majority of the council came from the guilds and the common people, only a few hereditary patricians (''Erbmänner'') were represented. In Münster resistance to the harsh rule of the Hoyas started to increase. Moreover, in October 1454, the [[Hansetag]] demanded the restoration of the old council constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allies around Walram of Moers and the Bishop of Utrecht managed to obtain assurances from the Pope, that all complaints from the opposite side to the Pope about spiritual penalties imposed by Walram were invalid. Those who aligned themselves with Walram were assured that they would receive absolution from any excommunication. Coesfeld was the first town to take advantage of the offer. This became the Walram's residence.

Because John of Cleves was temporarily unable to provide support due to his wedding, John of Hoya turned to Duke [[Frederick II of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Frederick of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] with a request for assistance. With his help John of Hoya attacked, plundering and destroying, the area of Coesfeld and the [[County of Bentheim]], which supported his enemies. Walram and Dietrich initially lacked the means to defend themselves against it. In July, a body of troops belonging to the archbishop arrived in Dülmen. Through a tactical mistake by Count John of Hoya, Duke Frederick's troops were alone when an allied army led by Dietrich of Moers, Walram of Moers, Rudolph of Utrecht, Bernard II of Bentheim, [[Bernard VII of Lippe|Bernard of Lippe]] and Conrad of Diepholz attacked and inflicted a crushing defeat on their opponents in the Battle of Varlar. The Duke was captured. One more vigorous attack might have brought total success, but the allies were hampered by internal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minor war and more negotiations ==
John of Hoya noticed that the mood in Münster was turning against him. He offered to transfer all the towns and castles to Cleves. But John of Cleves now had other plans. He wanted to give the diocese to Simon of Lippe, while Eric of Hoya was to get the Diocese of Osnabrück. He thus hoped that this would help to expel Bishop Rudolph from Utrecht. A short time later the latter died after he had ceded his rights to Ahaus and Ottenstein to Conrad of Diepholz. With his death, the allies of the House of Moers and Conrad of Diepholz lost their strongest supporter. The latter became Bishop of Osnabrück, but did not give up his aim of becoming the bishop in Münster as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Diocese of Münster, Walram of Moers continued to be opposed by John of Hoya. However, Dietrich of Moers did not pursue the matter with any great effort. So the fighting continued in the form of a minor war. In addition, negotiations took place which led to no result. One major success in early 1456 was the conquest of Coesfeld by John of Hoya. Then, in October 1456, Walram of Moers died in Arnhem. John of Hoya now relied on the support of the Duke of Burgundy. On behalf of Eric of Hoya he appealed for support to [[Pope Callistus III]], who was hoping that Burgundy would help him win the [[Ottoman Wars]]. The strong support of Philip of Burgundy for Hoya's cause meant that the towns now aligned themselves more firmly on the side of John of Hoya than they had in recent years. Eric of Hoya was proposed as bishop by two of the canons. However, the majority of the canons chose Conrad of Diepholz. Both sides asked Rome for a decision.

John of Hoya sought to strengthen his position in Münster by obtained citizenship in early 1457 and joining the Blacksmiths' Guild. A short time later he was elected to the Council. However, the Pope decided upon [[John of Palatinate-Simmern]], who had been totally uninvolved in the previous disputes. John of Hoya looked in vain to the support of Cleves and Burgundy once more. But even Conrad of Diepholz's aspiration to maintain his position failed.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcome and aftermath ==
On 23 October 1457 the Treaty of Kranenburg was signed that ended the conflict. It stipulated that Eric of Hoya should receive a lifetime income equivalent to that of the Cologne provost office. The city of Münster undertook to recognize the new bishop, to allow him to enter the town and to pay homage to him. In return, the new bishop agreed to recognize the existing privileges of the town. The new bishop also recognized the enfeoffment of the estates of Dülmen and Stromberg to the Duke of Cleves. The latter also received compensation of 11,000 Rhenish guilders. In early November, the new bishop arrived in Münster, swore the oath of office and the [[electoral capitulation]].

Earlier, John of Hoya had secretly left the town. Eric of Hoya died in 1458. [[Bevergern Castle]] which had been enfeoffed to him was returned to the diocese. After the peace treaty, life in the diocese quickly returned to normal. The dominant position that the patrician's (''Erbmänner'') had long held on Münster's town council was broken, as the guilds secured the right to be represented by their members. The ''Erbmänner'' only had half of the Council. In the end it was clear that the diocese had just become an object in the power game between noble families. The Emperor and Pope had lost any real influence. In the era of Henry and Walrams of Moers, some of the bishops had virtually lost any sense of their calling in faith to serve God and neighbour, but were simply out for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl (1999), 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War''' began with demonstrations in 1964 against the escalating [[role of the United States in the Vietnam War|role of the U.S. military in the Vietnam War]] and grew into a broad [[social movement]] over the ensuing several years. This movement informed and helped shape the vigorous and polarizing debate, primarily in the [[United States]], during the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s on how to end the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=5 ways Vietnam War changed America| last=deLeon| first=Rudy| date=June 25, 2015| publisher=[[CNN]]| url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/24/opinions/deleon-vietnam-war-effects/| accessdate=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in the [[peace movement]] within the U.S. were students, mothers, or [[Counterculture of the 1960s|anti-establishment]] [[hippie]]s. Opposition grew with participation by the African-American civil rights, women's liberation, and Chicano movements, and sectors of organized labor. Additional involvement came from many other groups, including educators, clergy, academics, journalists, lawyers, physicians (such as [[Benjamin Spock]]), and military [[veteran]]s. Their actions consisted mainly of peaceful, [[nonviolent]] events; few events were deliberately provocative and violent. In some cases, police used violent tactics against peaceful demonstrators. By 1967, according to [[Gallup poll|Gallup Polls]], an increasing majority of Americans considered U.S. military involvement in Vietnam to be a mistake, echoed decades later by the then head of American war planning, former U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/us/07mcnamara.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=Robert S. McNamara, Architect of a Futile War, Dies at 93|date=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
[[File:Vietnam War protesters. 1967. Wichita, Kans - NARA - 283625.jpg|thumb|Vietnam War protesters in Wichita, Kansas, 1967]]
The draft, a system of [[conscription]] that mainly drew from minorities and lower and middle class whites, drove much of the protest after 1965. [[Conscientious objector]]s played an active role despite their small numbers. The prevailing sentiment that the draft was unfairly administered inflamed [[blue-collar]] American, especially African-American, opposition to the military draft itself.

Opposition to the war arose during a time of unprecedented [[student activism]], which followed the [[free speech movement]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The military draft mobilized the [[baby boomers]], who were most at risk, but it grew to include a varied cross-section of Americans. The growing opposition to the Vietnam War was partly attributed to greater access to uncensored information through extensive television coverage on the ground in Vietnam.

Beyond opposition to the draft, anti-war protesters also made moral arguments against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. That moral imperative argument against the war was especially popular among American college students, who were more likely than the general public to accuse the United States of having imperialistic goals in Vietnam and to criticize the war as "immoral."&lt;ref&gt;Schuman, Howard.2000.'Two Sources of Antiwar Sentiment in America,' in Hixson, Walter L. (ed) The United States and the Vietnam War: Significant Scholarly Articles. New York: Garland Publishing, pp127–150&lt;/ref&gt; Civilian deaths, which were downplayed or omitted entirely by the Western media, became a subject of protest when photographic evidence of casualties emerged. An infamous photo of General [[Nguyễn Ngọc Loan]] shooting an alleged terrorist in handcuffs during the [[Tet Offensive]] also provoked public outcry.&lt;ref name="Guttmann"&gt;Guttmann, Allen. 1969. Protest against the War in Vietnam. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 382. pp. 56–63,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of the American opposition to the war was the perception that U.S. intervention in Vietnam, which had been argued as acceptable because of the [[domino theory]] and the threat of [[communism]], was not legally justifiable. Some Americans believed that the communist threat was used as a scapegoat to hide imperialistic intentions, and others argued that the American intervention in South Vietnam interfered with the [[self-determination]] of the country and felt that the war in Vietnam was a civil war that ought to have determined the fate of the country and that America was wrong to intervene.&lt;ref name="Guttmann"/&gt;

[[U.S. news media and the Vietnam War|Media coverage of the war]] also shook the faith of citizens at home as new television brought images of wartime conflict to the kitchen table. Newsmen like NBC's Frank McGee stated that the war was all but lost as a "conclusion to be drawn inescapably from the facts."&lt;ref name="Guttmann"/&gt; For the first time in American history, the media had the means to broadcast battlefield images. Graphic footage of casualties on the nightly news eliminated any myth of the glory of war. With no clear sign of victory in Vietnam, American military casualties helped stimulate opposition to the war by Americans. In their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman challenge that traditional view of how the media influenced the war and propose that the media instead censored the more brutal images of the fighting and the death of millions of innocent people.

==Polarization==
{{quote|If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read "Vietnam."|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], 1967&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' magazine: Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. 40 Years Later. Time Inc, 2008. Pg 139&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The U.S. became polarized over the war. Many supporters of U.S. involvement argued for what was known as the [[domino theory]], a theory that believed if one country fell to communism, then the bordering countries would be sure to fall as well, much like falling dominoes. This theory was largely held due to the fall of eastern Europe to communism and the Soviet sphere of influence following World War II. However, military critics of the war pointed out that the Vietnam War was political and that the military mission lacked any clear idea of how to achieve its objectives. Civilian critics of the war argued that the government of South Vietnam lacked political legitimacy, or that support for the war was completely immoral.

The media also played a substantial role in the polarization of American opinion regarding the Vietnam War. For example, In 1965 a majority of the media attention focused on military tactics with very little discussion about the necessity for a full scale intervention in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Herman, Edward S. 2002"&gt;Herman, Edward S. &amp; Chomsky, Noam. (2002) Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1965, the media covered the dissent and domestic controversy that existed within the United States, but mostly excluded the actual view of dissidents and resisters.&lt;ref name="Herman, Edward S. 2002"/&gt;

The media established a sphere of public discourse surrounding the Hawk versus Dove debate. The Dove was a liberal and a critic of the war. Doves claimed that the war was well–intentioned but a disastrously wrong mistake in an otherwise benign foreign policy. It is important to note the Doves did not question the U.S. intentions in intervening in Vietnam, nor did they question the morality or legality of the U.S. intervention. Rather, they made pragmatic claims that the war was a mistake. Contrarily, the Hawks argued that the war was legitimate and winnable and a part of the benign U.S. foreign policy. The Hawks claimed that the one-sided criticism of the media contributed to the decline of public support for the war and ultimately helped the U.S. lose the war. Author William F. Buckley repeatedly wrote about his approval for the war and suggested that "The United States has been timid, if not cowardly, in refusing to seek 'victory' in Vietnam."&lt;ref name="Guttmann" /&gt;  The hawks claimed that the liberal media was responsible for the growing popular disenchantment with the war and blamed the western media for losing the war in Southeast Asia as communism was no longer a threat for them.

==Antiwar movement==
As the Vietnam War continued to escalate, public disenchantment grew and a variety of different groups were formed or became involved in the movement.

There was a great deal of civic unrest on college campuses throughout the 1960s as students became increasingly involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Second Wave Feminism]], and [[anti-war movement]]. Doug McAdam explains the success of the mass mobilization of volunteers for [[Freedom Summer]] in terms of "Biographical Availability", where individuals must have a certain degree of social, economic, and psychological freedom to be able to participate in large scale social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, David S. 2007. The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This explanation can also be applied to the Anti-War Movement because it occurred around the same time and the same biographical factors applied to the college-aged anti-war protesters. David Meyers (2007) also explains how the concept of [[Self-efficacy|personal efficacy]] affects mass movement mobilization. For example, according to Meyers' thesis, consider that American wealth increased drastically after World War II. At this time, America was a superpower and enjoyed great affluence after thirty years of depression, war, and sacrifice. Benjamin T. Harrison (2000) argues that the post World War II affluence set the stage for the protest generation in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Benjamin T. (2000)'Roots of the Anti-Vietnam War Movement,' in Hixson, Walter (ed) the Vietnam Antiwar Movement. New York: Garland Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; His central thesis is that the World Wars and Great Depression spawned a '[[beat generation]]' refusing to conform to mainstream American values which lead to the emergence of the [[Hippies]] and the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture.]] The Anti-war movement became part of a larger protest movement against the traditional American Values and attitudes. Meyers (2007) builds off this claim in his argument that the "relatively privileged enjoy the education and affirmation that afford them the belief that they might make a difference."&lt;ref&gt;p49&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the present factors in terms of affluence, biographical availability (defined in the sociological areas of activism as the lack of restrictions on social relationships of which most likely increases the consequences of participating in a social movement), and increasing political atmosphere across the county, political activity increased drastically on college campuses.

College enrollment reached 9 million by the end of the 1960s. Colleges and universities in America had more students than ever before, and these institutions often tried to restrict student behavior to maintain order on the campuses. To combat this, many college students became active in causes that promoted free speech, student input in the curriculum, and an end to archaic social restrictions. Students joined the antiwar movement because they did not want to fight in a foreign civil war that they believed did not concern them or because they were morally opposed to all war. Others disliked the war because it diverted funds and attention away from problems in the U.S. Intellectual growth and gaining a liberal perspective at college caused many students to become active in the antiwar movement. Another attractive feature of the opposition movement was the fact that it was a popular social event. As one student{{who|date=April 2018}} said, antiwar demonstrations were the places to "get laid, get high, and listen to some great rock."{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Most student antiwar organizations were locally or campus-based because they were easier to organize and participate in than national groups. Common antiwar demonstrations for college students featured attempts to sever ties between the war machine and universities through [[Draft card burning|burning draft cards]], protesting universities furnishing grades to draft boards, and protesting military and Dow Chemical job fairs on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://1967.wisc.edu/ |title=A Turning Point |author=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=2017 |access-date= 26 Oct 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Worland |first=Gayle |date=8 Oct 2017 |title=50 years ago, 'Dow Day' left its mark on Madison |url=https://host.madison.com/wsj/article_47f7dc75-e30a-5a16-8cf1-044eebc66f18.html |magazine=Wisconsin State Journal |location=Madison, WI |publisher=John Humenik |access-date=26 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1969 to 1970, student protestors attacked 197 ROTC buildings on college campuses. Protests grew after the [[Kent State shootings]], radicalizing more and more students. Although the media often portrayed the student antiwar movement as aggressive and widespread, only 10% of the 2500 colleges in the United States had violent protests throughout the Vietnam War years. By the early 1970s, most student protest movements died down due to President Nixon's de-escalation of the war, the economic downturn, and disillusionment with the powerlessness of the antiwar movement.&lt;ref name=fry/&gt;

===Arts===
Many artists during the 1960s and 1970s opposed the war and used their creativity and careers to visibly oppose the war. Writers and poets opposed to involvement in the war included [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], and [[Robert Bly]]. Their pieces often incorporated imagery based on the tragic events of the war as well as the disparity between life in Vietnam and life in the United States. Visual artists [[Ronald Haeberle]], [[Peter Saul]], and [[Nancy Spero]], among others, used war equipment, like guns and helicopters, in their works while incorporating important political and war figures, portraying to the nation exactly who was responsible for the violence. Filmmakers such as [[Lenny Lipton]], Jerry Abrams, Peter Gessner, and David Ringo created documentary-style movies featuring actual footage from the antiwar marches to raise awareness about the war and the diverse opposition movement. Playwrights like [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Megan Terry]], Grant Duay, and [[Kenneth Bernard]] used theater as a vehicle for portraying their thoughts about the Vietnam War, often satirizing the role of America in the world and juxtaposing the horrific effects of war with normal scenes of life. Regardless of medium, antiwar artists ranged from pacifists to violent radicals and caused Americans to think more critically about the war. Art as war opposition was quite popular in the early years of the war, but soon faded as political activism became the more common and most visible way of opposing the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=149–161|author=Alexis Greene|authorlink=The Arts and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|editor=Barbara Tischler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
Women were a large part of the antiwar movement, even though they were sometimes relegated to second-class status within the organizations or faced sexism within opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=149–161|author=Nina Adams|authorlink=The Arts and the Vietnam Antiwar Movement|editor=Barbara Tischler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some leaders of anti-war groups viewed women as sex objects or secretaries, not actual thinkers who could contribute positively and tangibly to the group's goals, or believed that women could not truly understand and join the antiwar movement because they were unaffected by the draft.&lt;ref name="Swerdlow 159–170"&gt;{{harvnb|Swerdlow|1992|pp=159–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women involved in opposition groups disliked the romanticism of the violence of both the war and the antiwar movement that was common amongst male war protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Ruth|title=The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the inequalities, participation in various antiwar groups allowed women to gain experience with organizing protests and crafting effective antiwar rhetoric. These newfound skills combined with their dislike of sexism within the opposition movement caused many women to break away from the mainstream antiwar movement and create or join women's antiwar groups, such as [[Another Mother for Peace]], [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF), and [[Women Strike for Peace]] ([[Women Strike for Peace|WSP]]), also known as Women For Peace. Female soldiers serving in Vietnam joined the movement to battle the war and sexism, racism, and the established military bureaucracy by writing articles for antiwar and antimilitary newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sights on the Sixties|year=1992|publisher=Rutgers, the State University Press|pages=197–209|author=Barbara Tischler|authorlink=Voices of Protest: Women and the GI Antiwar Press|editor=Barbara Tischler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothers and older generations of women joined the opposition movement, as advocates for peace and people opposed to the effects of the war and the draft on the generation of young men. These women saw the draft as one of the most disliked parts of the war machine and sought to undermine the war itself through undermining the draft. Another Mother for Peace and [[Women Strike for Peace|WSP]] often held free draft counseling centers to give young men legal and illegal methods to oppose the draft.&lt;ref name="Swerdlow 159–170"/&gt; Members of Women For Peace showed up at the White House every Sunday for 8 years from 11 to 1 for a peace vigil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Small|1992|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such female antiwar groups often relied on maternalism, the image of women as peaceful caretakers of the world, to express and accomplish their goals. The government often saw middle-aged women involved in such organizations as the most dangerous members of the opposition movement because they were ordinary citizens who quickly and efficiently mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Small|1992|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women in America sympathized with the Vietnamese civilians affected by the war and joined the opposition movement. They protested the use of napalm, a highly flammable jelly weapon created by the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and used as a weapon during the war, by boycotting Saran Wrap, another product made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Small|1992|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with the sexism sometimes found in the antiwar movement, New Left, and Civil Rights Movement, some women created their own organizations to establish true equality of the sexes. Some of frustrations of younger women became apparent during the antiwar movement: they desired more radical change and decreased acceptance of societal gender roles than older women activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosen|2006|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female activists' disillusion with the antiwar movement led to the formation of the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] to establish true equality for American women in all facets of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1992|pp=182–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African Americans===
[[File:Martin Luther King Jr St Paul Campus U MN.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speaking to an anti-Vietnam War rally at the [[University of Minnesota]], St. Paul on April 27, 1967]]
African-American leaders of earlier decades like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] were often [[American imperialism|anti-imperialist]] and anti-capitalist. [[Paul Robeson]] weighed in on the Vietnamese struggle in 1954, calling [[Ho Chi Minh]] "the modern day [[Toussaint Louverture|Toussaint L'Overture]], leading his people to freedom." These figures were driven from public life by McCarthyism, however, and black leaders were more cautious about criticizing US foreign policy as the 1960s began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6oaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=sncc.+watts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZTu7K6mxXc&amp;sig=ayMKgV-T9xJLxEfIuHHwcwdU-BY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtuKisy5zZAhUFneAKHZiiC6EQ6AEwAnoECA4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Robeson&amp;f=false|title=Selma to Saigon: The Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War|last=Lucks|first=Daniel S.|date=2014-03-19|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=|isbn=9780813145099|location=|pages=9–10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the decade, open condemnation of the war became more common, with figures like [[Malcolm X]] and [[Robert Parris Moses]] speaking out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6oaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=sncc.+watts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZTu7K6mxXc&amp;sig=ayMKgV-T9xJLxEfIuHHwcwdU-BY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtuKisy5zZAhUFneAKHZiiC6EQ6AEwAnoECA4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Malcolm%20x&amp;f=false|title=Selma to Saigon: The Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War|last=Lucks|first=Daniel S.|date=2014-03-19|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=|isbn=9780813145099|location=|pages=83–84|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Champion boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] risked his career and a prison sentence to resist the draft in 1966. Soon [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Coretta Scott King]] and [[James Bevel]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)]] became prominent opponents of the Vietnam War, and the [[Black Panther Party]] vehemently opposed U.S. involvement in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Small 57–60"&gt;{{harvnb|Small|1992|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the war, some African Americans did not want to join the war opposition movement because of loyalty to President Johnson for pushing Civil Rights legislation, but soon the escalating violence of the war and the perceived social injustice of the draft propelled involvement in antiwar groups.&lt;ref name="Small 57–60" /&gt;

In 1965, the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) became the first major civil rights group to issue a formal statement against the war. When SNCC-backed Georgia Representative [[Julian Bond]] acknowledged his agreement with the anti-war statement, he was refused his seat by the State of Georgia, an injustice which he [[Bond v. Floyd|successfully appealed up to the Supreme Court.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6oaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=sncc.+watts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZTu7K6mxXc&amp;sig=ayMKgV-T9xJLxEfIuHHwcwdU-BY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtuKisy5zZAhUFneAKHZiiC6EQ6AEwAnoECA4QAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=Sncc.%201965&amp;f=false|title=Selma to Saigon: The Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War|last=Lucks|first=Daniel S.|date=2014-03-19|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=|isbn=9780813145099|location=|pages=113–120|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; SNCC had special significance as a nexus between the student movement and the black movement. At an SDS-organized conference at [[UC Berkeley]] in October 1966, SNCC Chair [[Stokely Carmichael]] challenged the white left to escalate their resistance to the military draft in a manner similar to the black movement. Some participants in [[Urban riots|ghetto rebellions]] of the era had already associated their actions with opposition to the Vietnam War, and SNCC first disrupted an Atlanta draft board in August 1966. According to historians Joshua Bloom and Waldo Martin, SDS's first Stop the Draft Week of October 1967 was "inspired by [[Black Power movement|Black Power]] [and] emboldened by the ghetto rebellions." SNCC appear to have originated the popular anti-draft slogan: "Hell no! We won't go!"&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Bloom and Waldo E. Martin, ''Black Against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party'' (University of California Press, 2013), pp. 29, 41-42, 102-103, 128-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black antiwar groups opposed the war for similar reasons as white groups, but often protested in separate events and sometimes did not cooperate with the ideas of white antiwar leadership.&lt;ref name="Small 57–60" /&gt; They harshly criticized the draft because poor and minority men were usually most affected by conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gills|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 and 1966, Afro-Americans comprised 25 percent of combat deaths, more than twice their proportion of the population. As a result, black enlisted men themselves protested and began the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War|resistance movement among veterans]]. After taking measures to reduce the fatalities, apparently in response to widespread protest, the military brought the proportion of blacks down to 12.6 percent of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8bzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113&amp;lpg=PT113&amp;dq=black.+casualties.+1965&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=98lUVBEcUP&amp;sig=_3d2qvu7RZNFwjLAJxKOokphMo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj4nrDMqKHZAhWQxFkKHWmDCx4Q6AEwBXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=black.%20casualties.%201965&amp;f=false|title=American Reckoning: The Vietnam War and Our National Identity|last=Appy|first=Christian G.|date=2015-02-05|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780698191556|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans involved in the antiwar movement often formed their own groups, such as Black Women Enraged, National Black Anti-War Anti-Draft Union, and National Black Draft Counselors. Within these groups, however, many African American women were seen as subordinate members by black male leaders.&lt;ref name="Gill 177–195" /&gt; Many African American women viewed the war in Vietnam as racially motivated and sympathized strongly with Vietnamese women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gills|1992|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such concerns often propelled their participation in the antiwar movement and their creation of new opposition groups.

===Asian Americans===
Many Asian Americans were strongly opposed to the Vietnam War. They saw the war as being a bigger action of U.S. imperialism and "connected the oppression of the Asians in the United States to the prosecution of the war in Vietnam."&lt;ref name="Daryl Maeda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chaines of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many Americans in the anti-war movement, they viewed the war "not just as imperialist but specifically as anti-Asian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like the [[Asian American Political Alliance|Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA)]], the Bay Area Coalition Against the War (BAACAW), and the Asian Americans for Action made opposition to the war their main focus.  Of these organizations, the Bay Area Coalition Against the War was the biggest and most significant. One of the major reasons leading to their significance was that the BAACAW was "highly organized, holding biweekly ninety-minute meetings of the Coordinating Committee at which each regional would submit detailed reports and action plans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: The Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driving force behind their formation was their anger at "the bombing of Hanoi and the mining of Haiphong Harbor." Another aspect of the group's prevalence was the support of the Japanese Community Youth Center, members of the Asian Community Center, student leaders of Asian American student unions, etc. who stood behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAACAW members consisted of many Asians Americans and they were involved in antiwar efforts like marches, study groups, fundraisers, teach-ins and demonstrations. During marches, Asian American activists carried banners that read "Stop the Bombing of Asian People and Stop Killing Our Asian Brothers and Sisters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Erika|title=The Making of Asian America: A History|date=2015|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its newsletter stated, "our goal is to build a solid, broad-based anti-imperialist movement of Asian people against the war in Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-war sentiment by Asian Americans was fueled by the racial inequality that they faced in the United States. As historian Daryl Maeda notes, "the antiwar movement articulated Asian Americans' racial commonality with Vietnamese people in two distinctly gendered ways: identification based on the experiences of male soldiers and identification by women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian American soldiers in the U.S. military were many times classified as being like the enemy. They were referred to as gooks and had a racialized identity in comparison to their non-Asian counterparts. There was also the hypersexualization of Vietnamese women which in turn affected how Asian American women in the military were treated. "In a [[Gidra (newspaper)|Gidra]] article, [a prominent influential newspaper of the Asian American movement], Evelyn Yoshimura noted that the U.S. military systematically portrayed Vietnamese women as prostitutes as a way of dehumanizing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian American groups realized in order to extinguish racism, they also had to address sexism as well. This in turn led to women's leadership in the Asian American antiwar movement. Patsy Chan, a "Third World" activist, said at an antiwar rally in San Francisco, "We, as Third World women [express] our militant solidarity with our brothers and sisters from Indochina. We, as Third World people know of the struggle the Indochinese are waging against imperialism, because we share that common enemy in the United States."&lt;ref name="Srikanth and Song"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Srikanth|first1=Rajini|last2=Hyoung Song|first2=Min|title=The Cambridge History of Asian American Literature|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other notable figures were [[Grace Lee Boggs]] and [[Yuri Kochiyama]]. Both Boggs and Kochiyama were inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s and "a growing number of Asian Americans began to push forward a new era in radical Asian American politics."&lt;ref name="Erika Lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Erika|title=The Making of Asian America: A History|date=2015|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=301–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also Asian American musicians who traveled around the United States to oppose the imperialist actions of the American government, specifically their involvement in Vietnam. "The folk trio 'A Grain of Sand'…[ consisting of the members] JoAnne 'Nobuko' Miyamoto, Chris Iijima, and William 'Charlie' Chin, performed across the nation as traveling troubadours who set the antiracist politics of the Asian American movement to music."&lt;ref name="Srikanth and Song"/&gt; This band was so against the imperialistic actions of the United States, that they supported the Vietnamese people vocally through their song 'War of the Flea'.&lt;ref name="Srikanth and Song"/&gt; Asian American poets and playwrights also joined in unity with the movement's antiwar sentiments. Melvyn Escueta created the play 'Honey Bucket' and was an Asian American veteran of the war. Through this play, "Escueta establishes equivalencies between his protagonist, a Filipino American soldier named Andy, and the Vietnamese people."&lt;ref name="Srikanth and Song"/&gt;

"The Asian American antiwar movement emerged from a belief that the mainstream peace movement was racist in its disregard to Asians…Steve Louie remembers that while the white antiwar movement had 'this moral thing about no killing,' Asian Americans sought to bring attention to 'a bigger issue…genocide.'… the broader movement had a hard time with the Asian movement…because it broadened the issues out beyond where they wanted to go… the whole question of U.S. imperialism as a system, at home and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Daryl|title=Chains of Babylon: Rise of Asian America|date=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clergy===
The clergy, often a forgotten group during the opposition to the Vietnam War, played a large role as well. The clergy covered any of the religious leaders and members including individuals such as Martin Luther King Jr. In his speech "Beyond Vietnam" King stated, "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent."&lt;ref&gt;King, "Beyond Vietnam"&lt;/ref&gt; King was not looking for racial equality through this speech, but tried to voice for an end to the war instead.

The involvement of the clergy did not stop at King though. The analysis entitled "Social Movement Participation: Clergy and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement" expands upon the anti-war movement by taking King, a single religious figurehead, and explaining the movement from the entire clergy's perspective. The clergy were often forgotten though throughout this opposition. The analysis refers to that fact by saying, "The research concerning clergy anti-war participation is even more barren than the literature on student activism."&lt;ref&gt;Tygart, "Social Movement Participation: Clergy and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement"&lt;/ref&gt; There is a relationship and correlation between theology and political opinions and during the Vietnam War, the same relationship occurred between feelings about the war and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Tygart, "Social Movement Participation: Clergy and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement"&lt;/ref&gt; This article basically was a social experiment finding results on how the pastors and clergy members reacted to the war. Based on the results found, they most certainly did not believe in the war and wished to help end it.

Another source, ''Lift Up Your Voice Like A Trumpet: White Clergy And The Civil Rights And Antiwar Movements, 1954–1973'' explains the story of the entire spectrum of the clergy and their involvement. Michael Freidland is able to completely tell the story in his chapter entitled, "A Voice of Moderation: Clergy and the Anti-War Movement: 1966–1967". In basic summary, each specific clergy from each religion had their own view of the war and how they dealt with it, but as a whole, the clergy was completely against the war.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland, ''Lift Up Your Voice Like A Trumpet: White Clergy And The Civil Rights And Antiwar Movements, 1954–1973''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vreeswijk Akerstrom Cervin 1965.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Cornelis Vreeswijk]], [[Fred Åkerström]], Gösta Cervin in a protest march against the Vietnam War in [[Stockholm]], 1965]]
Protest to American participation in the Vietnam War was a movement that many popular musicians appropriated, which was a stark contrast to the pro-war compositions of artists during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Ben. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/742053 War Music and the American Composer during the Vietnam Era]." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 75.3 (1991): 317. JSTOR. Web. 27 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These musicians included [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Gail Kubik]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Doctor Fink|Robert Fink]], [[David Noon]], [[Richard Wernick]], and [[John W. Downey]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Ben. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/742053 War Music and the American Composer during the Vietnam Era]." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 75.3 (1991): 318. JSTOR. Web. 27 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The two most notable genres involved in this protest were Rock and Roll and Folk music. While composers created pieces affronting the war, they were not limited to their music. Often protesters were being arrested and participating in peace marches and popular musicians were among their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Ben. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/742053 War Music and the American Composer during the Vietnam Era]." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 75.3 (1991): 320. JSTOR. Web. 27 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of intimate involvement reached new heights in May 1968 when the "Composers and Musicians for Peace" concert was staged in New York. As the war continued, and with the new media coverage, the movement snowballed and popular music reflected this. As early as the summer of 1965, music-based protest against the American involvement in Southeast Asia began with works like [[P. F. Sloan]]'s [[folk rock]] song [[Eve of Destruction (song)|''Eve of Destruction'']], recorded by [[Barry McGuire]] as one of the earliest musical protests against the Vietnam War.

A key figure on the [[rock music|rock]] end of the antiwar spectrum was [[Jimi Hendrix]] (1942–1970). Hendrix had a huge following among the youth culture exploring itself through drugs and experiencing itself through rock music. He was not an official protestor of the war; one of Hendrix's biographers contends that Hendrix, being a former soldier, sympathized with the anticommunist view.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 248. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, protest the violence that took place in the Vietnam War. With the song "[[Machine Gun (Jimi Hendrix song)|Machine Gun]]", dedicated to those fighting in Vietnam, this protest of violence is manifest. David Henderson, author of '''Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky'', describes the song as "scary funk […] his sound over the drone shifts from a woman's scream, to a siren, to a fighter plane diving, all amid Buddy Miles' Gatling-gun snare shots. […] he says 'evil man make me kill you […] make you kill me although we're only families apart.'"&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, David. 'Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky: Jimi Hendrix, Voodoo Child. New York: Atria, 2009. 339. Print&lt;/ref&gt; This song was often accompanied with pleas from Hendrix to bring the soldiers back home and cease the bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 221. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hendrix's views may not have been analogous to the protestors, his songs became anthems to the antiwar movement. Songs such as "Star Spangled Banner" showed individuals that "you can love your country, but hate the government."&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Charles R. ''Room Full of Mirrors: a Biography of Jimi Hendrix''. New York: Hyperion, 2006. 271. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Hendrix's anti-violence efforts are summed up in his words: "when the power of love overcomes the love of power... the world will know peace." Thus, Hendrix's personal views did not coincide perfectly with those of the antiwar protestors; however, his anti-violence outlook was a driving force during the years of the Vietnam War even after his death (1970).

The song known to many as the anthem of the protest movement was [[The "Fish" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]—first released on an [[Extended play|EP]] in the October 1965 issue of ''Rag Baby''—by [[Country Joe and the Fish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryjoe.com/ragbaby.htm|title=Country Joe's Place|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most successful protest bands. Although this song was not on music charts probably because it was too radical, it was performed at many public events including the famous [[Woodstock]] music festival (1969). "Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag" was a song that used sarcasm to communicate the problems with not only the war but also the public's naïve attitudes towards it. It was said that "the happy beat and insouciance of the vocalist are in odd juxtaposition to the lyrics that reinforce the sad fact that the American public was being forced into realizing that Vietnam was no longer a remote place on the other side of the world, and the damage it was doing to the country could no longer be considered collateral, involving someone else."&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, Lee. Battle Notes. Superior: Savage Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with singer-songwriter [[Phil Ochs]], who attended and organized anti-war events and wrote such songs as "I Ain't Marching Anymore" and "The War Is Over", another key historical figure of the antiwar movement was [[Bob Dylan]]. Folk and Rock were critical aspects of [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] during the Vietnam War&lt;ref&gt;James, David. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/466424 The Vietnam War and American Music]." Social Text 23 (1989): 132. JSTOR. Web. 27 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; both were genres that Dylan would dabble in. His success in writing protest songs came from his pre-existing popularity, as he did not initially intend on doing so. [[Tor Egil Førland]], in his article "Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist", quotes Todd Gitlin, a leader of a student movement at the time, in saying "Whether he liked it or not, Dylan sang for us.... We followed his career as if he were singing our songs."&lt;ref name="jstor1992"&gt;Førland, Tor Egil. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27555682 Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist]." Journal of American Studies 26.3 (1992): 351. JSTOR. Web. 26 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The anthem "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" embodied Dylan's anti-war, pro-civil rights sentiment. To complement "Blowin' in the Wind" Dylan's song "The Times they are A-Changin'" alludes to a new method of governing that is necessary and warns those who currently participate in government that the change is imminent. Dylan tells the "senators and congressmen [to] please heed the call." Dylan's songs were designed to awaken the public and to cause a reaction. The protestors of the Vietnam War identified their cause so closely with the artistic compositions of Dylan that Joan Baez and Judy Collins performed "The Times they are A-Changin'" at a march protesting the Vietnam War (1965) and also for President Johnson.&lt;ref name="jstor1992"/&gt; While Dylan renounced the idea of subscribing to the ideals of one individual, his feelings of protest towards Vietnam were appropriated by the general movement and they "awaited his gnomic yet oracular pronouncements", which provided a guiding aspect to the movement as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Førland, Tor Egil. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27555682 Bringing It All Back Home or Another Side of Bob Dylan: Midwestern Isolationist]." Journal of American Studies 26.3 (1992): 352. JSTOR. Web. 26 Jan. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lennon]], former member of the Beatles, did most of his activism in his solo career with wife [[Yoko Ono]]. Given his immense fame due to the success of the Beatles, he was a very prominent movement figure with the constant media and press attention. Still being proactive on their honeymoon, the newlyweds controversially held a sit-in, where they sat in bed for a week answering press questions. They held numerous sit-ins, one where they first introduced their song "Give Peace a Chance". Lennon and Ono's song overshadowed many previous held anthems, as it became known as the ultimate anthem of peace in the 1970s, with their words "all we are saying… is give peace a chance" being sung globally.

Gruesome images of two anti-war activists who [[self-immolation|set themselves on fire]] in November 1965 provided iconic images of how strongly some people felt that the war was immoral. On November 2, 32-year-old [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[Norman Morrison]] set himself on fire in front of [[The Pentagon]]. On November 9, 22-year-old [[Catholic Worker Movement]] member [[Roger Allen LaPorte]] did the same in front of [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York City. Both protests were conscious imitations of earlier (and ongoing) [[Thích Quảng Đức|Buddhist protests]] in South Vietnam.

[[File:vietnamdem.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.15|1967 Anti-Vietnam War demonstration at [[The Pentagon]]]]
Protests against the Vietnam War took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The protests were part of a movement in opposition to the Vietnam War and took place mainly in the United States. (See also [[Students for a Democratic Society]], [[Free Speech Movement]], [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Youth International Party]], [[Chicago Seven]].)

The growing anti-war movement alarmed many in the U.S. government. On August 16, 1966 the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) began investigations of Americans who were suspected of aiding the [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|NLF]], with the intent to introduce legislation making these activities illegal. Anti-war demonstrators disrupted the meeting and 50 were arrested.

In February 1967, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' published "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]", an essay by [[Noam Chomsky]], one of the leading intellectual opponents of the war. In the essay Chomsky argued that much responsibility for the war lay with liberal intellectuals and technical experts who were providing what he saw as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] justification for the policies of the U.S. government.

On February 1, 1968, [[Nguyễn Văn Lém]], a [[Vietcong]] officer suspected of participating in murder of South Vietnamese government officials during the [[Tet Offensive]], was [[Summary execution|summarily executed]] by General [[Nguyễn Ngọc Loan]], the South Vietnamese National Police Chief. Loan shot Lém in the head on a public street in [[Saigon]] front of journalists. South Vietnamese reports provided as justification after the fact claimed that Lém was captured near the site of a ditch holding as many as thirty-four bound and shot bodies of police and their relatives, some of whom were the families of General Loan's deputy and close friend. The execution provided an iconic image that helped sway public opinion in the United States against the war.

The events of Tet in early 1968 as a whole were also remarkable in shifting public opinion regarding the war. U.S. military officials had previously reported that counter-insurgency in South Vietnam was being prosecuted successfully. While the Tet Offensive provided the U.S. and allied militaries with a great victory in that the Vietcong was finally brought into open battle and destroyed as a fighting force, the American media, including respected figures such as [[Walter Cronkite]], interpreted such events as the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon#Tet Offensive|attack on the American embassy]] in Saigon as an indicator of U.S. military weakness.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow, Stanley "Vietnam"&lt;/ref&gt; The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the American people that the military had been untruthful to them about the success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the ability to achieve a meaningful military solution in Vietnam.

On October 15, 1969, hundreds of thousands of people took part in [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|National Moratorium]] anti-war demonstrations across the United States; the demonstrations prompted many workers to call in sick from their jobs and adolescents nationwide engaged in [[truancy]] from school. However, the proportion of individuals doing either who actually participated in the demonstrations is uncertain. A second round of "Moratorium" demonstrations was held on November 15, but was less well-attended.

[[File:My Lai massacre.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|The [[My Lai massacre]] was used as an example of bad military conduct during the Vietnam War.]]
The U.S. realized that the South Vietnamese government needed a solid base of popular support if it were to survive the insurgency. To pursue this goal of winning the "[[Hearts and Minds (Vietnam)|Hearts and Minds]]" of the Vietnamese people, units of the [[United States Army]], referred to as "[[Civil Affairs]]" units, were used extensively for the first time since World War II.

Civil Affairs units, while remaining armed and under direct military control, engaged in what came to be known as "[[nation-building]]": constructing (or reconstructing) schools, public buildings, roads and other [[infrastructure]]; conducting medical programs for civilians who had no access to medical facilities; facilitating cooperation among local civilian leaders; conducting hygiene and other training for civilians; and similar activities.

This policy of attempting to [[Hearts and Minds (Vietnam War)|win the hearts and minds]] of the Vietnamese people, however, often was at odds with other aspects of the war which sometimes served to antagonize many Vietnamese civilians and provided ammunition to the anti-war movement. These included the emphasis on "[[body count]]" as a way of measuring military success on the battlefield, civilian casualties during the bombing of villages (symbolized by journalist [[Peter Arnett]]'s famous quote, "it was necessary to destroy the village to save it"), and the killing of civilians in such incidents as the [[My Lai massacre]]. In 1974 the documentary [[Hearts and Minds (film)|''Hearts and Minds'']] sought to portray the devastation the war was causing to the South Vietnamese people, and won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for best documentary amid considerable controversy. The South Vietnamese government also antagonized many of its citizens with its suppression of political opposition, through such measures as holding large numbers of political prisoners, torturing political opponents, and holding a [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu#Re-elected unopposed and stagnation|one-man election for President]] in 1971. Covert counter-terror programs and semi-covert ones such as the [[Phoenix Program]] attempted, with the help of anthropologists, to isolate rural South Vietnamese villages and affect the loyalty of the residents.

[[File:Man wearing Purple Heart medal during Vietnam peace march, 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|This man wears a [[Purple Heart]] medal as he watches a San Francisco peace march, April 1967.]]
Despite the increasingly depressing news of the war, many Americans continued to support President Johnson's endeavors. Aside from the domino theory mentioned above, there was a feeling that the goal of preventing a communist takeover of a pro-Western government in South Vietnam was a noble objective. Many Americans were also concerned about saving face in the event of disengaging from the war or, as President [[Richard M. Nixon]] later put it, "achieving Peace with Honor." In addition, instances of Viet Cong atrocities were widely reported, most notably in an article that appeared in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in 1968 entitled ''The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh''.

However, anti-war feelings also began to rise. Many Americans opposed the war on moral grounds, appalled by the devastation and violence of the war. Others claimed the conflict was a war against Vietnamese independence, or an intervention in a foreign [[civil war]]; others opposed it because they felt it lacked clear objectives and appeared to be unwinnable. Many anti-war activists were themselves [[Vietnam veteran]]s, as evidenced by the organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. In April 1971, thousands of these veterans converged on the White House in Washington, D.C., and hundreds of them threw their [[medal]]s and [[Military decoration|decorations]] on the steps of the [[United States Capitol]]. By this time, it had also become commonplace for the most radical anti-war demonstrators to prominently display the flag of the Viet Cong "enemy", an act which alienated many who were otherwise morally opposed to the war.

==Political factors==
In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson began his re-election campaign. [[Eugene McCarthy]] ran against him for the nomination on an anti-war platform. McCarthy did not win the first primary election in [[New Hampshire]], but he did surprisingly well against an incumbent. The resulting blow to the Johnson campaign, taken together with other factors, led the President to make a surprise announcement in a March 31 televised speech that he was pulling out of the race. He also announced the initiation of the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Negotiations]] with Vietnam in that speech. Then, on August 4, 1969, U.S. representative [[Henry Kissinger]] and North Vietnamese representative [[Xuan Thuy]] began secret peace negotiations at the apartment of French intermediary [[Jean Sainteny]] in Paris.

After breaking with Johnson's pro-war stance, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] entered the race on March 16 and ran for the nomination on an anti-war platform. Johnson's vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]], also ran for the nomination, promising to continue to support the South Vietnamese government.

Protests bringing attention to "[[Conscription in the United States|the draft]]" began on May 5, 1965. Student activists at the University of California, Berkeley marched on the Berkeley [[Selective Service System|Draft board]] and forty students staged the first public [[Draft-card burning|burning of a draft card]] in the United States. Another nineteen cards were burnt on May 22 at a demonstration following the Berkeley [[teach-in]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet.html |title=UC Berkeley Library Social Activism Sound Recording Project: Anti-Vietnam War Protests&amp;nbsp;– San Francisco Bay Area |publisher=Lib.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draft card protests were not aimed so much at the draft as at the immoral conduct of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flynn |first=George Q. |title=The Draft, 1940–1973 |publisher=University Press of Kansas |year=1993 |series=Modern war studies |isbn=0-7006-0586-X |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, only a fraction of all men of draft age were actually [[Conscription in the United States|conscripted]], but the [[Selective Service System]] office ("Draft Board") in each locality had broad discretion on whom to draft and whom to exempt where there was no clear guideline for exemption. In late July 1965, Johnson doubled the number of young men to be drafted per month from 17,000 to 35,000, and on August 31, signed a law making it a crime to burn a draft card.

On October 15, 1965 the student-run [[National Coordinating Committee to End the War in Vietnam]] in New York staged the first draft card burning to result in an arrest under the new law.

In 1967, the continued operation of a seemingly unfair draft system then calling as many as 40,000 men for induction each month fueled a burgeoning draft resistance movement. The draft favored white, middle-class men, which allowed an economically and racially discriminating draft to force young African American men to serve in rates that were disproportionately higher than the general population. Although in 1967 there was a smaller field of draft eligible black men–29 percent versus 63 percent of draft eligible white men–64 percent of black men were chosen to serve in the war through conscription, compared to only 31 percent of eligible white men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham III|first=Herman|title=The Brothers' Vietnam War: Black Power, Manhood, and the Military Experience|year=2003|publisher=University of Florida Press|location=Gainesville|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 1967, draft card turn-ins were held across the country, yielding more than 1,000 draft cards, later returned to the [[Justice Department (US)|Justice Department]] as an act of [[civil disobedience]]. Resisters expected to be prosecuted immediately, but [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]] instead prosecuted a group of ringleaders including Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]] and Yale chaplain [[William Sloane Coffin, Jr.]] in Boston in 1968. By the late 1960s, one quarter of all court cases dealt with the draft, including men accused of draft-dodging and men petitioning for the status of [[conscientious objector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Small|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 210,000 men were accused of draft-related offenses, 25,000 of whom were indicted.&lt;ref name="Fry 228"&gt;{{harvnb|Fry|2007|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges of unfairness led to the institution of a draft lottery for the year 1970 in which a young man's birthday determined his relative risk of being drafted (September 14 was the birthday at the top of the draft list for 1970; the following year July 9 held this distinction).

The first [[draft lottery (1969)|draft lottery]] since World War II in the United States was held on 1 December 1969 and was met with large protests and a great deal of controversy; statistical analysis indicated that the methodology of the lotteries unintentionally disadvantaged men with late year birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v5n2/datasets.starr.html Nonrandom Risk: The 1970 Draft Lottery], Norton Starr, Journal of Statistics Education v.5, n.2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was treated at length in a January 4, 1970 ''[[New York Times]]'' article titled [http://frewm.wikispaces.com/file/view/nytimes.pdf "Statisticians Charge Draft Lottery Was Not Random"].

Various antiwar groups, such as Another Mother for Peace, WILPF, and [[Women Strike for Peace|WSP]], had free draft counseling centers, where they gave young American men advice for legally and illegally evading the draft.

Over 30,000 people left the country and went to Canada, Sweden, and Mexico to avoid the draft.&lt;ref name="Fry 228"/&gt; The Japanese anti-war group [[Beheiren]] helped some American soldiers to desert and hide from the military in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailman.lbo-talk.org/2002/2002-February/003886.html Antiwar campaigners to donate documents to Vietnamese museum], Keiji Hirano, Kyodo News, The Japan Times, February 16, 2002. (Web edition hosted by lbo-talk under the title "What Japanese Anti-Vietnam War activists are up to")&lt;/ref&gt;

To gain an exemption or deferment, many men attended college, though they had to remain in college until their 26th birthday to be certain of avoiding the draft.  Some men were rejected by the military as [[Class 1-A|4-F]] unfit for service failing to meet physical, mental, or moral standards. Still others joined the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] or entered the [[Peace Corps]] as a way of avoiding Vietnam. All of these issues raised concerns about the fairness of who got selected for involuntary service, since it was often the poor or those without connections who were drafted. Ironically, in light of modern political issues, a certain exemption was a convincing claim of [[homosexuality]], but very few men attempted this because of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] involved. Also, conviction for certain crimes earned an exclusion, the topic of the anti-war song "[[Alice's Restaurant]]" by [[Arlo Guthrie]].

Even many of those who never received a deferment or exemption never served, simply because the pool of eligible men was so huge compared to the number required for service, that the draft boards never got around to drafting them when a new crop of men became available (until 1969) or because they had high lottery numbers (1970 and later).

Of those soldiers who served during the war, there was increasing opposition to the conflict amongst GIs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/history/articles/vietnam-gi-resistance 1961–1973: GI Resistance in the Vietnam War], libcom.org
&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in [[Frag (military)|fragging]] and many other activities which hampered the US's ability to wage war effectively.

Most of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote or drink in most states, and the image of young people being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of enfranchisement or the ability to drink alcohol legally also successfully pressured legislators to lower the [[voting age]] nationally and the [[drinking age]] in many states.

Student opposition groups on many college and university campuses seized campus administration offices, and in several instances forced the expulsion of [[ROTC]] programs from the campus.

Some Americans who were not subject to the draft protested the conscription of their tax dollars for the war effort. [[Tax resistance|War tax resistance]], once mostly isolated to solitary anarchists like [[Henry David Thoreau]] and religious [[pacifists]] like the [[Quakers]], became a more mainstream protest tactic. As of 1972, an estimated 200,000–500,000 people were refusing to pay the excise taxes on their telephone bills, and another 20,000 were resisting part or all of their [[income tax]] bills. Among the [[tax resister]]s were [[Joan Baez]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;''War Tax Resistance'' War Resisters League (2003) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Momentum from the protest organizations and the war's impact on the environment became focal point of issues to an overwhelmingly main force for the growth of an [[environmental movement]] in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Many of the environment-oriented demonstrations were inspired by [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'', which warned of the harmful effects of pesticide use on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/business/rachel-carsons-lessons-50-years-after-silent-spring.html|title=Rachel Carson's Lessons, 50 Years After 'Silent Spring'|last=Koehn|first=Nancy F.|date=2012-10-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For demonstrators, Carson's warnings paralleled with the United States' use of chemicals in Vietnam such as [[Agent Orange]], a chemical compound which was used to clear forestry being used as cover, initially conducted by the [[United States Air Force]] in [[Operation Ranch Hand]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/458998/operation-ranch-hand/|title=1962 - Operation Ranch Hand &gt; Air Force Historical Support Division &gt; Fact Sheets|website=www.afhistory.af.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional hearings==
{{U.S. Congressional opposition to war}}
{{see also|List of Congressional opponents of the Vietnam War}}

===United Nations intervention===
In October 1967 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on resolutions urging President Johnson to request an emergency session of the United Nations security council to consider proposals for ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, ''Give Viet Cong Voice In Peace Talks – Cohen'' (October 27, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dellums (war crimes)===
In January 1971, just weeks into his first term, Congressman [[Ron Dellums]] set up a Vietnam war crimes exhibit in an annex to his Congressional office. The exhibit featured four large posters depicting atrocities committed by American soldiers embellished with red paint. This was followed shortly thereafter by four days of hearings on "[[war crimes]]" in Vietnam, which began April 25. Dellums, assisted by the [[Citizens Commission of Inquiry]],&lt;ref name=VNA /&gt; had called for formal investigations into the allegations, but Congress chose not to endorse these proceedings. As such, the hearings were ''ad hoc'' and only informational in nature. As a condition of room use, press and camera presence were not permitted, but the proceedings were transcribed.

In addition to [Ron Dellums] (Dem-CA), an additional 19 Congressional representatives took part in the hearings, including: [[Bella Abzug]] (Dem-NY), [[Shirley Chisholm]] (Dem-NY), [[Patsy Mink]] (Dem-HI), [[Parren Mitchell]] (Dem-MD), [[John Conyers]] (Dem-MI), [[Herman Badillo]] (Dem-NY), [[James Abourezk]] (Dem-SD), [[Leo Ryan]] (Dem-CA), [[Phil Burton]] (Dem-CA), [[Don Edwards]] (Dem-CA), [[Pete McCloskey]] (Rep-CA), [[Ed Koch]] (Dem-NY), John Seiberling (Dem-OH), [[Henry Reuss]] (Dem-WI), [[Benjamin Stanley Rosenthal]] (Dem-NY), [[Robert Kastenmeier]] (Dem-WI), and [[Abner J. Mikva]] (Dem-IL).&lt;ref name=VNA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Uhl|first1=Michael|title=Vietnam Awakening|date=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3074-1|pages=203–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcripts describe alleged details of U.S. military's conduct in Vietnam. Some tactics were described as "gruesome", such as the severing of ears from corpses to verify body count. Others involved the killing of civilians. Soldiers claimed to have ordered [[artillery]] strikes on villages which did not appear to have any military presence. Soldiers were claimed to use racist terms such as "gooks", "dinks" and "slant eyes" when referring to the Vietnamese.

Witnesses described that legal, by-the-book instruction was augmented by more questionable training by non-commissioned officers as to how soldiers should conduct themselves. One witness testified about "[[free-fire area|free-fire zones]]", areas as large as {{convert|80|sqmi|km2}} in which soldiers were free to shoot any Vietnamese they encountered after curfew without first making sure they were hostile. Allegations of exaggeration of body count, torture, murder and general abuse of civilians and the psychology and motivations of soldiers and officers were discussed at length.

===Fulbright (end to war)===
{{Main|Fulbright Hearing}}

In April and May 1971, the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], chaired by Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], held a series of 22 hearings (referred to as the [[Fulbright Hearing]]s) on proposals relating to ending the war. On the third day of the hearings, April 22, 1971, future Senator and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential candidate]] [[John Kerry]] became the first [[Vietnam veteran]] to testify before Congress in opposition to the war. Speaking on behalf of [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]], he argued for the immediate, unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. During nearly two hours of discussions with committee members, Kerry related in some detail the findings of the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]], in which veterans had described personally committing or witnessing [[wiktionary:atrocity|atrocities]] and [[war crimes]].

==Effects==
The opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War had many effects, which arguably led to the eventual end of the involvement of the United States. [[Howard Zinn]], a controversial historian, states in his book ''A People's History of the United States'' that, "in the course of the war, there developed in the United States the greatest antiwar movement the nation had ever experienced, a movement that played a critical role in bringing the war to an end."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 469&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fewer soldiers===
The first effect the opposition had that led to the end of the war was that fewer soldiers were available for the army. The draft was protested and even ROTC programs too. Howard Zinn first provides a note written by a student of Boston University on May 1, 1968, which stated to his draft board, "I have absolutely no intention to report for that exam, or for induction, or to aid in any way the American war effort against the people of Vietnam…"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War had many effects, which led to the eventual end of the involvement of the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 486&lt;/ref&gt; This refusal letter soon led to an overflow of refusals ultimately leading to the event provided by Zinn stating, "In May 1969 the Oakland induction center, where draftees reported from all of Northern California, reported that of 4,400 men ordered to report for induction, 2,400 did not show up. In the first quarter of 1970 the Selective Service System, for the first time, could not meet its quota."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The fewer numbers of soldiers as an effect of the opposition to the war also can be traced to the protests against the ROTC programs in colleges. Zinn argues this by stating, "Student protests against the ROTC resulted in the canceling of those programs in over forty colleges and universities. In 1966, 191,749 college students enrolled in ROTC. By 1973, the number was 72,459."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 491&lt;/ref&gt; The number of ROTC students in college drastically dropped and the program lost any momentum it once had before the anti-war movement.

===College campuses===
A further effect of the opposition was that many college campuses were completely shut down due to protests. These protests led to wear on the government who tried to mitigate the tumultuous behavior and return the colleges back to normal. The colleges involved in the anti-war movement included ones such as, Brown University, Kent State University, and the University of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Even at The College of William and Mary unrest occurred with protests by the students and even some faculty members that resulted in "multiple informants" hired to report to the CIA on the activities of students and faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;David McCarthy, "'The Sun Never Sets on the Activities of the CIA': Project Resistance at William and Mary"&lt;/ref&gt; At the University of Massachusetts, "The 100th Commencement of the University of Massachusetts yesterday was a protest, a call for peace", "Red fists of protest, white peace symbols, and blue doves were stenciled on black academic gowns, and nearly every other senior wore an armband representing a plea for peace."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''  Page 491&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "At Boston College, a Catholic institution, six thousand people gathered that evening in the gymnasium to denounce the war."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''   Page 490&lt;/ref&gt; At Kent State University, "on May 4, when students gathered to demonstrate against the war, National Guardsmen fired into the crowd. Four students were killed."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 490&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, "At the Brown University commencement in 1969, two-thirds of the graduating class turned their backs when Henry Kissinger stood up to address them."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Basically, from all of the evidence here provided by the historians, Zinn and McCarthy, the second effect was very prevalent and it was the uproar at many colleges and universities as an effect of the opposition to the United States' involvement in Vietnam.

===American soldiers===
Another effect the opposition to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States''  Page 496&lt;/ref&gt; The statement of one of the soldiers reads, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''A People's History of the United States'' Page 496&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.

A 4 hour bloody battle ensued after the police attacked the march, with injuries on both sides and -a partial victory for the anti-war movement because LBJ never dared speak in public again.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first massive war protests in the United States and the first in Los Angeles, Ending in a clash with riot police, it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed.&lt;ref name = LATretro /&gt; The vigor of the response from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], initially intended to prevent the demonstrators from storming the hotel where Johnson was speaking, was to a certain extent based on exaggerated reports from undercover agents which had infiltrated the organizations sponsoring the protest. "Unresisting demonstrators were beaten – some in front of literally thousands of witnesses – without even the pretext of and attempt to make an arrest."&lt;ref name = ACLU /&gt; A crowd the Los Angeles Times reports at 10,000 clashed with 500 riot police outside President Johnson's fundraiser at the Century City Plaza Hotel.

* July 30&amp;nbsp;– Gallup poll reported 52% of Americans disapproved of Johnson's handling of the war, 41% thought the U.S. made a mistake in sending troops, and over 56% thought the U.S. was losing the war or at an impasse.
* On August 28, 1967, U.S. representative [[Tim Lee Carter]] (R-KY) stated before congress: "Let us now, while we are yet strong, bring our men home, every man jack of them. The Vietcong fight fiercely and tenaciously because it is their land and we are foreigners intervening in their civil war. If we must fight, let us fight in defense of our homeland and our own hemisphere."
* On September 20, over one thousand members of WSP rallied at the White House. The police used brutal tactics to try to limit it to 100 people (as per the law) or stop the demonstration, and the event tarnished the wholesome and nonviolent reputation of the WSP.&lt;ref name=swerdlow&gt;{{cite book|title=Give Peace A Chance: Exploring the Vietnam Antiwar Movement |year=1992|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, New York|pages=159–170|author=Amy Swerdlow|authorlink="Not My Son, Not Your Son, Not Their Sons": Mothers Against the Vietnam Draft|editor=Melvin Small, William Hoover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large demonstration organized by the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]], a crowd of nearly 100,000 met at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. and at least 30,000 people then [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|marched to the Pentagon]] for another rally and an all night vigil. Some, including [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]], attempted to "exorcise" and "levitate" the building, while others engaged in [[civil disobedience]] on the steps of the Pentagon. These actions were interrupted by clashes with soldiers and police. In all, 647 arrests were made. When a plot to airdrop 10,000 flowers on the Pentagon was foiled by undercover agents, some of these flowers ended up being placed in the barrels of [[military police|MP]]'s rifles, as seen in famous photographs of the event (such as ''[[Flower Power (photograph)|Flower Power]]'' and ''[[The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet]]''). [[Norman Mailer]] documented the events surrounding the march, and the march on the Pentagon itself, in his [[non-fiction novel]], ''[[The Armies of the Night]]''.
* In November 1967 a non-binding referendum was voted on in San Francisco, California which posed the question of whether there should be an immediate withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam.

The American public's support of the Vietnam War decreased as the war continued on. As public support decreased, opposition grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunch |first=William|date=March 1979|title=American Public Opinion and the War in VietnamWar|jstor=447561|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] News Service began asking the American public whether it was a "mistake to send troops to Vietnam" in August 1965. At the time less than a quarter of Americans polled, 24%, believed it was a mistake to send troops to Vietnam while 60% of Americans polled believed the opposite. Three years later, in September 1968,  54% of Americans polled believed it was a mistake to send troops to Vietnam while 37% believed it was not a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/18097/iraq-versus-vietnam-comparison-public-opinion.aspx|title=Iraq Versus Vietnam: A Comparison of Public Opinion|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|date=|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1965 Gallup Poll asked the question, "Have you ever felt the urge to organize or join a public demonstration about something?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/vault/190886/gallup-vault-urge-demonstrate.aspx|title=Gallup Vault: The Urge to Demonstrate|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive responses were quite low; not many people wanted to protest anything, and those who did want to show a public demonstration often wanted to demonstrate in support of the Vietnam War. However, when the American Public was asked in 1990,  "Looking back, do you wish that you had made a stronger effort to protest or demonstrate against the Vietnam War, or not", 25 percent said they wished they had.

A major factor in the American public's disapproval of the Vietnam War came from the casualties being inflicted on US forces. In a Harris poll from 1967 asking what aspect most troubled people most about the Vietnam war the plurality answer of 31% was "the loss of our young men." A separated 1967 Harris poll asked the American public,"How has the war affected your own family, job or financial life?" The majority of respondents, 55%, said that it had had no effect on their lives. Of the 45% who indicated the war had affected their lives, 32% listed inflation as the most important factor while 25% listed casualties inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorell|first=Mark|date=March 1985|title=Casualties, Public Opinion, and Presidential Policy during the Vietnam War|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2007/R3060.pdf|journal=Casualties, Public Opinion, and Presidential Policy during the Vietnam War|volume=|pages=27|via=Rand Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war continued the public became much more opposed to the war as they could see was not ending. In a poll from December 1967, 71% of the public believed the war would not be settled in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/questionDetail.cfm?keyword=vietnam%20and%20war&amp;keywordoptions=1&amp;exclude=&amp;excludeOptions=1&amp;topic=Any&amp;organization=Any&amp;label=&amp;fromdate=01/01/1935&amp;toDate=&amp;stitle=&amp;sponsor=&amp;studydate=December%20712,%201967&amp;sample=1549&amp;qstn_list=&amp;qstnid=361925&amp;qa_list=&amp;qstn_id4=361925&amp;study_list=&amp;lastSearchId=317674060377&amp;archno=USAIPO1967-0755&amp;keywordDisplay=|title=The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research|last=2008|first=Solomon Berhe, Derek Doran, Alberto De la Rosa Algaran, Darlene Hart, Marc Maynard, Meena Stout,|date=|website=ropercenter.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later the same question was asked and 55% of people did not think the war would be settled in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/questionDetail.cfm?keyword=vietnam%20and%20war&amp;keywordoptions=1&amp;exclude=&amp;excludeOptions=1&amp;topic=Any&amp;organization=Any&amp;label=&amp;fromdate=01/01/1935&amp;toDate=&amp;stitle=&amp;sponsor=&amp;studydate=December%205-10,%201968&amp;sample=1497&amp;qstn_list=&amp;qstnid=362300&amp;qa_list=&amp;qstn_id4=362300&amp;study_list=&amp;lastSearchId=317674060377&amp;archno=USAIPO1968-0772&amp;keywordDisplay=|title=The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research|last=2008|first=Solomon Berhe, Derek Doran, Alberto De la Rosa Algaran, Darlene Hart, Marc Maynard, Meena Stout,|date=|website=ropercenter.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the American public was asked about the Vietnam-era Anti-War movement in the 1990s, 39% of the public said the approved while 39% said they disapproved. The last 22% were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/CFIDE/cf/action/ipoll/questionDetail.cfm?keyword=vietnam%20and%20war&amp;keywordoptions=1&amp;exclude=&amp;excludeOptions=1&amp;topic=Any&amp;organization=Any&amp;label=&amp;fromdate=01/01/1935&amp;toDate=&amp;stitle=&amp;sponsor=&amp;studydate=01-JAN-34&amp;sample=1225&amp;qstn_list=&amp;qstnid=217461&amp;qa_list=&amp;qstn_id4=217461&amp;study_list=&amp;lastSearchId=317674060458&amp;archno=&amp;keywordDisplay=|title=The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research|last=2008|first=Solomon Berhe, Derek Doran, Alberto De la Rosa Algaran, Darlene Hart, Marc Maynard, Meena Stout,|date=|website=ropercenter.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogans and chants==
*"'''Hell, no, we won't go!'''" was heard in antidraft and antiwar protests throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/10000981@N02/790033026/|title="Hell no, we won't go!"

*"'''Dow shall not kill'''" and "'''Making money burning babies!'''" were two slogans used by students at [[UCLA]] and other colleges to protest the [[Dow Chemical Company]], the maker of [[napalm]] and [[Agent Orange]].&lt;ref name="Fry 228"/&gt;
*"'''Stop the war, feed the poor'''" was a popular slogan used by socially conscious and minority antiwar groups, protesting that the war diverted funds that struggling Americans desperately needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gills|1992|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"'''Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, the Viet Cong are gonna win'''" was a common anti-war chant during anti-war marches and rallies in the later sixties. 
*"'''Hey, hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?'''" was especially chanted by students and other marchers and demonstrators in opposition to [[Lyndon B.

The '''Seven Wonders of the World''' or the '''Seven Wonders of the Ancient World''' is a list of remarkable constructions of [[classical antiquity]] given by various authors in guidebooks or poems popular among ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] tourists. Although the list, in its current form, did not stabilise until the [[Renaissance]], the first such lists of seven wonders date from the 1st-2nd century BC. The original list inspired [[Wonders of the World|innumerable versions]] through the ages, often listing seven entries. Of the original Seven Wonders, only one—the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also called the Pyramid of [[Khufu]], after the pharaoh who built it), the oldest of the ancient wonders—remains relatively intact. The [[Colossus of Rhodes]], the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], the [[Temple of Artemis]] and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Statue of Zeus]] were all destroyed. The location and ultimate fate of the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|Hanging Gardens]] are unknown, and there is speculation that they may not have existed at all.

==Background==
The Greek conquest of much of the known western world in the 4th century BC gave Hellenistic travellers access to the [[civilization]]s of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[History of Iran|Persians]], and [[Babylonia]]ns.&lt;ref name=seven_wonders /&gt; Impressed and captivated by the landmarks and marvels of the various lands, these travellers began to list what they saw to remember them.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the Past: World History | url = http://worldhistory.byethost8.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite web | title = The Seven Wonders | author = Paul Lunde | date = May–June 1980 | publisher = Saudi Aramco World | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198003/the.seven.wonders.htm | accessdate = 2009-09-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091013125703/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198003/the.seven.wonders.htm | archive-date = 2009-10-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of "wonders", the ancient Greeks spoke of "''theamata''" (θεάματα), which means "sights", in other words "things to be seen" (Τὰ ἑπτὰ θεάματα τῆς οἰκουμένης [γῆς] ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Tà heptà theámata tēs oikoumenēs [gēs]}}''). Later, the word for "wonder" ("''thaumata''" θαύματα, "wonders") was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clayton | first = Peter | authorlink = |author2=Martin J.

The first reference to a list of seven such monuments was given by [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diodorus Siculus|title=Bibliotheca Historica, Books I-V|publisher=Perseus Project, Tufts University|location=2.11.5|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+2.11.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Peter A.|last2=Price|first2=Martin|title=The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136748097|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Df-AAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158|accessdate=25 November 2016|language=en|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epigrammist [[Antipater of Sidon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Anthology, Volume III|publisher=Perseus Project, Tufts University|location=Book 9, chapter 58|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0474%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D58}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lived around or before 100 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Dictionary Volume III|publisher=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w1FAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=25 November 2016|language=en|year=1843}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a list of seven such monuments, including six of the present list (substituting the walls of Babylon for the lighthouse):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Peter A.|last2=Price|first2=Martin|title=The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136748103|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQSBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=25 November 2016|language=en|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I have gazed on the walls of impregnable Babylon along which chariots may race, and on the Zeus by the banks of the Alpheus, I have seen the hanging gardens, and the Colossus of the Helios, the great man-made mountains of the lofty pyramids, and the gigantic tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the sacred house of Artemis that towers to the clouds, the others were placed in the shade, for the sun himself has never looked upon its equal outside Olympus. – ''Greek Anthology'' IX.58}}

[[File:Pyramide Kheops.JPG|thumb|The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing]]

Another 2nd century BC observer, who claimed to be the mathematician [[Philo of Byzantium]],&lt;ref name=brittanica&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica Micropædia Volume 10 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year =1995 | location =USA | page =666 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-85229-605-3 | author = }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a short account entitled ''The Seven Sights of the World''. However, the incomplete surviving manuscript only covered six of the supposedly seven places, which agreed with Antipater's list.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

Earlier and later lists by the historian [[Herodotus]] (484 BC–ca. 425 BC) and the architect [[Callimachus]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (ca. 305–240 BC), housed at the Museum of [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], survived only as references.

The [[Colossus of Rhodes]] was the last of the seven to be completed, after 280 BC, and the first to be destroyed, by an earthquake in 226/225 BC. Hence, all seven existed at the same time for a period of less than 60 years.

==Scope==
The list covered only the sculptural and architectural monuments of the Mediterranean and [[Middle East]]ern regions,&lt;ref name=brittanica /&gt; which then comprised the known world for the Greeks. Hence, extant sites beyond this realm were not considered as part of contemporary accounts.&lt;ref name=seven_wonders&gt;{{cite web | title = The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World | url = http://www.amazeingart.com/seven-wonders/7-wonders.html|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary accounts, coming from Hellenistic writers, also heavily influenced the places included in the wonders list. Five of the seven entries are a celebration of Greek accomplishments in the arts and architecture (the exceptions being the Pyramids of Giza and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon).

===Arts and architecture===
[[File:Maerten van Heemskerck - Panorama with the Abduction of Helen Amidst the Wonders of the Ancient World - Walters 37656.jpg|right|thumb|In this painting by [[Maerten van Heemskerck]], the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World are depicted as a background for the abduction of Helen by Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21286 |title= Panorama with the Abduction of Helen Amidst the Wonders of the Ancient World}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum]]
The seven wonders on Antipater's list won praises for their notable features, ranging from superlatives of the highest or largest of their types, to the artistry with which they were executed. Their architectural and artistic features were imitated throughout the Hellenistic world and beyond.

The Greek influence in Roman culture, and the revival of Greco-Roman artistic styles during the Renaissance caught the imagination of European artists and travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wonders of Europe | url = http://www.7wonders.org/wonders/europe/|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings and sculptures alluding to Antipater's list were made, while adventurers flocked to the actual sites to personally witness the wonders. Legends circulated to further complement the superlatives of the wonders.

===Modern lists===
Of Antipater's wonders, the only one that has survived to the present day is the Great Pyramid of Giza. Its brilliant white stone facing had survived intact until around 1300 AD, when local communities removed most of the stonework for building materials. The existence of the Hanging Gardens has not been proven, although theories abound.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]] (2013), ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World wonder traced.'' OUP {{ISBN|978-0-19-966226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records and archaeology confirm the existence of the other five wonders. The Temple of Artemis and the Statue of Zeus were destroyed by fire, while the Lighthouse of Alexandria, Colossus, and tomb of Mausolus were destroyed by earthquakes. Among the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to have survived are sculptures from the tomb of Mausolus and the Temple of Artemis in the [[British Museum]] in London.

Still, the listing of seven of the most marvellous architectural and artistic human achievements continued beyond the Ancient Greek times to the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and to the modern age. The Roman poet [[Martial]] and the Christian bishop [[Gregory of Tours]] had their versions.&lt;ref name=seven_wonders /&gt; Reflecting the rise of Christianity and the factor of time, nature and the hand of man overcoming Antipater's seven wonders, Roman and Christian sites began to figure on the list, including the [[Colosseum]], [[Noah's Ark]] and [[Solomon's Temple]].&lt;ref name=seven_wonders /&gt;&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; In the 6th century, a list of seven wonders was compiled by St. [[Gregory of Tours]]: the list&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Peter and Price, Martin: The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (Routledge, 1988), pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; included the Temple of Solomon, the [[Pharos of Alexandria]] and Noah's Ark.

Modern historians, working on the premise that the original Seven Ancient Wonders List was limited in its geographic scope, also had their versions to encompass sites beyond the Hellenistic realm—from the Seven Wonders of the ''Ancient World'' to the Seven Wonders of the ''World''. Indeed, the "seven wonders" label has spawned innumerable versions among international organizations, publications and individuals based on different themes—works of nature, engineering masterpieces, constructions of the Middle Ages, etc. Its purpose has also changed from just a simple travel guidebook or a compendium of curious places, to lists of sites to defend or to preserve.

'''Shanzhai''' or '''shan zhai''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|山寨}}|p={{linktext|shānzhài}}|j=saan1 zaai6}}) refers to [[counterfeit consumer goods]], including imitation and trademark infringing brands and/or particularly electronics, in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmidle|first=Nicholas|title=Inside the Knockoff-Tennis-Shoe Factory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22fake-t.html|accessdate=8 September 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Literally "mountain village" or "mountain stronghold", the term refers to the mountain stockades of regional warlords or bandits, far away from official control. "Shanzhai" can also be stretched to refer to people who are lookalikes, low-quality or improved goods, as well as things done in [[parody]].

==Origin==
According to the ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Dictionary]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=现代汉语词典/現代漢語詞典|s=|t=|labels=no}}), "Shanzhai" can stand for two meanings:
# A fenced place in the forest.
# Villages in the mountain that have stockade houses.

Historically, "shanzhai" is sometimes used as a metaphor to describe bandits who oppose and evade the corrupted authority to perform deeds they see as justified. One example of such bandits is the story of ''[[Water Margin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/268947.html?wtp=tt |title=Baidu Encyclopedia "Shanzhai" |publisher=Baike.baidu.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "Shanzhai" to refer to imitation products comes from [[Cantonese]] slang, in which "shanzhai factory" means an ill-equipped, low-end and family-based factory. However, with the accumulation of profit, quite a few of those factories invest a lot of money to improve their equipment. Some factories also get investment from someone other than family members. Nowadays, a significant portion of Shanzhai factories are no longer ill-equipped or family-based. 

Their products are no longer poor-quality. Yet they still can not escape from the fate of no-brand (or fake brand), not-for-sale in top department stores with non-''shanzha''i products.  One of the motivations for going 'Shanzhai' is the difficult regulations the Chinese government had established to become an official mobile phone manufacturer.  So to avoid the hassles companies try to operate under the radar.  They can avoid taxes and regulation in this way.

Another account of the origin is that because imitation electronic appliance manufacturers are largely located in [[Shenzhen]], wholesalers from other parts of China started calling their products "Shenzhen product". Gradually "Shenzhen product" became "Shanzhai product" because they sound similar when people speak [[mandarin Chinese]] with a Cantonese accent.

==Shanzhai products==
The use of "shanzhai" became popular with the outstanding sale performance of "shanzhai" mobile phones. According to [[Gartner]]’s data, 1.15 billion mobile phones were sold worldwide in 2007, and according to data provided by the Chinese government, 150 million "Shanzhai" mobile phones were sold in the same year, thus making up more than one tenth of the global sales.&lt;ref name="Shanzhai’s Destruction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.163.com/09/0420/10/57BBE6EL0009388P.html |title=Shanzhai’s Destruction |publisher=Tech.163.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Financial Times estimated that Shanzhai phones accounted for about 20 per cent of the global [[2G]] mobile phone market.&lt;ref name=mediatek&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market for "shanzhai" mobile phones is not only in China, but are also found in the surrounding developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The outstanding sales performance of "shanzhai" mobile phones is usually attributed to their low price, multifunctional performance and imitations of trendy mobile phone design. Although "shanzhai" companies do not use branding as a marketing strategy, they are known for their flexibility of design to meet specific market needs. For example, during [[Barack Obama]]’s 2008 U.S. presidential election campaign, "shanzhai" mobile phone companies started selling "Obama" mobile phones in [[Kenya]], with the slogan "yes we can" and Obama’s name on the back of the mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3zai.org.cn/shanzhai/shanzhaishouji/2009-01/136.html|title=Obama Brand Shanzhai Cell Phone|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also designed "[[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest]]" ({{Lang-zh|c=鸟窝|s=|t=|labels=no}}) and "[[Fuwa]]" ({{Lang-zh|c=福娃|s=|t=|labels=no}}) mobile phones in light of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympic Games]].

Before the booming shanzhai mobile phone industries, since the early 2000s, imitation electronic products such as DVD players and [[MP3 player|MP3]] players were already manufactured in the [[Pearl River Delta]] ({{Lang-zh|c=珠三角|s=|t=|labels=no}}) area.&lt;ref name="Shanzhai’s Destruction"/&gt; Many shanzhai mobile phone companies accumulated their capital in that process.  After understanding that many buyers  prefer lookalike phones without the blaring of fake logos, many manufacturers adopted a practice of not using fraudulent logos. They instead opt for a generically designed logo. This allows overseas buyers to find a lookalike phone easily, without the fake logo.

Shanzhai mobile phones can be sold at very low prices compared to other mobile phones. On average, the imitations sell at retailers at about $US100-$US150, while production costs are about $US20.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barboza|first=David|title=In China, Knockoff Cellphones Are a Hit|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2009-04-27|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/technology/28cell.html?hpw|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanzhai mobile phone factories are able to manufacture at a very low cost for two reasons, they do not buy mobile phone manufacture licenses from the Chinese government, thus saving all the related costs.

CECT is one of the many brands of [[cellular phone]]s manufactured in [[China]]. CECT offers unauthorized [[clone (computing)|clones]] or [[replicas]] of the [[Apple Inc.]] [[iPhone]] and various [[Nokia]] cell phones manufactured in [[China]] and sold at a fraction of the price of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/technologyNewsMolt/idUKPEK33380420080623|title=Hi-phone anyone? Fake mobiles threaten China brands|publisher=Reuters UK|accessdate=22 July 2008| date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one reseller has been subject to legal demands from [[Apple Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/08/05/12/iphone.knockoff.threatened/|title=Apple threatens European iPhone knockoff reseller|publisher=MacNN|accessdate=22 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One company that earned notoriety for producing shanzhai smartphones is [[Goophone]], which in 2012 was reported to have filed a patent for the "Goophone i5", a [[MediaTek]]-powered clone marketed prior to the real [[iPhone 5]]'s official release.&lt;ref name="Hodgkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/16/wico-goophone-iphone-6-clones/|title=Wico and Goophone Beat Apple to Market with Android-Based iPhone 6 Clones|last=Hodgkins|first=Kelly|date=16 July 2014|work=[[MacRumors]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many fake garments, watches, bags, and shoes in China, they are not called "shanzhai" products, perhaps because these fake products came into existence earlier than fake mobile phones and the newer use of the term "shanzhai". "Shanzhai" mobile phones may stand out as the most successful and most often discussed "shanzhai" products, because mobile phones strongly symbolise wealth in China, but they are much more affordable than other symbolic signs of wealth such as cars and apartments.

Quite a few shanzhai mobile phone companies tried to exploit the market by making shanzhai [[Netbooks]], but these gained little market acceptance and sales.

"Shanzhai" electric cars, which run on lead-acid batteries and sell for as little as $US2000-$US3000, are being produced in the Shandong province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.asiasociety.org/chinagreen/shanzhai-electric-car-revolution/ |title=Shanzhai Electric Car Revolution 山寨电动汽车革命|publisher=China Green|date= |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce announced a crackdown on shanzhai phone sellers and manufacturers. The administration blamed "money-stealing" services that used the cheap phones to steal services using customers' SIM cards. Industry commentator Liu Sheng said that it was more likely to be linked to the country's intellectual property rights protection campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Shanzhaiism==
Shanzhaiism ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨主義|s=|t=|labels=no}}) is a philosophical term denoting a Chinese style of innovation with a peasant mind-set. 

Shanzhaiism has an equivalent English term: tinker. Lacking a garage, they build products in villages in the mountains that have stockade houses. However, with shanzhaiism in mind, people can produce fake and counterfeit products in a massively organized way.

Shanzhaiism can be analyzed using a term coined by Jean-Paul Sartre: [[Bad faith (existentialism)|Bad faith]]. Fake and unlicensed products are produced. For example, there was once a so-called  Fake-One Road&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/ada2aje/6RDAUWHUWeg#!topic/ada2aje/6RDAUWHUWeg|title=Whole street of Fake Famous brand name shops to be opened in China - Wenan Jie|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120223062019/http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/jw!m3yjq.KQGRu5wWDGLuhCpQ--/article?mid=989&amp;prev=990&amp;next=976 Nanjing Shanzhai Street (南京山寨一條街,真是大開眼界..山寨手機/山寨家電/山寨電腦..等等.還有其他的山寨版品牌,以後可以在大陸一次買足 - 雅登廚飾/廚具設計/系統櫥櫃/美國/荷蘭廚房家電--雲林/嘉義生活館) - tw.myblog.yahoo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨一條街|s=|t=|labels=no}}) in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408997/Wanda-Plaza-China-lined-counterfeit-brands-called-knock-alley.html|title=Fancy a cheap Starbocks or some Häagen Dezs ice cream?

This kind of phenomena is not confined to fake products. The mind set of shanzhaiism even extends to advertisements. For example, a [https://web.archive.org/web/20121220153346/http://www.clonedinchina.com/2009/06/spokeman-obama-and-a-blackberry-storm-9500-clone.html shanzhai phone advertisement] used the former president of the United States, Obama, to promote its shanzhai products.

==Shanzhai culture==

The frequent reference to shanzhai cell phones on internet and in traditional media made people start labeling low-cost imitation cultural activities as shanzhai as well. Some of the most well-known events include the [[Shanzhai National Spring Gala]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨春节联欢晚会|s=|t=|labels=no}}), Shanzhai Lecture Room ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨百家讲坛|s=|t=|labels=no}}), Shanzhai Olympic Torch Relay ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨奥运火炬传递|s=|t=|labels=no}}), and Shanzhai Nobel Prize ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨诺贝尔奖|s=|t=|labels=no}}). One thing these events have in common is that they all imitate high-end, popular yet authoritative events in which grass-roots power usually has no participating role.

While the purpose of the above-mentioned shanzhai events is arguably just for the participants to have fun and to experience being the authority, other shanzhai cultural phenomena, like the shanzhai products, are profit-oriented. For example, some low-end performing agencies will hire [[Doppelgänger|people who look like pop stars]] to perform in rural areas, where people cannot afford to watch the actual stars. Thus shanzhai [[Jay Chou]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨周杰伦|s=|t=|labels=no}}), shanzhai [[Andy Lau]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨刘德华|s=|t=|labels=no}}) and shanzhai [[Faye Wong]] ({{Lang-zh|c=山寨王菲|s=|t=|labels=no}}) appear in many underdeveloped places in China.

Shanzhai movies are another profit-driven shanzhai phenomenon. These movies usually have low budgets, yet achieve commercial success by [[parody]]ing, making fun of or borrowing elements from high-end [[Hollywood]] blockbuster movies. One of the first shanzhai movies is [[Ning Hao]]’s ({{Lang-zh|c=宁浩|s=|t=|labels=no}}) ''[[Crazy Stone (film)|Crazy Stone]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=疯狂的石头|s=|t=|labels=no}}). It imitates the multi-angle shooting, rapid cutting and stunts that are usually used in Hollywood action movies, yet it retains the grass-roots Chinese set up. With a 3 million Hong Kong dollar budget, ''Crazy Stone'' achieved 22 million-box-office revenue. Following its success, shanzhai movies like "the Big Movie" series ("{{Lang-zh|c=大电影"系列|s=|t=|labels=no}}") and ''No.2 in the World'' ({{Lang-zh|c=天下第二|s=|t=|labels=no}}) were made. Some also argue that Hollywood parody movies like ''[[Scary Movie]]'' are the true inspirational force behind shanzhai movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanzhaihuo.com/chinanews/shanzhai-movie-yuanzihaolaiwu-fengkuangdeshitoushibizu.html |title="Shanzhai" Movie is From Hollywood; the "Crazy Stone" is Their Ancestor |publisher=Shanzhaihuo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The heated online debate about whether shanzhai should be encouraged or denounced is arguably due to Ni Ping ({{lang|zh|倪萍}}), a well-known [[China Central Television|CCTV]] host's proposal during the [[Lianghui]] (two conferences) this year.{{which|date=December 2012}} She proposed to establish relevant legislation that will eliminate the shanzhai phenomenon by arguing that the copycat culture associated with shanzhai will stifle genuine creativity and hamper awareness of property rights. While some agree with her, others point out that in order to give objective comment on the shanzhai phenomenon, one has to distinguish shanzhai products from "pirated" products and shanzhai culture from shanzhai products. They also argue that although many shanzhai culture events manifest themselves as copycat events, some also have true original elements. Western media outlets like ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123257138952903561|title=Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Rebellion in China|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|author=Sky Canaves and Juliet Ye|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2009/03/a-chinese-pirat.html|title=A Chinese Pirate Unmasks|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|author=Evan Osnos|authorlink=Evan Osnos|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported about the shanzhai phenomenon and presented it as a form of rebellion and resistance to the mainstream culture.

The '''South American Continental Exhibition''' (Exposición Continental Sud-Americana) was held in [[Buenos Aires]] from 14 March&lt;ref name="relics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ibamuseum/texts/Andermann03.htm|access-date=19 November 2017|title=Relics and Selves: Iconographies of the National in Argentina, Brazil and Chile, 1880-1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; to
31 July 1882.&lt;ref name="1882exhibition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elarcondelahistoria.com/la-exposicion-continental-sudamericana-1531882/|access-date=18 November 2017|language=Spanish|title=LA EXPOSICIÓN CONTINENTAL SUDAMERICANA (15-3-1882)  El arcón de la historia Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

The fair was organised by the Industrial Club of Buenos Aires who had organised an industrial exhibition in Buenos Aires in 1877.&lt;ref name="1882exhibition" /&gt; [[Julio Argentino Roca|Julio A Roca]] (president) inaugurated the exhibition with the honorary chair of the committee [[Nicolás Avellaneda]]&lt;ref name="relics" /&gt; stating that the exhibition represented industrial progress.&lt;ref name="1882exhibition" /&gt;

[[National Congress of Argentina|Congress]] gave funds for the exhibition&lt;ref name="1882exhibition" /&gt; which were used for premises in [[Plaza Once]].

==Exhibits and prizes==
Exhibits covered: arts; beer, cigarettes and wine; clothing and footwear; and soap from Argentina and other countries in America and Europe.&lt;ref name="1882exhibition" /&gt;

Prize winners included the Brazilian photographers [[Marc Ferrez (photographer)|Marc Ferrez]], {{illm|Insley Pacheco|pt|Joaquim José Insley Pacheco}}.&lt;ref name="1882BAprize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enciclopedia.itaucultural.org.br/evento528684/exposicao-continental-de-buenos-aires-1882-buenos-aires-argentina|access-date=19 November 2017|language=Spanish|title=Exposição Continental de Buenos Aires (1882 : Buenos Aires, Argentina) &amp;#124; Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Brazilian 'Esberard Glass and Crystal' company.&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carnivalglassworldwide.com/esberard.html|access-date=20 November 2017|title=Esberard, Brazil - Carnival Glass - Carnival Glass Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical show==
A historical show was announced on the 15 March 1882. This was to cover the history of the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] with sections including 
"Argentinian prehistorical", "Columbian era", numismatics, paintings, prints, manuscripts, maps (including nautical maps) and furniture.&lt;ref name="1882exhibition" /&gt;

The tone of the exhibition was debated with [[Estanislao Zeballos]] of the exhibition organising committee arguing that war trophies that could embarrass potentially participating nations (Brazil and Paraguay) be excluded.&lt;ref name="1882exhibition" /&gt;

==Closure==

By the time it closed at the end of July 50 000 people had visited.&lt;ref name="1882exhibition" /&gt;

Its  radio signal was easily detectable even by [[amateur radio|radio amateurs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/features/2007/09/28/03/?nc=1 |title=Sputnik and Amateur Radio |date=28 September 2007 |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |author=Ralph H.

This surprise success precipitated the American [[Sputnik crisis]] and triggered the [[Space Race]], a part of the [[Cold War]]. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_88.shtml Walter A.

Tracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper [[Earth's atmosphere#Temperature and the atmospheric layers|atmosphere]] could be deduced from its [[aerodynamic drag|drag]] on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the [[ionosphere]].

Sputnik 1 was launched during the [[International Geophysical Year]] from [[Gagarin's Start|Site No.1/5]], at the 5th [[Tyuratam]] range, in [[Kazakh SSR]] (now known as the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]). The satellite travelled at about {{convert|29000|km/h|mph m/s}}, taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit.

==Before the launch==

===Satellite construction project===
On 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist [[Sergei Korolev]] proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to Minister of Defence Industry [[Dimitri Ustinov]]. Korolev forwarded a report by [[Mikhail Klavdievich Tikhonravov|Mikhail Tikhonravov]] with an overview of similar projects abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rgantd.ru/vzal/korolev/pics/015_025.jpg |title=On the possibility of Earth's artificial satellite development |language=Russian |first=Sergei |last=Korolev |date=26 May 1954 |access-date=26 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408193139/http://rgantd.ru/vzal/korolev/pics/015_025.jpg |archivedate=8 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tikhonravov had emphasized that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.&lt;ref name="ZE"&gt;[http://www.buran.ru/htm/gud%2017.htm Создание первых искусственных спутников Земли.

On 29 July 1955, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] announced through his press secretary that the United States would launch an artificial satellite during the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/monograph10/korspace.html |title=Korolev and Freedom of Space: 14 February 1990 – 4 October 1957 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, on 8 August, the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rgantd.ru/vzal/korolev/pics/015_001.jpg |title=On the creation of the Earth's artificial satellite |author=The Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU |language=Russian |date=8 August 1955 |access-date=26 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408193149/http://rgantd.ru/vzal/korolev/pics/015_001.jpg |archivedate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August [[Vasily Ryabikov]] – the head of the State Commission on [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7 rocket]] test launches – held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/vetrov/korolev-delo/06-01.html |title=G. S.

It prevented contact between the batteries and the transmitter prior to launch. Currently on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] [[National Air and Space Museum]].]]
On 30 January 1956 the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named ''Object D'', was planned to be completed in 1957–58; it would have a mass of {{convert|1000|to|1400|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and would carry {{convert|200|to|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of scientific instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nauka.relis.ru/05/9710/05710002.htm |title=The Beginning |language=Russian |access-date=26 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205937/http://nauka.relis.ru/05/9710/05710002.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first test launch of "Object D" was scheduled for 1957.&lt;ref name="ZE" /&gt; Work on the satellite was to be divided among institutions as follows:&lt;ref name="NL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lidorenko.ru/ns1.htm |title=On the Launch of the First Earth's artificial satellite in the USSR |first=Nikolai |last=Lidorenko |language=Russian |access-date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] was responsible for the general scientific leadership and research instruments supply
* the Ministry of Defence Industry and its primary design bureau [[OKB-1]] were assigned the task of building the satellite
* the Ministry of Radiotechnical Industry would develop the control system, radio/technical instruments and the [[telemetry]] system
* the Ministry of Ship Building Industry would develop [[gyroscope]] devices
* the Ministry of Machine Building would develop ground launching, refueling and transportation means
* the Ministry of Defense was responsible for conducting launches

Preliminary design work was completed by July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its [[ion]] composition, the [[solar wind]], [[magnetic field]]s, and [[cosmic ray]]s. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites. A system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/nk/1997/16/16-1997.html |title=40 Years of Space Era |language=Russian |access-date=26 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229190257/http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/nk/1997/16/16-1997.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1956 it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low [[specific impulse]] produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 sec instead of the planned 309 to 310 sec). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958.&lt;ref name="ZE" /&gt; Object D would later fly as ''[[Sputnik 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lanius, ''et al'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in April–May 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light ({{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated 'Object PS'.&lt;ref name="1957sat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://claudelafleur.qc.ca/Spacecrafts-1957.html |title=Spacecrafts launched in 1957 |access-date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations.&lt;ref name="1957sat" /&gt; The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71) was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.&lt;ref name="1957sat" /&gt;

{{Main|Sputnik (rocket)|R-7 Semyorka}}
The [[R-7 Semyorka]] was initially designed as an [[ICBM]] by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arms.ru/nuclear/R7.htm |script-title=ru:Межконтинентальная баллистическая ракета Р-7 |publisher=Arms.ru |language=Russian |access-date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO) designation 8K71.&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104,&lt;ref name="CoxStoiko69"&gt;Cox &amp; Stoiko, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and Type A.&lt;ref&gt;Bilstein, p.387.&lt;/ref&gt; A special [[reconnaissance]] commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket [[proving ground]] (the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as "NIIP-5", or "GIK-5" in the post-Soviet time). The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_origin.html |title=Origin of the test range in Tyuratam |author=Anatoly Zak |authorlink= |year=2015 |publisher=Anatoly Zak |work=RussianSpaceWeb.com |access-date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units. On 14 June 1956 Sergei Korolev decided to adapt the R-7 rocket to the 'Object D',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik3.html Sputnik-3] at Russianspaceweb.com&lt;/ref&gt; that would later be replaced by the much lighter 'Object PS'.

The first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400&amp;nbsp;km downrange.&lt;ref name="AR7"&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/r7.htm R-7] at Astronautix.com&lt;/ref&gt; Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10–11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/launchers/rocket-r7.html|title=S.P.Korolev RSC Energia - LAUNCHERS|website=www.energia.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July.&lt;ref name="AR7" /&gt; An electrical short caused the [[vernier engine]]s to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7&amp;nbsp;km from the pad.&lt;ref name="RR7"&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/r7.html R-7 family of launchers and ICBMs] at Russianspaceweb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 [[Moscow Time]],&lt;ref name="AR7" /&gt; was successful. The rocket's core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} after traveling 6,000&amp;nbsp;km. On 27 August [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September&lt;ref name="AR7" /&gt; was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry,&lt;ref name="RR7" /&gt; and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfill its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1,&lt;ref&gt;Harford, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the delay in the rocket's military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.&lt;ref name="NKA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/237/36.shtml |trans-title=Creation and Launch of the First Earth's Satellite |author=V.Poroshkov |publisher=Novosti Kosmonavtiki |script-title=ru:Создание и запуск Первого спутника Земли |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606033433/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/237/36.shtml |archivedate=6 June 2011 |language=Russian |access-date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named [[Sputnik (rocket)|Sputnik]] and indexed as 8K71PS,&lt;ref name="Siddiqi, p. 163"&gt;Siddiqi, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkau.gov.ua/gateway/news.nsf/NewsALLR/BC8D1101C20C9643C3256BB90039079F!open 45th Anniversary of the First Start of Native ICBM R-7] at Ukrainian Aerospace Portal {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from 280 tonnes to 272 tonnes; its length with PS-1 was {{convert|29.167|m|ftin}} and the [[thrust]] at lift off was {{convert|3.90|MN|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik_lv.html|title=Sputnik launch vehicle 8K71PS (M1-1PS)|website=www.russianspaceweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These weight reductions were accomplished by removing the inertial guidance system, several telemetry measurements, and assorted hardware designed to support a warhead.

===Observation complex===
PS-1 was not designed to be controlled; it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to [[NII-4]].&lt;ref name="NKA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/237/36.shtml|trans-title=Creation and Launch of the First Earth's Satellite|author=V.Poroshkov|publisher=Novosti Kosmonavtiki|script-title=ru:Создание и запуск Первого спутника Земли|language=Russian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606033433/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/237/36.shtml|archivedate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located back in Moscow (at [[Yubileyny, Moscow Oblast|Bolshevo]]), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the [[Ministry of Defence (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defence]] dedicated to missile development.&lt;ref name="Siddiqi39"&gt;Siddiqi, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The six observatories were clustered around the launch site, with the closest situated {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} from the launch pad.&lt;ref name="NKA" /&gt;

A second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite's [[ground track]].&lt;ref name="Siddiqi162"&gt;Siddiqi, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; These tracking stations were located at [[Tyuratam]]; [[Sary-Shagan]]; [[Yeniseysk]]; [[Klyuchi, Kamchatka Krai|Klyuchi]]; [[Yelizovo]]; [[Makat]] in [[Atyrau Province|Guryev Oblast]]; and [[Ishkup]] in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]].&lt;ref name="NKA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siddiqi162" /&gt; Stations were equipped with [[radar]], optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by [[telegraph]]s into NII-4 where [[ballistics]] specialists calculated orbital parameters. The complex became an early prototype of the Soviet [[Mission Control Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nauka.relis.ru/26/0507/26507086.htm Mission Control Center: Labour, Joys and Ordeals] {{ru icon}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatories used a trajectory measurement system called "Tral," developed by [[OKB]] MEI, by which they received and monitored data from [[transponder]]s mounted on the R-7 rocket's core stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okbmei.ru/upage.html?id=30 Wonderful "Seven" and First Satellites] at the website of OKB MEI {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903073846/http://www.okbmei.ru/upage.html?id=30 |date=3 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The data was useful even after the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket; ''Sputnik''{{'s}} location was calculated from the data on the second stage's location which followed ''Sputnik'' at a known distance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin Yu.A.Mozzhorin Memories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018165625/http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin |date=18 October 2007 }} at the website of Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} but radar could track it for almost {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]] (5 October at the launch site&lt;ref name="rswSM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik_mission.html |title=Sputnik's mission |author=Anatoly Zak |authorlink= |year=2015 |publisher=Anatoly Zak |work=RussianSpaceWeb.com |access-date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from [[Site No.1]] at NIIP-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.tecnocosmos.com/archivo/1957/1957001b.htm Sputnik 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180255/http://www.tecnocosmos.com/archivo/1957/1957001b.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight.&lt;ref name="MainR" /&gt; At shut down, the 7.5 tonne core stage with PS-1 attached had attained an altitude of {{convert|223|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level, a velocity of {{convert|7780|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} and velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial orbit of {{convert|223|km}} by {{convert|950|km}}, with an apogee approximately {{convert|500|km}} lower than intended, and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 65.1 degrees and a period of 96.2 minutes.&lt;ref name="MainR" /&gt;

The launch came very close to failure—a postflight examination of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and ''Sputnik 1'' crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.

A fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of powered flight and engine thrust 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were {{convert|375|kg|lb}} of LOX remaining at cutoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik_mission.html|title=Sputnik's mission|website=www.russianspaceweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage&lt;ref name="rswSM" /&gt; and the satellite's transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of ''Sputnik 1''{{'s}} "beep-beep-beep" tones confirmed the satellite's successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 fell below the horizon.&lt;ref name="NKA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/ziv/2002/5-kak-zap.html How the First Sputnik Was Launched] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408030050/http://epizodsspace.testpilot.ru/bibl/ziv/2002/5-kak-zap.html |date=8 April 2008 }} at ''Zemlya i Vselennaya'' magazine, No.5, 2002 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.&lt;ref name="rswSM" /&gt;

Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking.&lt;ref name="redmoonPN" /&gt; The satellite, a small, highly polished sphere, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. A third object, the payload fairing, also achieved orbit.

The core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while ''Sputnik 1'' orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth.&lt;ref name="rswSM" /&gt;

The Soviets provided details of ''Sputnik 1'' before the launch but few outside the Soviet Union noticed. After reviewing information publicly available before the launch, the science writer [[Willy Ley]] wrote in 1958: {{quote|If somebody tells me that he has the rockets to shoot — which we know from other sources, anyway — and tells me what he will shoot, how he will shoot it, and in general says virtually everything except for the precise date — well, what should I feel like if I'm surprised when the man shoots?&lt;ref name="ley195811"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1958-11/Galaxy_1958_11#page/n47/mode/2up |title=How Secret was Sputnik No. 1? |work=Galaxy |date=October 1958 |access-date=13 June 2014 |author=Ley, Willy |pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Organized through the [[citizen science]] project [[Operation Moonwatch]], teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the Soviet sphere at dawn and during the evening twilight through binoculars or telescopes as it passed overhead.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite news |title=Course Recorded |url=https://www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-02.html |work=New York Times |first=Walter |last=Sullivan |date=5 October 1957 |access-date=20 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR asked radio amateurs and commercial stations to record the sound of the satellite on [[magnetic tape]].&lt;ref name="CR" /&gt;
[[File:Sputnik beep.ogg|thumb|Listeners were both thrilled and terrified to hear ''Sputnik 1''{{'s}} steady beep.&lt;ref&gt;Ackman, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

News reports at the time pointed out that "anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWtVDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT131&amp;ots=nevuxjhu_t&amp;dq=anyone%20possessing%20a%20short%20wave%20receiver%20can%20hear%20the%20new%20Russian%20earth%20satellite%20as%20it%20hurtles%20over%20this%20area%20of%20the%20globe&amp;pg=PT131#v=onepage&amp;q=anyone%20possessing%20a%20short%20wave%20receiver%20can%20hear%20the%20new%20Russian%20earth%20satellite%20as%20it%20hurtles%20over%20this%20area%20of%20the%20globe&amp;f=false|title=Last of the Seals|author=Greg Messel|access-date=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directions, provided by the [[American Radio Relay League]] were to "Tune in 20 [[Hertz|megacycles]] sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe."&lt;ref&gt;"How To Tune," ''San Antonio Light'', 5 October 1957, p1&lt;/ref&gt; The first recording of ''Sputnik 1''{{'s}} signal was made by [[RCA]] engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over [[NBC]] radio. However, as ''Sputnik'' rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by W2AEE, the ham radio station of [[Columbia University]]. Students working in the university's FM station, [[WKCR]], made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the ''Sputnik'' signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).

At first the Soviet Union agreed to use equipment "compatible" with that of the United States, but later announced the lower frequencies.&lt;ref name="CR" /&gt; The [[White House]] declined to comment on military aspects of the launch, but said "it did not come as a surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senators Attack Missile Fund Cut |url=https://www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-10.html |work=New York Times |date=6 October 1957 |access-date=20 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October the Naval Research Laboratory announced it had recorded four crossings of ''Sputnik 1'' over the United States.&lt;ref name="CR" /&gt; The [[Air Force Cambridge Research Center|USAF Cambridge Research Center]] collaborated with [[Bendix Aviation|Bendix-Friez]], [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Westinghouse Broadcasting Co.]], and the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] to obtain a motion picture of ''Sputnik''{{'s}} rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by [[WBZ-TV]] in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Molczan, [http://www.satobs.org/sputnik1rocketbaltimore.html "Motion Picture of Sputnik 1 Rocket from Baltimore on October 12, 1957"], 30 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President Eisenhower obtained photographs of the Soviet facilities from [[Lockheed U-2]] flights conducted since 1956.&lt;ref name="BN" /&gt;

The success of ''Sputnik 1'' seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;http://eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/sputnik/Reaction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s launch of ''Sputnik 1'' spurred the United States to create the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/body/arpa_darpa.html |title=ARPA/DARPA |access-date=21 May 2007 |publisher=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407064829/http://www.darpa.mil/body/arpa_darpa.html |archivedate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/history.html |title=DARPA: History |access-date=7 December 2009 |publisher=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015051521/http://www.darpa.mil/history.html |archivedate=15 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NetValley"&gt;[http://www.netvalley.com/intval.html "Roads and Crossroads of Internet History"] by Gregory Gromov&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about humankind's progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the [[Space Age]]. However, when the Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 2|a second craft]] containing the dog [[Laika]], the media narrative returned to one of anti-communism and many people sent protests to the Russian embassy and the RSPCA.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Barnett '"Russia Wins Space Race"': The British Press and the Sputnik Moment, 1957': ''Media History'', 19: 2 (2013), 182–195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propaganda===
[[File:Sputnik-stamp-ussr.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet 40 kopeks stamp, showing satellite's orbit]]
''Sputnik 1'' was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West.&lt;ref name="bessonov"&gt;Bessonov, K. (2007). Sputnik's legacy. ''Moscow News'', ''41''. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.mnweekly.ru/news/20071004/55280383.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526215946/https://mnweekly.ru/news/20071004/55280383.html |archivedate=26 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviets began using ''Sputnik'' in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to ''Sputnik''{{'s}} signals on the radio&lt;ref name ="bessonov" /&gt; and to look out for ''Sputnik'' in the night sky. While ''Sputnik'' itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26 meter core stage of the R-7.&lt;ref name ="bessonov" /&gt; Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of ''Sputnik 1'' surprised the American public and shattered the perception, furthered by American propaganda, of the United States as the technological superpower and the Soviet Union as a backward country.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;The Legacy of Sputnik [Editorial]. (2007). ''New York Times'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on ''Sputnik'' from secret spy plane imagery.&lt;ref&gt;PBS.org – NOVA:Sputnik Declassified{{season needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] built ''[[Explorer 1]]'', and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, ''[[Sputnik 2]]'', on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of ''[[Vanguard TV3]]'' on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the [[Space Race]]. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race,&lt;ref name ="wilson"&gt;Wilson, C. (n.d.). Sputnik: a Mixed Legacy. ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', ''143''(12), (37–38).&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems.&lt;ref name="morring"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Morring |first1=F. |year=2007 |title=March).

Initially U.S. President Eisenhower was not surprised by ''Sputnik 1''. He had been forewarned of the R-7's capabilities by information derived from [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy plane]] overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts.&lt;ref&gt;Lashmar, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peebles (2000), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive.&lt;ref&gt;Divine, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain [[space law|legal status of orbital satellite overflights]].&lt;ref&gt;McDougall, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of [[Project Genetrix]] (Moby Dick) balloons&lt;ref&gt;Peebles (1991), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; To set a precedent for "freedom of space" before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites,&lt;ref&gt;Peebles (1997), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. had launched [[Project Vanguard]] as its own "civilian" satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year.&lt;ref&gt;McDougall, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of ''Sputnik'' and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of fear was inflamed by Democratic politicians and professional cold warriors, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind.&lt;ref&gt;Divine, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of "impact" upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture.&lt;ref name="CoxStoiko69" /&gt;

The U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including ''[[Explorer 1]]'',  [[Project SCORE]], and ''[[Courier 1B]]''. However, public reaction to the [[Sputnik crisis]] spurred America to action in the Space Race, leading to the creation of both the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or [[DARPA]] in 1972),&lt;ref&gt;Brezezinski, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] (through the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]]),&lt;ref&gt;McDougall, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an increase in U.S. government spending on scientific research and education.

''Sputnik'' also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 [[National Defense Education Act]], which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in math and science.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neal, ''et al'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of ''Sputnik'', a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)&lt;ref&gt;Project Mercury: Main-in-Space Program of NASA, Report of the Committee on Aeronautical Sciences, United States Senate, 1 December 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of the ''Sputnik'' shock was the perception of a "[[missile gap]]."&lt;ref&gt;Prados, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; This became a dominant issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign.

One irony of the ''Sputnik'' event was the initially low-key response of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' only printed a few paragraphs about ''Sputnik 1'' on 4 October.&lt;ref&gt;Harford, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In the days following the world's startled response, the Soviets started celebrating their great accomplishment.

''Sputnik'' also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the [[X-15]] rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle's second stage was moved by the launch of ''Sputnik'' to think of space as being the next step for America.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Astronauts [[Alan Shepard]], who was the first American in space, and [[Deke Slayton]] later wrote of how the sight of ''Sputnik I'' passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard &amp; Slayton, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer Hickam]]'s memoir ''[[Rocket Boys]]'' and the movie ''[[October Sky]]'' tell the story of how a coal miner's son, inspired by ''Sputnik'', started building rockets in the mining town where he lived.

The launch of ''Sputnik 1'' inspired United States writer [[Herb Caen]] to coin the term "[[beatnik]]" in an article about the [[Beat Generation]] in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' on 2 April 1958.&lt;ref name="Hamlin"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jesse |last=Hamlin |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/11/26/PK72111.DTL |title=How Herb Caen Named a Generation |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=26 November 1995 |access-date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backup units and replicas===

At least two vintage duplicates of ''Sputnik 1'' exist, built apparently as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow in the corporate museum of [[S.P.

Unlike Energia's unit, it has no internal components, but it does have casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which suggest it was built as more than just a model. Authenticated by the [[Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics]] in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum.&lt;ref name="CSTopTen" /&gt; Two more ''Sputnik'' backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs [[Richard Garriott]]&lt;ref name="CSTopTen" /&gt; and [[Jay S.

Three one-third scale student-built replicas of ''Sputnik 1'' were deployed from the [[Mir space station]] between 1997 and 1999.

'''Stoughton Opera House''' is a [[Theater (structure)|theater]] in [[Stoughton, Wisconsin]].  It is on the second floor of the Stoughton City Hall.

== History ==
The Stoughton Opera House was originally known as the City Auditorium. It opened on February 22, 1901 with Ullie Akerstrom's comic play, ''The Doctor's Warm Reception''. During the next 50 years, the Opera House was used for plays, political rallies, [[Temperance movement|temperance]] speeches, boxing and wrestling matches, high school graduations, and class plays. From 1910 to the late 1920s, it also served as a movie theater. In the 1950s the theater was closed and fell into ruin. In the late 1980s a decision was made to save the building, restore its ornate [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] interior, and rebuild the clock tower. The venue is now used for weddings, business and government meetings, rallies, and other functions. The building is in the [[Stoughton Main Street Commercial Historic District]].

== Repertoire ==
In its early days, the theater's repertoire primarily featured plays, [[vaudeville]] reviews by traveling companies, and concerts. Since its reopening, its repertoire has consisted of plays by local companies, classical music concerts, and concerts by well-known touring musicians and bands.

The '''Theatre Royal''' is a restored [[Regency architecture|Regency]] [[theatre]] in [[Bury St. Edmunds]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. The building is one of eight [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade I listed]] theatres in the United Kingdom, and is the only working theatre operated under the auspices of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. It is considered to be one of the most perfect examples of Regency theatres in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, J. (1970). ''The Shell Guide to England''. London: Michael Joseph.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre presents a diverse programme of drama, music and stand up. It regularly produces its own work which tours nationally, most recently Torben Bett's Invincible in the summer of 2016. In early 2017 the Theatre Royal will produce an adaptation of Jane Austen's ''Northanger Abbey'', which will tour nationally. 

The Theatre Royal is currently a member of the pioneering Black Theatre Live partnership, a consortium of eight UK theatres committed to effecting change nationally for [[wikt:BAME|BAME]] touring through a three-year programme of national touring, structural support and audience development.

== History ==

The Theatre Royal was opened by its proprietor and architect [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] on 11 October 1819, and was one of the most elegant, sophisticated and up-to-date playhouses of its age. The fact that it has survived, without significant alteration, into our time is a miracle and it is now one of only three buildings to give the experience of theatre-going in pre-Victorian Britain.

Wilkins was an architect of national repute, responsible for, amongst other buildings, the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in [[London]] and [[Downing College, Cambridge]]. As the proprietor of the [[Norwich]] circuit, he employed a small company of players to undertake an annual tour of six theatres: [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], [[Ipswich]], [[Theatre Royal, Barnwell, Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Colchester]] and [[King's Lynn]]. Each was open for just one or two short seasons during the year. The Bury theatre opened for the Great Fair in early October to mid-November and was only available for special events at other times of the year. At that time, it would certainly have enjoyed large audiences particularly as the local community would not have been able to travel far for entertainment, until the arrival of the railway in the 1840s.

[[File:Charley - Brandon.jpg|thumb|right|[[W. S. Penley]] as the first [[Charley's Aunt]], Donna Lucia d'Alvadorez, performed at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, in 1892.]] The Norwich comedians were disbanded in 1843 and at Bury there followed more than half a century of economic difficulty and theatrical gloom. This was alleviated briefly in 1892 when the world premiere of ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' was staged at the theatre. The theatre closed in 1903 but it reopened in 1906 when alterations to the building were made by the architect [[Bertie Crewe]].

[[Greene King]], the local [[brewery]], purchased the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]], which it still owns, in 1920. However, in 1925, in the face of overwhelming competition from two new [[Movie theater|cinema]]s, the theatre closed once more. Greene King had struggled to keep the theatre in operation but was now content to use the building as a barrel store. So it remained until the 1960s when a group of local people led by [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Stanley Vincent]] raised over [[pound sterling|£]]37,000 to restore and re-open the Theatre Royal in 1965. The building was vested in the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1975 on a 999-year lease. The Theatre Royal is now managed as an independent working theatre by the Bury St Edmunds Theatre Management Limited.

===2000s restoration===
In September 2005 the Theatre was closed to begin a £5.3million restoration project to restore the building to its original 1819 configuration and decorative scheme. Following an extensive research period, architects Levitt Bernstein, in collaboration with theatre staff and the National Trust, drew up plans to restore the historic building to as close to its original design as possible.

Previous restorations to the building had removed the original Georgian entrances to the pit as well as its distinctive Georgian forestage. The boxes had also been removed from the dress circle and the seating layout changed throughout the building.

The project restored these aspects to recreate a theatre which could provide further insight into the architecture, stage techniques and repertoire of the 18th and 19th centuries, of which little is known in comparison to theatre of other epochs. In addition to the restoration of the building the theatre's artistic team researched and re-discovered many of the lost texts, of the Georgian repertoire.  

Under the banner of "Restoring the Repertoire" the Theatre Royal produced some of plays of the Georgian period in the restored Theatre. On 11 September 2007 the theatre re-opened with a production of the 1829 nautical melodrama, ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', written by [[Douglas Jerrold]].  

In addition to the restoration of the main building a new modern foyer was constructed to the side of the Theatre to provide a restaurant, additional bar and more toilets for the building.

'''Videoex''' is a [[Zurich]]-based [[Film festival]] for [[Experimental film]] and [[Video art]]. It is the only festival in [[Switzerland]] that is explicitly dedicated to the genre of experimental film. The festival exists since 1998 and takes place every year during the last two weeks of May.

The festival usually consists of a Swiss and an international competition, retrospectives of important artists, a special program dedicated to one or more filmmakers and a guest program. Besides its film program Videoex also hosts [[Expanded Cinema]] live acts, performances, discussions and workshops.

== History ==
Videoex took place for the first time in December 1998 as a one week experimental film screening at the cinema Xenix in Zurich. By now a manifold program has evolved that attracts an international audience. Since its formation in 1998 the number of submitted film and video works has increased every year. In 2008 more than 1800 works from over 50 countries were submitted. Although the target audience is small, Videoex has proven to be an important reference point for contemporary experimental film.

'''World Youth Day 1995''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pandaigdigang Araw ng Kabataan 1995'') was a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] youth festival that took place from January 10&amp;ndash;15, 1995 in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[Antoni Jackowski: The lexicon of the pilgrimages of John Paul II. Krakow: WAM, 2006, pp. 319-320. {{ISBN|83-7318-613-1}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time for an [[Asia|Asian]] country to host the event. [[Pope John Paul II]] presided over the event, marking his second trip to the country as Pope after his visit in 1981, and also the last papal visit in the country of the [[20th century]] and [[2nd millennium]].

==The program of the days==
Since the opening ceremony, the Pope underlines the importance of the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Filipino Catholic Church]]. At the meeting of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences (FABC), the Pope points out what are the new areas of the contemporary mission: the poor of cities, migrants, refugees, young people, the media and social communications. "In the first millennium," he says, "the Cross has been planted on the soil of Europe; in the second on that of America and Africa; we can pray that in the third Christian millennium in this vast and vital continent there will be a great harvest of faith to be harvested".

==Events==
A week before the celebration of the World Youth Day proper, two representatives from each of countries all over the world gathered for an International Youth Forum (IYF) at the [[University of Santo Tomas]]. The Philippines sent eight representatives, while others were from the different Catholic religious youth organizations and campuses. These were the selected youth leaders and coordinators. During their five-day stay in UST, representatives were grouped and discussed issues and concerns laid out by the Episcopal Commission on Youth, on topics set months before.

The IYF was also a venue wherein few from these selected youth representative had able to have a short talk with the Pope.
Young pilgrims gathered from many different parts of the world to celebrate [[God]] together, to learn other cultures and to speak as "brothers and sisters" among themselves. There was also a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] where some youths directly received [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|Communion]] from the Pope. Youth pilgrims gathered from different parts of the world to worship and talk together. Different activities were held, including a traditional ''Barrio Fiesta'', where it was possible to search company and entertainment. During these days, Masses were celebrated every day in most parishes throughout the Philippines.

The closing Mass, held at [[Luneta Park]], was estimated to have been attended by more than 5 million people, the [[List of largest gatherings in history|second-largest papal gathering]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-16/news/1995016078_1_pope-philippines-papal Millions flock to papal Mass in Manila Gathering is called the largest the pope has seen at a service]. Retrieved 16 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.asianews.it/index.php?art=2947&amp;l=en asianews.it]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.leparisien.fr/international/videos-retour-sur-l-histoire-des-jmj-16-08-2011-1567837.php leparisien.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-16/news/1995016078_1_pope-philippines-papal articles.baltimoresun.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The event saw the presence of Catholic representatives of all Chinese communities: [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]]. Already on 12 January, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Taipei|archbishop of Taipei]], [[Joseph Ti-kang]], celebrated mass with 5 priests of the "official" Chinese Roman Catholic Church. On 14 January, through Radio Veritas, the pope launches a message of reconciliation between the "official" and underground Chinese Church addressed to "all the Catholic faithful". At the end of the Mass in Luneta Park, the Pope greeted in [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], the language of China and Taiwan.

This was Pope John Paul II's last visit to the Philippines, as his scheduled return for the [[World Meeting of Families]] in January 2003 fell through due to the progression of [[Parkinson's disease]].

==Official song==
The official song for World Youth Day 1995 was released in 1994, titled "[[Tell the World of His Love]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.netcom.com/~mdmiguel/wyd95themesong.htm home.netcom.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, composed by [[Trina Belamide]].

==Theme==
"As the Father has sent me, so am I sending you". ([[Gospel of John|Jn]] 20:21) the same as that of the World Youth Day of 1994, which was celebrated at the diocesan level on [[Palm Sunday]] of that year, fall on March 22.

==John Paul II's assassination attempt==

[[Ramzi Yousef]], an [[Al-Qaeda]] member, attempted to assassinate the Pope in the [[Bojinka Plot]], but the plan was discovered four days earlier and Yousef fled to [[Pakistan]].

==Delegations==
Pilgrims at [[World Youth Day]] 1995 represented the following countries:&lt;ref&gt;The [[Roman Catholic Church]] considers five inhabited continents when listing countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yamurikuma''' is a festival in which the women of some [[Xingu (people)|Xingu]] tribes participate in a sort of [[gender role]] reversal, wearing feather ornaments and ankle rattles normally worn by men. There are several physical competitions, including archery, swimming, carrying logs, running, and [[tug of war]].

The festival culminates in a wrestling contest called [[Huka-huka]]. Wrestling matches usually only last for a few seconds until one opponent is either actually thrown down or 'thrown down' by default (when the other wrestler has grabbed both of their knees in such a way that it would inevitably lead to them being knocked to the ground).
