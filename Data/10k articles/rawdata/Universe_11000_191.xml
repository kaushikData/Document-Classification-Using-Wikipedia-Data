The '''1879 Bouctouche Tornado''' was a tornado that struck the town of [[Bouctouche, New Brunswick]] on Wednesday, August 6, 1879.

It is estimated that the tornado was an [[Fujita scale|F3]] in strength, and is the easternmost ''major'' tornado in [[North America]], though weaker tornadoes and [[waterspout]]s have been known to form in [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Nova Scotia]].

The tornado killed 5&amp;nbsp;people, injured 10 others, and rendered 25&amp;nbsp;families homeless.

In March 1984, a serious radiation accident occurred in Morocco, where eight people died from [[Pulmonary hemorrhage|pulmonary hemorrhaging]] caused by overexposure to [[radiation]] from a lost [[iridium-192]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Radiological accidents: A historical review of sealed sources accidents|last = Lushbaugh|first = C|last2 = Ricks|first2 = R|last3 = Fry|first3 = S|publisher = International Atomic Energy Agency|year = 1988|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals also received significant overdoses of radiation that required medical attention. Three people were sent to the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]] in Paris for treatment of radiation poisoning.

The [[Radiographic equipment|source]] was used to [[Industrial radiography|radiograph]] welds and became separated from its [[Radiation protection|shielded]] container. As the source itself had no markings indicating it was radioactive, a worker took it home, where it stayed for some weeks, exposing the family to radiation. The laborer, his family, and some relatives were the eight deaths caused by the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1985/in85057.html|title = Information Notice No. 85-57: Lost Iridium-192 Source Resulting in the Death of Eight Persons in Morocco|last = Metzger|first = J.|date = 1985|publisher = United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date = March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''air mass coefficient''''' defines the direct optical path length through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], expressed as a ratio relative to the path length vertically upwards, i.e. at the [[zenith]].
The air mass coefficient can be used to help characterize the solar spectrum after [[solar radiation]] has traveled through the atmosphere.
The air mass coefficient is commonly used to characterize the performance of [[solar cell]]s under standardized conditions, and is often referred to using the syntax "AM" followed by a number.
"AM1.5" is almost universal when characterizing terrestrial power-generating panels.

==Description==
[[File:EffectiveTemperature 300dpi e.png|thumb|The [[effective temperature]], or [[black body]] temperature, of the Sun (5777 K) is the temperature a black body of the same size must have to yield the same total emissive power.]]
[[File:Solar Spectrum.png|thumb|Solar irradiance spectrum above atmosphere and at surface]]

Solar radiation closely matches a [[black body]] radiator at about 5,800&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name="NASA5777K"&gt;or more precisely 5,777&amp;nbsp;K as reported in [http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Display=Facts&amp;Object=Sun NASA Solar System Exploration - Sun: Facts &amp; Figures] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703111716/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun&amp;Display=Facts |date=2015-07-03 }} retrieved 27 April 2011 "Effective Temperature ... 5777&amp;nbsp;K"&lt;/ref&gt;
As it passes through the atmosphere, sunlight is attenuated by [[scattering]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]; the more atmosphere through which it passes, the greater the [[attenuation]].

As the sunlight travels through the atmosphere, chemicals interact with the sunlight and absorb certain wavelengths changing the amount of short-wavelength light reaching the Earth's surface.
A more active component of this process is water vapor, which results in a wide variety of absorption bands at many wavelengths, while molecular nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide add to this process. By the time it reaches the Earth's surface, the spectrum is strongly confined between the far infrared and near ultraviolet.

Atmospheric scattering plays a role in removing higher frequencies from direct sunlight and scattering it about the sky.&lt;ref&gt;See also the article [[Diffuse sky radiation]].&lt;/ref&gt;
This is why the sky appears blue and the sun yellow — more of the higher-frequency blue light arrives at the observer via indirect scattered paths; and less blue light follows the direct path, giving the sun a yellow tinge.&lt;ref&gt;Yellow is the [[color negative]] of blue — yellow is the aggregate color of what remains after scattering removes some blue from the "white" light from the sun.&lt;/ref&gt;
The greater the distance in the atmosphere through which the sunlight travels, the greater this effect, which is why the sun looks orange or red at dawn and sundown when the sunlight is travelling very obliquely through the atmosphere — progressively more of the blues and greens are removed from the direct rays, giving an orange or red appearance to the sun; and the sky appears pink — because the blues and greens are scattered over such long paths that they are highly attenuated before arriving at the observer, resulting in characteristic pink skies at dawn and sunset.

==Definition==
For a path length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; through the atmosphere, and solar radiation incident at angle &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; relative to the normal to the Earth's surface, the air mass coefficient is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Physics of Solar Cells | author = Peter Würfel | publisher = Weinheim: Wiley-VCH | date = 2005 }} {{ISBN|3-527-40857-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;AM = \frac{L}{L_\mathrm o} \approx \frac{1}{\cos\, z} \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|A.1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;L_\mathrm o&lt;/math&gt; is the zenith path length (i.e. normal to the Earth's surface) at [[sea level]]
and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the zenith angle in degrees.

The air mass number is thus dependent on the Sun's elevation path through the sky and therefore varies with time of day and with the passing seasons of the year, and with the latitude of the observer.

==Accuracy near the horizon==
[[File:Airmass geometry.png|thumb|Atmospheric effects on optical transmission can be modelled as if the atmosphere is concentrated in approximately the lower 9&amp;nbsp;km.]]
The above approximation overlooks the curvature of the Earth, and is reasonably accurate for values of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; up to around 75°. A number of refinements have been proposed to more accurately model the path thickness towards the horizon, such as that proposed by Kasten and Young (1989):&lt;ref&gt;Kasten, F. and Young, A. T. (1989). [http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-28-22-4735 Revised optical air mass tables and approximation formula]. ''Applied Optics'' 28:4735&amp;ndash;4738.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;AM = \frac{1} { \cos\, z + 0.50572 \,(96.07995 - z)^{-1.6364}} \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|A.2}}}}
A more comprehensive list of such models is provided in the main article [[Airmass]], for various atmospheric models and experimental data sets.
At sea level the air mass towards the horizon (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; = 90°) is approximately 38.&lt;ref name="AM38"&gt;The main article [[Airmass]] reports values in the range 36 to 40 for different atmospheric models&lt;/ref&gt;

Modelling the atmosphere as a simple spherical shell provides a reasonable approximation:&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg, E. (1929). Theoretische Photometrie, g) Über die Extinktion des Lichtes in der Erdatmosphäre. In ''Handbuch der Astrophysik''. Band II, erste Hälfte. Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;AM = \sqrt { ( r \cos z )^2 + 2 r + 1 } \; - \; r \cos z \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|A.3}}}}
where the radius of the Earth &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm E&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6371&amp;nbsp;km, the effective height of the atmosphere &lt;math&gt;y_\mathrm{atm}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;km, and their ratio &lt;math&gt;r = R_\mathrm E / y_\mathrm{atm}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;708.

This implies that for these purposes the atmosphere can be considered to be effectively concentrated into around the bottom 9&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref&gt;The main article [[Airmass]] reports values in the range 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;km for different atmospheric models&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. essentially all the atmospheric effects are due to the atmospheric mass in the lower half of the [[Troposphere]].  This is a useful and simple model when considering the atmospheric effects on solar intensity.

==Cases==

*'''AM0'''
The spectrum outside the atmosphere, approximated by the 5,800&amp;nbsp;K black body, is referred to as "AM0", meaning "zero atmospheres".  Solar cells used for space power applications, like those on [[communications satellite]]s are generally characterized using AM0.

*'''AM1'''
The spectrum after travelling through the atmosphere to sea level with the sun directly overhead is referred to, by definition, as "AM1".  This means "one atmosphere".
AM1 (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;=0°) to AM1.1 (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;=25°) is a useful range for estimating performance of solar cells in [[equatorial climate|equatorial]] and [[tropical]] regions.

*'''AM1.5'''
Solar panels do not generally operate under exactly one atmosphere's thickness: if the sun is at an angle to the Earth's surface the effective thickness will be greater.  Many of the world's major population centres, and hence solar installations and industry, across Europe, China, Japan, the United States of America and elsewhere (including northern India, southern Africa and Australia) lie in [[temperate]] latitudes.  An AM number representing the spectrum at mid-latitudes is therefore much more common.

"AM1.5", 1.5 atmosphere thickness, corresponds to a solar zenith angle of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;=48.2°.  While the summertime AM number for mid-latitudes during the middle parts of the day is less than 1.5, higher figures apply in the morning and evening and at other times of the year.  Therefore, AM1.5 is useful to represent the overall yearly average for mid-latitudes.  The specific value of 1.5 has been selected in the 1970s for standardization purposes, based on an analysis of solar irradiance data in the conterminous United States.&lt;ref name=Gueymard2002&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the solar industry has been using AM1.5 for all standardized testing or rating of terrestrial solar cells or modules, including those used in concentrating systems. The latest AM1.5 standards pertaining to photovoltaic applications are the ASTM G-173&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5] NREL retrieved 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G173"&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ASTMG173/ASTMG173.html Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: ASTM G-173] ASTM retrieved 1 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and IEC 60904, all derived from simulations obtained with the [[SMARTS (The Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine)|SMARTS]] code

*'''AM2~3'''
AM2 (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;=60°) to AM3 (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;=70°) is a useful range for estimating the overall average performance of solar cells installed at high latitudes such as in northern Europe.
Similarly AM2 to AM3 is useful to estimate wintertime performance in temperate latitudes, e.g. airmass coefficient is greater than 2 at all hours of the day in winter at latitudes as low as 37°.

*'''AM38'''
AM38 is generally regarded as being the airmass in the horizontal direction (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;=90°) at sea level.&lt;ref name="AM38" /&gt;
However, in practice there is a high degree of variability in the solar intensity received at angles close to the horizon as described in the next section [[#Solar intensity|Solar intensity]].

*'''At higher altitudes'''
The ''relative'' air mass is only a function of the sun's zenith angle, and therefore does not change with local elevation. Conversely, the ''absolute'' air mass, equal to the relative air mass multiplied by the local atmospheric pressure and divided by the standard (sea-level) pressure, decreases with elevation above sea level.  For solar panels installed at high altitudes, e.g. in an [[Altiplano]] region, it is possible to use a lower absolute AM numbers than for the corresponding latitude at sea level: AM numbers less than 1 towards the equator, and correspondingly lower numbers than listed above for other latitudes. However, this approach is approximate and not recommended. It is best to simulate the actual spectrum based on the relative air mass (e.g., 1.5) and the ''actual'' atmospheric conditions for the specific elevation of the site under scrutiny.

==Solar intensity==
Solar intensity at the collector reduces with increasing airmass coefficient, but due to the complex and variable atmospheric factors involved, not in a simple or linear fashion.
For example, almost all high energy radiation is removed in the upper atmosphere (between AM0 and AM1) and so AM2 is not twice as bad as AM1.
Furthermore, there is great variability in many of the factors contributing to atmospheric attenuation,&lt;ref name="Earthscan"&gt;''Planning and installing photovoltaic systems: a guide for installers, architects and engineers'', 2nd Ed. (2008), Table 1.1, [http://www.earthscan.co.uk Earthscan] with the International Institute for Environment and Development, Deutsche Gesellshaft für Sonnenenergie. {{ISBN|1-84407-442-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
such as water vapor, aerosols, [[photochemical smog]] and the effects of [[temperature inversion]]s.
Depending on level of pollution in the air, overall attenuation can change by up to ±70% towards the horizon, greatly affecting performance particularly towards the horizon where effects of the lower layers of atmosphere are amplified manyfold.

One approximate model for solar intensity versus airmass is given by:&lt;ref name="PVCDROM"&gt;[http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/2-properties-sunlight/air-mass PVCDROM] retrieved 1 May 2011, Stuart Bowden and Christiana Honsberg, [http://pv.asu.edu/ Solar Power Labs, Arizona State University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meinel"&gt;Meinel, A. B. and Meinel, M. P. (1976). ''Applied Solar Energy'' Addison Wesley Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;I = 1.1 \times I_\mathrm{o} \times 0.7^{(AM^{0.678})}
\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|I.1}}}}
where solar intensity external to the Earth's atmosphere &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm o&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.353&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the factor of 1.1 is derived assuming that the diffuse component is 10% of the direct component.&lt;ref name="PVCDROM"/&gt;

This formula fits comfortably within the mid-range of the expected pollution-based variability:

This illustrates that significant power is available at only a few degrees above the horizon. For example, when the sun is more than about 60° above the horizon (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; &lt;30°) the solar intensity is about 1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (from equation {{EquationNote|I.1}} as shown in the above table), whereas when the sun is only 15° above the horizon (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; =75°) the solar intensity is still about 600&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 60% of its maximum level; and at only 5° above the horizon still 27% of the maximum.

===At higher altitudes===

One approximate model for intensity increase with altitude and accurate to a few kilometres above sea level is given by:&lt;ref name="PVCDROM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laue, E. G. (1970), [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V50-497T7KC-T/2/c932c2f01c2de3c36c0f461c991f791a The measurement of solar spectral irradiance at different terrestrial elevations], ''Solar Energy'', vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 43-50, IN1-IN4, 51-57, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;I = 1.1 \times I_\mathrm{o} \times [ (1 - h/7.1) 0.7^{(AM)^{0.678})} + h/7.1 ]
\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|I.2}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the solar collector's height above sea level in km and &lt;math&gt;AM&lt;/math&gt; is the airmass (from {{EquationNote|A.2}}) ''as if'' the collector was installed at sea level.

Alternatively, given the significant practical variabilities involved, the [[Airmass#Homogeneous spherical atmosphere with elevated observer|homogeneous spherical model]] could be applied to estimate AM, using:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;AM = \sqrt { ( r+c )^2 \cos^2 z + ( 2r+1+c ) ( 1-c ) } \; - \; ( r+c ) \cos z \,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|A.4}}}}
where the normalized heights of the atmosphere and of the collector are respectively &lt;math&gt;r = R_\mathrm E / y_\mathrm{atm}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;708 (as above) and &lt;math&gt;c = h / y_\mathrm{atm}&lt;/math&gt; .

And then the above table or the appropriate equation ({{EquationNote|I.1}} or {{EquationNote|I.3}} or {{EquationNote|I.4}} for average, polluted or clean air respectively) can be used to estimate intensity from AM in the normal way.

These approximations at {{EquationNote|I.2}} and {{EquationNote|A.4}} are suitable for use only to altitudes of a few kilometres above sea level, implying as they do reduction to AM0 performance levels at only around 6 and 9&amp;nbsp;km respectively.
By contrast much of the attenuation of the high energy components occurs in the ozone layer - at higher altitudes around 30&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;R.L.F. Boyd (Ed.) (1992). ''Astronomical photometry: a guide'', section 6.4. Kluwer Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7923-1653-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence these approximations are suitable only for estimating the performance of ground-based collectors.

==Solar cell efficiency==

{{Main|Solar cell efficiency}}

Silicon solar cells are not very sensitive to the portions of the spectrum lost in the atmosphere.  The resulting spectrum at the Earth's surface more closely matches the [[bandgap]] of [[silicon]] so silicon solar cells are more efficient at AM1 than AM0. This apparently counter-intuitive result arises simply because silicon cells can't make much use of the high energy radiation which the atmosphere filters out.
As illustrated below, even though the ''efficiency'' is lower at AM0 the ''total output power'' ('''P&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;''') for a typical solar cell is still highest at AM0.
Conversely, the shape of the spectrum does not significantly change with further increases in atmospheric thickness, and hence cell efficiency does not greatly change for AM numbers above 1.

This illustrates the more general point that given that solar energy is "free", and where available space is not a limitation, other factors such as total '''P&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''P&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;/$''' are often more important considerations than efficiency ('''P&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;''').

'''Apatite''' is a group of [[phosphate minerals]], usually referring to [[hydroxylapatite]], [[fluorapatite]] and [[chlorapatite]], with high concentrations of [[Hydroxide|OH]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Fluoride|F]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Chloride|Cl]]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]]s, respectively, in the [[crystal]]. The formula of the admixture of the three most common [[Endmember (mineralogy)|endmembers]] is written as [[Calcium|Ca]]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;([[Phosphate|PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]])&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH,F,Cl)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the crystal unit cell formulae of the individual [[mineral]]s are written as Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The mineral was named apatite by the German [[geologist]] [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] in 1786,&lt;ref&gt;According to Werner himself — (Werner, 1788), p. 85 — the name "apatite" first appeared in print in:
*  Gerhard, C.A., ''Grundriss des Mineral-systems'' [Outline of the system of minerals] (Berlin, (Germany):  Christian Friedrich Himburg, 1786), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DRI-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA281#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 281.] From p. 281: ''"Von einigen noch nicht genau bestimmten und ganz neu entdeckten Mineralien. Ich rechne hierzu folgende drei Körper: 1. Den Apatit des Herrn Werners. … "''(On some still not precisely determined and quite recently discovered minerals. I count among these the following three substances: 1. the apatite of Mr. Werner. … )
Werner described the mineral in some detail in an article of 1788.
* Werner, A.G. (1788) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XyU7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Geschichte, Karakteristik, und kurze chemische Untersuchung des Apatits"] (History, characteristics, and brief chemical investigation of apatite), ''Bergmännisches Journal'' (Miners' Journal), vol. 1, pp. 76–96. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XyU7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On pp. 84–85], Werner explained that because mineralogists had repeatedly misclassified it (e.g., as [[Beryl#Aquamarine_and_maxixe|aquamarine]]), he gave apatite the name of "deceiver": ''"Ich wies hierauf diesem Foßile, als einer eigenen Gattung, sogleich eine Stelle in dem Kalkgeschlechte an; und ertheilte ihm, — weil es bisher alle Mineralogen in seiner Bestimmung irre geführt hatte, — den Namen ''Apatit'', den ich von dem griechischen Worte ''απατάω'' (decipio) bildete, und welcher so viel as ''Trügling'' sagt."'' (I then immediately assigned to this fossil [i.e., material obtained from underground], as a separate type, a place in the lime lineage; and conferred on it — because it had previously led astray all mineralogists in its classification — the name "apatite", which I formed from the Greek word ''απατάω'' [apatao] (I deceive) and which says as much as [the word] "deceiver".)&lt;/ref&gt; although the specific mineral he had described was reclassified as fluorapatite in 1860 by the German [[mineralogist]] [[Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg]]. Apatite is often mistaken for other minerals. This tendency is reflected in the mineral's name, which is derived from the Greek word απατείν (apatein), which means ''to deceive'' or ''to be misleading''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-1572.html |title=Fluorapatite mineral information and data |website=mindat.org |access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apatite is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. Apatite is the defining mineral for 5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Hydroxyapatite, also known as hydroxylapatite, is the major component of [[tooth enamel]] and [[bone mineral]]. A relatively rare form of apatite in which most of the OH groups are absent and containing many [[carbonate]] and acid phosphate substitutions is a large component of [[bone]] material.

Fluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite; in the mid-20th century, it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of [[dental caries]].&lt;ref name=NICDR&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/OralHealth/Topics/Fluoride/TheStoryofFluoridation.htm |title=The story of fluoridation |publisher=National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluoridated water]] allows exchange in the [[tooth|teeth]] of fluoride ions for [[Hydroxyl#Hydroxyl group|hydroxyl groups]] in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste typically contains a source of fluoride [[anions]] (e.g. sodium fluoride, [[sodium monofluorophosphate]]).

[[Phosphorite]] is a phosphate-rich [[sedimentary rock]], that contains between 18% and 40% P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The apatite in phosphorite is present as [[cryptocrystalline]] masses referred to as ''collophane''.

==Uses==
[[File:Widok na Apatyty z Chibin.JPG|thumb|left|Apatite quarries and processing facilities. View from [[Khibiny Mountains]]]]
The primary use of apatite is in the manufacture of [[fertilizer]]&amp;nbsp;– it is a source of phosphorus. It is occasionally used as a gemstone. Green and blue varieties, in finely divided form, are [[pigment]]s with excellent covering power.

During digestion of apatite with [[sulfuric acid]] to make [[phosphoric acid]], [[hydrogen fluoride]] is produced as a byproduct from any [[fluorapatite]] content. This byproduct is a minor industrial source of [[hydrofluoric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villalba|first1=Gara|last2=Ayres|first2=Robert U.|last3=Schroder|first3=Hans|year=2008|title=Accounting for Fluorine: Production, Use, and Loss|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=11|pages=85–101|doi=10.1162/jiec.2007.1075}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2011-05-07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluoro-chloro apatite forms the basis of the now obsolete Halophosphor [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tube]] phosphor system. Dopant elements of manganese and antimony, at less than one mole-percent, in place of the calcium and phosphorus impart the fluorescence, and adjustment of the fluorine-to-chlorine ratio adjusts the shade of white produced. This system has been almost entirely replaced by the Tri-Phosphor system.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Marsden, "Lamps and Lighting", Edward Arnold Ltd., 1972, {{ISBN|0-7131-3267-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, apatite-derived fertilizers are used to supplement the nutrition of many agricultural crops by providing a valuable source of [[phosphate]].

Apatites are also a proposed host material for storage of [[nuclear waste]], along with other phosphates.

==Gemology==
[[File:Apatite taillée.jpg|thumb|left|Faceted blue apatite, Brazil]]
Apatite is infrequently used as a [[gemstone]]. [[Transparency (optics)|Transparent]] stones of clean color have been faceted, and [[chatoyant]] specimens have been [[cabochon]]-cut.&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; Chatoyant stones are known as ''cat's-eye apatite'',&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; transparent green stones are known as ''asparagus stone'',&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; and blue stones have been called ''moroxite''.&lt;ref&gt;Streeter, Edwin W., [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/streeter-precious-stones/page_306 Precious Stones and Gems] 6th edition, George Bell and Sons, London, 1898, p306&lt;/ref&gt; If crystals of [[rutile]] have grown in the crystal of apatite, in the right light the cut stone displays a cat's-eye effect.  Major sources for gem apatite are&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; Brazil, Burma, and Mexico. Other sources include&lt;ref name="GRG"/&gt; Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, and the United States.

== Use as an ore mineral ==
[[Image:Apatite09.jpg|thumb|right|Apatite crystal, Mexico]]
Apatite is occasionally found to contain significant amounts of [[rare-earth elements]] and can be used as an [[ore]] for those metals.&lt;ref&gt;Salvi S, Williams‐Jones A. 2004.

St. Catharines (ON): Geological Association of Canada. pp. 315‐341 {{ISBN|1-897095-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is preferable to traditional rare-earth ores such as [[monazite]],&lt;ref&gt;Haxel G, Hedrick J, Orris J. 2006.

However, apatite often contains [[uranium]] and its equally radioactive [[decay chain|decay-chain]] nuclides.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, Robert N.

==Thermodynamics==
The [[Standard enthalpy of formation|standard enthalpies of formation]] in the crystalline state of hydroxyapatite, chlorapatite and a preliminary value for bromapatite, have been determined by reaction-solution [[calorimetry]]. Speculations on the existence of a possible fifth member of the calcium apatites family, iodoapatite, have been drawn from energetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jct.2005.01.010 |author1=Cruz, F.J.A.L. |author2=Minas da Piedade, M.E. |author3=Calado, J.C.G. |title=Standard molar enthalpies of formation of hydroxy-, chlor-, and bromapatite |journal=J.

The accuracy of the model at room temperature and atmospheric pressure was checked against crystal structural data, with maximum deviations of c. 4% for the haloapatites and 8% for hydroxyapatite. High-pressure simulation runs, in the range 0.5-75 kbar, were performed in order to estimate the isothermal compressibility coefficient of those compounds. The deformation of the compressed solids is always elastically anisotropic, with BrAp exhibiting a markedly different behavior from those displayed by HOAp and ClAp.

In October 2015, Tim Cook stated about the car industry that: "It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive change. You may not agree with that. That's what I think..."We'll see what we do in the future. I do think that the industry is at an inflection point for massive change." Cook enumerated ways that the modern descendants of the [[Ford Model T]] would be shaken to the very chassis—the growing importance of software in the car of the future, the rise of autonomous vehicles, and the shift from an [[internal combustion engine]] to electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://recode.net/2015/10/19/apple-ceo-tim-cook-massive-change-is-coming-to-the-auto-industry/ |title=Apple CEO Tim Cook: ‘Massive Change’ Is Coming to Cars |first=Dawn |last=Chmielewski |date= |work=Re/code |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020225015/http://recode.net/2015/10/19/apple-ceo-tim-cook-massive-change-is-coming-to-the-auto-industry/ |archivedate=October 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Tesla Motors]] CEO [[Elon Musk]] stated that Apple will probably make a compelling electric car: "It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35280633 |title = Tesla Chief Elon Musk Says Apple Is Making an Electric Car |author =  |date =  |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = January 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, there were reports indicating Apple was interested in electric car [[charging station]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://in.reuters.com/article/apple-charging-idINKCN0YG25R |title = Exclusive: Apple Explores Charging Stations for Electric Vehicles |first1 = Julia |last1 = Love |first2 = Alexandria |last2 = Sage |last-author-amp = yes |date = May 26, 2016 |publisher = Reuters |access-date = May 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on July 25, 2016 that Apple had convinced retired senior hardware engineering executive [[Bob Mansfield]] to return and take over the Titan project.&lt;ref name=W&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-taps-bob-mansfield-to-oversee-car-project-1469458580|title=Apple Taps Bob Mansfield to Oversee Car Project|author=Daisuke Wakabayashi|date=July 25, 2016|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/07/25/apple-car-bob-mansfield/|title=WSJ: Apple recruits retired hardware expert Bob Mansfield to lead Apple Car project|author=Zac Hall|date=July 25, 2016|website=[[9 to 5 Mac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, on July 29, ''[[Bloomberg Technology]]'' reported that Apple had hired Dan Dodge, the founder and former chief executive officer of [[QNX]], [[BlackBerry Ltd.]]’s automotive software division.  According to ''Bloomberg'', Dodge's hiring heralded a shift in emphasis at Apple's Project Titan, in which the company will give first priority to creating software for autonomous vehicles. However, the story said that Apple would continue to develop a vehicle of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-28/apple-taps-blackberry-talent-as-car-project-takes-software-turn|title=Apple Hires BlackBerry Talent With Car Project Turning to Self-Driving Software|last=atbwebb|first=Mark Gurman markgurman Alex Webb|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date= July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported dozens of layoffs in an effort to reboot,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/apple-is-said-to-be-rethinking-strategy-on-self-driving-cars.html?_r=0 |title = Apple Is Said to Be Rethinking Strategy on Self-Driving Cars |last = Wakabayashi |first = Daisuke |work= [[The New York Times]] |access-date = October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably from a team still numbering around 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macobserver.com/analysis/bob-mansfield-reportedly-shaking-apple-car-project-layoffs/|title=Bob Mansfield Reportedly Shaking Up Apple Car Project With Layoffs|author=Bryan Chaffin|date=September 10, 2016|website=The Mac Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===

After a period of no new reports, car project news flared up again in mid-April, 2017, as word spread that Apple was permitted to test autonomous vehicles on California roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/14/15303338/apple-autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-california|title=Apple just received a permit to test self-driving cars in California|author=Andrew J. Hawkins|date=April 14, 2017|website=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-June, [[Tim Cook]] in an interview with ''[[Bloomberg TV]]'' said Apple was "focusing on autonomous systems" but not necessarily leading to an actual Apple car product, leaving speculation about Apple's role in the convergence of three disruptive "vectors of change": autonomous systems, electric vehicles and ride-sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/13/apple-car-tim-cook-confirmation/|title= Tim Cook says self-driving car tech ‘incredibly exciting,’ Apple may or may not make a car|author=Ben Lovejoy|date=June 13, 2017|website=9 to 5 Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transportation/tech website ''[[Jalopnik]]'' reported in late November that Apple was recruiting automotive test engineering and tech talent for autonomous systems work, and appeared to be surreptitiously leasing, via third parties, a former Fiat Chrysler proving grounds site in Surprise, Arizona (originally Wittman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felton|first1=Ryan|title=Apple Might Be Leasing Chrysler's Old Proving Grounds To Test Autonomous Car Technology|url=https://jalopnik.com/apple-might-be-leasing-chryslers-old-proving-grounds-to-1820782763|website=Jalopnik|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2017, the ''New York Times'' suggested that Apple had stopped developing its own self-driving car.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; In response to such reports, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged publicly that year that the company was working on autonomous-car technology.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

===2018===
In January 2018, the company registered 27 self-driving vehicles with California's Department of Motor Vehicles.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

In May 2018, a ''[[New York Times]]'' article reported on major project news.&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicas|first1=Jack|title=Apple, Spurned by Others, Signs Deal With Volkswagen for Driverless Cars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/technology/apple-bmw-mercedes-volkswagen-driverless-cars.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=24 May 2018|date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After proposed partnership arrangements with Germany's high-end brands [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] failed,&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"/&gt; as did potential alliances with [[Nissan]], [[BYD Auto]], [[McLaren Automotive]], and others, Apple reportedly partnered with [[Volkswagen]] to produce an autonomous employee shuttle van based on the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T6)|T6 Transporter]] commercial vehicle platform.&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"/&gt; The T6 Transports would be transformed into autonomous electric versions at VW's [[Italdesign]] subsidiary in [[Turin, Italy]], with the frame, wheels, and chassis remaining the same.&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"/&gt;

While Apple does its best to keep its autonomous vehicles plans secret,&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;ref name=B/&gt; regulatory filings do provide some factual insight into its activities. In September 2018, Apple was reportedly in third place in the number of California autonomous vehicle permits with 70, behind [[GM Cruze]] (175) and [[Alphabet (company)|Alphabet]]'s [[Waymo]] (88).&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/apple-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleet-california-70/|title=Apple’s autonomous vehicle fleet swells 27% in four months|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arkhangelske gas field''' [[natural gas field]] is located in the north-western part of the continental shelf of the [[Black Sea]]. It was discovered in 1989 and developed by [[Chornomornaftogaz]] and [[Shelton Canada]]. It is located {{convert|60|-|70|km}} off the coast, at a depth of {{convert|51|m}}.&lt;ref name=ukrinform050712&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkhangelske field began production in 1991 and produces [[natural gas]] and [[Natural gas condensate|condensates]]. The total [[proven reserves]] of the Arkhangelsk gas field are around {{convert|750|e9cuft}}, and production is slated to be around {{convert|70|e6cuft/d}} in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasandoil.com/news/2009/03/cnr90920|title=Shelton acquires Ukraine gas field|date=2009|publisher=gasandoil.com|accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bromley-by-Bow gasholders''' are a group of seven cast iron Victorian gasholders in Twelvetrees Crescent, [[Bromley-by-Bow]], London.

The gasholders were built between 1872 and 1878 to a design by the engineers [[Clark &amp; Kirkham]]. They are all [[grade II listed]] with [[Historic England]].&lt;ref name=NHL&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1293590|desc=Gasholder|access-date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that the land on which they are sited be converted to an urban park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlondonlandscape.org/project_detail_COM2.php?p=236 Bromley-By-Bow Gasworks.] New London Landscape. Retrieved 13 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, they were named among the top ten endangered buildings of the Victorian and Edwardian eras in a survey released by the [[Victorian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/12/great-yarmouth-winter-gardens-uk-most-at-risk-buildings-victorian-society Great Yarmouth Winter Gardens among UK's most at-risk buildings.] Mark Brown, ''The Guardian'', 12 September 2018.

Although there are numerous oil companies operating in Canada, the majority of production, refining and marketing is done by fewer than 20 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrcan.gc.ca/eneene/sources/infinf/refraf-eng.php|title=Natural Resources Canada:Canadian Refineries|date=2009-01-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216074850/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/eneene/sources/infinf/refraf-eng.php|archivedate=2011-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the 2013 edition of Forbes Global 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/#p_1_s_a0_Oil%20&amp;%20Gas%20Operations_All%20countries_All%20states_|title=the global 2000 forbes |date=2012-04-18 |work=forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; canoils.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=69b0a92f-8f7f-42a1-963a-878897b0af02|title=Suncor ousts Encana as Calgary's market cap leader|accessdate=2010-04-28|date=2010-05-29|work=Calgary Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829200821/http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=69b0a92f-8f7f-42a1-963a-878897b0af02#|archive-date=2012-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any other list that emphasizes market capitalization and revenue when sizing up companies, as of March 31, 2014 &lt;ref name=ftmarch/&gt; these are the largest Canada-based oil and gas companies (they are either based entirely in Canada or majority Canadian owned).  However more recent changes, possibly mergers or a stronger showing in the price of oil could mean a few of the oil sands producers are underrepresented; this is because Canadian companies are increasingly dependent on production from that source, which is hurt severely when oil prices decline below 50 to 60 dollars a barrel since costs per barrel traditionally exceed $28 and non-upgraded bitumen (&lt;10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; API) produces 1.7 fewer barrels per metric ton than West Texas Intermediate oil (according to [[API gravity#Using API gravity to calculate barrels of crude oil per metric ton|calculation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=17850|title=Solid Economics for Oil Sands|date=2004-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few of the larger companies ([[Penn West Petroleum]] and [[Athabasca Oil Corporation]]) don't show up in the [[Forbes 2000|Forbes]] list because its ranking system takes many different factors into account.
Syncrude and Irving Oil are also leaders in the Canadian industry, with Syncrude being the top producer of oil sands crude and Irving Oil operating the [[Irving Oil Refinery|largest oil refinery]] in the country.&lt;ref name=indeed.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Irving-Oil|title=Irving Oil Company Information|accessdate=2009-08-11 |date=2009-08-06 |work=indeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, based on the price paid for a 9% share in Syncrude Canada Ltd by [[Sinopec]] the company could be worth as much as US$50 billion.&lt;ref name=syncrude&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/streetwise/sinopec-pays-a-hefty-sum-for-syncrude/article1531659/|title=Sinopec pays a hefty sum for Syncrude| location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|first=Andrew|last=Willis|date=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canadian oil company profits quickly recovered from the financial crisis; In 2009 they were down 90% but in 2010 they reached $8.4 billion; Helping profits is the smaller price gap between West Texas Intermediate oil ($85/bbl) and Western Canadian heavy crude ($65/bbl) with the price of upgraded synthetic oil surpassing WTI when supply falls (before being upgraded to [[synthetic crude]], heavier oil produces fewer barrels of oil per metric ton than lighter oil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/17/us-enbridge-gateway-idUSTRE71G4IF20110217|title=Analysis, Foes fight Canada pipeline to rich Asian market|date=2011-02-17 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/breakingnews/better-times-ahead-for-canadas-oil-companies-with-expected-84b-profit-in-2010-102058233.html|title=Better times ahead for Canada's oil companies with expected $8.4B profit in 2010|date=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two largest (Suncor and CNRL) are 2 of the 11 most valuable Canadian companies (April 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/#page:2_sort:0_direction:asc_search:_filter:All%20industries_filter:Canada_filter:All%20states|title=Forbes Global 2000 Canada|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2,412 oil and gas companies are based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/Energy+sector+keen+merger/4492680/story.html|title=Energy sector not so keen on TSX merger|date=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research and development involving extraction technology and processing methods are chipping away at many of the barriers to [[Synthetic crude|bitumen production]].  A number of Canadian oil companies have a lot of exposure to heavy oil through assets in Alberta, they stand to benefit when research into more efficient and cost effective solutions yields positive results (Petrobank has numerous patents related to [[Petrobank Energy and Resources#THAI technology|extraction technology]] that at least one major engineering firm considers 17% more efficient than the widely used [[steam assisted gravity drainage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntm.nickles.com/issues/story.aspx?aid=1000363947|title=Petrobank's THAI Technology Expands Exploitable Bitumen In Place|date=2010-03-12}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 2010 a research team at [[Hokkaido University]] discovered a [[catalyst]] that significantly improves the efficiency while lowering costs related to the processing of bitumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heavyoilinfo.com/news-1/new-technology-for-bitumen-extraction|title=New technology for bitumen extraction|date=2010-08-09|access-date=2010-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711161858/http://www.heavyoilinfo.com/news-1/new-technology-for-bitumen-extraction#|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major oil producers are showing renewed interest in new technologies, a direct result of both heightened interest in raising the proportion of the oil sands that can be recovered (10%, which means {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl|km3}} are at stake) and the growing value of licensing rights.  That has resulted in a shift in focus over to patent producing research and development.  Cenovus Energy has used its patents as a tool to negotiate deals.&lt;ref name=patents&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/generic/generated/static/business/article1862279.html|title=Petroleum patent pending|date=2011-01-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114213025/http://www.ctv.ca/generic/generated/static/business/article1862279.html|archivedate=2011-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Husky Energy]] was founded in Wyoming by Albertan Glenn Nielson who with 2 partners, bought 2 heavy oil refineries, and used them to establish the Husky Refining Co. in 1938.  This was followed by major purchases of oil rich land and gas stations.  In 1946 Nielson moved part of the company to Canada where Husky Oil Ltd. was created separate from the parent company.  By the late 1970s the company's need for more funding eventually forced Nielson to sell all his stake in the company.  Another Albertan, Bob Blair CEO of the pipeline company AGTL (later renamed Nova Corp.) took advantage of the situation gradually increasing his stake in the company until he owned a controlling interest.  About a decade later Husky ran into financial problems that were solved when Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing started investing in the company leading to a buy out of Blair's interests in 1991.  The 1988 acquisition of Centerra Energy Ltd. made Husky a top 10 Canadian oil company.  After a turbulent couple decades, Husky reasserted itself as a major Canadian petroleum company in 2000 by purchasing Renaissance Energy Ltd. in a [[Canadian dollar|$]]3.02 billion deal.

Husky Energy has proven petroleum reserves of {{convert|430000000|oilbbl}} and {{convert|2|e12cuft|m3}} of natural gas. It owns approximately 500 filling stations in Canada as well as property and/or mineral rights to some 6.67 million acres (27,000&amp;nbsp;km²) in Western Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://companies.jrank.org/pages/2087/Husky-Energy-Inc.html |title=Husky Energy Inc.

Began as a pipeline company called interprovincial pipelines incorporated by Imperial Oil in the 1940s as a result of growth at the Leduc oil fields in Alberta exceeding the capacity of Alberta's refineries to process the oil. In 1950 its pipelines were operational and in 1953 it was a publicly traded company at stock exchanges in Toronto and Montreal.  By the late 1950s its main pipeline was almost {{convert|2000|mi|km}} long handling about {{convert|200000|oilbbl}} of oil per day in certain sections.
In the late 1960s refineries in the US and Canada demanded more oil be delivered from Canadian sources, and the solution deemed best by management, and government officials was to build a new line through Chicago.  The access expansion gave the company to Chicago helped the company grow rapidly and by the early 1970s throughput reached {{convert|900000|oilbbl}} of oil.  By 1986 Imperial Oil's ownership of the company was down to 33% and through an exchange of shares Imperial Oil helped interprovincial acquire another oil company called Hiram Walker while subsequently changing its name to Interhome Energy Inc.  Later it was renamed IPL Energy Inc.  During the 1990s it acquired a number of other companies (consumers gas, altagas, interest in Chicap pipeline) which delivered natural gas as well but most of the company's business was still in crude oil.  The new divisions gave the company greater access to Toronto, Quebec and New York.  Its last name change made in 1998 was to Enbridge Inc. a combination of the words energy and bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://companies.jrank.org/pages/1425/Enbridge-Inc.html|title=Enbridge|publisher=jrank|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently Enbridge owns the world's longest oil pipeline system (delivers {{convert|2000000|oilbbl}} per day), owns Canada's largest natural gas distributing company, and has 1.9 million customers.  It is also active in the alternative energy sector, having an interest in wind farms, [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] plants and photovoltaic projects the largest of which is the Sarnia Solar Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crocodyl.org/wiki/enbridge_inc|title=Enbridge Inc.|publisher=Crocodyl|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.firstsolar.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=201491&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;id=1478697|title=Enbridge and First Solar Complete the Largest Photovoltaic Facility in the World|date=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catagenesis''' is a term used in [[petroleum geology]] to describe the [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] process which results in the conversion of organic [[kerogen]]s into [[hydrocarbon]]s.

==Theoretical reaction==

Catagenesis is the second stage of maturation of organic carbon on the path to becoming graphitic. This geologic process accounts for very significant changes in the biogenic materials that make up the carbonaceous sediment. During catagenesis, the temperature increases, the pressure increases, and both organic and inorganic constituents “adjust” their phase or form to compensate. The process of “lithification” begins during this stage. Generally speaking, a rise in temperature results in the volatization of unstable species or elements that are weakly attached to carbon atoms. Increased temperature and pressure also result in the cessation of biogenic processes. One way to express these changes is to look at the ratio of oxygen to carbon, or hydrogen to carbon as the sediment matures. In almost all cases, as biogenic material matures in a geologic environment, the volatile elements such as oxygen and hydrogen are significantly reduced, resulting in a reduction in the O/C and H/C ratios. A typical O/C ratio value for a fully matured, catagenesis stage carbon might be less than 0.1. This means that for every 100 carbon atoms there are less than 10 oxygen atoms. Similar reductions in the level of hydrogen are also apparent.

This [[chemical reaction]] is believed to be a [[time]], [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] dependent process which creates liquid and/or gaseous hydrocarbon Hc from primary kerogen X and can be summarised using the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;X_0 \rightarrow Hc + X(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial kerogen [[concentration]] and X(t) is the kerogen concentration at time t.

It is generally held that the dependence on pressure is negligible, such that the process of catagenesis can be given as a first-order [[differential equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt} = - \kappa X&lt;/math&gt;
where X is the reactant (kerogen) and κ is the [[reaction rate constant]] which introduces the temperature-dependence via the [[Arrhenius equation]].

==Important parameters==
Several generally unrecognized but important controlling parameters of metamorphism have been suggested.&lt;ref name="Price1997"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Price
  | first = Leigh C.
  | title = Minimum Thermal Stability Levels and Controlling Parameters of Methane, As Determined by C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;+ Hydrocarbon Thermal Stabilities
  | journal = Geologic controls of deep natural gas resources in the United States (USGS Bulletin 2146)
  | pages = 139–176
  | publisher = USGS
  |year= 1997
  | url = https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/b/b2146
  | accessdate = 2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The absence or presence of water in the system, because hydrocarbon-thermal destruction is significantly suppressed in the presence of water.
* Increasing fluid pressure strongly suppresses all organic-matter metamorphism.
* Product escape from reaction sites, as lack of product escape retards metamorphism.
* Increasing temperature as the principal driver of reactions.

==Future Work==
A great deal of future research is required to isolate the parameters which are most significant for inducing the Catagenetic process.  Future work in the field will involve the following: 

* Establishing the precise relationship between burial time and hydrocarbon cracking.
* Determining how hydrogen from water is ultimately incorporated in kerogen.
* Establishing the effect of regional shearing.
* Determining how static fluid pressure affects hydrocarbon generation. Some experiments have demonstrated that static fluid pressure may explain the presence of hydrocarbon concentrations at depths where their composition would not otherwise be expected.
* Many measurements of hydrocarbon content in sample rocks have been done at atmospheric pressure.  This ignores the loss of large amounts of hydrocarbons during depressurization.  Rock samples at atmospheric pressure have been measured at 0.11&amp;ndash;2.13 percent of samples at formation pressure.  Observations at well sites include fizzing of rock chips and oil films covering [[drilling mud]] pits.
* Types of organic matter can not be ignored.  Different types of organic matter have different chemical bonds, bond strength patterns, and thus different activation energies.
* C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;+ hydrocarbons are stable at much higher temperatures than predicted by first-order reaction kinetics.*
For example, while it was once assumed that catagenetic processes were [[Order of reaction#First order|first-order reaction]]s, some research has shown that this may not be the case.&lt;ref name="Price1997" /&gt;

The '''Cheng cycle''' is a retrofit to the [[gas turbine]] cycle. The Cheng cycle involves the heated exhaust gas from the turbine being used to make steam in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).&lt;ref&gt;Penning, F. M. and de Lange, F. M. (1995) Steam Injection: analysis of a typical application ''Applied Thermal Engineering'' Vol. 16, No. 2, pp. 115 125&lt;/ref&gt; The steam so produced is injected into the gas turbine's combustion chamber to increase power output.&lt;ref&gt;De Paepe, M. and E. Dick (2001) Technological and economical analysis of water recovery in steam injected gas turbines, ''Applied Thermal Engineering'', Volume 21, Issue 2, January 2001, Pages 135–156&lt;/ref&gt;  The process can be thought of as a parallel combination of the gas turbine [[Brayton cycle]] and a steam turbine [[Rankine cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Stadler,F.  and U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3982">'''Chinese wax''' is a white to yellowish-white, gelatinous, [[crystal]]line water-insoluble substance obtained from the [[wax]] secreted by certain insects.

It resembles [[spermaceti]] but is harder, more [[friable]], and with a higher melting point. Two [[scale insects]] produce the wax: ''[[Ceroplastes ceriferus]]'', common in [[China]] and [[India]], and the related ''[[Ericerus pela]]'', found in China and [[Japan]]. These insects deposit their secretions on the branches of certain species of ''Ligustrum'' (privet) tree. The insects and their secretions are harvested and boiled with water to extract the raw wax. The insect bodies, which settle to the bottom, are used as food for [[swine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112805/Chinese-wax|title=Chinese wax - insect secretion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article in a November 1932 magazine article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Herbert Beardsley, "...the male larvae of a white insect, about the size of a mosquito, built a cocoon of pure, shining wax.  The tree that produces the white wax insect grows in the [[Chien-Chang]] Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects.  If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers.  So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the wood oil tree, then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets.  Runners or porters lift the baskets on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night – for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon – traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts.  
The baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of flowering ash about five or six feet high.  They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out.  When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks.  After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches.  
About the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem.  By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick.  The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Beardsley, Nature Magazine article from November issue 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Chinese wax is used chiefly in the manufacture of polishes, sizes, and [[candle]]s.
Candles, temple images and other articles connected with ceremonial worship, and polish for furniture. It is also used for burnishing the back of Chinese [[hanging scroll]]s with a stone. 

In China the wax has been employed medicinally. Taken internally, it has been used as a remedy for [[hoarseness]], pain, [[Helminths|worm]]s, [[Anxiety|nervousness]], and to aid the mending of broken bones. Externally, it has been used as an [[ointment]] for treatment of [[wound]]s.

==Other names==
Other names for Chinese wax include:
*Chinese tree wax
*Chinese insect wax
*Insect wax
*White wax

In Japan the tree yielding it is called ''ibota'' and the wax ''ibotaro''. Among other uses, it is used to polish white clamshell [[Go_(game)|go]] stones.

The '''first-generation [[Chrysler minivans]]''' are a series of [[minivan]]s produced and marketed by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in North American and Europe from 1984 to 1990.  Sold in both passenger and cargo configurations, the series is the first of six generations of Chrysler minivans.  Launched ahead of chief competitors [[Chevrolet Astro|Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari]] and [[Ford Aerostar]], the first-generation Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager effectively created the modern minivan segment in North America, with many later North American minivans adopting a similar body configuration.    

Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, the Chrysler minivans were produced in a single body style, with the extended-length Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager introduced in 1987.  For 1990, the minivan was added to the Chrysler brand, adopting the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate.  For export, Chrysler sold the Chrysler Voyager, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] (which began life as a Talbot, part of the former Chrysler Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.matrasport.dk/Cars/Espace/history.html|title=The Matra/Renault Espace|last=Sorth|first=Lennart|website=www.matrasport.dk|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  

== Background and development ==
[[File:1986 Dodge Caravan Smithsonian National Museum of American History.jpg|thumb|left|A 1986 Dodge Caravan at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]

The development of what became the Chrysler minivans began life in the early 1970s, as both Ford Motor Company and the truck division of Dodge began separate projects on "garageable vans".  Intended as a more powerful, safer-handling alternative to the Volkswagen Microbus, both companies sought to create vehicles capable as a second car.&lt;ref name="allpar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html|title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan|publisher=Allpar|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dodge project ended with the creation of a clay model; Ford would create the 1972 [[Ford Carousel]] protoype, based on the Ford Econoline.  Supported by both Lee Iaccoca and Henry Ford II, the Carousel prototype did not reach production, facing internal opposition from other Ford executives.  

At the end of 1977, development of Chrysler minivans restarted with four main goals, with a planned 1982 model year launch.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;
# The ability to park in a standard-size garage 
# Car-like [[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]]
# Low, flat load floor
# Removable rear seats (ability to carry 4x8 sheet of building material on floor)
Although both the front-wheel drive [[Chrysler K platform|K-Cars]] and L-body ([[Dodge Omni|Omni/Horizon]]) were being considered as donor platforms, Chrysler also allowed consideration of rear-wheel drive.  Ultimately, the L-body was ruled out, as it was considered too light-duty for either the size of the vehicle or its planned six-cylinder engine.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  

In 1978, both [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich were fired from Ford Motor Company, joining Chrysler Corporation.  The same year, the truck engineering division of Dodge was merged within its car counterpart of Chrysler.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During 1978, Chrysler began research across the United States, seeking what features customers desired in a potential minivan, finding agreement in its planned goals.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though potential customers found concept sketches "ugly", Chrysler still found a potential market of nearly 1 million vehicles per year, with Chrysler selling 215,000 of them.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;   

By 1979, Chrysler chose front-wheel drive for the minivan project, codenamed "T-115".&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Though the van would share its transverse engine and transmission with the K-cars, it would be based on a separate body structure.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  Approved by Lee Iaccoca at the end of 1979, the T-115 project would cost $500 million to produce, funded as part of the $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees given to Chrysler.  

From their 1979 approval to their 1984 launch, the Chrysler S-chassis minivans would undergo several major redesigns.  Originally intended to use 4 sedan-style doors (similar to a station wagon), Chrysler changed to two sliding doors, claiming better parking-lot access. The design was later changed to a single sliding door, as Chrysler wanted to market the van to commercial buyers; while engineers wanted to make the left-side door an option, the tooling complexity was claimed to be too expensive.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  During development, the configuration of the rear door was also contentious, with a liftgate winning out over a station wagon-style tailgate.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  On the exterior, in 1981, the side windows were redesigned to become flush with the body; while requiring a major redesign of components and tooling, the design change allowed for a reduction of wind noise and drag.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  To further reduce costs, a number of visible interior components were shared with the [[Plymouth Reliant|Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant]], including the instrument panel, interior controls, radio, and various trim items.

==Overview==
Launched in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, Chrysler marketed the first-generation minivans as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, along with the Mini Ram Van cargo van.  While the Dodge Caravan nameplate was used for the first time, Plymouth had used the Voyager nameplate since 1974 on its version of the Dodge Sportsman full-size passenger van.  

Initially released in a single 112-inch wheelbase, Chrysler introduced a 119-inch wheelbase as part of a 1987 update, launching the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager.  Starting in 1988, the Chrysler Voyager was exported to markets outside of the United States and Canada.  For 1990, Chrysler began production of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, among the first luxury vehicles produced as a minivan.    

=== Body ===
[[File:1984 Plymouth Voyager LE (30965894313).jpg|left|thumb|LE-trim Chrysler minivan rear seats (1984-1986)]]
Designed as an alternative to full-size station wagons, the standard-length Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager (two inches shorter and two inches wider than a K-car station wagon), presented nearly double the cargo space of a K-car station wagon with a 7-foot long cargo floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/model/m/original-minivans.html|title=Original Minivans: 1984-91 Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, Chrysler Town &amp; Country|website=www.allpar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the K-car station wagons, the minivans use a liftgate rear door (supported by gas struts), unlocked by key.  

Several seating configurations were offered, depending on trim level.  The standard configuration of five-passenger seating in two rows was included with seven or eight-passenger seating in three rows; the back two seats were two-passenger and three-passenger bench seats (in the style of a larger van, these latched to the floor).  The more popular two-passenger configuration was offered in several configurations, with low-back seats (as the minivan was technically a light truck), or high back seats with headrests; depending on trim level, seats could have vinyl, "deluxe" cloth or vinyl", or "luxury" cloth/vinyl upholstery.  Two styles of rear seats were offered.  The three-passenger rear bench adjusted was adjustable for passenger legroom or cargo space; the seatback also folded down when not in use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1985, a five-passenger version was introduced with a fold-flat rear seat; called "Convert-a-bed", the option allowed the rear seat to fold backwards into a bed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

To lower production and development costs of the Chrysler minivans, the vehicles maintained a high degree of visible parts commonality with other Chrysler vehicles, sharing wheel covers, door handles, instrument panels, and other visible trim pieces with the Aries/Reliant and other Chrysler vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As the design of the dashboard precluded a conventional glove box, Chrysler added a large storage drawer underneath the passenger seat (a feature retained in later generations of Chrysler minivans and the Chrysler PT Cruiser).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

=== 1984-1986 ===
At their 1984 launch, as with the K-Cars, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were externally distinguished largely by their grilles.  Both vehicles were fitted with four headlights, with the Caravan fitted with an eggcrate grille while the Voyager was fitted with a horizontally-oriented grille.  In what would become a signature styling feature of 1980s Chrysler minivans, top-trim Caravans and Voyagers were both offered with [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] as an option. 

In following with many other Chrysler vehicles, for 1986, Chrysler minivans shifted from 4-lug to 5-lug wheels.  To reduce high-speed wind noise, Chrysler added a bumper-mounted air dam&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as the design of the dashboard did not include a conventional glove box, Chrysler added a large storage drawer underneath the passenger seat (a feature retained in later generations of Chrysler minivans and the Chrysler PT Cruiser).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 1987-1990 ===
The 1987 model year saw a mid-cycle update to the S-platform minivans.  Largely centered around the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager, the update saw an update to the front fascia (and taillamps).  To better differentiate the Caravan from the Voyager, the model lines received different grilles; all models except the Mini Ram Van (cargo van) were shifted to flush-lens composite headlamps.  Fourteen inches longer in length than a standard-wheelbase Chrysler minivan, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager was the largest minivan in North America in 1987.  The first Chrysler minivans fitted with a V6 engine, the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager eventually became the two most popular configurations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  With both rear seats removed, the "Grand" minivans offered 150 cubic feet of cargo room, 25 extra than a standard wheelbase Chrysler minivan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The unpopular front bench seat ended production, along with the rare Convert-a-Bed option.  Interior upholstery was upgraded on several trims, with base vinyl seats removed (and deluxe vinyl remaining as an option on SE trim); for the first time, leather seating was offered on LE/Grand LE trim.

For 1989, the minivans saw a minor update.  To improve fit and finish, Chrysler redesigned the front and rear bumpers, with single-piece bumper covers, painted to match the color of the body.  The early-1980s K-Car steering wheel was replaced by a 3-spoke design (though the rest of the dashboard remained unchanged).  In addition to the standard trim levels, Chrysler added the top-line Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX; as an early 1990 model, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country luxury minivan was introduced in early 1989.

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Chrysler minivans are based upon the Chrysler S platform, using unibody construction.  Contrary to popular belief, the S platform is not directly related to the K platform&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;; though sharing powertrains to lower development and production costs, the S platform has a distinct body structure, allowing for a higher hoodline and seat height.&lt;ref name="allpar.com" /&gt;  The S platform is produced in two wheelbases: 112.1 inches for standard-length minivans; 119.1 inches for "Grand"-length minivans.

Adapting the layout of the K platform for a larger vehicle, the S-platform vans were fitted with [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension and a [[Beam axle|beam rear axle]] with [[Leaf spring|leaf springs]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  All S-platform minvans are fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;            

==== Engines ====
For the first three years of production, two engines were offered&amp;nbsp;– both [[inline-4]] engines with two barrel [[carburetors]]. The base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] was borrowed from the [[Chrysler K Platform|Chrysler K-cars]], and produced {{convert|96|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] engine later offered in the K-cars was never offered in the Caravan, and the 2-bbl version would remain the base power plant until mid-1987. Alongside the [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]], an optional Mitsubishi [[Astron 2.6|2.6L]] engine was available, producing {{convert|104|hp|kW|abbr=on}} horsepower.

In mid-1987, the base [[Chrysler K engine#2.2|2.2L]] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with a [[fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler K engine#2.5|2.5L]] [[Straight-4|I4]], which produced a respectable {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[Mitsubishi Astron engine|Mitsubishi ''G54B'']] [[Straight-4|I4]] was replaced with the new [[fuel-injected]] [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine#6G72|3.0L Mitsubishi]] [[V6 engine|V-6]] producing {{convert|136|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in March of that year.

[[File:Dodge V6 EFI fender badge.jpg|thumb|right|Fender badge originally used on V6 equipped minivans]]

Shortly thereafter in model year 1989, a more powerful engine became optional, with a [[Chrysler K engine#2.5 Turbo|turbocharged version]] of the base 2.5L producing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Revisions to the Mitsubishi V-6 upped its output to {{convert|142|hp|kW|abbr=on}} that same year, and in 1990 a new {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|3.3 L V-6]] was added to the option list. The V6 engines became popular as sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled and it was dropped at the end of the year.

None of the V6 engines, nor the turbocharged 2.5L were available on the European Chrysler Voyager. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country was only available with one engine option, the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6 until June 1989, when it was replaced by the newly introduced 3.3L V6.

====Transmissions====
Both a three-speed TorqueFlite [[automatic transmission]] and a five-speed manual were available with most [[inline-4]] engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). Manual transmissions were not available on 2.6L Mitsubishi 4-cylinder models, V6 models of the passenger Caravan, but were an option on the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V's long wheelbase models with a 3.0 L V6{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

[[V6 engine|V-6]] engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated [[TorqueFlite]], until the computer controlled [[Ultradrive]] 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The [[Ultradrive]] offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the [[inline-4]] engine. However, it suffered from reliability problems, usually stemming from what is known as "gear hunt" or "shift busyness", resulting in premature wear of the internal clutches. It also required an uncommon type of automatic transmission fluid and is not clearly labeled as such, leading many owners to use the more common [[Dexron|Dexron II]] rather than the specified "Mopar ATF+3", resulting in transmission damage and eventual failure.

The [[Ultradrive]] received numerous design changes in subsequent model years to improve reliability,{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}} and many early model transmissions would eventually be retrofitted or replaced with the updated versions by dealers, under warranty. These efforts were mostly successful, and most first-generation Caravans eventually got an updated transmission.{{Original research inline|date=February 2015}}

=== Trim ===
The S-platform Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were both offered in three trim levels, an unnamed base trim level, mid-range ''SE'', and top-range ''LE''; LE-trim minivans were marketed with the option of [[Woodie (car body style)#simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] paneling.  In 1989, as part of a minor exterior update, Dodge and Plymouth each gained an additional trim level for the top of the model range, the Dodge Caravan ES and Plymouth Voyager LX, available only in standard-wheelbase configuration.

== Variants ==

=== Cargo van ===
[[File:Dodge Caravan CV.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Dodge Caravan C/V]]
Chrysler produced two cargo van variants of the S platform, both based upon the Dodge Caravan.  From 1984 to 1988, Dodge marketed the Mini Ram Van.  Distinguished by a "Ram" nameplate under the side-view mirror, the Mini Ram Van was renamed the Caravan C/V (Cargo Van) for 1989.  In contrast to passenger vans, the Caravan C/V was fitted with model-specific headlight clusters, using dual sealed-beam headlamps (shared with the export Chrysler Voyager).  Several window configurations were available, ranging from either no windows to a full set of windows.  Coinciding with the 1987 introduction of the Grand Caravan, cargo van production expanded to both wheelbases.

On the Caravan C/V, in addition to the liftgate rear door, Chrysler offered 50/50 split rear doors (similar to the [[Chevrolet Astro]] and traditional cargo vans).  Produced as an option, the 50/50 doors were constructed of fiberglass; custom-installed by an outside vendor, the doors were installed between the factory and shipment to a dealer.  

As with the larger [[Dodge Ram Van]], the Mini Ram Van and Caravan C/V also served as a basis for [[Conversion van|conversion vans]], sold through Chrysler dealers as well as through converters themselves.

=== Chrysler Voyager (export) ===
{{Main|Chrysler Voyager}}
[[File:VoyagerIEuropeLeft.jpg|thumb|1989-1990 Chrysler Voyager ]]
Starting for the 1988 model year, Chrysler began exports of minivans to Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As neither the Plymouth nor the Dodge brands were marketed outside of North America by Chrysler, minivans were exported under the [[Chrysler Voyager]] nameplate, competing against the [[Renault Espace]] and [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)|Volkswagen Transporter/Caravelle]] (sold as the Vanagon in North America).    

While the Voyager name was derived from the Plymouth division, the Chrysler Voyager was a rebranded version of the Dodge Caravan, fitted with the front fascia of the Caravan C/V cargo van.  To accommodate the vehicle for European sale, the Chrysler Voyager was fitted with amber turn signal lenses (requiring new taillights), turn signal repeaters, and a model-specific license plate surround (adapted for European license plates and embossed with "Chrysler").    

Along with its rebranding, the Chrysler Voyager saw internal modifications, largely to comply with European safety and emissions regulations.  With the exception of the turbocharged 2.5L engine and 3.3L V6, the Chrysler Voyager shared its powertrain with its North American counterpart; many examples were produced with manual transmissions.  

=== Chrysler Town &amp; Country ===
{{Main|Chrysler Town &amp; Country}}
[[File:1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan.jpg|thumb|1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country]]After being discontinued in the 1988 model year, the Chrysler Town &amp; Country nameplate was revived as Chrysler released a minivan for its namesake division.  Introduced in the spring of the 1989 as an early 1990 model, the Town &amp; Country was released as the highest-trim version of the three Chrysler minivans, sold exclusively in the long-wheelbase body length.  Originally slated for a 1989 release&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wqIAAOxy4c5RsPPu/$T2eC16FHJIQE9qUHrjB(BRsPPur4DQ~~60_57.JPG?rt=nc Early sales material for the model referring to it as a 1989 model], retrieved on 2014-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;, the Town &amp; Country was the first of the three minivans produced as a 1990 model.  

Designed as a competitor to luxury-themed minivans such as the Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer and the (then-upcoming) [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], the Town &amp; Country included nearly every feature of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager as standard equipment, with a number of trim features of its own.  All examples were produced with woodgrain trim (a feature associated with the nameplate).  Initially, Bright White Clearcoat was the sole color available, with Black Clearcoat added as an option in June 1989 (as 1990 Caravans/Voyagers entered production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 30], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt;).    

To externally distinguish the Town &amp; Country, Chrysler added a chrome waterfall grille (styled similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]), clear-lens turn front turn signals, body-color mirrors, a crystal Pentastar hood ornament (shared with the New Yorker/Fifth Avenue), lower body trim (a monochromatic, long-wheelbase version of the Dodge Caravan ES body trim), and 15" alloy wheels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1990/index.htm "1990 Chrysler Showroom Brochure" pg. 20-21], retrieved on 2011–06–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (later used with the Plymouth Voyager LX and other Plymouth models).  The interior featured model-specific leather seating, leather interior trim panels, all available power-operated equipment, front and rear air conditioning, and an [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity II sound system]].

Depending on production date, the 1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country was produced with one of two V6 engines.  Prior to June 1989, it was fitted with a 142hp 3.0L Mitsubishi V6.  From June 1989 onward, all examples were fitted with the 150hp Chrysler 3.3L V6.  Although all S-platform Town &amp; Country minivans have 1990 VINs, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] classifies examples with the 3.0L V6 as 1989 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/6255.shtml "Fuel Economy of the 1989 Chrysler Town and Country"], retrieved on 2015-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both engines were paired with the 4-speed [[Ultradrive]] automatic transmission.  

In total, 5,404 examples of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country were produced, making this variant the rarest of all Chrysler minivans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/production/chrysler-US.html|title=Chrysler Cars and Production Numbers, United States|last=Wilson|first=Gerard|date=June 2013|work=Allpar|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Marketing ==
Original commercials for the 1984 Voyager featured magician [[Doug Henning]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joE9juKuWSY&amp;feature=related "1984 plymouth voyager commercial"], retrieved on 2010–08–25.&lt;/ref&gt; as a spokesperson to promote the Voyager "Magic Wagon's" versatility, cargo space, low step-in height, passenger volume, and maneuverability.

'''Cohune oil''' is pressed from the seeds of the [[Attalea cohune|cohune palm]], which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].

Along with other byproducts of the palm, cohune oil is believed to have been used by cultures in southern [[Mesoamerica]] since the [[pre-Columbian]] era, in particular by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Uses of the oil include as a [[lubricant]], for [[Cooking oil|cooking]], [[soap]]making and [[Vegetable oil used as fuel|lamp oil]]. For this latter purpose the oil was placed in earthenware or soapstone lamps and lit with a wick, for cooking and illumination.

Cohune oil is made up of the following portions of [[fatty acid]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Commercialization ==
Cohune oil is generally not used commercially because the cohune palm is very difficult to break open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|124660}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the manufacture and usage of the oil continues among certain [[Maya peoples|contemporary Maya communities]] in [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gann, Thomas W.F. |authorlink=Thomas Gann |year=1918 |title=The Maya Indians of Southern Yucatan and Northern British Honduras |url=https://archive.org/details/mayaindiansofsou00ganniala |format=[[PDF]] online facsimile of original, digitized [2008] by the [[Internet Archive]] |series=Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin no. 64|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |location=Washington DC |oclc=424421 | pages=17,31,130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schlesinger, Victoria |year=2001 |title=Animals and Plants of the Ancient Maya: A Guide |others=Juan C.

'''Coronaric acid''' ('''isoleukotoxin''') is a mono-unsaturated, [[epoxide]] derivative of the di-saturated fatty acid, [[linoleic acid]] (i.e. 9(''Z''),12(''Z'') octadecadienoic acid.  It is a mixture of the two optically active [[isomers]] of 12(''Z'') 9,10-epoxy-octadecenoic acid.  This mixture is also termed 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid or 9(10)-EpOME&lt;ref&gt;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6246154&lt;/ref&gt; and when formed by or studied in mammalians, isoleukotoxin.

==Occurrence==
Coronaric acid is found in the seed oils derived from plants in [[sunflower]] family such as (Helianthus annuus)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17805802 | year = 1968 | author1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = K.

R. | last3 = Wolff | first3 = I. A. | doi = 10.1007/BF02530918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coronaric acid is also formed by the cells and tissues of various mammalian (including humans) species through the metabolism of linoleic acid by [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) [[epoxygenase]] enzymes.  These CYPs (CYP2C9 and probably other CYPs that metabolize [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] to epoxides) metabolize linoleic acid to (+)12''S'',13''R''-epoxy-9(''Z'')-octadecaenoic acid and (-)12''R'',13''S''-epoxy-9(''Z'')-octadecaenoic acid, i.e. the (+) and (-) epoxy [[optical isomers]] of coronaric acid.&lt;ref name="pmid10729206"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10729206 | year = 2000 | author1 = Draper | first1 = A.

Y. | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.07.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When studied in this context, the optical isomer mixture is often termed isoleukotoxin.  This same CYP epoxygenases concurrently  attack linoleic acid at the carbon 9,10 rather than 12,13 [[double bond]] of linoleic acid to form a mixture of (+) and (-) epoxy [[optical isomers]] viz., 9''S'',10''R''-epoxy-12(''Z'')-octadecaenoic and 9''R'',10''S''-epoxy-12(''Z'')-octadecaenoic acids.  This (+) and (-) optical mixture is often termed [[vernolic acid]] or when studied in plants and leukotoxin when studied in mammals.&lt;ref name="pmid10729206"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20869469"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25093613"/&gt;

Coronoric acid is found in urine samples from healthy human subjects and increases 3- to 4-fold when these subjects are treated with a salt-loading diet.&lt;ref name="pmid20869469"/&gt;

Coronaric and vernolic acids also form non-enzymatically when linoleic acid is exposed to oxygen and/or [[UV]] radiation as a result of the spontaneous process of [[autooxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 481136 | year = 1979 | author1 = Sevanian | first1 = A | title = Epoxides as products of lipid autoxidation in rat lungs | journal = Lipids | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 634–43 | last2 = Mead | first2 = J. F. | last3 = Stein | first3 = R. A. | doi=10.1007/bf02533449}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This autoxidation complicates studies in that it is often difficult to determine if these epoxy fatty acids identified in linoleic acid-rich plant and mammalian tissues represent actual tissue contents or are artifacts formed during their isolation and detection.

==Metabolism==
In mammalian tissue, coronaric acid is metabolized to its two corresponding dihydroxy [[stereoisomer]]s, 12''S'',13''R''-dihydroxy-9(''Z'')-octadecaenoic and 12''R'',13''S''-dihydroxy-9(''Z'')-octadecaenoic acids, by [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] within minutes of its formation.&lt;ref name="pmid10775319"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10775319 | year = 2000 | author1 = Greene | first1 = J.

==Activities==

===Toxicities===
At very high concentrations, the linoleic acid-derived set of optical isomers, coronaric acid (i.e. isoleukotoxin), possesses activities similar to that of other structurally unrelated leukotoxins viz., It is toxic to leukocytes and other cell types and when injected into rodents produce multiple organ failure and respiratory distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9299596 | year = 1997 | author1 = Moran | first1 = J.

'''Dallasite''' is a [[breccia]] made of subequant to rectangular or distinctly elongate, curvilinear shards that represent the spalled rims of [[Pillow lava|pillow basalt]] (see: [[Hyaloclastite]]). This material is commonly partly altered to [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[epidote]], [[quartz]] and [[Carbonate minerals|carbonate]], for which the local term 'dallasite' has been coined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266289964_High-Mg_Lavas_in_the_Karmutsen_Flood_Basalts_Northern_Vancouver_Island_NTS_092L_Stratigraphic_Setting_and_Metallogenic_Significance]{{citation|title=High-Mg Lavas in the Karmutsen Flood Basalts, Northern Vancouver Island (NTS 092L): Stratigraphic Setting and Metallogenic Significance|date=2008|author=Nixon, G.T., Larocque, J., Pals, A., Styan, J., Greene, A.R., and Scoates, J.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone dallasite is named after Dallas Road, [[Victoria, British Columbia]].

The '''Dowelmax''' is a loose tenon [[dowel]]ling jig manufactured by the O.M.S. Tool company in [[Canada]]. The manufacturer claims that the small [[Engineering tolerance|manufacturing tolerances]] of {{convert|0.026|mm|in}} for the [[aluminium]], [[brass]] and [[steel]] components of the jig ensure accuracy and repeatability. The precision manufacturing adds to the unit's cost, which is higher than other dowelling jigs.

The tool allows the placement of five dowels in one pass. A distance gauge bar provided with the jig allows accurate spacing between sets of dowels.

==Joint strength==
Tests by both the manufacturer,&lt;ref name="dmtest"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dowelmax.com/jointstrength.html|title=Destructive Tests Comparing Biscuit Joints, Mortise and Tenon Joints, and Multiple Dowel Joints made with Dowelmax|accessdate=2008-08-01|publisher=O.M.S Tool Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wood magazine]],&lt;ref name="woodmag"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.woodstore.net/is17ju201.html|title=What’s what in loose-tenon tools|accessdate=2008-08-01|publisher=Wood Magazine|date=2007-07-01|work=issue 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; are claimed to show that dowel joints made with the Dowelmax are stronger than most other woodworking joints tested.

In 2007, ''Wood'' magazine compared the joint strength of various loose tenon methods and tools, with these results:&lt;ref name="woodmag" /&gt;

A 2011 review&lt;ref name="dmtest2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toolreviews.woodmagazine.com/power-tools/joinery-tools-jigs/doweling-mortising-jigs/discussions/review?id=102|title=Review-A-Tool Dowelmax Doweling Jig|accessdate=2014-10-07|publisher=WOOD Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.woodmagazine.com/ Wood Magazine], has rated [http://www.dowelmax.com/ Dowelmax] very highly as a dowel joinery tool.

Regarded by many people in [[Southeast Asia]] as the "king of fruits",&lt;ref name="Heaton" /&gt; the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong [[odour]], and [[Spine (botany)|thorn]]-covered [[peel (fruit)|rind]]. The fruit can grow as large as {{convert|30|cm|in}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three&amp;nbsp;kilograms (2 to 7&amp;nbsp;lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance, whereas others find the aroma overpowering with an unpleasant odour. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, [[turpentine]], and raw sewage. The persistence of its odour, which may linger for several days, has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in southeast Asia. By contrast, the nineteenth-century British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] described its flesh as "a rich [[custard]] highly flavoured with [[almond]]s". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in [[Asian cuisine|southeast Asian cuisines]]. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.

==Etymology==
First used around 1580, the name "durian" is derived from the [[Malay language]] word ''duri'' (meaning "thorn"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=durian|title=Durian|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|date=2018|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the numerous prickly thorns
of the rind, together with the noun-building suffix ''-an''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Durian| publisher = Dictionary.com|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/durian?r=75?r=75 |date=2018|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==

''Durio sensu lato'' has 30 recognised species.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; ''Durio sensu stricto'' comprises 24 of these species. The 6 additional species included in ''Durio s.l.'' are now considered by some to comprise their own genus, ''Boschia''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''Durio s.s.'' and ''Boschia'' have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial difference between the two is that anther [[locule]]s open by apical pores in ''Boschia'' and by longitudinal slits in ''Durio s.s.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kostermans |first=A.

These three genera together form a clade that is characterised by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Systematics and character evolution in Durio s. lat.

The genus ''Durio'' is placed by some taxonomists in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Bombacaceae]], or by others in a broadly defined [[Malvaceae]] that includes Bombacaceae, and by others in a smaller family of just seven genera Durionaceae.&lt;ref name="GRIN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/family.pl?2319 |title=USDA GRIN Taxonomy, Durionaceae |accessdate=2014-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203192931/http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/family.pl?2319 |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APW"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/APweb/orders/malvalesweb.htm#Malvales | title = Angiosperm Phylogeny Website&amp;nbsp;– Malvales | publisher = [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Durio'' is often included in Bombacaceae because of the presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the [[Malvaceae|mallows]] (and [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]], in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Durioneae]] should be placed in the [[subfamily]] Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesise that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies [[Malvoideae]] and [[Bombacoideae]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phylogeny of the core Malvales: evidence from ndhF sequence data|url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/86/10/1474|journal = American Journal of Botany|date = 1999-10-01|issn = 0002-9122|pmid = 10523287|pages = 1474–1486|volume = 86|issue = 10|first = William S.|last = Alverson|first2 = Barbara A.|last2 = Whitlock|first3 = Reto|last3 = Nyffeler|first4 = Clemens|last4 = Bayer|first5 = David A.|last5 = Baum|doi=10.2307/2656928|jstor = 2656928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Support for an expanded family concept of Malvaceae within a recircumscribed order Malvales: a combined analysis of plastid atpB and rbcL DNA sequences|journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|date = 1999-04-01|issn = 1095-8339|pages = 267–303|volume = 129|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.1999.tb00505.x|first = Clemens|last = Bayer|first2 = Michael F.|last2 = Fay|first3 = Anette Y.|last3 = De Bruijn|first4 = Vincent|last4 = Savolainen|first5 = Cynthia M.|last5 = Morton|first6 = Klaus|last6 = Kubitzki|first7 = William S.|last7 = Alverson|first8 = Mark W.|last8 = Chase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Durian tree in malaysia.jpg|thumb|Juvenile durian tree in [[Malaysia]]. Mature specmens can grow up to {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off}}]]
Durian trees are large, growing to {{convert|25|–|50|m|ft}} in height depending on the species.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; The leaves are [[evergreen]], elliptic to oblong and {{convert|10|–|18|cm|in|abbr=off}} long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx ([[sepals]]) and five (rarely four or six) [[petal]]s. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods per year, although the timing varies depending on the species, cultivars, and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit can hang from any branch, and matures roughly three months after [[pollination]]. The fruit can grow up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} long and {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Among the thirty known species of ''Durio'', nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: ''[[Durio zibethinus|D. zibethinus]]'', ''[[Durio dulcis|D. dulcis]]'', ''[[Durio grandiflorus|D. grandiflorus]]'', ''[[Durio graveolens|D. graveolens]]'', ''[[Durio kutejensis|D. kutejensis]]'', ''[[Durio lowianus]]'', ''[[Durio macrantha|D. macrantha]]'', ''[[Durio oxleyanus|D. oxleyanus]]'' and ''[[Durio testudinarius|D. testudinarius]]''.&lt;ref name=ACIAR&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://aciar.gov.au/files/node/598/mn114-part1.pdf |title=Diversity and management of ''Phytophthora'' in Southeast Asia.

The name ''durian'' comes from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''duri'' (thorn) together with the [[suffix]] -''an'' (for building a noun in Malay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=Via ''durion'', the Indonesia name for the plant. |title=Oxford English Dictionary |year=1897 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Huxley |editor-first=A. |title=New RHS Dictionary of Gardening |publisher=Macmillan |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-56159-001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''D. zibethinus'' is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree [[phenology]]. In the species name, ''zibethinus'' refers to the Indian [[civet]], ''[[Viverra zibetha]]''. There is disagreement over whether this name, bestowed by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Michael J. |title=Durio&amp;nbsp;– A Bibliographic Review |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AcGwT0CdSwC&amp;pg=PA2 |isbn=978-92-9043-318-7 |page=2 |accessdate = 2012-09-04}} See also pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6 regarding whether Linnaeus or Murray is the correct authority for the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious [[nectar (plant)|nectar]], and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of [[bat]]s that eat nectar and [[pollen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Whitten, Tony |title=The Ecology of Sumatra |publisher=Periplus |year=2001 |isbn = 978-962-593-074-9 |page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (''[[Eonycteris|Eonycteris spelaea]]'');&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; however, a 1996 study indicated two species, ''D. grandiflorus'' and ''[[Durio oblongus|D. oblongus]]'', were pollinated by [[spiderhunter]]s ([[Nectariniidae]]) and another species, ''D. kutejensis'', was pollinated by [[giant honey bee]]s and birds as well as bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bird-pollination of Three Durio Species (Bombacaceae) in a Tropical Rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia |author=Yumoto, Takakazu |journal=[[American Journal of Botany]] |volume=87 |issue=8 |pages=1181–1188 |year=2000 |doi=10.2307/2656655 |jstor=2656655 |pmid=10948003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have hypothesised that the development of monothecate anthers and larger flowers (compared to those of the remaining genera in Durioneae) in the clade consisting of ''Durio, Boschia'', and ''Cullenia'' was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to vertebrate pollination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Cultivars===
[[File:D101 and random stock.jpg|thumb|right|Different cultivars of durian often have distinct colours. D101 (right) has rich yellow flesh, clearly distinguishable from another variety (left).]]

Over the centuries, numerous durian [[cultivar]]s, propagated by vegetative [[Cloning|clone]]s, have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by [[layering]], [[marcotting]], or more commonly, by [[grafting]], including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected [[rootstock]]s. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;

Most cultivars have a common name and a code number starting with "D". For example, some popular clones are Sultan (D24), Kop (D99 {{lang-th|กบ}}&amp;nbsp;– "frog" {{IPA-th|kòp}}), Chanee (D123, {{lang-th|ชะนี}}&amp;nbsp;– "gibbon" {{IPA-th|tɕʰániː}}), Berserah or Green Durian or Tuan Mek Hijau (D145 {{lang-th|ทุเรียนเขียว}}&amp;nbsp;– Green Durian {{IPA-th|tʰúriːən kʰǐow}}), Kan Yao (D158, {{lang-th|ก้านยาว}}&amp;nbsp;– Long Stem {{IPA-th|kâːn jaːw}}), Mon Thong (D159, {{lang-th|หมอนทอง}}&amp;nbsp;– Golden Pillow {{IPA-th|mɔ̌ːn tʰɔːŋ}}), Kradum Thong ({{lang-th|กระดุมทอง}}&amp;nbsp;– Golden Button {{IPA-th|kràdum tʰɔːŋ}}), and with no common name, D169. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' exist in [[Thailand]].

Mon Thong is the most commercially sought after, for its thick, full-bodied creamy and mild sweet-tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee is the best in terms of its resistance to infection by ''[[Phytophthora palmivora]]''. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odourless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum.&lt;ref name=Pibul&gt;{{cite web

Popular cultivars in Malaysia and Singapore (Singapore imports most of its durians from Malaysia, hence the varieties are similar although there may be slight variation in the names) include "D24", which is a popular variety known for its bittersweet taste; "XO", which has a pale colour, thick flesh with a tinge of alcoholic fermentation; "Chook Kiok" (Cantonese meaning: bamboo leg) which has a distinctive yellowish core in the inner stem; and "Musang King" ('musang' is the Malay word for [[Asian palm civet|palm civet]]) which is usually the priciest of all cultivars. Musang King is known for its bright yellow flesh and is like a more potent or enhanced version of the D24.&lt;ref name=year/&gt;

The durian is native to [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]],&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; and is cultivated in other areas with a similar climate. It is strictly [[Tropical agriculture|tropical]] and stops growing when mean daily temperatures drop below {{convert|22|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=ACIAR/&gt;
There is some debate as to whether the durian is native to the [[Philippines]] or was introduced, particularly the [[Davao City|Davao]] region on the island of [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

The centre of [[ecological diversity]] for durians is the island of [[Borneo]], where the fruits of the edible species of ''Durio'' including ''D.&amp;nbsp;zibethinus'', ''D.&amp;nbsp;dulcis'', ''D.&amp;nbsp;graveolens'', ''D.&amp;nbsp;kutejensis'', ''D.&amp;nbsp;oxleyanus'', and ''D.&amp;nbsp;testudinarius'' are sold in local markets.

''D.&amp;nbsp;zibethinus'' is not grown in [[Brunei]] because consumers there prefer other species such as ''D.&amp;nbsp;graveolens'', ''D.&amp;nbsp;kutejensis'', and ''D.&amp;nbsp;oxleyanus''. These species are commonly distributed in Brunei, and together with other species like ''D.&amp;nbsp;testudinarius'' and ''D.&amp;nbsp;dulcis'' constitute a [[genetic diversity|genetically diverse]] crop source.&lt;ref name="Osman"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bioversityinternational.org/uploads/tx_news/Expert_consultation_on_tropical_fruit_species_of_Asia_655.pdf |title=Tropical fruit production and genetic resources in Southeast Asia: Identifying the priority fruit species |first1=M.

The durian is a seasonal fruit, unlike some other non-seasonal tropical fruits such as the [[papaya]] which are available throughout the year. In peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is typically from June to August, coinciding with that of the [[mangosteen]].&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

Prices of durians are relatively high, compared with other fruits. For example, in Singapore the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24 (''Sultan''), and Musang King (''Mao Shan Wang'') has resulted in typical retail prices of between [[S$]]8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit in 2007.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html |series=ST Foodies Club |title=Durian King |year=2006 |access-date=2007-07-25 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215124752/http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html |archive-date=2007-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With an average weight of about {{convert|1.5|kg}}, a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15).&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;  The drive for the prices increase was due to its popularity in China, which drove The edible portion of the fruit, known as the [[aril]] and usually referred to as the "flesh" or "pulp", only accounts for about 15–30% of the mass of the entire fruit.&lt;ref name="bioversityinternational"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Michael J. |title=Durio – A Bibliographic Review |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) |page=35 |year=1997 |url=http://www.bioversityinternational.org/uploads/tx_news/Durio_654.pdf |format=PDF |isbn=978-92-9043-318-7 |access-date=2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of the fruit also saw the price of the Malaysian variety Musang King rise considerably; durian farmers would see the prices they get increasing from two ringgit per kilogram to 60 ringgit per kilo by 2018, which made it a far more lucrative than palm oil or rubber, leading to an increase in durian plantation.&lt;ref name="ellis=petersen"/&gt;  Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) on a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;

==Flavour and odour==
[[File:No durians sign.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sign informing that Durian fruit is not allowed inside the Singapore subway]]
The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;ref name="genthe"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/durians-smell-awful-but-the-taste-is-heavenly-57313254/ | title=Durians Smell Awful – But the Taste Is Heavenly | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | date=September 1999 | accessdate=6 October 2016 | author=Genthe, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1856, the British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] provided a much-quoted description of the flavour of the durian:

{{quote|The five cells are silky-white within, and are filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about three seeds each. This pulp is the edible part, and its consistence and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acidic nor sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact, to eat Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience. ... as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour it is unsurpassed.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite web | author = Wallace, Alfred Russel | title = On the Bamboo and Durian of Borneo | year = 1856 | url = http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S027.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | authorlink = Alfred Russel Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}}}}

Wallace described himself as being at first reluctant to try it because of the aroma, "but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater".&lt;ref name=Wallace1886p74&gt;{{Cite book |year=1886 |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel | authorlink = Alfred Russel Wallace |title=The Malay Archipelago: The land of the orang-utang and the bird of paradise |place=London |publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co |url=https://archive.org/stream/malayarchipelag03wallgoog#page/n90/mode/1up |pages=74–75 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited one traveller from 1599:{{Ref label|b|b|none}} "it is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all other fruits of the world, according to those who have tasted it."&lt;ref name=Wallace1886p74/&gt; He cites another writer: "To those not used to it, it seems at first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately after they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it."&lt;ref name=Wallace1886p74/&gt; Despite having tried many foods that are arguably more eccentric, Andrew Zimmern, host of [[Bizarre Foods]], was unable to finish a durian upon sampling it, due to his intolerance of its strong taste.

While Wallace cautions that "the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly at first disagreeable", later descriptions by Westerners are more graphic in detail. Novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] writes that eating durian is "like eating sweet raspberry [[blancmange]] in the lavatory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h_ReGl7pJuEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Long%20Day%20Wanes%3A%20A%20Malayan%20Trilogy&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=durian | title = The Long Day Wanes: A Malayan Trilogy | first = Anthony |last = Burgess | authorlink = Anthony Burgess | page = 68 | publisher = W.

The wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great deal to do with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (''D. dulcis'') has a deep [[caramel]] flavour with a [[turpentine]] odour while red-fleshed durian (''D. graveolens'') emits a fragrance of roasted [[almond]]s.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt; Among the varieties of ''D. zibethinus'', Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and less odorous than Malay ones.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; The degree of ripeness has an effect on the flavour as well.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

Scientific analyses of the composition of durian aroma found numerous [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] compounds including [[ester]]s, [[ketone]]s, and different [[sulphur compounds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Characterization of the major odour-active compounds in Thai durian ( ''Durio zibethinus'' L.

Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;ref name=genthe/&gt;

This strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including [[squirrel]]s, [[Chevrotain|mouse deer]], pigs, [[sun bear]], [[orangutan]], [[Asian elephant|elephants]], and even carnivorous [[tiger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/4193933/In-praise-of-the-delectable-durian.html|title=In praise of the delectable durian|date=18 October 2004|author=Mulqueen, Kevin|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=su08b/&gt; While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Marinelli | editor-first=Janet | title=Brooklyn Botanic Garden Gardener's Desk Reference | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | year=1998 | isbn = 978-0-8050-5095-0 | page = 691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;{{cite book | author = McGee, Harold | title= On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | isbn = 978-0-684-80001-1 | page = 379 | authorlink = Harold McGee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ripeness and selection===
[[File:Durian customer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A customer sniffs a durian before purchasing it.]]

According to ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'', the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Larousse Gastronomique | editor-last=Montagne | editor-first=Prosper | publisher = Clarkson Potter | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-609-60971-2 | page = 439| title-link=Larousse Gastronomique }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in [[southern Thailand]] prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in [[northern Thailand]], the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic,&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.

The various preferences regarding ripeness among consumers make it hard to issue general statements about choosing a "good" durian. A durian that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days, but after five or six days most would consider it overripe and unpalatable,&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt; although some Thais proceed from that point to cook it with palm sugar, creating a dessert called durian (or thurian) guan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbtPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT115 |title= The Durian Tourist's Guide To Thailand: Volume 1 of The Durian Tourist |date=2014 |accessdate= 6 October 2016 |author= Gasik, Lindsay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Culinary===
Durian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as traditional Malay candy, ''[[ice kacang]]'', ''[[dodol]]'', ''lempuk'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agromedia.mardi.gov.my/magritech/tech_detail_fdscience.php?id=495|title=Mardi – Lempuk technology.|author=|date=|website=mardi.gov.my|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; rose biscuits, [[ice cream]], [[milkshake]]s, [[mooncake]]s, [[Yule log (cake)|Yule log]]s, and [[cappuccino]]. ''Es durian'' (durian ice cream) is a popular dessert in Indonesia, sold at street side stall in Indonesian cities, especially in Java. ''Pulut Durian'' or ''ketan durian'' is [[glutinous rice]] steamed with [[coconut milk]] and served with ripened durian. In [[Sabah]], red durian is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabahtravelguide.com/culture/default.ASP?page=trad_cuisine |publisher=Sabah Tourism Promotion Corporation |title=Traditional Cuisine |accessdate=2008-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929122049/http://www.sabahtravelguide.com/culture/default.ASP?page=trad_cuisine |archivedate=2008-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red-fleshed durian is traditionally added to ''sayur'', an Indonesian soup made from freshwater fish.&lt;ref name=Heaton&gt;{{cite book | title = A Consumers Guide on World Fruit | author = Heaton, Donald D. | publisher = BookSurge Publishing | isbn = 978-1-4196-3955-5 | year = 2006 | pages= 54–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ikan brengkes tempoyak'' is fish cooked in a durian-based sauce, traditional in [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indonesia (Lonely Planet Travel Guides) | first = Justine |last = Vaisutis |author2=Neal Bedford |author3=Mark Elliott |author4=Nick Ray |author5=Ryan Ver Berkmoes  | page = 83 | publisher = Lonely Planet Publications | isbn = 978-1-74104-435-5 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dried durian flesh can be made into [[kripik]] durian (durian chips).

''[[Tempoyak]]'' refers to [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] durian, usually made from lower quality durian unsuitable for direct consumption. Tempoyak can be eaten either cooked or uncooked, is normally eaten with rice, and can also be used for making [[curry]]. Sambal Tempoyak is a [[Sumatran dish]] made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as [[sambal]]. In Palembang, ''[[Pangasius]]'' catfish can be either cooked as ''tempoyak ikan patin'' (fish in tempoyak curry) or as ''[[pepes|brengkes (pepes)]] tempoyak'', which is a steamed fermented durian paste in [[banana leaf]] container.

In Thailand, durian is often eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste are sold in the markets, though much of the paste is [[Adulterant|adulterated]] with [[pumpkin]].&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt; Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called ''boder''. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in [[coconut oil]], with a texture that is similar to [[taro]] or [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], but stickier. In [[Java]], the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to [[cyclopropene]] [[fatty acid]]s and should not be ingested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Durio, A Bibliographic Review | publisher=Bioversity International, International Plant Genetic Resources Institute | author=Brown, Michael J. | year=1997 | pages=56–59 | isbn=978-9290433187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AcGwT0CdSwC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young leaves and [[shoot]]s of the durian are occasionally cooked as [[greens (vegetable)|greens]]. Sometimes the ash of the burned [[peel (fruit)|rind]] is added to special cakes.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt; The petals of durian flowers are eaten in the [[Batak (Indonesia)|North Sumatra]] province of Indonesia, while in the [[Moluccas]] islands the husk of the durian fruit is used as fuel to [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoke]] fish.

Raw durian is composed of 65% water, 27% [[carbohydrates]] (including 4% [[dietary fibre]]), 5% [[fat]] and 1% [[protein]]. In 100 grams, raw or fresh frozen durian provides 33% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) of [[thiamine]] and moderate content of other [[B vitamins]], [[vitamin C]], and the [[dietary mineral]] [[manganese]] (15–24% DV, table).

==History==
[[File:Boym-durian-Lach-and-Kley-3-4-369.png|thumb|left|[[Michał Boym]], a [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionary]] to China, provided one of the early (1655) reports on durian (upper right) to European scholars.]]

Origin of the durian is thought to be in the region of [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]], grows wild in the [[Malay peninsula]], and was commonly cultivated in a wide region from [[India]] to [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt; Four hundred years ago, it was traded across present-day [[Myanmar]], and was actively cultivated especially in [[Thailand]] and [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt;

The earliest known European reference to the durian is the record of [[Niccolò Da Conti]], who travelled to south-eastern Asia in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Michael J. |title=Durio&amp;nbsp;– A Bibliographic Review |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) |year=1997 |url= http://www.bioversityinternational.org/uploads/tx_news/Durio_654.pdf |isbn=978-92-9043-318-7 |page=3 |format = PDF |accessdate = 2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated from the [[Latin]] in which [[Poggio Bracciolini]] recorded Da Conti's travels: "They [people of Sumatra] have a green fruit which they call durian, as big as a watermelon. Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, with a combination of flavours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcjmiBm8hHQC&amp;pg=PA332|title=Hobson-Jobson: The Anglo–Indian Dictionary|chapter=Durian, Dorian|last1=Yule|first1=Henry|last2=Burnell|first2=Arthur Coke|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|year=1996|orig-year=1886|isbn=978-1853263637|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] physician [[Garcia de Orta]] described durians in ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' published in 1563. In 1741, ''Herbarium Amboinense'' by the German botanist [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus ''Durio'' has a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius.&lt;ref name=ACIAR/&gt; During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the [[soursop]] (''Annona muricata''), for both of these species had thorny green fruit.&lt;ref name=Brown_006/&gt; The Malay name for the soursop is ''durian Belanda'', meaning ''Dutch durian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Davidson, Alan | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | isbn = 978-0-19-211579-9 | page= 737}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, [[Johann Anton Weinmann]] considered the durian to belong to [[Chestnut|Castaneae]] as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.&lt;ref name=Brown_006&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Michael J. |title=Durio&amp;nbsp;– A Bibliographic Review |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) |year=1997 |url= http://www.bioversityinternational.org/uploads/tx_news/Durio_654.pdf |isbn=978-92-9043-318-7 |page=6 |format = PDF |accessdate = 2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Durio Zibethinus Van Nooten.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Durio zibethinus''. [[Chromolithograph]] by Hoola Van Nooten, circa 1863]]
''D. zibethinus'' was introduced into [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] by the Portuguese in the 16th century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been planted in the Americas but confined to [[botanical garden]]s. The first seedlings were sent from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to [[Auguste Saint-Arroman]] of [[Dominica]] in 1884.&lt;ref name=Agro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/SEA/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=715 |title=Agroforestry Tree Database&amp;nbsp;– ''Durio zibethinus'' |publisher=International Center for Research in Agroforestry |accessdate=2008-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154326/http://www.worldagroforestry.org/SEA/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=715 |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In south-eastern Asia, the durian has been cultivated for centuries at the village level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; In ''My Tropic Isle'', [[Australia]]n author and [[naturalist]] [[Edmund James Banfield]] tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in Singapore sent him a durian seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Edmund James Banfield | last=Banfield | first=E.

In 1949, the British botanist [[E. J. H. Corner]] published ''The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree''. His theory was that [[Zoochorous|endozoochory]] (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], and that primitive ancestors of ''Durio'' species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (''D. dulcis'') exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which ''Durio'' and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phylogenetic relationships of the durians (Bombacaceae-Durioneae or /Malvaceae/Helicteroideae/Durioneae) based on chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences|journal = Plant Systematics and Evolution|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 0378-2697|pages = 55–82|volume = 224|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1007/BF00985266|first = R.|last = Nyffeler|first2 = D. A.|last2 = Baum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1990s, the domestic and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]) region has increased significantly, partly due to the increasing affluence of Asia.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

==Culture and folk medicine==

===Cultural influences===

A common local belief is that the durian is harmful when eaten with coffee&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; or alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; The latter belief can be traced back at least to the 18th century when [[Rumphius]] stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and [[Halitosis|bad breath]]. In 1929, J. D. Gimlette wrote in his ''Malay Poisons and Charm Cures'' that the durian fruit must not be eaten with [[brandy]]. In 1981, J. R. Croft wrote in his ''Bombacaceae: In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea'' that "a feeling of morbidity" often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian. Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions,&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; though a study by the [[University of Tsukuba]] finds the fruit's high sulphur content inhibits the activity of [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]], causing a 70% reduction of the ability to clear toxins from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327253.200-durians-and-booze-worse-than-a-stinking-hangover.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news | title = Durians and booze: worse than a stinking hangover | date = 2009-09-16 | accessdate = 2009-10-15 | publisher = ''[[New Scientist]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The durian is commonly known as the "King of the Fruits",&lt;ref name=Heaton/&gt; a label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering odour.&lt;ref&gt;The [[mangosteen]], called the "queen of fruits", is petite and mild in comparison. The mangosteen season coincides with that of the durian and is seen as a complement, which is probably how the mangosteen received the complementary title.&lt;/ref&gt; In its native south-eastern Asia, the durian is an everyday food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the cultural perception it has in the region. The durian symbolised the subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in [[Hong Kong]] director [[Fruit Chan]]'s [[2000 in film|2000 film]] ''[[Durian Durian]]'' (榴槤飄飄, ''lau lin piu piu''), and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy ''Durian King'' played by [[Adrian Pang]].&lt;ref name=STB&gt;{{cite web | title = Uniquely Singapore&amp;nbsp;– July 2006 Issue | url = http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/about_singapore/ezine_home/Jul06/local_speak/Durain_Story.html | year = 2006 | publisher = Singapore Tourism Board| accessdate = 2007-07-31 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070823005745/http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/about_singapore/ezine_home/Jul06/local_speak/Durain_Story.html | archivedate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the oddly shaped [[Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade]] building in Singapore (Theatres on the Bay) is often called "The Durian" by locals,&lt;ref name=STB/&gt; and "The Big Durian" is the nickname of [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20070622.B10 |

A durian falling on a person's head can cause serious injuries because it is heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a [[hardhat]] is recommended when collecting the fruit. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious [[effusion]] of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt; A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt which is untrue as people have died from durian falling on their heads especially young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2012/11/28/baby-boy-killed-by-falling-durian-in-jawi/|title=Baby boy killed by falling durian in Jawi - Nation - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=www.thestar.com.my|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Asian Food | url = http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=D&amp;startno=27&amp;endno=51 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010409054415/http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=D&amp;startno=27&amp;endno=51 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2001-04-09 | year = 1998 | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | publisher = Periplus | first = Charmaine | last = Solomon }}&lt;/ref&gt; A saying in Indonesian, ''ketiban durian runtuh'', which translates to "getting a durian avalanche", is the equivalent of the English phrase "[[windfall gain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An Indonesian–English Dictionary | first = John M. |last = Echols|author2=Hassan Shadily |publisher= Cornell University Press |year = 1989 |isbn = 978-0-8014-2127-3| page = 292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indonesia (Lonely Planet Travel Guides) | first = Justine |last = Vaisutis |author2=Neal Bedford |author3=Mark Elliott |author4=Nick Ray |author5=Ryan Ver Berkmoes  | pages = 393–394 | publisher = Lonely Planet Publications | isbn = 978-1-74104-435-5 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong nylon or woven rope nettings are often strung between durian trees in orchards, serving a threefold purpose: the nets aid in the collection of the mature fruits, deter ground-level scavengers, and most importantly, prevent the durians from falling onto people.

A naturally spineless variety of durian growing wild in [[Davao City|Davao]], Philippines, was discovered in the 1960s; fruits borne from these seeds also lacked spines.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Since the bases of the scales develop into spines as the fruit matures, sometimes spineless durians are produced artificially by scraping scales off immature fruits.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; In Malaysia, a spineless durian clone D172 is registered by Agriculture Department on 17 June 1989. It was called "Durian Botak" (Bald Durian).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Indonesia, Ir Sumeru Ashari, head of Durian Research Centre, Universitas Brawijaya reported spineless durian from Kasembon, Malang. Another cultivar is from Lombok, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia.

Animals such as [[Sumatran elephant]]s and tigers are known to consume durians.&lt;ref name=su08b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/tiger/panthera-tigris/video-su08b.html |title=Sumatran tiger inspects durian fruit on forest floor |work=BBC |publisher=ARKive |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the names Thailand contributed to the list of storm names for Western North Pacific tropical cyclones was '[[Typhoon Durian|Durian]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/tyname.html | title = Tropical Cyclone Names | publisher = Japan Meteorological Agency | accessdate = 2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was retired after the second storm of this name in [[2006 Pacific typhoon season|2006]]. Being a fruit much loved by a variety of wild beasts, the durian sometimes signifies the long-forgotten animalistic aspect of humans, as in the legend of [[Orang Mawas]], the Malaysian version of Bigfoot, and [[Orang Pendek]], its Sumatran version, both of which have been claimed to feast on durians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Lian, Hah Foong | url = http://www.bigfootencounters.com/creatures/mawas.htm | title = Village abuzz over sighting of 'mawas' | publisher = Star Publications, Malaysia | date = 2000-01-02 | accessdate = 2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jambiexplorer.com/content/orangpendek.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116100430/http://www.jambiexplorer.com/content/orangpendek.htm | archivedate=2008-01-16 | title = Do 'orang pendek' really exist? | publisher = Jambiexplorer.com | accessdate = 2006-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk medicine===

In Malaysia, a [[decoction]] of the leaves and roots used to be prescribed as an [[antipyretic]]. The leaf juice is applied on the head of a fever patient.&lt;ref name=Morton/&gt; The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription, collected by Burkill and Haniff in 1930. It instructs the reader to boil the roots of ''[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]'' with the roots of ''Durio zibethinus'', ''[[Nephelium longan]]'', ''[[Nephelium mutabile]]'' and ''[[Artocarpus|Artocarpus integrifolia]]'', and drink the decoction or use it as a [[poultice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burkill, I. H.  |author2=Haniff, M. | year = 1930 | title = Malay village medicine, prescriptions collected | journal = Gardens Bulletin Straits Settlements | issue = 6 | pages = 176–177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">The '''electrodipping force''' is a force proposed to explain the observed attraction that arises among small [[colloidal]] particles attached to an interface between immiscible liquids.  The particles are held there by [[surface tension]].  Normally the surface tension does not in itself give rise to an attraction or repulsion among particles on a [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]].  A capillary interaction requires that the particles are pushed or pulled away from the meniscus, for instance because of their weight, if the particles are large and heavy enough.

It has been proposed by Nikolaides et al.{{ref|Nikolaides}} that the observed attractions are the result of an electrostatic pressure on the liquid interface, due to electric charges on the particles.  The electrostatic pressure arises because the dielectric constants of the liquids differ.  Due to the pressure, the liquid interface deforms.  This pressure is balanced by a simultaneous electrostatic force acting on the charges, and hence on the particle itself.  The force has been coined the ''electrodipping force'' by Kralchevsky et al. - it dips the particle in one of the liquids.{{ref|Kralchevsky}}

According to Nikolaides, the electrostatic force engenders a long range capillary attraction.  However, this explanation is controversial;  other authors have argued that the capillary effect of the electrodipping force is in fact cancelled by the electrostatic pressure on the interface, so the resulting capillary effect would be insignificant.{{ref|Megens}}{{ref|Wuerger}}

An '''environment minister''' (sometimes '''minister of the environment''' or '''secretary of the environment''') is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] position charged with protecting the [[natural environment]] and promoting [[wildlife conservation]]. The areas associated with the duties of an ''environmental minister'' depends largely of the needs of an individual countries or states.

The world's first minister of the environment was the British Politician [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]] from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. He was appointed in 1970.

'''Förster coupling''' is the resonant energy transfer between [[exciton]]s within adjacent QD's ([[quantum dot]]s). The first studies of Foerster were performed in the context of the sensitized luminescence of solids. Here, an excited sensitizer atom can transfer its excitation to a neighbouring acceptor atom, via an intermediate virtual photon. This same mechanism has also been shown to be responsible for exciton transfer between QD’s and within molecular systems and biosystems (though incoherently, as a mechanism for photosynthesis), all of which may be treated in a similar formulation. (See also [[Förster resonance energy transfer]] (FRET).)

==Introduction==
In the introductory lecture given by T. Förster,&lt;ref&gt;T. Förster, Discuss. Faraday Soc. 27, 7 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; he considered the transfer of electronic excitation energy between otherwise well-separated atomic or molecular electronic systems, which exclude the trivial case of an excitation transfer that consists in the emission of one quantum of light by the first atom or molecule followed by re-absorption by the second one. It is only the non-radiative transfer of excitation occurring during the short lifetimes of excited electronic systems which he considered there.

The first observation of energy transfer was made by Cario and Franck (1922)&lt;ref&gt;Cario and Franck, Z. Physik, 1923, 17, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; in their classical experiments on sensitized fluorescence of atoms in the vapour phase. A mixture of mercury and thallium vapour, when irradiated with the light of the mercury resonance line, shows the emission spectra of both atoms. Since thallium atoms do not absorb the exciting light, they can get excited only indirectly by an excitation transfer from mercury atoms. A transfer by reabsorption is impossible here. Therefore, this transfer must be a non-radiative one with a mercury atom as the donor or sensitizer and the thallium atom as the acceptor. Unfortunately, in this case it cannot be decided whether the transfer occurs between distant atoms or during a normal collision or even in a labile molecule formed as an intermediate. This decision, however, was possible in similar cases, as in the mercury-sensitized fluorescence of sodium and in the mutual sensitization of the fluorescence of different mercury isotopes. In these cases, the transfer occurs over distances very much larger than those in normal collisional separations. Similar observations of sensitized fluorescence were made with molecular vapours and in solution.

Further experiments have shown that in this case the transfer occurs not over collisional distances but over the mean intermolecular distances of sensitizer and acceptor, corresponding to a concentration of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;[[Mole (unit)|M]]. This is demonstrated by the fact that sensitization occurs with similar half-value concentrations in solution of very different viscosities and even in organic glasses at low temperature. The possibility of the formation of a complex between sensitizer and acceptor molecules was excluded by the additivity of the absorption spectra and the different dependence on concentration to be expected in this case. It must be concluded, therefore, that excitation transfer of a non-trivial nature occurs over the mean distances between statistically distributed molecules which are about 40Å in this case. It differs from short-distance collisional transfer by its independence of solvent viscosity and from transfer within a molecular complex by the constancy of absorption spectra and the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime.

==Qualitative features==
Table 2 summarizes some qualitative features of this kind of long-range transfer and of some more or less trivial mechanisms. The non-trivial transfer differs from re-absorption transfer by its independence of the volume of the solution, by the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime, and by the invariability of the sensitizer fluorescence spectrum. It differs from short-distance collisional transfer by its independence of solvent viscosity and from transfer within a molecular complex by the constancy of absorption spectra and the decrease in sensitizer fluorescence lifetime. In most cases, some of these different properties allow a decision between trivial and non-trivial transfer mechanisms. Further discriminations may be made by quantitative studies of these properties.

==Coulomb interaction==
&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Bimberg, "Semiconductor nanostructures"  (Berlin: Springer, 25 cm).&lt;/ref&gt; The electrons interact via the Coulomb interaction, given by the Hamiltonian
:&lt;math&gt;H_c=\frac{1}{2}\sum _{i,j,k,l} V_{\text{ijkl}}a_i{}^{\dagger }a_j{}^{\dagger }a_la_k&lt;/math&gt;
where the Coulomb matrix element is given by
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{ijkl}}=\frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon _0\epsilon _r}\int d^3x\int d^3x'\phi _i{}^*\left(\overset{\rightharpoonup }{x}\right)\phi _j{}^*\left(\overset{\rightharpoonup }{x}'\right)\frac{1}{\left|\overset{\rightharpoonup }{x}-\overset{\rightharpoonup }{x}'\right|}\phi _k\left(\overset{\rightharpoonup }{x}\right)\phi _l\left(\overset{\rightharpoonup }{x}'\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon _r&lt;/math&gt; is the dielectric constant of the medium.

To calculate the dynamics of two coupled QDs (each modeled as an interband two-level system with one conduction and one valence level &lt;math&gt;|c\rangle&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;|v\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, respectively) which have no electronic overlap, an expansion of the potential is performed: (i) a long-range expansion about a reference point of each QD, varying on a mesoscopic scale and neglecting the variation on the scale of the elementary cell - this yields level diagonal contributions in the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H_{\text{cc}}=\sum _{i&gt;j} V_{\text{cc}}^{\text{ij}}a_{c_i}{}^{\dagger }a_{c_j}{}^{\dagger }a_{c_j}a_{c_i}&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;H_{\text{cv}}=\sum _{i\neq  j} V_{\text{cv}}^{\text{ij}}a_{c_i}{}^{\dagger }a_{v_j}{}^{\dagger }a_{v_j}a_{c_i}&lt;/math&gt; ; and (ii) a short-range expansion about an arbitrary lattice vector, taking into account the microscopic variation of the QD - this yields nondiagonal contributions &lt;math&gt;H_F=\sum _{i\neq  j} V_F^{\text{ij}}a_{c_i}{}^{\dagger }a_{v_j}{}^{\dagger }a_{c_j}a_{v_i}&lt;/math&gt; . On the dipole-dipole level, the level diagonal elements correspond to an electrostatic energetic shift of the system (biexcitonic shift &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{bs}}=V_{\text{cv}}-V_{\text{cc}}&lt;/math&gt;), while the nondiagonal elements, the so-called Förster coupling elements &lt;math&gt;V_F&lt;/math&gt;, correspond to an excitation transfer between the different QDs.

==Hamiltonian==
Here
&lt;ref&gt;A. Nazir ''et al'', "Anticrossings in Förster coupled quantum dots", arXiv:quant-ph/0309099v2&lt;/ref&gt;
, we shall consider excitons in two coupled QD’s and the Coulomb interactions between them. More specifically, we shall derive an analytical expression for the strength of the inter-dot Foerster coupling. It can be also shown that this coupling is, under certain conditions, of dipole-dipole type and that it is responsible for resonant exciton exchange between adjacent QD’s. This is a transfer of energy only, not a tunnelling effect.

we write the Hamiltonian of two interacting QD’s in the computational basis
&lt;math&gt; \{ |00 \rangle , |01 \rangle , |10 \rangle , |11\rangle \} \ as \ ( \hbar = 1)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}=\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 \omega _0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; \omega _0+\omega _2 &amp; V_F &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; V_F &amp; \omega _0+\omega _1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \omega _0+\omega _1+\omega _2+V_{\text{XX}}
\end{array}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the off-diagonal Förster interaction is given by &lt;math&gt;V_F&lt;/math&gt;
, and the direct Coulomb binding energy between the two excitons, one on each dot, is on the diagonal and given by &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{XX}}&lt;/math&gt;
. The ground state energy is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\omega _0&lt;/math&gt;
, and &lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega \equiv \omega _1 - \omega _2 &lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the excitation energy for dot I and that for dot II. These excitation energies and inter-dot interactions are all functions of the applied field F.

It is also straightforward to see that an off-diagonal Förster coupling does indeed correspond to a resonant transfer of energy; if we begin in the state
&lt;math&gt; |10 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; (exciton on dot I, no exciton on dot II) this will naturally evolve to a state
&lt;math&gt; |01 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

A '''gate dielectric''' is a [[dielectric]] used between the gate and substrate of a [[field-effect transistor]].  In state-of-the-art processes, the gate dielectric is subject to many constraints, including:

* Electrically clean interface to the substrate (low density of [[quantum state]]s for electrons)
* High [[capacitance]], to increase the FET [[transconductance]]
* High thickness, to avoid [[dielectric breakdown]] and leakage by [[quantum tunneling]].

The capacitance and thickness constraints are almost directly opposed to each other.  For [[silicon]]-substrate FETs, the gate dielectric is almost always [[silicon dioxide]] (called "[[gate oxide]]"), since [[thermal oxidation|thermal]] oxide has a very clean interface.  However, the semiconductor industry is interested in finding alternative materials with higher dielectric constants, which would allow higher capacitance with the same thickness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4222">In the study of [[diffusion flame]], '''Liñán's equation''' is a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation which describes the inner structure of the diffusion flame, first derived by [[Amable Liñán]] in 1974&lt;ref&gt;Linan, A. (1974). The asymptotic structure of counterflow diffusion flames for large activation energies. Acta Astronautica, 1(7-8), 1007-1039.&lt;/ref&gt;. The equation reads as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{d\zeta^2} =(y^2-\zeta^2)e^{-\delta^{1/3}(y+\gamma \zeta)} &lt;/math&gt;

subjected to the boundary conditions

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\zeta\rightarrow -\infty : &amp;\quad \frac{dy}{d\zeta}=-1,\\
\zeta\rightarrow \infty : &amp;\quad \frac{dy}{d\zeta}=1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced or rescaled [[Damköhler numbers|Damköhler number]] and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of excess heat conducted to one side of the reaction sheet to the total heat generated in the reaction zone. If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, more heat is transported to the oxidizer side and if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then more heat is transported to the fuel side of the diffusion flame. 

The equation is, in some aspects, universal (also called as the canonical equation of the diffusion flame) since although Liñán derived the equation for [[stagnation point flow]], assuming unity [[Lewis number|Lewis numbers]] for the reactants, the same equation is found to represent the inner structure for general laminar flamelets&lt;ref&gt;Peters, N. (1983). Local quenching due to flame stretch and non-premixed turbulent combustion. Combustion Science and Technology, 30(1–6), 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, N. (1986). Laminar Flamelet concept in turbulent combustion Twenty-First Symposium (International) on Combustion-The Combustion Institute 1231.&lt;/ref&gt;, having arbitrary Lewis numbers&lt;ref&gt;Seshadri, K., &amp; Trevino, C. (1989). The influence of the Lewis numbers of the reactants on the asymptotic structure of counterflow and stagnant diffusion flames. Combustion science and technology, 64(4-6), 243-261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheatham, S., &amp; Matalon, M. (2000). A general asymptotic theory of diffusion flames with application to cellular instability. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 414, 105–144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liñán, A., Martínez-Ruiz, D., Vera, M., &amp; Sánchez, A. L. (2017). The large-activation-energy analysis of extinction of counterflow diffusion flames with non-unity Lewis numbers of the fuel. Combustion and Flame, 175, 91–106.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Near the extinction of the diffusion flame, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is order unity. The equation has no solution for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;\delta_E&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\delta_E&lt;/math&gt; is the extinction Damköhler number. For &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;\delta_E&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|\gamma|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the equation possess two solutions, of which one is an unstable solution. Unique solution exist if &lt;math&gt;|\gamma|&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;\delta_E&lt;/math&gt;.

Liñán also gave a correlation formula for the extinction Damköhler number, which is increasingly accurate for &lt;math&gt;1-\gamma \ll 0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_E = e[(1-\gamma)-(1-\gamma)^2+0.26(1-\gamma)^3 + 0.055(1-\gamma)^4].&lt;/math&gt;

==Large Damköhler number==
As &lt;math&gt;\delta\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{d\zeta^2} =(y^2-\zeta^2), \quad \zeta\rightarrow\pm\infty:\, \frac{dy}{d\zeta}=\pm 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This limit corresponds to the [[Burke–Schumann limit]]. An approximate solution to this equation was developed by Liñán himself using integral method in 1963 for his thesis&lt;ref&gt;Linan, A. (1963). On the Structure of Laminar Diffusion Flames. Caltech. https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/4833/1/Linan_a_1963.pdf  http://oa.upm.es/2108/2/LINAN_MONO_1963_01a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;y(\zeta)=\alpha + \zeta\operatorname{erf}(\beta \zeta) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi} \beta}\left[1-e^{-(\beta \zeta)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{erf}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[error function]] and 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha &amp;= \left[\frac{2}{\pi}(\sqrt{1+\pi}-1)\right]^{1/3} \approx 0.87,\\
\beta &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\alpha^2}{2}\approx 0.67.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''nor'easter''' (also '''northeaster'''; see [[#Etymology and usage|below]]) is a macro-scale [[extratropical cyclone]] in the western North Atlantic ocean. The name derives from the direction of the strongest winds that will be hitting an eastern seaboard of the northern hemisphere: as a cyclonic air mass rotates [[counterclockwise]], winds tend to blow northeast-to-southwest over the region covered by the northwest quadrant of the [[cyclone]]. Use of the term in North America is associated with storms that impact the middle and north Atlantic areas of the [[United States]], and in the Atlantic Provinces of [[Canada]]. 

Typically, such storms originate as a [[atmospheric pressure|low-pressure]] area that forms within {{convert|100|mi|km}} of the shore between [[North Carolina]] and [[Massachusetts]]. The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical storm]]s. Nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy [[rain]] or [[snow]], and can cause severe [[coastal flooding]], [[coastal erosion]], [[Beaufort Scale|hurricane-force]] winds, or [[Blizzard|blizzard conditions]]. Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in New England and [[Atlantic Canada]]. They thrive on converging air masses—the cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the water—and are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Multi-Community Environmental Storm Observatory|title=Nor'easters|year=2006|publisher=Multi-community Environmental Storm Observatory |url=http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009034304/http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noaafeature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/features/03_protecting/noreasters.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214123432/http://www.noaa.gov/features/03_protecting/noreasters.html|archivedate=February 14, 2016|title=Know the dangers of nor’easters|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="disc2"&gt;{{cite web|author=How stuff works|title=What are nor'easters?|year=2006|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2008|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question595.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor'easters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of November and March, although they can (much less commonly) develop during other parts of the year as well. The susceptible regions are generally impacted by nor'easters a few times each winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:Compass thumbnail.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Compass card (1607), featuring the spelling "Noreast"]]
The term ''nor'easter'' came to [[American English]] by way of [[British English]]. The earliest recorded uses of the contraction ''nor'' (for ''north'') in combinations such as ''nor'-east'' and ''nor-nor-west'', as reported by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', date to the late 16th century, as in John Davis's 1594 ''The Seaman's Secrets'': "Noreast by North raiseth a degree in sayling 24 leagues."&lt;ref&gt;"nor'-east, n., adj., and adv." [[OED]] Online. Oxford University Press, January 2018. Web. March 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling appears, for instance, on a [[Compass rose|compass card]] published in 1607. Thus, the manner of pronouncing from memory the 32 [[points of the compass]], known in maritime training as "boxing the compass", is described by Ansted&lt;ref&gt;Ansted. ''A Dictionary of Sea Terms'', Brown Son &amp; Ferguson, Glasgow, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; with pronunciations "Nor'east (or west)," "Nor' Nor'-east (or west)," "Nor'east b' east (or west)," and so forth. According to the OED, the first recorded use of the term "nor'easter" occurs in 1836 in a translation of [[Aristophanes]]. The term "nor'easter" naturally developed from the historical spellings and pronunciations of the compass points and the direction of wind or sailing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

As noted in a January 2006 editorial by William Sisson, editor of ''Soundings'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundingsonline.com |title=Featuring Boating News, Stories and More |publisher=Soundings Online |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; use of "nor'easter" to describe the storm system is common along the U.S. East Coast. Yet it has been asserted by linguist Mark Liberman (see below) that "nor'easter" as a contraction for "northeaster" has no basis in regional New England dialect; the [[Boston accent]] would elide the "R": ''no'theastuh'''.  He describes nor'easter as a "fake" word. However, this view neglects the little-known etymology and the historical maritime usage described above.

19th-century Downeast mariners pronounced the compass point "north northeast" as "no'nuth-east", and so on.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} For decades, Edgar Comee, of [[Brunswick, Maine]], waged a determined battle against use of the term "nor'easter" by the press, which usage he considered "a pretentious and altogether lamentable affectation" and "the odious, even loathsome, practice of landlubbers who would be seen as salty as the sea itself". His efforts, which included mailing hundreds of postcards, were profiled, just before his death at the age of 88, in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =McGrath | first =Ben | title =Nor’Easter | work =The New Yorker: Tsk-Tsk Dept. | publisher =Condé Nast | date =September 5, 2005 | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/05/050905ta_talk_mcgrath | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the efforts of Comee and others, use of the term continues by the press. According to ''Boston Globe'' writer [[Jan Freeman]], "from 1975 to 1980, journalists used the nor’easter spelling only once in five mentions of such storms; in the past year (2003), more than 80 percent of northeasters were spelled nor'easter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Freeman | first =Jan | title =Guys and dolls | work =Boston Globe: The Word | publisher =The New York Times Company | date =December 21, 2003 | url =http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/12/21/guys_and_dolls/ | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Pennsylvania]] linguistics professor [[Mark Liberman]] has pointed out that while the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples dating back to 1837, these examples represent the contributions of a handful of non-New England poets and writers. Liberman posits that "nor'easter" may have originally been a [[Syncope (phonology)|literary affectation]], akin to "e'en" for "even" and "th'only" for "the only", which is an indication in spelling that two syllables count for only one position in metered verse, with no implications for actual pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Liberman | first =Mark | title =Nor’Easter Considered Fake | work =Language Log | date =January 25, 2004 | url =http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000386.html | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite these assertions, the term can be found in the writings of New Englanders, and was frequently used by the press in the 19th century.

==Geography and formation characteristics==

[[File:Gulf Stream water temperature.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Surface temperature of the sea off the east coast of North America. The corridor in yellow gives the position of the Gulf Stream]]

===Formation===
Nor'easters develop in response to the sharp contrast in the warm [[Gulf Stream]] ocean current coming up from the tropical Atlantic and the cold air masses coming down from Canada. When the very cold and dry air rushes southward and meets up with the warm Gulf stream current, which is often near {{convert|70|F|C}} even in mid-winter, intense low pressure develops.

In the [[upper atmosphere]], the strong winds of the [[jet stream]] remove and replace rising air from the Atlantic more rapidly than the Atlantic air is replaced at lower levels; this and the [[Coriolis force]] help develop a strong storm. The storm tracks northeast along the East Coast, normally from North Carolina to Long Island, then moves toward the area east of [[Cape Cod]]. Counterclockwise winds around the [[low-pressure system]] blow the moist air over land. The relatively warm, moist air meets cold air coming southward from Canada. The low increases the surrounding pressure difference, which causes the very different air masses to collide at a faster speed. When the difference in temperature of the air masses is larger, so is the storm's instability, turbulence, and thus severity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name="disc1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Storm-E|title=Nor'easters|year=2007|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2008|url=http://www3.cet.edu/weather2/h17.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626044252/http://www3.cet.edu/weather2/h17.html|archivedate=June 26, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nor'easters taking the East Coast track usually indicates the presence of a [[High pressure|high-pressure]] area in the vicinity of [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="disc4"&gt;{{cite web|author = The Weather Channel|title = Nor'easters|year = 2007|publisher = [[The Weather Channel]]|accessdate = January 24, 2016|url = http://dw.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/noreast.html|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160408114440/http://dw.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/noreast.html|archivedate = April 8, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a nor'easter will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain (New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, etc.) and snow in New England (Boston northward). It can move slightly offshore, bringing a wet snow south of Boston to Richmond, Virginia, or even parts of the Carolinas.&lt;ref name="disc3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Multi-Community Environmental Storm Observatory|title=Nor'easters|year=2006|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2008 |url=http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009034304/http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a storm will rapidly intensify, tracking northward and following the topography of the East Coast, sometimes continuing to grow stronger during its entire existence. A nor'easter usually reaches its peak intensity while off the [[Canada|Canadian coast]]. The storm then reaches Arctic areas, and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]. It then meanders throughout the [[North Atlantic]] and can last for several weeks.&lt;ref name="disc3"/&gt;

===Characteristics===
Nor'easters are usually formed by an area of [[vorticity]] associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop. Such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms, a "parent storm", and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet stream.

Until the nor'easter passes, thick, dark, low-level clouds often block out the sun. Temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction. During a single storm, the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist. All precipitation types can occur in a nor'easter. High wind gusts, which can reach hurricane strength, are also associated with a nor'easter. On very rare occasions, such as in the [[Northeastern United States Blizzard of 1978|nor'easter in 1978]], [[North American blizzard of 2006]], and [[January 2018 North American blizzard]], the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a [[hurricane]] and have a small "dry slot" near the center, which can be mistaken for an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], although it is not an eye.

====Difference from tropical cyclones====
Often, people mistake nor'easters for [[tropical cyclones]] and do not differentiate between the two weather systems. Nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor'easters are cold-core low-pressure systems, meaning that they thrive on drastic changes in temperature of Canadian air and warm Atlantic waters.  Tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems, which means they thrive on purely warm temperatures.

====Difference from other extratropical storms====
A nor'easter is formed in a strong [[extratropical cyclone]], usually experiencing [[bombogenesis]]. While this formation occurs in many places around the world, nor'easters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds. Nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the Pacific Northeast (northern Japan and northwards) with winds from NW-N. In Europe, similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible; the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow, though NE winds can be strong.

===Geography===
The eastern United States, from [[North Carolina]] to Maine, and [[Eastern Canada]] can experience nor'easters, though most often they affect the areas from northern New Jersey northward. The effects of a nor'easter sometimes bring high surf and strong winds as far south as coastal [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Nor'easters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas, as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areas.

Biologists at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] on [[Cape Cod]] have determined nor'easters are an environmental factor for [[red tide]]s on the Atlantic coast.

|- valign=top
| [[Early February 2013 North American blizzard]]
| February 7–18, 2013
| An extremely powerful and historic nor'easter that dumped heavy snow and unleashed hurricane-force wind gusts across New England. Many areas received well over {{convert|2|ft|cm}} of snow, especially Connecticut, Rhode Island, and eastern Massachusetts. The highest amount recorded was {{convert|40|in|cm}} in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], and Gorham, Maine, received a record {{convert|35.5|in|cm}}. Over 700,000 people were left without power and travel in the region came to a complete standstill. On the afternoon of February 9, when the storm was pulling away from the Northeastern United States, a well defined eye was seen in the center. The eye feature was no longer there the next day and the storm quickly moved out to sea. The nor'easter later moved on to impact the [[United Kingdom]], before finally dissipating on February 20. The storm killed 18 people.
|- valign=top
| [[March 2013 nor'easter]]
| March 1–21, 2013
| A large and powerful nor'easter that ended up stalling along the eastern seaboard due to a blocking ridge of high pressure in [[Newfoundland]] and pivoted back heavy snow and strong winds into the Northeast United States for a period of 2 to 3 days. Many officials and residents were caught off guard as local weather stations predicted only a few inches (several centimeters) of snow and a change over to mostly rain. Contrary to local forecasts, many areas received over {{convert|1|ft|cm|spell=in}} of snow, with the highest amount being {{convert|29|in|cm}} in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Several schools across the region, particularly in the [[Boston, Massachusetts]], metropolitan area, remained in session during the height of the storm, not knowing the severity of the situation. Rough surf and rip currents were felt all the way southwards towards Florida's east coast.
|- valign=top
| [[January 2015 North American blizzard]]
| January 23–31, 2015
| Unlike recent historical winter storms, there was no indication that a storm of this magnitude was coming until about 3 days in advance. The [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|European computer model (ECMWF)]] first picked up on the potential for the nor'easter sometime before January 24. By the afternoon of January 24, most if not all major computer models were forecasting the storm to be much more severe than previously indicated earlier in the week. On the same day, the National Weather Service said they were aware about the potential for a major, crippling snowstorm but decided to hold off on winter weather headlines due to still being in the middle of another nor'easter. The Blizzard began as an [[Alberta Clipper]] in the Midwestern States, which was forecast to transfer its energy to a new, secondary Low Pressure off the coast of the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid Atlantic]] and move northeastward and pass to the south and east of New England. Before the transition began, most of the area was being affected by generally light snow on the morning and afternoon of January 26. It wasn't until the evening into the early morning hours of January 27, that the storm was forecast to begin rapid deepening, stall, and also do a loop. It did stall for a time, however, the loop of the storm that was forecast did not happen. Due to this the storm began to slowly pull away to the northeast, a little quicker than expected. Contrary to local forecasts, western portions of the area, including western Connecticut and New York City only receiving a general {{convert|4|to|6|in|cm}} of snow, with a maximum of {{convert|9|in|cm}} recorded at [[Central Park]]. Further to the east, the storm brought over {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow to much of the area, with several reports of over {{convert|30|in|cm}} across the State of Massachusetts, breaking many records. A maximum of {{convert|36|in|cm}} was recorded in at least four towns across [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] in Massachusetts and the city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] itself received {{convert|34.5|in|cm}}, marking the city's largest storm snowfall accumulation on record. The city of Boston recorded {{convert|24.6|in|cm}}, making it the largest storm snowfall accumulation during the month of January and the city's sixth largest storm snowfall accumulation on record. On the coast of Massachusetts, Hurricane Force gusts up to around {{cvt|80|mph|km/h}} along with sustained winds between {{cvt|50|and|55|mph|km/h}} at times, were reported. The storm also caused severe coastal flooding and [[storm surge]]. The storm bottomed out to a central pressure of {{cvt|970|mb}}. By January 28, the storm began to pull away from the area.
|- valign=top
| [[October 2015 North American storm complex]] 
| September 29 – October 2, 2015
| In early October, a low pressure system formed in the Atlantic, Tapping into moisture from [[Hurricane Joaquin]], the storm dumped a huge amount of rain, mostly in [[South Carolina]].
|- valign=top
| [[January 2016 United States blizzard]] (also known as Winter Storm Jonas, Snowzilla, or The Blizzard of 2016 by media outlets)
| January 19–29, 2016
| This system dumped {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm}} of snow in the East Coast of the United States. States of Emergencies were declared in 12 States in advance of the storm as well as by the Mayor of [[Washington D.C.]]. The blizzard also caused significant storm surge in New Jersey and Delaware that was equal to or worse than Hurricane Sandy. Sustained damaging winds over {{cvt|50|mph|km/h}} were recorded in many coastal communities, with a maximum gust to {{cvt|85|mph|km/h}} on [[Assateague Island]], Virginia. A total of 55 people died due to the storm.
|- valign=top
| [[February 2017 United States blizzard]] (also known as Winter Storm Niko and The Blizzard of 2017 by media outlets)
| February 6–11, 2017
| Forming as an Alberta clipper in the northern United States on February 6, the system initially produced light snowfall from the Midwest to the Ohio Valley as it tracked southeastwards. It eventually reached the East Coast of the United States on February 9 and began to rapidly grow into a powerful nor'easter, dumping {{convert|1|to|2|ft|cm}} across the Northeast Megapolis. The storm also produced prolific thunder and lightning across [[Southern New England]]. Prior to the blizzard, unprecedented and record-breaking warmth had enveloped the region, with record highs of above {{cvt|60|F|C}} recorded in several areas, including Central Park in New York City. Some were caught off guard by the warmth and had little time to prepare for the snowstorm.
|- valign=top
| October 2017 nor'easter
| October 28–31, 2017
| An extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Philippe (2017)#Preparations and impact|Tropical Storm Philippe]]. The combined systems became an extremely powerful nor'easter that wreaked havoc across the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada. The storm produced sustained tropical storm force winds along with hurricane force wind gusts. The highest wind gust recorded was {{cvt|93|mph|km/h}} in [[Popponesset, Massachusetts]]. The storm caused over 1,400,000 power outages. Damage across New England, especially in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, was extreme. This was due to the combination of the high winds, heavy rainfall, saturated ground, and most trees still being fully leaved. Autumn foliage in parts of northern New England was removed from the landscape in a matter of hours due to high winds. Some residents in Connecticut were without power for nearly a week following the storm. Heavy rain in [[Quebec]] and [[Eastern Ontario]], with up to {{cvt|98|mm|in}} in the Canadian capital region of [[Ottawa]], greatly interfered with transportation.
|- valign=top
| [[January 2018 North American blizzard]] 
| January 2–6, 2018
| A powerful blizzard that caused severe disruption along the East Coast of the United States and Canada. It dumped snow and ice in places that rarely receive wintry precipitation, even in the winter, such as Florida and Georgia, and produced snowfall accumulations of over 2 feet (61 cm) in the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and Atlantic Canada. The storm originated on January 3 as an area of low pressure off the coast of the Southeast. Moving swiftly to the northeast, the storm explosively deepened while moving parallel to the Eastern Seaboard, causing significant snowfall accumulations. The storm received various unofficial names, such as Winter Storm Grayson, Blizzard of 2018 and Storm Brody. The storm was also dubbed a "historic bomb cyclone", with a minimum central pressure of 948 mb, similar to that of a Category 3 or 4 hurricane 
|- valign=top
| [[March 1-3, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Riley or False Tropical Storm Riley by media outlets)
| March 1–5, 2018
| A very powerful nor'easter that caused major impacts in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. It originated as the northernmost low of a stationary front over the Midwest on March 1, which moved eastward into the Northeast later that night. A new low pressure system rapidly formed off the coast on March 2 as it slowly meandered near the coastline. It peaked later that day and began to gradually move out to sea by March 3. Producing over 2 feet (24 in) of snow in some areas, it was one of the most significant March snowstorms in many areas, particularly in Upstate New York. In other areas, it challenged storm surge records set by other significant storms, such as Hurricane Sandy. It also produced widespread damaging winds, with gusts well over Hurricane force strength in some areas across Eastern New England as well as on the back side in the Mid-Atlantic via a [[sting jet]]. Over 2.2 million customers were left without power.
|- valign=top
| [[March 6-8, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Quinn by media outlets) 
| March 2–9, 2018
| A powerful nor'easter that affected the Northeast United States. It came just days after [[March 1-3, 2018 nor'easter|another nor'easter]] devastated much of the Northeast. Frequent cloud to ground [[Thundersnow]] as well as snowfall rates of up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) an hour were reported in areas around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-State Area]], signaling the rapid intensification of the storm. Late in the afternoon, an eye-like feature was spotted near the center of the storm. It dumped over 2 feet of snow in many areas across the Northeast, including many areas in [[New England]] where the predominant precipitation type was rain for the previous storm. Over 1 million power outages were reported at the height of the storm due to the weight of the heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines. Many people who lost power in the previous storm found themselves in the dark again.
|- valign=top
| [[2017–18 North American winter#March nor'easters|March 12–14, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Skylar by media outlets) 
| March 11–14, 2018
| A powerful nor'easter that affected portions of the Northeast United States. The storm underwent [[Explosive cyclogenesis|rapid intensification]] with a central [[Millibar|millibaric pressure]] dropping down from 1001 mb to 974 mb in just 24 hours. This was the third major storm to strike the area within a period of 11 days. The storm dumped over up 2 feet of snow and brought Hurricane force wind gusts to portions of Eastern New England. Hundreds of public school districts including, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] were closed on Tuesday, March 13.
|-valign=top 
| [[March 20–22, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Toby and Four'easter by media outlets)
| March 20–22, 2018  
| A powerful nor'easter that became the fourth major nor'easter to affect the Northeast United States in a period of less than three weeks. It caused a [[List of United States tornadoes from January to March 2018|severe weather outbreak]] over the Southern United States on March 19 before moving off of the [[North Carolina]] coast on March 20 and spreading freezing rain and snow into the Mid-Atlantic States after shortly dissipating later that night. A new low pressure center then formed off of [[Chesapeake Bay]] on March 21 and then became the primary nor'easter. Dry air prevented most of the precipitation from reaching the ground in areas in [[New England]] such as [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], all of which received little to no accumulation, in contrast with what local forecasts had originally predicted. In [[Islip, New York]] at the height of the storm, snowfall rates of up to 5 inches per hour were reported. 8 inches was reported at [[Central Park]] and over 12 inches was reported in many locations on [[Long Island]] as well in and around [[New York City]] and in parts of [[New Jersey]]. Over 100,000 customers lost power at the peak of the storm, mostly due to the weight of the heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines, with a majority of the outages being in New Jersey.

| A rare summertime nor'easter that developed off the coast of North Carolina along the [[warm front]] of a powerful upper level low during July 21 and retrograded to the west into Delaware and Pennsylvania then rapidly weakened in [[Upstate New York]] on the morning of July 22. An extremely rare summertime [[Wind Advisory]] was issued for parts of New Jersey, New York City, Long Island, and Connecticut. The storm produced strong to damaging winds that created [[tropical storm]] conditions for much of New Jersey, New York City, and Long Island. The western side of the storm also brought excessive rainfall and extensive flooding in several metropolitan areas in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] while the tail of the storm channeled a huge moisture feed into [[Southern New England]] along with the threat for [[waterspouts]] and [[tornadoes]], though none were reported.

| An early season nor'easter that developed along the Gulf Coast near [[Louisiana]] and trekked northeastward then northward into [[Long Island]] and [[Southern New England]]. It formed on October 25th and absorbed the remnant moisture from [[Hurricane Willa]]. It brought severe weather along the [[Gulf Coast]], [[Florida]], and the [[Carolinas]], though only minor instances were reported. The nor'easter intensified on October 26th and the morning of October 27th, before becoming [[Occluded front|occluded]] and moving inland late on the 27th. The storm brought strong to damaging winds for many coastal areas in the Northeast as well as moderate to major coastal flooding for [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], and parts of [[Connecticut]], with levels coming close to what was experienced during [[Hurricane Sandy]], especially in western parts of [[Long Island Sound]]. The storm was also responsible for an early season snow to parts of [[Upstate New York]] and [[Northern New England]]. Accumulations were minor.

The '''North West Regional Assembly''' ('''NWRA''')  was the [[regional chamber]] for the [[North West England]] region of the [[England]]. It was based at [[Wigan]], in [[Greater Manchester]]. It was abolished in July 2008.

==Creation and functions==

The assembly was created  by the '''Regional Development Agencies Act 1998'''. The first meeting was held in 1999. In July 2003 the assembly was reconstituted to combine its existing functions with those of the regional arm of the [[Local Government Association]] and of the Regional Employers Organisation.

The NWRA acted as the representative voice of the region and  worked to promote the economic, environmental and social well-being of the North West of England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Dl1/Directories/DG_10012119 North West Regional Assembly : Directgov - Directories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The key functions of the assembly were:

*Co-ordinate the public expenditure of local authorities
*Act as regional planning body
*Scrutinise the work of the [[Northwest Regional Development Agency]]

==Abolition==

Following criticism of the [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]], it was proposed in July 2007 that they will be axed, losing their role by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6903108.stm BBC NEWS | Politics | Regional assemblies will be axed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A regional leaders forum known as '''[[4NW']]'' was established on 15 July 2008 and the NWRA ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwrpb.org.uk/ NWRA :: Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
Membership of the NWRA was not by direct election. The NWRA represented the interests of [[Cumbria]], [[Cheshire]], [[Lancashire]], [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]] and had '''80 members''' nominated by [[Local government in England|Local Authorities]], business, trade unions, further and higher education, environmental interests, and the voluntary, cultural and community sectors including sport and tourism.

Jensen |isbn=0-201-62731-0 |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Nuclear matter''' is an idealized system of interacting nucleons ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) that exists in several [[phase (matter)|phase]]s that as yet are not fully established.&lt;ref name=Durand&gt;

{{cite book |title=Nuclear dynamics in the nucleonic regime |author=Dominique Durand |author2=Eric Suraud |author3=Bernard Tamain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9obAY54qb30C&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |isbn=0-7503-0537-1 |date=2001 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is ''not'' matter in a nucleus, but a hypothetical substance consisting of a huge number of protons and neutrons interacting by only [[nuclear force]]s and ''no'' [[Coulomb force]]s.&lt;ref name=Mattuck&gt;

{{cite book |title=A Guide to Feynman Diagrams in the Many-body Problem |author=Richard D. Mattuck |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pe-v8zfxE68C&amp;pg=PA92 |isbn=0-486-67047-3 |date=1992 |publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]] |edition=Reprint of  1974 McGraw-Hill second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walecka&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Volume and the number of particles are infinite, but the ratio is finite.&lt;ref name=Hofmann&gt;

{{cite book |title=The Physics of Warm Nuclei: With Analogies to Mesoscopic Systems |author=Helmut Hofmann |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIX5bIkQks0C&amp;pg=PA36 |page=36 |date=2008 |isbn=0-19-850401-2 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite volume implies no surface effects and translational invariance (only differences in position matter, not absolute positions).

A common idealization is ''symmetric nuclear matter'', which consists of equal numbers of protons and neutrons, with no electrons.

When nuclear matter is compressed to sufficiently high density, it is expected, on the basis of the [[asymptotic freedom]] of [[Quantum chromodynamics]], that it will become [[quark matter]], which is a degenerate Fermi gas of quarks.&lt;ref name=Alford&gt;

{{cite book |editor= Armen Sedrakian |editor2= John Walter Clark |editor3= Mark Gower Alford |chapter=Phase diagram of neutral quark matter at moderate densities |title=Pairing in fermionic systems |author=Stefan B Rüster |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlW_DXqKvLUC&amp;pg=PA19 |isbn=981-256-907-3 |date=2007 |publisher=World Scientific}}

Some authors use "nuclear matter" in a broader sense, and refer to the model described above as "infinite nuclear matter",&lt;ref name=Siemens/&gt; and consider it as a "toy model", a testing ground for analytical techniques.&lt;ref name="Müther"&gt;

{{cite book |title=Nuclear methods and the nuclear equation of state |editor=Marcello Baldo |chapter=Dirac-Brueckner approach for finite nuclei |author=Herbert Müther |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3xeCXHJq6wC&amp;pg=PA170 |page=170 |isbn=981-02-2165-7 |publisher=World Scientific |date=1999}}

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the composition of a [[neutron star]], which requires more than neutrons and protons, is not necessarily locally charge neutral, and does not exhibit translation invariance, often is differently referred to, for example, as ''neutron star matter'' or ''stellar matter'' and is considered distinct from nuclear matter.&lt;ref name=Raduta&gt;

'''Pedicar''' was a pedal powered quadricycle [[velomobile]] developed in 1973 by the Environmental Trans-Sport Corporation in [[Windsor, Connecticut]].

== Background ==
The Pedicar had a seat and an enclosed body with one door.   The vehicle was propelled by a unique linear cable [[Drivetrain|drive train]] with five forward and one reverse gear.   The four wheels were standard [[Bicycle wheel|bicycle wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=People+powered+vehicle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vpsQUaDtL8SIrAHVloGAAw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=People%20powered%20vehicle&amp;f=false|title=Pedal cars: the gasless way to go|last=Galleger|first=Sheldon M.|date=May 1974|work=Popular Mechanics|page=98|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle was designed by Robert L. Bundschuh, a 38 year old ex-[[Gyrodyne]] aircraft engineer and his coworker, Lionel Martin, in 1972.  They produced 20 models which sold for $500 in 1973. Flyers and tv commercials were produced.&lt;ref name="Pedicar Commercial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvh44wzhw9c|title="Pedicar" Роберта Бундшуха|first=|last=Алексей Перижняк|date=24 March 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being marketed as a replacement for an automobile during the ongoing [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and being fully enclosed from the weather, the Pedicar was not as commercially successful as the contemporary [[People Powered Vehicle]] and manufacturing issues prevented a contract with the [[United States Army|US Army]] from being completed.&lt;ref name="pedicar tech"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lefthandedcyclist.blogspot.com/2012/04/pedicar-technology.html|title=The Left-handed Cyclist: Pedicar Technology|first=|last=Hephaestus|date=8 April 2012|website=lefthandedcyclist.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Petroleum University of Technology''' ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه صنعت نفت}}) is a leading Iranian [[Public university|public]] university funded by the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] particularly by its main company, the [[National Iranian Oil Company|NIOC]] . It was  founded in 1939 in [[Abadan]] in response to the increasing industrialization of Iran oil company, and is officially the second oldest university in Iran after [[University of Tehran]]&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt; and based on The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR), this university has the 7th worldwide rank in oil an gas sector and petroleum engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://cwur.org/2017/subjects.php#Engineering, Petroleum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|sure=n|reason=Reference is not a reliable website and there is no prove for the claim there.|date=September 2017}} It offers [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], [[Master of Science|M.S]] and [[Doctorate]] programs for upstream and downstream oil and gas industry such as [[petroleum engineering]], [[chemical engineering]],  [[offshore  engineering]],  [[instrumentation engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[accounting]], and [[marine engineering]].

It has four campuses in [[Ahwaz]], [[Abadan]], [[Tehran]] and [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] and some research centers.

== History ==
[[File:نمای ورود دانشکده.jpg|thumb|Ahwaz Petroleum University of Technology]]

[[File:Abadan Petroleum University.jpg|thumb|Abadan Institute of Technology in 1939]]
The name of the university has been changed several times. The university was established in 1939 in [[Abadan]] as '''Abadan Technical School'''. The academic program comprised working and studying in sequence. The students (if employed) spent two-fifth of the academic program in the school and three-fifth in the '''Abadan Refinery''' ({{lang-fa|پالايشگاه آبادان}} ''Pālāyeshgāh-e Ābādān'') as trainees.&lt;ref name="put history"/&gt;

In 1956, the name was changed to '''Abadan Technical College'''. By then, the educational program focused on the general engineering major; admissions were given to 4th grade high school students after passing an entry test and interviews. The last admissions of the program were granted in 1961 and the last students graduated in 1961.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

In 1962, the name changed to  '''Abadan Institute of Technology''' (AIT). The programs offered [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degrees in petroleum engineering, economic and administrative sciences and accounting. The programs was still internship-orientated.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the outbreak of the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], the university was relocated. It was first moved to [[Gachsaran County|Gachsaran]] in 1981. The universities all over the country reopened in December 1982 and the university moved to the current location of Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in [[Kut-e Abdollah]], [[Karun, Khuzestan|Karun County]].&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

After the [[Iran–Iraq War|War]], in 1989, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education granted permission to found the Petroleum University of Technology. All the educational institutions of the [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]] are supervised by the university. [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)|Ministry of Petroleum]], then founded the '''Abadan Shahid Tondghuyan Faculty of Chemical and Petrochemical Engineering''' or Abadan Faculty of Petroleum in {{date|February 1992}} in the location of the former Abadan Institute of Technology and The Research Center of Petroleum University of Technology in the campus of the current Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum in 1993.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

== Today==
As of 2015, the Petroleum University of Technology consists of four faculties in cities that offer 13 [[undergraduate]], 11 [[graduate school|graduate]] and three [[doctorate]] programs:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Ahwaz), 
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum (or PUT Abadan),
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum ([[N.I.O.C. school of Accounting and Finance ]]) (or PUT Tehran),
* [[Mahmudabad, Mazandaran|Mahmudabad]] Faculty of Marine Sciences (or PUT Mahmudabad).&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

The university has four research centers:
* Ahwaz Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Abadan Faculty of Petroleum Research Center;
* Tehran Faculty of Petroleum Research Center and,
* Mahmudabad Faculty of Marine Sciences Offshore Oil &amp; Gas Industries Research Center.&lt;ref name="put history" /&gt;

==Roles and goals==
The priorities of the PUT are maintaining the resources of oil and gas in the country and training manpower for the development and exploitation of these resources.

== Students ==
According to the results of M.S. [[Iranian University Entrance Exam|Entrance Examinations]], PUT students are the best among other universities like [[Sharif University of Technology]] and [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] in Petroleum and Chemical Engineering, and Accounting . The university has sent some of its students to the  [[University of Calgary]], [[Curtin University of Technology]] and [[French Institute of Petroleum]] (IFP).

A student has won the bronze medal of the 9th South Eastern European Mathematical Olympiad for University Students (SEEMOUS 2015) that took place in [[Ohrid]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], from March 3–8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=افتخارآفرینی دانشجوی دانشگاه صنعت نفت در المپیاد جهانی ریاضی|url=http://www.shana.ir/fa/newsagency/236898/%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A2%D9%81%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%AC%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%AA-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B6%DB%8C|accessdate=13 September 2015|work=شبکه اطلاع‌رسایی نفت و انرژی|agency=شانا|date=March 10, 2015|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This granite, from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] side of the [[Mont Blanc]] massif, has large white [[plagioclase]] phenocrysts, [[triclinic]] [[mineral]]s that give [[trapezoid]] shapes when cut through). [[1 euro coins|1 euro coin]] ([[diameter]] 2.3 cm) for scale.]]

A '''phenocryst''' is an early forming, relatively large and usually conspicuous [[crystal]] distinctly larger than the grains of the rock [[Matrix (geology)|groundmass]] of an [[igneous]] rock. Such rocks that have a distinct difference in the size of the crystals are called [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyries]], and the adjective [[porphyritic]] is used to describe them.  Phenocrysts often have [[euhedral]] forms, either due to early growth within a [[magma]], or by post-emplacement [[recrystallization (geology)|recrystallization]]. Normally the term  ''phenocryst'' is not used unless the crystals are directly observable, which is sometimes stated as greater than .5 millimeter in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;The minimum size boundary is arbitrary and not precise.  It is based upon observation and may vary depending upon whether technical aids, such as a hand lens or a microscope are used or not. One analyst used a 100 [[Micrometre|µm]] limit on the size of crystals as that was the minimum that could be point-counted accurately by optical means. {{Cite journal|author1=Murphy, M.

Phenocrysts are more often found in the lighter (higher silica) igneous rocks such as [[felsite]]s and [[andesite]]s, although they occur throughout the igneous spectrum including in the [[ultramafic]]s. The largest crystals found in some [[pegmatite]]s are often phenocrysts being significantly larger than the other minerals.

==Analysis using phenocrysts==
Geologists use phenocrysts to help determine rock origins and transformations, as when and whether crystals form depends on pressure and on temperature.

===Other characteristics===
[[Plagioclase]] phenocrysts often exhibit zoning with a more [[calcium|calcic]] core surrounded by progressively more [[sodium|sodic]] rinds.

In shallow [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]]s or [[volcanic]] flows phenocrysts which formed before eruption or shallow emplacement are surrounded by a fine-grained to [[glass]]y [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. These volcanic phenocrysts often show flow banding, a parallel arrangement of [[lath]]-shaped crystals. These characteristics provide clues to the rocks' origins. Similarly, intragranular microfractures and any intergrowth among crystals provide additional clues.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''pigeon pea''' ('''''Cajanus cajan''''') is a perennial [[legume]] from the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Fabaceae]]. Since its [[domestication]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common [[food]] in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is consumed on a large scale mainly in [[south Asia]] and is a major source of [[protein]] for the population of the Indian subcontinent.

==Common names==
The pigeon pea is known by numerous names in various languages around the world. Since there are many languages in the [[Indian subcontinent]], there is a plethora of names used for this legume in that region.

== Origins ==
[[File:Cajanus cajan.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Pigeon pea is a perennial which can grow into a small tree.]]
[[File:Cajanus cajan MHNT.BOT.2015.2.47.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Cajanus cajan'' – [[MHNT]]]]

The cultivation of the pigeon pea goes back at least 3,500 years. The centre of origin is probably peninsular India, where the closest wild relatives (''Cajanus cajanifolia'') occur in tropical deciduous woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Maeson, L. J. G. (1995). "Pigeonpea ''Cajanus cajan''", pp. 251–5 in Smartt, J. and Simmonds, N. W. (eds.), ''Evolution of Crop Plants.

==Cultivation==
Today, pigeon pea is widely cultivated in all tropical and semitropical regions of both the [[Old World|Old]] and the New Worlds.

World production of pigeon peas is estimated at 4.49 million tons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 63% of this production comes from India. Africa is the secondary centre of diversity and at present it contributes about 21% of global production with 1.05 million tons. Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda are the major producers in Africa.

The total number of hectares grown to pigeon pea is estimated at 5.4 million.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; India accounts for 72% of area grown to pigeon pea or 3.9 million hectares.

Pigeon pea is an important [[legume]] crop of rainfed agriculture in the semiarid tropics. The Indian subcontinent, eastern Africa and Central America, in that order, are the world's three main pigeon pea-producing regions. Pigeon peas are cultivated in more than 25 tropical and subtropical countries, either as a sole crop or intermixed with [[cereal]]s, such as [[sorghum]] (''Sorghum bicolor''), [[pearl millet]] (''Pennisetum glaucum''), or [[maize]] (''Zea mays''), or with other legumes, such as [[peanut]]s (''Arachis hypogaea''). Being a legume capable of [[symbiosis]] with [[Rhizobia]], the bacteria associated with the pigeon pea enrich soils through symbiotic [[nitrogen fixation]].

Pigeon peas can be of a perennial variety, in which the crop can last three to five years (although the seed yield drops considerably after the first two years), or an annual variety more suitable for seed production.

The crop is cultivated on marginal land by resource-poor farmers, who commonly grow traditional medium- and long-duration (5–11 months) [[landrace]]s. Short-duration pigeon peas (3–4 months) suitable for multiple cropping have recently been developed. Traditionally, the use of such input as fertilizers, weeding, irrigation, and pesticides is minimal, so present yield levels are low (average = 700&amp;nbsp;kg/ha). Greater attention is now being given to managing the crop because it is in high demand at remunerative prices.

Pigeon peas are very drought-resistant and can be grown in areas with less than 650&amp;nbsp;mm annual rainfall. With the maize crop failing three out of five years in drought-prone areas of [[Kenya]], a consortium led by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] (ICRISAT) aimed to promote the pigeon pea as a drought-resistant, nutritious alternative crop. Successive projects encouraged commercialization of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialization of the pigeon pea is now enabling farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.

[[John Spence (scientist)|John Spence]], a [[botanist]] and politician from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], developed several varieties of dwarf pigeon peas which can be harvested by machine, instead of by hand.&lt;ref name="niherst"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.niherst.gov.tt/icons/tt-icons-1/69-john-spence.htm|title=John Spence (1929) Plant Pathologist|last=|first=|date=|work=[[National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology]]|accessdate=2015-02-24|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seeds and Chafe==
===Dehulling methods=== 
Dehulling pigeon peas is an age old practice in India. In earlier days hand pounding was common. Several traditional methods are used, that can be broadly classified under two categories:

====Wet Method==== 
Involves water soaking, sun drying and dehulling.

====Dry Method==== 
Involves oil/water application, drying in the sun, and dehulling. Depending on the magnitude of operation, large scale commercial dehulling of large quantities of pigeon pea into its deskinned, split version known as toor [[dal]] in Hindi, is done in mechanically operated mills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikisan.com/tg-redgram-harvesting-storage.html ''Harvesting And Storage'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 ''Pigeonpea in Eastern and Southern Africa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718193632/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 |date=2014-07-18 }}, [[ICRISAT]] Posted 10 October 2012.

Pigeon peas are both a food crop (dried peas, flour, or green vegetable peas) and a forage/cover crop. In combination with [[cereals]], pigeon peas make a well-balanced meal and hence are favoured by nutritionists as an essential ingredient for balanced diets. The dried peas may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor different from the green or dried peas. Sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon peas via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried peas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ja06052 "Effect of Sprouting on invitro digestibility of some locally consumed leguminous seeds".] ''Journal of Applied Sciences and Environmental Management''. Vol. 10, Num. 3, 2006, pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, split pigeon peas, called ''tur'' (तूर) in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], ''toor [[dal]]'' (तूर दाल) or 'arhar' (अरहर) in [[Hindi]] and ''arehar ki dal'' in Urdu, ''kandhi pappu'' (కంది పప్పు) in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], ''thuvara parippa'' in Kerala and ''thuvaram paruppu'' in Tamil Nadu, ''togari bele'' in [[Kannada]] are one of the most popular [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]], being an important source of protein in a mostly vegetarian diet. In regions where it grows, fresh young pods are eaten as a vegetable in dishes such as [[Sambar (dish)|''sambar'']]. Whole pigeon peas are called ''arhar dal'' in [[Hindi]]. In [[Ethiopia]], not only the pods, but also the young shoots and leaves are cooked and eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Zemede Asfaw, [http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Web_version/500/ch08.htm "Conservation and use of traditional vegetables in Ethiopia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707210646/http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/Web_version/500/ch08.htm |date=2012-07-07 }}, ''Proceedings of the IPGRI International Workshop on Genetic Resources of Traditional Vegetables in Africa'' (Nairobi, 29–31 August 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shelling pigeonpeas, Kenya.jpg|thumb|right|Kenyans shelling pigeon peas]]
In some places, such as the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Panama]] and Hawaii, pigeon peas are grown for canning and consumption. A dish made of rice and green pigeon peas (called ''moro de guandules'') is a traditional food in the Dominican Republic. Pigeon peas are also made as a stew, with [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] balls. In [[Puerto Rico]], ''[[arroz con gandules]]'' is made with [[rice]] and pigeon peas and is a traditional dish, especially during Christmas season. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Grenada]] have their own variant, called ''[[pelau]]'', which includes either beef or chicken, and occasionally pumpkin and pieces of cured pig tail. In the Atlantico department of Colombia the [[sopa de guandú con carne salada]] (or simply "gandules") is made with pigeon peas.

Unlike in some other parts of the Greater Caribbean, in [[The Bahamas]] the light brown colored dried seeds of the pigeon pea plant are used (instead of the fresh green pigeon peas used elsewhere) to make the heartier, heavier, signature Bahamian staple dish "Peas 'n Rice." A slab of partially cubed or diced pork "fatback" lard with skin on (bacon is a common substitute), diced onions and sweet pepper, and a mixture of spices are all sauteed in the bottom of a deep pot. Tomatoes and tomato paste are added.  Then water is added along with the peas and rice, and slow boiled until tender. The dish becomes a medium-dark brown color, resulting from absorbing the colors of the browned initial ingredients and the cooked tomato paste. The pigeon peas themselves absorb the same, becoming a much darker brown, providing some contrast while still complementing the distinctive "browned" theme of the dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trubahamianfoodtours.com/bites-of-nassau-food-tour/bahamian-must-eats-peas-n-rice/|title=Tru Bahamian Must Eats: Peas &amp; Rice|website=Tru Bahamian Food Tours|accessdate=12 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042143/http://trubahamianfoodtours.com/bites-of-nassau-food-tour/bahamian-must-eats-peas-n-rice/|archivedate=12 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]], pigeon peas are grown as a host for [[scale insect]]s which produce [[lac]], the key ingredient in [[shellac]].

Pigeon peas are in some areas an important crop for [[green manure]], providing up to 90&amp;nbsp;kg nitrogen per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adu-Gyamfi|first=Joseph J.|last2=Myaka|first2=Fidelis A.|last3=Sakala|first3=Webster D.|last4=Odgaard|first4=Rie|last5=Vesterager|first5=Jens M.|last6=Jensen|first6=Henning Høgh|date=2007|title=Biological nitrogen fixation and nitrogen and phosphorus budgets in farmer-managed intercrops of maize-pigeonpea in semi-arid southern and eastern Africa|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/biological-nitrogen-fixation-and-nitrogen-and-phosphorus-budgets-in-farmermanaged-intercrops-of-maizepigeonpea-in-semiarid-southern-and-eastern-africa(b07bde3a-e748-48a5-a1ff-730beb4bd900).html|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=295|issue=1–2|pages=127–136|doi=10.1007/s11104-007-9270-0|issn=0032-079X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woody stems of pigeon peas can also be used as firewood, fencing and thatch.

It is an important ingredient of animal feed used in West Africa, especially in Nigeria, where it is also grown. Leaves, pods, seeds and the residues of seed processing are used to feed all kinds of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Delagarde R., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2017.

==Genome sequence==
The pigeon pea is the first seed legume plant to have its complete genome sequenced. The sequencing was first accomplished by a group of 31 Indian scientists from the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]]. It was then followed by a global research partnership, the International Initiative for Pigeonpea Genomics (IIPG), led by [[ICRISAT]] with partners such as BGI–Shenzhen (China), US research laboratories like University of Georgia, University of California-Davis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and National Centre for Genome Resources, European research institutes like the National University of Ireland Galway. It also received support from the CGIAR Generation Challenge Programme, US National Science Foundation and in-kind contribution from the collaborating research institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icrisat.org/newsroom/latest-news/happenings/happenings1492.htm#1| title=ICRISAT-led global team cracks pigeonpea genome|accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n1/abs/nbt.2022.html|title=Draft genome sequence of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), an orphan legume crop of resource-poor farmers|accessdate=2014-12-21 | volume=30|doi=10.1038/nbt.2022|pmid=22057054|date=January 2012|journal=Nat.

Pigeon peas contain high levels of [[protein]] and the important [[amino acid]]s [[methionine]], [[lysine]], and [[tryptophan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4369/2 "Nutrition Facts and Analysis for Pigeon peas (red gram), mature seeds, raw"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table indicates completeness of nutritional profile of various amino acids within mature seeds of pigeon pea.

As can be seen from the table above, Methionine+Cystine combination is the only limiting amino acid combination in pigeon pea. In contrast to the mature seeds, the immature seeds are generally lower in all nutritional values, however they contain a significant amount of vitamin C (39&amp;nbsp;mg per 100 g serving) and have a slightly higher fat content.  Research has shown that the protein content of the immature seeds is of a higher quality.&lt;ref name="PMID 363219"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bressani R, Gómez-Brenes RA, Elías LG. |title=Nutritional quality of pigeon pea protein, immature and ripe, and its supplementary value for cereals |journal=Arch Latinoam Nutr  |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=108–16 |year=1986 |pmid=3632193 |last2=Hobart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1.055 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s (1.055 exajoules or EJ) in [[SI]] units.

The unit is used by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] in discussing world and national energy budgets.  &lt;!-- Not just in the US? --&gt; The [[World energy consumption|global primary energy production]] in 2004 was 446 quad, equivalent to 471 EJ.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Renewable energy in Uruguay''' is the use of [[renewable energy]] primarily for [[electricity generation]] in [[Uruguay]].

Uruguay is notable for its use of renewable energies, which provide 94.5% of the country’s electricity and 55% of the country's total [[energy mix]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy |title=Uruguay makes dramatic shift to nearly 95% electricity from clean energy|publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay has already developed all its potential for large [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects. Existing plants are Terra (152 MW), Baygorria (108 MW), Constitución (333 MW) and the bi-national [[Salto Grande Dam|Salto Grande]], with a total capacity of 1,890 MW.

[[Wind power]] is experiencing a boom recently. [[Biomass]] and [[solar power]] have also been ramped up. This is further helping the country slash its [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt;

Heating is another spectrum where the use of [[renewable resource]]s is being implemented. [[Firewood]] is mostly used for home heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/lenerias-compiten-madera-multinacionales-celulosa.html Firewood in Uruguay] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12851">In [[science fiction]], a '''shrink ray''' is any device which uses [[energy]] to reduce the physical size of [[matter]]. Many are also capable of enlarging items as well.

==Scientific ==
Science fiction writer and [[polymath]] [[Isaac Asimov]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Peary, D ed. (1984). ''Omni's Screen Flights, Screen Fantasies'' Doubleday {{ISBN|0-385-19199-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Miniaturization doesn't actually make sense unless you miniaturize the very atoms of which matter is composed.  Otherwise a tiny brain in a man the size of an insect, composed of normal atoms, is composed of too few atoms for the miniaturized man to be any more intelligent than the ant.  Also, miniaturizing atoms is impossible according to the rules of quantum mechanics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Depending on how those atoms were supposed to have been miniaturized, the man might or might not also weigh as much as he originally had; an observation that has been used to various effect over the years that [[Henry Pym]] has been featuring in comic books.

The problems of the miniaturized human do not stop there, however.  Basic geometry governs such things as the relationship between cross-section, volume, and surface area. It may be impossible for a one-inch high human to kill themselves in a fall of any conceivable height,&lt;ref&gt;J.B.S. Haldane, [http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html "On Being the Right Size"],&lt;/ref&gt; but they may be able to drown themselves with [[Surface tension|a single drop of water.]]

==Appearances in popular culture==
&lt;!-- Please place your entries into this list in a chronological order if possible --&gt;

===Films and television===
*Dr. Cyclops from the [[Dr. Cyclops|1940 horror film of that name]] shrank his victims by locking them inside an "atomic generator".
* In the 1958 movie ''[[Attack of the Puppet People]]'', a scientist captures people and shrinks them to 6&amp;nbsp;inches in height with an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] wave device, so he can keep them as company. (He keeps them sealed inside special [[suspended animation]] canisters between "puppet shows".)
*The 1966 science-fiction film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (written by Harry Kleiner, novelization by [[Isaac Asimov]]) is plotted around such a device, allowing the miniaturized submarine ''Proteus'' to carry a crew inside a stricken scientist in an attempt to save his life. They have one hour to cure him before they expand back to normal size.
*In the episode "The Big Break-In" of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' animated TV series]], [[Krang]] uses a remote-controlled minimizer device with a shrink ray to shrink down [[US Army]] bases, preventing them from attacking the [[Technodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/the-big-break-in-2-70699/|title=The Big Break-In|publisher=TV.com|date=21 November 1989|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "Funny, They Shrunk Michelangelo" of the same TV series captain Talbot Breech uses a miniaturizing ray to shrink [[US Navy|US naval ships]] and put them into bottles as revenge on those who turned him down for the [[United States Naval Academy|US Naval Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/funny-they-shrunk-michaelangelo-73503/|title=Funny, They Shrunk Michaelangelo|publisher=TV.com|date=13 October 1990|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same show also features the episode "Poor Little Rich Turtle" features [[Shredder (TMNT)|Shredder]] using a shrink ray on the girl Buffy Shellhammer, who despite her young age runs a company, to force her telling a super rockt fuel formula her grandfather told her before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/poor-little-rich-turtle-73508/|title=Poor Little Rich Turtle|publisher=TV.com|date=10 November 1990|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' episode "Jiggles", Kowalski uses his shrink ray to shrink Jiggles to normal size.
*In an episode "Getting Antsy" of the 1991 ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' [[cartoon]], a [[villain]] Lilliput uses the ray to shrink buildings and landmarks of the fictional city St. Canard. He then employs [[ant]]s to haul the shrunken buildings to a [[miniature golf]], where they become part of the course. Eventually, Lilliput also shrinks the hero [[Darkwing Duck (character)|Darkwing Duck]] to an even tinier size.
*In an episode of ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'', titled Operation: M.I.N.I.G.O.L.F., after Numbuh 2 bests champion golfer, Rupert Putkin, in a game of mini-golf, Rupert seeks revenge. He builds a shrink ray to shrink down the world's greatest monuments and uses them in his own miniature-golf course. Afterwards, he shrinks Numbuh 2 and forces him to play a rematch in his smaller height. Later, Rupert plans to use Numbuh 2 as the golfball as he hits him into a hole that will activate his shrink ray to shrink the world. His plan fails when he misses and Numbuh 2 hits the reverse setting on the shrink ray, which zaps Rupert and makes him grow bigger, causing him to step on and crush his golf course. The shrink ray is destroyed subsequently, but Numbuh 2 remains tiny. He runs back to his friends in the treehouse, and they use him for ping-pong.
*In another episode of ''Kids Next Door'', entitled "Operation: S.P.R.O.U.T.", when Numbuh 4 swallows a brussel sprout, supposedly to make him an adult faster, his friends at Sector V take action. Numbuhs 1, 2, and 5 use a shrink ray to shrink down to the size of a booger. Afterwards, Numbuh 3 places them inside of Numbuh 4's nose, and they make their way to the stomach to recover the brussel sprout, before the shrink effect wears off. They are able to retrieve the massive sprout and make it out of Numbuh 4's body just before they re-expand to normal size. In the aftermath, Numbuh 4 returns home and accidentally eats liver, implying that they have to go on the same mission again.
*In the TV series, ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', one of Jimmy's most-used inventions is his shrink ray, first introduced in his movie in which he shrank himself in order to sneak out of his house.
*In the 1996 [[Tim Burton]]'s movie, ''[[Mars Attacks!|Mars Attacks]]'', the Martian Leader uses a shrinking ray to shrink and crush the [[President of the United States]]' main general, General Decker.
*In "In the Belly of the Boss", the third segment of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' Halloween special episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XV]]", the Simpson family is shrunk by [[Professor Frink]].
*A shrink ray invented by Professor Wayne Szalinski is featured in both the movie and TV Disney series ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show]]''.
*In a 1995 episode of ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]]'' called "No Small Problem", Dr. Blight invents a shrinking ray which Sly Sludge uses to shrink rubbish.
*In an episode of ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', Tim and Al shrink themselves using shrink rays to work deep inside of the engine.
*In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Master uses a [[Master (Doctor Who)#Tissue Compression Eliminator|Tissue Compression Eliminator]] to shrink and kill people.
*In the ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' episode "Unremarkable Voyage", Frylock builds a shrink ray (which can also enlarge items). Master Shake quickly gains control of the machine and proceeds to abuse its power for his own benefit. The shrink ray turns out to be faulty, however, as shrunken items return to normal size after a period of time.
*A shrink ray is a recurring device shown in ''[[Venture Brothers]]'', although it never seems to actually work properly.
*In ''[[Despicable Me]]'', Gru used the shrink ray to shrink the Moon and pocket it. The effects of the shrink ray are only temporary, however, and the bigger the mass of an object, the quicker the effect wears off; this is called the "Nefario Principle". Vector returns the Moon to satellite orbit before it returns to normal size using his [[escape pod]], but the Moon expands before he could do so in time and his escape pod is consequently destroyed, trapping him and a Minion on the now normal-sized Moon.
*In ''[[Innerspace]]'', a naval aviator is selected as a guinea pig to participate in a project which places him in a submersible pod to be shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the body of a rabbit.
*In ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', Dipper Pines was insulted by his twin Mabel Pines, so he finds a crystal that he attaches to a flashlight. One side enlarges things and the other shrinks things. It falls into Gideon's hands until the twins stop Gideon from shrinking Grunkle Stan and taking the Mystery Shack.
*In ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' , a Micro Band invented by Bulma can shrink its wearer. Also, a portable home called a Capsule House can be carried around in a capsule and deployed when desired.
*In ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' and its sequels, ''[[Honey I Blew Up the Kid]]'' and ''[[Honey We Shrunk Ourselves]]'', the shrink ray was the primary invention used in the trilogy.  Not only could it shrink people or other objects, but it could also reverse the effect to bring them back to normal size.
*In the episode "The Sound of Fear" from the ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens (TV series)|Monsters vs. Aliens]]'' TV series, Dr. Crockroach uses a shrink gun to shrink Susan. After a few minutes, she is back to normal.

* In an episode of ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', Dr. Doofinshmirtz shrinks himself but misses his hand. Phineas and Ferb have also shrunk themselves twice.
* In the ''[[Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse]]'' episode entitled "The Shrink-e-nator", Ken builds a shrink ray and accidentally shrinks Barbie and Racquelle.
* In the ''[[WordGirl]]'' episode entitled "Shrinkin' in the Ray", Dr. Too-Brains uses a shrink ray to shrink cheese and shrunk Scoops and WordGirl
* In ''[[The Electric Company]]'' episode "Shrink, Shrank, Shrunk", Manny uses a "shrinkinator" to shrink the water bottle and the car but accidentally shrinks Jessica, Marcus, and himself instead. In the end, they return to normal size.
* In the sixth season of ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', episodes "Drastic Voyage: Part I" and "Drastic Voyage: Part II" involves a [[CIA]]-developed machine which can perform "molecular miniaturization" and which is essentially a shrink ray. The episodes both parody and reference ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''.

===Radio===
* The "Pertwee System of Infinite Acceleration" in the ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' episode ''The Professor Was A Thief'' was a shrink ray (November 5, 1950).

===Literature===
*''Cold War in a Country Garden'' (Lindsay Gutteridge, Pocket 1973) concerns the adventures of miniaturized spies.
*The [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Ant-Man]], [[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]], and [[Doll Man]] are but a few of the comic book characters who had as a primary power the ability to shrink (usually by technological means).

===Video games===
*''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' and ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'' have a shrink gun capable of shrinking an enemy, which allows the player character Duke Nukem to step on the shrunken foe, instantly killing it. A similar weapon appears in ''[[Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project]]''.
*Engineers in ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' are capable of crafting a Gnomish shrink ray.
*The [[Eiffel Tower]] is reduced in size, then stolen, in the game ''[[Evil Genius (game)|Evil Genius]]''.
*In the ''[[Men in Black (series)|Men in Black]]'' game ''Crashdown'', Agent Jay uses a shrink ray to shrink himself so he may fight a group of alien insects.
*''[[Pandemonium (video game)|Pandemonium!]]'' features a shrink ray power-up.
*''Call Of Duty: Black Ops'' Zombie mode includes weapon called 31-79JGb215, which reduces zombies size for short time so they can be instantly killed no matter of weapon, or even by running towards them. Although this weapon is only seen in map Shangri-La.
*The game ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank: Size Matters]]'' features a shrink ray item, which Ratchet uses to enter keyholes and unlock them.

===Other===
The term "[[The Consumerist#grocery shrink ray|grocery shrink ray]]" has been used to describe a manufacturer decreasing the amount of product in a package while keeping the package price the same, as a scheme to implement a hidden price increase.

'''Slash-and-char''' is an alternative to [[slash-and-burn]] that has a lesser effect on the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is the practice of [[charring]] the [[biomass]] resulting from the slashing, instead of burning it. The resulting residue matter [[charcoal]] can be utilized as [[biochar]] to [[soil conditioner|improve the soil fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biederman|first=L. A.|date=2012-12-31|title=Biochar and its effects on plant productivity and nutrient cycling: a meta-analysis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcbb.12037|journal=GCB Bioenergy|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=202-214|doi=10.1111/gcbb.12037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that context, [[charcoal]] can be made by numerous and varied methods, from [[Charcoal#History|the simplest]] (an earth cover on the pile of wood, with strategically placed vents) to the most sophisticated (a modern equipment or plant that recuperates and processes strictly all exhaust gases into [[pyroligneous acid]] and [[syngas]]).

Slash-and-char offers considerable benefits to the environment when compared to [[slash-and-burn]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

It results in the creation of biochar, which can then be mixed with biomass such as [[crop residue]]s, [[food waste]], or [[manure]], and buried in the soil to bring about the formation of [[terra preta]]. Terra preta is one of the richest soils on the planet – and the only one known to regenerate itself. 

It moreover sequesters considerable quantities of [[CO2 sequestration|carbon]] in the safest and most beneficial fashion, as opposite to the negative effects of the slash-and-burn. Switching to slash-and-char can sequester up to 50% of the carbon in a highly stable form.&lt;ref&gt; Lehmann – Biochar sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems,'' supra'' note 11 at 407 (“If this woody aboveground [[biomass]] were converted into biochar by means of simple kiln techniques and applied to soil, more than 50% of this C would be sequestered in a highly stable form.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
The nascent [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]] market that sponsors [[CO2 sequestration|{{CO2}} sequestration]] projects, could therefore help supplement the farmers' income while supporting a decrease in the pace of [[deforestation]] and the development of a more [[sustainable agriculture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6512">A '''solar-powered laser''' is a [[laser]] that shares the same [[optics|optical]] properties as conventional lasers such as emitting a [[Light beam|beam]] consisting of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[radiation]] which can reach high [[power (physics)|power]], but which uses [[solar radiation]] for [[laser pumping|pumping]] the [[Active laser medium|lasing medium]].  This type of laser is unique from other types in that it does not require any artificial energy source.

==Lasing media==

The two most studied lasing media for solar-pumped lasers have been [[iodine]],&lt;ref name="deyoung1987"&gt;De Young et al. Preliminary Design and Cost of a 1-Megawatt Solar-Pumped Iodide Laser Space-to-Space Transmission Station, NASA Technical Memorandum, 1987 ([https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19870017752_1987017752.pdf Original version], [https://www.webcitation.org/5zeqsH099 WebCite archive]), Retrieved 2011-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; with a laser wavelength of 1.31 micrometers, and [[Yttrium_aluminium_garnet#Nd:Cr:YAG|NdCrYAG]], which lases at 1.06 micrometers wavelength.  Solar-pumped [[Laser diode|semiconductor lasers]] have also been proposed by Landis&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Landis, "New Approaches for a Solar-Pumped GaAs Laser," ''Optics Communications, 92'', pp 261-265 (1992). ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994SPIE.2121...58L Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Tsidulko, "Semiconductor Laser Pumped by Solar Radiation," ''Soviet Journal of Quantum Electronics 22'' (5), pp. 463-466 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Solar-pumped lasers are not used commercially because the low cost of electricity in most locations means that other more efficient types of lasers that run on electrical power can be more economically used. Solar pumped lasers might become useful in off-grid locations.

===Nanopowders===

Very fine grained dispersed powders can be produced by the use of laser synthesis technology.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hydrogen production===

A leader in this field is Shigeaki Uchida and his team in Japan (Tokyo/Osaka).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can Lasers Help Decrease Our Dependence on Fossil Fuels? |url=http://www.photonics.com/Content/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=30649 |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515142312/http://www.photonics.com/Content/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=30649 |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their design uses [[Fresnel lens]]es and a solar-pumped [[Yttrium_aluminium_garnet#Nd:Cr:YAG|NdCrYAG]] laser to drive a magnesium-based cycle, which produces hydrogen gas as its product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar light pumped laser and cooling method of solar light pumped laser, USPTO Application #: 20080225912 |url=http://www.freshpatents.com/Solar-light-pumped-laser-and-cooling-method--of-solar-light-pumped-laser-dt20080918ptan20080225912.php |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217004241/http://www.freshpatents.com/Solar-light-pumped-laser-and-cooling-method--of-solar-light-pumped-laser-dt20080918ptan20080225912.php |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential spacecraft applications===

Since there is no 'grid' power in space, most spacecraft today use solar power sources, mostly [[photovoltaic]] solar cells.    Powering lasers requires high levels of power, so the inefficiency of PV solar cells (usually less than 27% efficiency) motivates interest in solar pumping of lasers.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Landis, "Prospects for Solar Pumped Semiconductor Lasers," Paper SPIE 2121-09, Laser Power Beaming, SPIE Proceedings Volume 2121, pp. 58-65,  January 27–28, 1994 ([http://www.mill-creek-systems.com/HighLift/Climbers/solar_laser_SPIE1.pdf web version] access date 2009-11-10)&lt;/ref&gt;
Other potential benefits of solar-pumped lasers might be reduced weight and reduced number of components, affording higher reliability (reduced number of failure modes) versus an electrically pumped laser powered from PV cells. They can also be used for [[Free-space optical communication|deep space communications]], sensors for conditions on earth, detecting and tracking objects in space, as well as power transmission.

====Space propulsion====

There have been proposals to use solar-pumped lasers for spacecraft [[beam-powered propulsion]].

====Solar power satellite====

There have been proposals to use solar-pumped lasers for space-based solar power.

==Current research==
The largest solar-pumped laser is currently being operated by a research facility in Uzbekistan.  
It is a 1 MW solar input power [[NdYAG]] type laser, operating at 3,000 degrees C. It is cooled by distilled water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physics-sun solar laser oozes millions of watts |url=http://solarfeeds.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2820:physics-sun-solar-laser-oozes-millions-of-watts&amp;catid=76:ecofriend&amp;Itemid=112

Water usually cold, is circulated in cold finger to allow the desired compound to be deposited.&lt;br&gt;'''1''' Cooling water in '''2''' Cooling water out '''3''' Vacuum/gas line '''4''' Sublimation chamber '''5''' Sublimed compound '''6''' Crude material '''7''' External heating]]
'''Sublimation apparatus''' is equipment, commonly [[laboratory glassware]], for purification of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] by selective [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]]. In principle, the operation resembles purification by [[distillation]], except that the products do not pass through a [[liquid|liquid phase]].
==Overview==
[[Image:Camphor sublimation 1.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|[[Camphor]] being purified on a sublimation apparatus. Note the white purified camphor on the cold finger, and the dark-brown crude product.]]
[[Image:Cp2NiSublimate.jpg|thumb|200 px|Dark green crystals of [[nickelocene]], freshly sublimed on the cold finger of the sublimation apparatus.]]
A typical sublimation apparatus separates a mix of appropriate solid materials in a vessel in which it applies heat under reduced pressure or [[vacuum]]. If the material is not at first solid, then it freezes under the reduced [[pressure]]. Conditions are so chosen that the solid [[volatility (chemistry)|volatilizes]] and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface, leaving the non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] residual [[impurities]] or solid products behind. 

The form of the cooled surface often is a so-called [[cold finger]]. If the operation is a [[Batch production|batch process]], then the sublimed material can be collected from the cooled surface once heating ceases and the vacuum is released. 

Among the advantages of applying the principle to certain materials, are the comparatively low working temperatures and reduced exposure to gases such as oxygen that otherwise might harm certain classes of desired products.&lt;ref name="Couper2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=James R. Couper|title=Chemical Process Equipment: Selection and Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qG_TQwCsG-8C&amp;pg=PA729|year=2012|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-12-396959-0|pages=729–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature gradient==
More sophisticated variants of sublimation apparatus include those that apply a [[temperature gradient]] so as to allow for controlled [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] of different fractions along the cold surface. [[Thermodynamic processes]] follow a [[statistical distribution]], and suitably designed apparatus exploit this principle with a gradient that will yield different purities in particular temperature zones along the collection surface. Such techniques are especially helpful when the requirement is to refine or separate multiple products or impurities from the same mix of raw materials. It is necessary in particular when some of the required products have similar [[sublimation point|sublimation points]] or [[vapor pressure|pressure curves]].&lt;ref name="Couper2012"/&gt;

'''''The God Species: Saving the Planet in the Age of Humans''''' (alternatively, ''The God Species: How the Planet Can Survive the Age of Humans'' (U.S.) or ''The God Species: How Humans Really Can Save the Planet...'' (paperback)) is a 2011 book by environmental writer [[Mark Lynas]]. It argues that since the Earth has entered an age where several of its systems are in the control of humanity&amp;mdash;the [[Anthropocene]]&amp;mdash;it is now up to humans to use this power wisely. The book challenges several beliefs usually held by environmentalists, arguing that technology like [[nuclear power]] and [[genetic engineering]] are useful and necessary tools to keep the Earth system within planetary boundaries, and that the [[Green movement]]'s insistence on lifestyle changes and opposition to economic growth are unlikely to work.

== Contents ==
The book is structured around the concept of [[planetary boundaries]] as proposed by a group of Earth system scientists and environmental scientists led by [[Johan Rockström]] in 2009. Lynas describes how the idea for the book came while attending a meeting with the planetary boundaries group in Sweden.

* The [[biodiversity]] boundary. 
* The [[climate change]] boundary.
* The [[biogeochemical]] boundary in the original framework has two parts: a) anthropogenic [[nitrogen]] removed from the atmosphere and b) anthropogenic [[phosphorus]] going into the oceans. Lynas focuses on the nitrogen cycle.
* The [[land use]] boundary.
* The [[water crisis|freshwater]] boundary.
* The toxics boundary, referring to chemical pollution; the concentration of [[Toxicity|toxic substances]], [[Plastic#Environmental issues|plastics]], [[endocrine disruptors]], [[heavy metals]] and [[radioactive contamination]] into the environment.
* The [[aerosol]]s boundary.
* The [[ocean acidification]] boundary.
* The [[ozone depletion|ozone layer]] boundary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6933">'''Ti-6Al-7Nb''' (UNS designation '''R56700''') is an alpha-beta [[titanium alloy]] first synthesized in 1977. It features high strength and has similar properties as the cytotoxic vanadium containing alloy Ti-6Al-4V. Ti-6Al-7Nb is used as a material for hip protheses.&lt;ref&gt;Mamoun Fellah, Mohamed Labaïz, Omar Assala, et al., “Tribological behavior of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb Alloys for Total Hip Prosthesis,” Advances in Tribology, vol. 2014, Article ID 451387, 13 pages, 2014. doi:10.1155/2014/451387&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ti―6Al―7Nb is one of the titanium alloys that built of hexagonal α phase (stabilised with [[aluminium]]) and regular body-centred phase β (stabilised with [[niobium]]). The alloy is characterized by added advantageous mechanical properties, it has higher corrosion resistance and biotolerance  in relation to [[Ti-6Al-V]] alloys.&lt;ref&gt;Chlebus, Edward, et al. "Microstructure and mechanical behaviour of Ti―6Al―7Nb alloy produced by selective laser melting." Materials Characterization 62.5 (2011): 488-495.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;X. Liu, P.-K. Chu, C.

López, A. Gutiérrez, J.-A. Jiménez. In vitro corrosion behaviour of titanium alloys without vanadium. Electrochimica Acta, 47 (2002), pp. 1359–1364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical properties==
Mechanical properties of the alloy are mostly dependent on the morphology and the fractions volume of the phases presence from the parameters obtained from the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lütjering. Influence of processing on microstructure and mechanical properties of (α + β) titanium alloys. Materials Science and Engineering, A243 (1998), pp. 32–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.A.

As shown in the above table, alloying is one of the  effective methods  to improve the mechanical properties and since Niobium belongs to the same group of Vanadium in the [[periodic table]] it is of course acts as α –β  stabilizing elements  (similar to Ti-6AL-4V alloy), however the strength of Nb alloy is little less than  that of Ti-6AL-4V .The main difference between Ti-6AL-4V  and Ti―6Al―7Nb is related to different factors such as solid-solution strengthening, the structure-refining  strengthening provided by the refined  two-phase structure  and the difference in the microstructure between the two alloys.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Equo, et al. "Mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Ti–6Al–7Nb alloy dental castings." Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine 9.10 (1998): 567-574.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Ti-6Al-7Nb is produced by powder metallurgy methods. The most common methods are hot pressing, metal injection mouldering and blending and pressing. In the production of Ti-6Al-7Nb a sintering temperature between 900-1400&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C usually are used. Altering the sintering temperature gives the Ti-6Al-7Nb different properties such as different porosity and microstructure. It also gives a different composition between alpha, beta and alpha+beta phases. In the recent years Ti-6Al-7Nb alloys could also be made by different 3D-printer technique such as SLM and EBM.&lt;ref&gt;Bolzoni, Leandro, et al. "Comparison of Microstructure and Properties of Ti-6Al-7Nb Alloy Processed by Different Powder Metallurgy Routes." Key Engineering Materials. Vol. 551. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-66321998000400002&amp;script=sci_arttext&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat treatment==
Heat treatment of titanium is demonstrated to have significant influences on reducing the residual stresses, improving the mechanical properties (i.e. tensile strength or fatigue strength by solution treatment and ageing). Moreover, heat treatment provides an ideal combination of ductility, machinability and structural stability due to the differences in microstructure and cooling rates between α and β phases.&lt;ref&gt;Sercombe, Tim, et al. "Heat treatment of Ti-6Al-7Nb components produced by selective laser melting." Rapid Prototyping Journal 14.5 (2008): 300-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooling rate have an impact of the morphology . When the cooling rate is reduced for example from air cool to slow cooling, the morphology of the transformed α increases in thickness and length and is contained within fewer, larger α colonies.&lt;ref&gt;2.	Tim Sercombe Noel Jones Rob Day Alan Kop, (2008),"Heat treatment of Ti-6Al-7Nb components produced by selective laser melting", Rapid Prototyping Journal, Vol. 14 Iss 5 pp. 300 - 304&lt;/ref&gt; The α colony size is the most important microstructural properties due to its influences the fatigue properties and deformation mechanics of β processed α+ β alloys.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Lütjering, G. "Influence of processing on microstructure and mechanical properties of (α+ β) titanium alloys." Materials Science and Engineering: A 243.1 (1998): 32-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
* Implant devices replacing such as : failed hard tissue, artificial hip joints, artificial knee joints, bone plates, screws for fracture fixation, cardiac valve prostheses, pacemakers,  and artificial hearts.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, C. N., et al. "Biomedical applications of titanium and its alloys." Jom 60.3 (2008): 46-49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dental application &lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Equo, et al. "Mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Ti–6Al–7Nb alloy dental castings." Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine 9.10 (1998): 567-574.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aircraft materials

==Biocompatibility==
Ti-6Al-7Nb has a high biocompatibility. The oxides from Ti-6Al-7Nb is saturated in the body and are not transported in vivo or are a bioburden. The alloy will not create adverse tissue tolerance reactions and creates fewer giant cell nucleis. Ti-6Al-7Nb also shows a high compatibility to ingrowth to the human body.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.synthes.com/sites/NA/NAContent/Docs/Product%20Support%20Materials/Materials%20Booklets/Implant%20Materials%20-%20Titanium--6_%20Aluminum--7_%20Niobium.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The tola is a [[Vedic period|Vedic]] measure, with the name derived from the [[Sanskrit]] ''tol'' (तोलः root तुल्) meaning "weighing" or "weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Platts | first = John T. | year = 1884 | title = A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindi, and English | url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.platts.1806931 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120527071003/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.platts.1806931 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-05-27 | location = London | publisher = W.

''Statistics of the colonies of the British empire'', London: W.H. Allen and Co., 1839, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and its exact weight varied according to locality. However, it is also a convenient mass for a coin: several pre-colonial coins, including the currency of [[Akbar the Great]] (1556–1605), had a mass of "one tola" within slight variation.&lt;ref name="Prinsep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinsep (1840), pp. 45–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The very first [[rupee]] ({{lang-ur|رپيا}}; ''rupayā''), minted by [[Sher Shah Suri]] (1540–45), had a mass of 178&amp;nbsp;troy grains, or about 1% less than the British tola.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.rbi.org.in/currency/museum/c-mogul.html | title = Mughal Coinage | publisher = RBI Monetary Museum | accessdate = 2008-05-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085855/http://www.rbi.org.in/currency/museum/c-mogul.html | archivedate = 2008-05-16 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British East India Company]] issued a [[silver]] rupee coin of 180&amp;nbsp;troy grains, and this became the practical standard mass for the tola well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Silb2"&gt;{{citation | author = Silberrad, C.

[[File:20180507 12471p.jpg|thumb|A set of tolas]]
The British tola of 180&amp;nbsp;troy grains (from 1833) can be seen as more of a standardisation than a redefinition: the previous standard in the [[Bengal Presidency]], the system of "sicca weights", was the mass of one [[Murshidabad]] rupee, 179.666&amp;nbsp;troy grains.&lt;ref name="Prinsep" /&gt; For the larger weights used in commerce (in the Bengal Presidency), the variation in the pre-1833 standards was found to be greater than the adjustment.&lt;ref name="Prinsep" /&gt;

The tola formed the base for units of mass under the British Indian system, and was also the standard measure of [[Precious metal|gold and silver bullion]].&lt;ref name="Prinsep" /&gt; Although the tola has been officially replaced by metric units since 1956,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonlii.org/in/legis/num_act/sowama1956324/ Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1956 (No. 89 of 1956)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928150049/http://www.commonlii.org/in/legis/num_act/sowama1956324/ |date=2009-09-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is still in current use, and is a popular denomination for gold bullion bars in [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Singapore]], with a ten tola bar being the most commonly traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An '''Underground storage tank''' ('''UST''') is, according to United States federal regulations, a [[storage tank]], not including any underground piping connected to the tank, that has at least 10 percent of its volume underground.
[[Image:Underground.Storage.Tank.with.Anodes.jpg|thumb|A horizontal cylindrical [[steel]] tank with a factory applied [[coating]] and [[Cathodic protection#Galvanic CP|galvanic anodes]] prior to installation underground.]]

==Definition in U.S. federal law==
"Underground storage tank" or "UST" means any one or combination of tanks including connected underground pipes that is used to contain regulated substances, and the volume of which including the volume of underground pipes is 10 percent or more beneath the surface of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=3113bdbd55bf563c9663729770e6a78e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:26.0.1.1.10.1.47.3&amp;idno=40 "Definitions."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612155112/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=3113bdbd55bf563c9663729770e6a78e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:26.0.1.1.10.1.47.3&amp;idno=40 |date=2011-06-12 }} ''Technical Standards and Corrective Action Requirements for Owners and Operators of Underground Storage Tanks (UST).'' ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|40|280|12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include, among other things, any farm or residential tank of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes, tanks for storing [[heating oil]] for consumption on the premises, or [[septic tank]]s. For USTs in service in the United States the EPA and states collectively require tank operators to take financial responsibility for any releases or leaks associated with the operation of those below ground tanks. As a condition to keep a tank in operation a demonstrated ability to pay for any release must be shown via UST insurance, a bond, or some other ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 1995 |title=Financial Responsibility Requirements for Underground Storage Tanks |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-03/documents/dolsens.pdf |publisher=EPA |series=''Dollars and Sense'' |id=EPA 510-K-95-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1984, U.S. Congress amended the Resource Conservation Recovery Act to include Subtitle I: Underground Storage Tanks, calling on the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to regulate the tanks. In 1985, when it was launched, there were more than 2 million tanks in the country and more than 750,000 owners and operators. The program was given 90 staff to oversee this responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/602BCE06FAFAB29B.pdf#page=2|title=Transcript of ‘The Underground Storage Tank Program’s Early Management Challenges’ video|last=Brand|first=Ron|date=August 24, 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1988, the EPA published initial underground storage tank regulations, including a 10-year phase-in period that required all operators to upgrade their USTs with spill prevention and leak detection equipment.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1988-09-23). "Technical Standards and Corrective Action Requirements for Owners and Operators of Underground Storage Tanks (UST)." ''Federal Register,'' {{USFR|53|37194}}. 40 CFR Part 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA updated UST and state program approval regulations in 2015, the first major changes since 1988.&lt;ref name="EPA 2015-07-15"&gt;EPA (2015-07-15). "Revising Underground Storage Tank Regulations-Revisions to Existing Requirements and New Requirements for Secondary Containment and Operator Training." ''Federal Register,'' {{usfr|80|41565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revisions increase the emphasis on properly operating and maintaining UST equipment. The revisions will help prevent and detect UST releases, which are a leading source of groundwater contamination. The revisions will also help ensure all USTs in the United States, including those in Indian country, meet the same minimum standards. The changes established federal requirements that are similar to key portions of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]]. In addition, EPA added new operation and maintenance requirements and addressed UST systems deferred in the 1988 UST regulation. The changes:

* Added secondary containment requirements for new and replaced tanks and piping
* Added operator training requirements
* Added periodic operation and maintenance requirements for UST systems
* Added requirements to ensure UST system compatibility before storing certain biofuel blends
* Removed past deferrals for emergency generator tanks, field constructed tanks, and airport hydrant systems
* Updated codes of practice
* Made editorial and technical corrections.&lt;ref name="EPA 2015-07-15"/&gt;

==Tank types==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Underground storage tanks fall into four different types:

#[[Steel]]/[[aluminum]] tank, made by manufacturers in most states and conforming to standards set by the Steel Tank Institute.
#[[Composite material|Composite overwrapped]], a metal tank (aluminum/steel) with filament windings like [[glass fiber]]/[[aramid]] or [[carbon fiber]] or a plastic compound around the metal cylinder for corrosion protection and to form an interstitial space.
#Tanks made from [[Composite material|composite]] material, [[fiberglass]]/[[aramid]] or [[carbon fiber]] with a metal liner (aluminum or steel). See [[metal matrix composite]].
# Composite tanks such as carbon fiber with a polymer liner ([[thermoplastic]]). See [[rotational molding]] and [[fibre-reinforced plastic]] (FRP).

Underground storage tanks for water are traditionally called [[cistern]]s and are usually constructed from [[brick]]s and [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or [[concrete]].

==Petroleum underground storage tanks==
[[Petroleum]] USTs are used throughout North America at automobile [[filling stations]] and by the US military. Many have [[leak]]ed, allowing petroleum to contaminate the [[soil]] and [[groundwater]] and enter as vapor into buildings, ending up as brownfields or Superfund sites.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Many USTs installed before 1980 consisted of bare [[steel]] pipes, which [[corrosion|corrode]] over time.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Faulty installation can also cause structural failure of the tank or piping, causing leaks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/ust/resources-ust-owners-and-operators#installing |title=Resources for UST Owners and Operators |publisher=US EPA |website=EPA.gov |access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation in the US===
{{Duplication|section=yes}}
USTs are regulated in the United States to prevent release of petroleum and contamination of groundwater, soil and air. The 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) required EPA to develop regulations for the underground storage of motor fuels to minimize and prevent environmental damage, by mandating owners and operators of UST systems to verify, maintain, and clean up sites damaged by petroleum contamination.&lt;ref name="HSWA statute"&gt;United States. Hazardous and Solid Wastes Amendments of 1984, P.L. 98-616, {{USStat|98|3224}}, November 8, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1988, EPA regulations asking owners to locate, remove, upgrade, or replace underground storage tanks became effective. Each state was given authority to establish such a program within its own jurisdiction, to compensate owners for the cleanup of underground petroleum leaks, to set standards and licensing for installers, and to register and inspect underground tanks.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Most upgrades to USTs consisted {{when|date=June 2015}} of the installation of corrosion control ([[cathodic protection]], interior lining, or a combination of cathodic protection and interior lining), overfill protection (to prevent overfills of the tank during tank filling operations), [[oil spill|spill containment]] (to catch spills when filling), and [[leak#Leak testing|leak detection]] for both the tank and piping.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Many USTs were removed without replacement during the 10-year program. Many thousands of old underground tanks were replaced with newer tanks made of corrosion resistant materials (such as [[fiberglass]], steel clad with a thick [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|FRP]] shell, and well-coated steel with [[galvanic anodes]]) and others constructed as double walled tanks to form an interstice between two tank walls (a tank within a tank) which allowed for the detection of leaks from the inner or outer tank wall through monitoring of the interstice using vacuum, pressure or a liquid sensor probe. Piping was replaced during the same period with much of the new piping being double-wall construction and made of fiberglass or [[plastic]] materials.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Tank monitoring systems capable of detecting small leaks (must be capable of detecting a 0.1 gallons-per-hour with a probability of detection of 95% or greater and a probability of false alarm of 5% or less) were installed and other methods were adopted to alert the tank operator of leaks and potential leaks.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

U.S. regulations required that UST cathodic protection systems be tested by a cathodic protection expert (minimum every three years) and that systems be monitored to ensure continued compliant operation.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=3113bdbd55bf563c9663729770e6a78e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:26.0.1.1.10.3.47.2&amp;idno=40 "Operation and maintenance of corrosion protection."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612155036/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=3113bdbd55bf563c9663729770e6a78e&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:26.0.1.1.10.3.47.2&amp;idno=40 |date=2011-06-12 }} ''Technical Standards and Corrective Action Requirements for Owners and Operators of Underground Storage Tanks (UST).'' ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|40|280|31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some industrial owners, who previously stored fuel in underground tanks, switched to above-ground tanks to avoid environmental regulations that require monitoring of fuel storage. Many states, however, do not permit above-ground storage of motor fuel for resale to the public.

The EPA Underground Storage Tank Program is considered to have been very successful.{{according to whom|date=June 2015}} The national inventory of underground tanks has been reduced by more than half, and most of the rest have been replaced or upgraded to much safer standards.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Of the approximately one million underground storage tanks sites in the United States as of 2008, most of which handled some type of fuel, an estimated 500,000 have had leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Sullivan, [http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/08/ap_impact_underground_fema_fue_1.php "Cold War era fuel tanks could be leaking hazardous material into environment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822083617/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/08/ap_impact_underground_fema_fue_1.php |date=2008-08-22 }}, ''Associated Press'', August 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, there were approximately 600,000 active USTs at 223,000 sites subject to federal regulation.&lt;ref name="EPA UST 2009"&gt;EPA (2010).

In 2012, EPA published how to screen buildings vulnerable to petroleum vapor intrusion,&lt;ref name=screen&gt;{{cite web|author1=John T. Wilson, James W. Weaver, Hal White|title=An Approach for Developing Site-Specific Lateral and Vertical Inclusion Zones within which Structures Should be Evaluated for Petroleum Vapor Intrusion due to Releases of Motor Fuel from Underground Storage Tanks (EPA 600/R-13/047)|url=http://www.epa.gov/oust/cat/pvi/epa600r13047.pdf|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=13 June 2015|pages=34|format=pdf|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2015, U.S. EPA finally released its
"Technical Guide for Assessing and Mitigating the Vapor Intrusion  Pathway from Subsurface Vapor Sources to Indoor Air"
and "Technical Guide For Addressing Petroleum Vapor Intrusion At Leaking Underground Storage Tank Sites"&lt;ref name=pvidocs&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Technical Documents, Tools and Other Resources to Support Vapor Intrusion Assessment and Mitigation Activities|url=http://www.epa.gov/oswer/vaporintrusion/guidance.html#EO12866OSWERVI|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=13 June 2015|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999''' are  regulations imposed on the [[England and Wales]] [[Water industry]] by [[Statutory Instrument]]. 

The regulations were signed jointly by [[Michael Meacher]], [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] and [[Jon Owen Jones]], [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Parliamentary Under]]-[[Secretary of State for Wales]]

==Arrangement==
The Regulations are divided into three parts and a further 3 Schedules are attached

===Parts===
Part I defines terms used and defines the scope of the regulations.

Part II specifies the requirements for water fittings; restrictions on the installation of water fittings;  certification to be issued and notifications to be given.

Part III deals with enforcement, penalties, tests and disputes.

===Schedules===
Schedule 1 categorizes water into five different levels fluid categories for ''wholesomeness'', while schedule 2 provides further explanation of terms used within the body of the regulations.
Schedule 3 revokes previous water byelaws.

====Fluid category 1====
Wholesome water supplied by a [[Water Industry Act 1991#Part 2 Water Undertakers|water undertaker]] and complying with the requirements of regulations made under [[Water Industry Act 1991#Standards of wholesomeness|section 67]] of the [[Water Industry Act 1991]].

====Fluid category 2====
Water in fluid category 1 whose aesthetic quality is impaired owing to-
:a) a change in its temperature, or
:b) the presence of substances or [[organism]]s causing a change in its taste, odour or appearance, including water in a [[Water heating|hot water distribution]] system.

====Fluid category 3====
Fluid which represents a slight health hazard because of the concentration of substances of low toxicity, including any fluid which contains-
:a) [[ethylene glycol]], [[copper sulphate]] solution or similar chemical additives, or
:b) [[sodium hypochlorite]] (common [[disinfectant]]s).

====Fluid category 4====
Fluid which represents a significant health hazard because of the concentration of [[toxic]] substances, including any fluid which contains-
:a) chemical, [[carcinogenic]] substances or pesticides (including [[insecticides]] and [[herbicides]]), or
:b) environmental organisms of potential health significance.

====Fluid category 5====
Fluid representing a serious health hazard because of the concentration of pathogenic organisms, radioactive or very toxic substances, including any fluid which contains-
:a) [[Feces|faecal]] material or other human waste;
:b) [[butcher]]y or other animal waste; or
:c) [[pathogens]] from any other source.

The '''zentner''' ([[German language|German]] ''Zentner'', from [[Latin]] ''centenarius'', derived from ''centum'' meaning "hundred") is an obsolete name for a unit of [[mass]] which was used predominantly in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], although it was also sometimes used in the [[United Kingdom]] &amp;ndash; for example, as a measure of the weight of certain [[agriculture|crops]] including [[hops]] for [[beer]] production &amp;ndash; and similar units were used in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictZ.html ''Dictionary of Units of Measure''], [[University of North Carolina]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the notion of [[hundredweight]], the zentner is the weight of 100 units, where the value of the unit depends on the time and location. Traditionally the unit was one hundred [[pound (mass)|pound]]s (German ''Pfund''), or roughly 50000 [[gram]]s  &amp;ndash; the precise value being context-dependent &amp;ndash; making one zentner equal to about 50 [[kilogram]]s.

In later times, with the adoption of the [[metric system]], the value came to denote exactly 50&amp;nbsp;kg, at least in Germany; in Austria and Switzerland the term is now in use for a measure of 100&amp;nbsp;kg, as it is in Russia ([[:ru:Центнер]], ''tsentner''). In Germany a measure of 100&amp;nbsp;kg is named a Doppelzentner.
