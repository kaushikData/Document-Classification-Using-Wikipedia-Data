'''''10 Years''''' is a 2011 American [[romantic comedy]] directed by [[Jamie Linden (writer)|Jamie Linden]] in his directorial debut.&lt;ref name=About&gt;Murray, Rebecca (August 26, 2010). [http://movies.about.com/b/2010/08/26/channing-tatum-is-putting-together-ten-year-film.htm "Channing Tatum is Putting Together Ten Year Film"]. Movies.about.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Channing Tatum]], [[Jenna Dewan]], [[Justin Long]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Lynn Collins]], [[Chris Pratt]], [[Scott Porter]], [[Brian Geraghty]], [[Anthony Mackie]], Kelly Noonan and Juliet Lopez. The film was released on September 14, 2012, in select theaters.

==Plot==
Jake ([[Channing Tatum]]), and his girlfriend Jess ([[Jenna Dewan]]) arrive at his high school
friend's house owned by married couple, Cully ([[Chris Pratt]]) and Sam ([[Ari Graynor]]). There, some of
Jake's friends  start to arrive including: best buddies Marty ([[Justin Long]]) and AJ ([[Max Minghella]]),
musician Reeves ([[Oscar Isaac]]) and Scott ([[Scott Porter]]) together with his wife, Suki (Eiko Nijo).
The guys then start driving to their high school reunion venue. Other friends from their
high school arrive including: Garrity ([[Brian Geraghty]]) along with his wife Olivia ([[Aubrey Plaza]])
and Garrity's best friend Andre ([[Anthony Mackie]]). Meanwhile, a reclusive woman named Elise ([[Kate Mara]])
arrives at the reunion alone. She tries to welcome the guest only to be ignored by the party planners, 
Anna ([[Lynn Collins]]) and Julie (Kelly Noonan).

The night proceeds as each couple is faced with both their past selves and present.  Some have changed while others stayed the same; Cully attempts to apologize for his high school behavior towards the nerds he used to know but he only reverts to his old self with each drink he takes, embarrassing his wife and all others present.

Marty and AJ, now successful in their respective careers, attempt to impress and woo the prom queen Anna, the girl who has everything.  After she turns them down they attempt childish revenge only to learn that none of them has a perfect life.  Instead all three must learn to reconnect and forgive themselves for past faults.

Elise connects with Reeves throughout the night, revealing feelings he has had for her that ended up as inspiration for his popular song 'Never Had', and she must decide if she is going to run away again.

Jake, meanwhile, has been deciding the right time to propose to Jess, but he must come to terms with feelings he had for his high school sweetheart, Mary ([[Rosario Dawson]]), and the way their relationship ended.

The film ends with Jake and Jess at a diner with friends, happy to relive past moments and looking forward to tomorrow.

'''''3 Strikes''''' is a 2000 American [[screwball comedy film]] written and directed by [[DJ Pooh]]. The film stars [[Brian Hooks]] as Rob Douglas, a man just released from a one-year sentence in jail, who already has two strikes to his name. Since he is living under [[California]]'s [[three strikes law]], Rob decides to go straight and leave the street life alone. However, things go horribly wrong for him as he gets involved in an altercation with the police upon the day of his release. The plot centers on Rob as he evades the police until he can prove his innocence, for fear that he will be put away for good with a third strike. [[David Alan Grier]], [[Faizon Love]], and [[N'Bushe Wright]] co-star.

==Plot==
Robert Douglas ([[Brian Hooks]]) is in prison for one of two felonies he has previously committed. While in prison, he watches to a local news report that states California has instituted the [[Three-strikes law|habitual offenders law]], commonly referred to as the "three-strikes" law, which will put offenders with three felonies in prison for a minimum of twenty-five years. On his last day in prison, Robert is ecstatic about being released, informing his girlfriend, Juanita ([[N'Bushe Wright]]), of such and contacting his friend, Tone ([[Faizon Love]]) to pick him up after he gets out.

On the way to pick up Robert, Tone stops to pick up a woman on the street and takes her home. Tone tells his friend, J.J. ([[De'Aundre Bonds]]), to pick Robert up in his place. Shortly after leaving prison, while on the way to check in with Robert's probation officer, the pair are pulled over by police; J.J. reveals that the car they are driving is stolen and, unwilling to surrender, he begins shooting at the cops. Knowing he will be convicted for his third and final felony offense, Robert flees on foot. As he is trying to escape himself, Jay-Jay is wounded from a shot to the buttocks and is taken into custody. Robert escapes pursuit by hiding at a backyard party and, soon after returning home, learns he has been identified and implicated in the shooting as a suspect. Detective Jenkins ([[David Alan Grier]]) leads the investigation.

While in the hospital, J.J. calls his friend, Blue ([[Barima McKnight]]), and berates Robert for leaving him during the shooting, telling Blue that he plans to peg Robert as the shooter when the police come to interview him. The call is recorded on voice mail at Blue's home. Jay-jay antagonizes the man guarding his room, who then lets a homosexual janitor that was ogling J.J. from afar into the room. Unable to defend himself, it is assumed J.J. is sexually assaulted by the janitor.

At home, Robert receives a call from Tone. Parked outside Robert's house, Tone blames him for leaving J.J. by himself during the shootout, and tells him he plans to pass the word around the neighborhood for everyone to be on the lookout for him, insinuating there would be repercussions. Robert reaches out to his probation officer for help in proving his innocence, but is told that his best option is to simply turn himself in.

Robert gets into a heated argument with his father ([[George Wallace]]) and is kicked out of the house, but runs into his friend, Mike ([[E-40]]), who lends Robert enough money for him and Juanita to get a hotel room. Detective Jenkins and Officer Roberts ([[Dean Norris]]) stop by Robert's parent's house, but are turned away without a warrant to search the premises.

The following morning, Robert is informed by his mother that the police are searching for him, but more importantly that a woman named Dahlia ([[Mo'Nique]]) has  information that is critical to proving his innocence and keeping himself out of jail: the tape recording of J.J.'s call to Blue. She tells Robert to meet him at her house. Robert meets up with Mike once more, and asks Mike to set him up with a good lawyer.

At her home, Dahlia agrees to hand over the tape, but reveals she's had a crush on Robert since high school, and blackmails him into letting her have her way with him for the tape. Begrudgingly, Robert accepts her proposal. Having witnessed Robert enter Dahlia's house, Blue - Dahlia's brother - calls Tone, who brings several of his goons over to his location. As Robert sneaks out with the tape, Tone and his people are there to meet him, and begin to jump him. Just as quickly as it begins, the police show up and send a dog after Robert.

Robert manages to get to his car, and a high-speed chase ensues. After being cornered in an alley by Detective Jenkins and several other pursuing units, Robert attempts to give himself up, but Jenkins begins shooting anyway; in the confusion, Robert manages to get away again, and is picked up by Mike. Chased by police cars and surveilled by helicopters, Robert's chase is broadcast across every news network; he tells Mike to head to a church where he has told the lawyer Mike set him up with, Mr. Libowitz ([[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]), he will hand himself over to the authorities. The media and dozens of spectators are there as he arrives. Robert manages to be taken into custody without any harm done to him.

At his trial, the judge believes the tape recording clearly proves Robert was not the shooter and was completely unaware that the vehicle he and J.J. were in at the time was stolen. The felony charges against him are dismissed, and he avoids being convicted of a crime that would have put him behind bars under the "three-strikes" law. However, the opposition points out that Robert did not check in with his probation officer after leaving prison, and Robert is sentenced to 30 days in jail for violating his parole.

Before court is adjourned, Robert's father tells him that he will personally pick him up after he is released. The epilogue states that Rob was eventually released from prison early due to overcrowding.

'''''Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel''''' is the second collection of short stories written by [[Baroness Orczy]] about the gallant English hero, [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] and his League. Written in 1929 the stories, which are listed below, are set in 1793 but appear in no particular order. They occasionally refer to events in other books in the series and Orczy frequently reuses plot lines and ideas from the longer Pimpernel novels.

==Contents==

==="Fie, Sir Percy!"===
Citoyen Lauzet, Chief of section in the rural division of the department [[Seine et Oise]], is perturbed by the Pimpernel's success in rescuing the Comte and Comtesse de Tournon-d'Agenay and their three children from under his nose. Concerned about how he can possibly deal with the English spies, he sends for his friend Armand Chauvelin who has some experience in dealing with the Scarlet Pimpernel. Chauvelin advises Lauzet to pick a family of aristo traitors who will appeal to the English gang (''a pretty woman, an old man, some young children and preferably a nice cripple or imbecile to appeal to their sense of injustice'') and then use them to prime a trap. After selecting some suitable bait in the form of Citizen Desèze, his invalid wife and pretty daughter, they are transported towards Paris in a [[diligence]] with a seemingly weak guard.. however the other travellers in the [[stagecoach]] are really soldiers in disguise – ready to strike back should the Pimpernel and his gang attack.

===The Principal Witness===
In May 1793, committed republicans the widow Leseur and her son Achille run a profitable business selling wine. Their maid-of-all-work Joséphine Palmier, who is pretty and dainty, has caught Achille's eye and having made up his mind that he is in love with her, he asks her to marry him. Joséphine refuses him categorically and firmly, telling him that she can give him no love in return. Incensed at her rejection, he gets his mother to accuse Joséphine of theft, hoping that when faced with the prospect of marrying him or the guillotine, she will pick the former. Joséphine again refuses. In court, she asserts her innocence and accuses Leseur of being a false witness. The Attorney-General tells her she must prove she is innocent but he won't accept her mother's testimony. Joséphine seems unwilling to name another witness to her alibi when suddenly Citizen George Gradin, known as Cyrano, announces to the court that he lives in the same street as her mother and that the Palmiers are frequently visited by an aristocrat, who was at Joséphine's house at the hour in question and is therefore the principal witness. Joséphine pales at this statement and insists that she was home alone with her maman. Cyrano and his gang fail to track down the witness, but back in court denounce Joséphine as an aristocrat whose real name is de Lamoignan and, much to the disgust of Achille, Gradin declares that he will marry her to get even with the mystery aristo...

===The Stranger from Paris===
In January 1793, Citizen Campon, the Chief Commissary of Police in [[Limours]], is still reeling following the rescue of half a dozen aristos from the local comissariat by [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] and his league. Worried about further intervention by the English, he writes to his friend Citizen Chauvelin for advice on what to do next. Chauvelin is unable to leave Paris, but suggests that Campon should secure a pack of aristos (the more innocent and pathetic the better), let people know he has incarcerated them, and wait for the inevitable rescue attempt—taking whatever precautions are necessary. He also assures Campon that by the next day, he will receive help in carrying out his plan from Citizen Mayet, one of the best trackers of criminals and spies known to the committees in Paris. They start to put their plan into action when they hear that the English spies have been spotted at a local abandoned chateâu. Campon takes some men and heads off to investigate, leaving the stranger from Paris in charge of the aristos. Although the plot at first appears to be very similar to elements of ''[[Mam'zelle Guillotine]]'', Orczy throws in an unexpected twist.

==="Fly-By-Night"===
A group of young men who are all ardent royalists, hold secret meetings of the "Club des Fils du Royanne" in the cellar of an old house, where they talk politics and swear allegiance to the young King [[Louis XVII]]. An old wastrel called Servan keeps watch for them during their sittings and normally they don't meet unless he is present. However although Servan is away and they have promised to postpone their next meeting until his return, it's 13 October 1793 and the trial of [[Marie Antoinette]] will begin the following day. Ignoring Servan's warnings, the group call a hurried meeting to discuss the situation but it's not long before the ominous call "''Open in the name of the Republic''" is heard and they are trapped like rats in a burrow. After a good fight, fifteen of the young conspirators are captured and the rest left for dead. It is only the following day that the Chief Commissary realises that one person is missing – Félicien Lézennes, chairman of the Club des Fils du Royanne – but where can he have gone and what fate now awaits his family, who are being watched by spies from the [[Committee of Public Safety]]?

===The Lure of the Old Chateau===
Citizen Fernand Malzieu, is an actor who commands the love of his fellow citizens. A comic genius on the stage, witty, genial and handsome he is adored by women and respected by men, but his popularity has been noticed by the [[Committee of Public Safety]], for they cannot allow a man to remain in such a position of strength. Citizen Chauvelin is on the case and soon realises that he cannot simply arrest Malzieu, so comes up with a plan to discredit the actor and knock him off his popular pedestal.

One day in late September he is visited by a lawyer who tell him that his estranged cousin Désiré Malzieu has died leaving the old family château of Maljovins to Fernand on condition that he lives there. Fernand has always loved the château and rushes to tell his fianceé Céleste at her house in [[St. Brieuc]], where he meets Sir Percy, who is obviously an old friend. On hearing the news of his inheritance, Percy becomes suspicious and warns Fernand to be careful, urging him to leave his first visit to Maljovians for at least a week. Fernand laughs at the thought that someone might want to trap him and resolves to go that very night, but four days later Céleste is scared to death, for Fernand has not been in touch and even missed a dress rehearsal at the theatre.

===In the Tiger's Den===
The league of [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] have been at work near [[Bordet]], rescuing two old ''calotins'' from under the nose of Citizen Sergeant Renault. Banished to Holland for his carelessness, Sergeant Renault is replaced by Citizen Papillon, a special officer sent from Paris to take over the detachment of the National Guard. Papillon is determined to stop the English spies from causing any more trouble, so when he hears that they are hiding out in a derelict cottage he sends his soldiers to capture them. It soon becomes obvious that the situation has been planned by the Pimpernel as a way to distract the guard while he attempts to rescue a group of priests being held at the nearby Duchess Anne tower. However, as soon as Sir Percy climbs up the tower and through the window where the priests are being held, he realises that he has fallen into a trap – for waiting for him in the room are a dozen members of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and his arch enemy Chauvelin. After a brief fight where Percy gets a good thrashing, they tie him securely to a table and lock the door, leaving him a helpless prisoner, little more than an insentient log...

===The Little Doctor===
Late September 1793 in a picturesque corner of [[Brittany]] and the Scarlet Pimpernel and Docteur Lescar are watching a [[schooner]] disappear over the horizon towards England and safety. The old Docteur, who helped Sir Percy save the La Forest family (who are on the schooner), is voicing concern for the Englishman's safety – though not his own, asserting that
"''Even the most hot-headed patriot knows that the country could not afford to send all its doctors to the guillotine''". Despite his confidence, several days later Lescar finds himself being questioned about the English spy by a stranger. Lescar is popular in the area and the crowd in the tavern starts to get uneasy at the treatment of the good Doctor especially when it is revealed that the stranger is none other than Citizen Péret, a member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. Péret senses the atmosphere and backs off, but before long his attention turns to a conversation between three [[sailor|mariners]] / [[smuggling|smugglers]] who are discussing seeing an Englishman (who might be the Pimpernel) being attended by Docteur Lescar in the Rue des Pipots. Péret sends some soldiers to check the address and they report that, although the house was empty, they have found a quantity of smuggled English goods...as well as note addressed to Citizen Dieudonné (one of the mariners) from the Pimpernel arranging to meet him at the usual place at 10pm that evening. Threatened with the [[guillotine]], Dieudonné eventually tells Péret that the trysting place is the house of Docteur Lescar and denounces the little Doctor as a traitor...

===The Chief's Way===
The early days of the league, and Marguerite Blakeney has successfully pleaded with her husband not to take the traitorous Lord Kulmsted (see ''''The Traitor'''' in [[The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel]]) on his latest mission. Several members of the league would have liked to extend the prohibition to young Lord Fanshawe, who, despite a keen start, is wilful &amp; obstinate – an inveterate gambler who is apt to turn very nasty if matters don't go the way he desires.

Fanshawe has, for several years, been in love with Aline, the daughter of The Comte d'Ercourt, whom he first met before the revolution when she was a child of sixteen. At this time Paul Notara, a good-looking teacher at the local school who lived with his mother, was also passionately in love with Aline. After his mother died, Notara declared his love to Aline, but her brother François, finding the schoolteacher in a compromising situation with his sister, beats Paul to within an inch of his life with a riding whip for daring to make love to the daughter of a French aristocrat. Notara is permanently scarred by the attack, losing an eye.

Four years later and the old regime has been swept away. Notara is a republican agitator and the d'Ercourt family are being condemned as traitors. Fanshawe has thoughts for no-one by Aline, but after realising that Notara still has deep feelings for Aline, the Pimpernel wants to save him, as well as the whole d'Ercourt family from their inevitable fate under the [[guillotine]]. Dressed as musicians (see [[Sir Percy Leads the Band]]), the league are able to influence the happenings at the Chateau, but can Sir Percy stop Fanshawe's jealousy from ruining everything?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2416">An '''anamonic''' is a form of [[mnemonic]] device frequently employed by tournament [[Scrabble]] players (the word '''anamonic''' is itself a [[portmanteau]] of '''ana'''gram and mne'''monic'''). It consists of a six or seven letter "stem" (often, but not always, an acceptable word itself), paired with a phrase in which each letter can be added to the stem and rearranged (anagrammed) to form a new word. Typical stems are sets of six or seven letters, as such anamonics aid in learning and in finding valuable seven- and eight-letter bingo ([[British English|UK]]: "bonus") plays. Just as importantly, a player can quickly verify that he or she should not waste valuable time looking for a word in a set of letters that is ruled out by an anamonic.

A successful anamonic will typically have some memorable semantic relationship to the stem.  It will usually avoid unnecessary or easily confused words, which might lead to a misconception of just which letters combine with the [[Plant stem|stem]].

When no vowel combines with the stem, an anamonic phrase will typically make use of multiple vowels that are meant to be ignored.  A skilled Scrabble player will typically be able to verify that at least one of these vowels does not form an acceptable word with the stem, thereby avoiding confusion.

[[Authorship]] of particularly noteworthy anamonics is often acknowledged, although this is not necessarily expected by the Scrabble community.  

==Example anamonic (North American word list)==

TSUNAMI: COASTAL HARM

*TSUNAMI+C = TSUNAMIC
*TSUNAMI+O = MANITOUS TINAMOUS
*TSUNAMI+A = AMIANTUS
*TSUNAMI+S = TSUNAMIS
*TSUNAMI+T = ANTISMUT
*TSUNAMI+L = SIMULANT
*TSUNAMI+H = HUMANIST
*TSUNAMI+R = NATRIUMS NATURISM
*TSUNAMI+M = MANUMITS

==Origin of the term==

The term "anamonics" was coined in a private letter to Nick Ballard in 1993. The coiner was Bob Lipton, who was probably the first or second player in history to make extensive use of anamonics before they even had a name. Lipton's first anamonics were constructed in the summer of 1987. It was Ballard who first popularized the technique in a series of articles published in the now-defunct newsletter "Medleys."

An '''apologue''' or '''apolog''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀπόλογος, a "statement" or "account") is a brief fable or allegorical story with pointed or exaggerated details, meant to serve as a pleasant vehicle for a moral doctrine or to convey a useful lesson without stating it explicitly.  Unlike a [[fable]], the moral is more important than the narrative details.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apologue|volume=2|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the [[parable]], the apologue is a tool of [[rhetoric]]al [[argument]] used to convince or persuade.

Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of [[Jotham]] in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:7-15); "The Belly and its Members," by the patrician [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Agrippa Menenius Lanatus]] in the second book of [[Livy]]; and perhaps most famous of all, those of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Well-known modern examples of this literary form include [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and the [[Br'er Rabbit]] stories derived from African and [[Cherokee]] cultures and recorded and synthesized by [[Joel Chandler Harris]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}  The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects. An apologue is distinguished from a [[fable]] in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as "a satire in action."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

An apologue differs from a [[parable]] in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be ''true'' in the sense that "when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it", while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: "when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it."  The [[parable]] reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don't misbehave or you'll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander).  It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, [[Martin Luther]] thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}} for the main text, but the origin of the examples is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;  The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shonmehta.com/2017/01/calamity.html|title=Calamity|website=www.shonmehta.com|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with [[allegory]], [[metaphor]] and [[imagination]]. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the [[slave]]s, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. It is noteworthy that the two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely [[Aesop]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]. [[La Fontaine]] in France; [[John Gay|Gay]] and [[Robert Dodsley|Dodsley]] in England; [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert|Gellert]], [[Lessing]] and [[Friedrich von Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in Germany; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Tomas de Iriarte]] in Spain, and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]] in Russia, were leading later writers of apologues.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, "Le Coq et la Perle" ("The Cock and the Pearl").&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

''"A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shining amid the straw. “Ho! ho!” quoth he, “that’s for me,” and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? “You may be a treasure,” quoth Master Cock, “to men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls.”''{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On the other hand, in the romances of [[Reynard the Fox]] we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, [[Corti]], is said to have developed an apologue of "The Talking Animals" reaching twenty-six [[canto]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Antoine Houdar de la Motte|La Motte]], writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters [[amour-propre]] by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but [[Rousseau]] contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A work by P. Soullé, ''La Fontaine et ses devanciers'' (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] wrote a propos his ''[[Persian Letters]]'' "There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be ''felt''.  Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy."{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''At Ease''' was an alternative to the [[Macintosh]] [[Desktop computer|desktop]] developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in the early 1990s for the [[classic Mac OS]]. It provided a simple environment for new Macintosh users and young children to help them to work without supervision. At Ease sits on top of the [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] desktop, providing a simple tabbed panel-oriented [[graphical user interface]] in which [[application software|applications]] and [[document]]s are represented by [[icon (computing)|icons]] on large buttons. Aside from its security features, its interface and basic functionality is very similar to the [[Packard Bell Navigator]].

== Features ==
* Panels: at the main At Ease desktop, there are two "panels" which are accessed with tab buttons. One displays your applications and one displays your personal documents. When a panel is full, another is created and you must change the current page.
* Multiple users: at the time At Ease was released, [[System 7]] did not support multiple users. At Ease provided an easy and safe way for Macintosh users to store personal files on their computer and protect them from other people using the same computer.
* Sharing: At Ease allows files to be shared with other users.
* Privileges: the main user (known as the "Administrator" or "Owner") can set what programs and documents the user has access to.
* Security: At Ease allowed passwords to be set for each user, to make sure that one user cannot log on to another user's account

== At Ease for Workgroups ==
At Ease for Workgroups allows users to log on to a server from any workstation that has the At Ease software installed. At Ease for Workgroups introduced a number of network-specific features not found in the original At Ease. The workgroup version enabled client configuration, network access and restrictions on how the client's computer can be used. In addition to the beige-colored Applications "folder" and the blue-colored Documents "folder" that each user had in his or her account, the workgroup version of the software also would allow for easier access to removable media: a pink-colored folder would appear in the user's profile for any CD-ROM inserted into the computer and a green-colored folder would appear for a floppy disk. These features were controlled for each user by the administrator. At Ease for Workgroups also included an Administration program that can add users and workgroups to the network.

At Ease for Workgroups 5 also provided a restricted Finder mode that allowed the Finder to operate instead of the traditional At Ease panels. It provided quick access to the user's documents folder which could be stored on an AppleShare IP server. The restricted Finder mode later evolved into Mac OS 9's multiple users feature.

== At Ease in Mac OS 9 ==
Built-in support for multiple users was implemented into [[Mac OS 9]], bringing all of the features straight into the Mac OS and thus eliminating the need to install and use a different environment.

Even though At Ease was discontinued, certain aspects of its user interface appear in later versions of Mac OS. Its influence upon iOS, Apple's operating system for iPhone and iPad devices, has been [https://web.archive.org/web/20120229040622/http://themacgamer.com/2010/04/28/iphone-os-at-ease/ noted]. There is also a similarity to the productivity-enhancing [https://web.archive.org/web/20100428164511/http://www.applelinks.com/index.php/more/using_the_mac_os_launcher Launcher] Control Panel, in Mac OS 7 and 8. In macOS, the Simple [[Finder (software)|Finder]] is very similar to the idea of At Ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18572|title=OS X Yosemite: Set up a simplified Finder|date=September 23, 2015|website=[[Apple Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2860">The '''Berlin State Ballet''' (German '''Staatsballett Berlin''') is the principal [[ballet]] company in the German capital of [[Berlin]]. It was created in 2004 through a merger of the separate ballet companies of the city's three opera houses at a time when the city was going through a financial crisis. It is one of the largest ballet companies in Western Europe with approximately 90 dancers.

Since 2004, the Berlin State Ballet, alongside the [[Berlin State Opera]], the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], the [[Komische Oper Berlin]] comprise the {{Interlanguage link multi|Stiftung Oper in Berlin|de|3=Stiftung Oper in Berlin|lt=Berlin Opera Foundation}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oper-in-berlin.de/en_EN/news/index/ Oper in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin State Ballet inaugural general and artistic director, dancer and choreographer [[Vladimir Malakhov (dancer)|Vladimir Malakhov]], was a director of the ballet of the [[Berlin State Opera|Berlin Opera]] before the companies merged to form the Berlin State Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pointemagazine.com/call-board-2412800126.html|title=Call Board|date=2001-11-30|work=Pointe|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the company for ten years, creating a mixed repertoire of classical titles and contemporary choreography. A star dancer himself, Malakhov was not only managing, but also performing with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staatsballett-berlin.de/de/ensemble/vladimir-malakhov/114|title=Vladimir  Malakhov|website=www.staatsballett-berlin.de|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Nacho Duato]] became general and artistic director at the Berlin State Ballet with an initial five years term. He created new choreography for the company, and oversaw restagings of some of his signature ballets, created in [[Madrid]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], in Berlin. In 2016, [[Michael Müller (politician)|Michael Mueller]], [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Mayor of Berlin]], announced that the city will not extend Duato's contract with the company when it expires in 2019. [[Sasha Waltz]] and [[Johannes Ohman]] are to succeed him as joint artistic directors of the Berlin State Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/arts/dance/staatsballett-berlin-sasha-waltz-johannes-ohman-to-succeed-nacho-duato.html|title=2 New Faces for Staatsballett Berlin, When Nacho Duato Leaves in 2019|last=Sulcas|first=Roslyn|date=2016-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The life and work of American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have generated various [[Madonna Studies|academic study material]].&lt;ref name="Halls"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Hall|2010|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shelia"&gt;{{harvnb|Jeffreys|2005|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FennerHill"&gt;{{harvnb|Fenner|Hill|2010|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a list containing the different written works about Madonna, including biographies, journals, articles, essays and theses.{{efn|The list does not contain works where Madonna is the secondary theme.

It also excludes books that talks about Madonna in a few pages, or just list her records like the ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.}} According to critic Paul Northup who wrote in ''[[Third Way (magazine)|Third Way]]'' magazine, "Eminent authors and academics have pored over her tirelessly since she burst onto the pop scene in the early Eighties."&lt;ref name="ThirdWay"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h56sBy_z9eUC&amp;pg=PA28|title=Reviews: Madonna Ray of Light|last=Northup|first=Paul|date=April 1998 |accessdate=May 30, 2018|journal=[[Third Way (magazine)|Third Way]]|volume=21|number=3|page=28|issn=0309-3492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors have written more than one book about Madonna and these have been published in multiple languages other than English, including German, French, Dutch, Spanish and Italian.{{efn|Multiple editions of the same release by an author are noted with the different catalogue number in the adjoining reference against the table entry.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammer|Kellner|2009|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist [[Annalee Newitz]], "The academics in the fields of theology to [[queer studies]] have written literally volumes about what Madonna's fame means for gender relations, [[American culture]], and the future."&lt;ref name="Newitz"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1993/09/newitz.html|title=Madonna's Revenge: What Madonna has given to American culture, and culture throughout the world, is not a collection of songs; rather, it is a collection of images.|date=November 1993|accessdate=February 23, 2015|work=[[Bad Subjects]]|issue=9|authorlink=Annalee Newitz|last=Newitz|first=Annalee|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228112705/http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1993/09/newitz.html|archivedate=February 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies released about the singer include ''[[Madonna: An Intimate Biography]]'' (2002) by [[J.

The releases have sometimes become [[bestseller]]s and have faced varied reception from critics and academics. Morton's biography was criticized by Madonna herself and she was also against the release of Ciccone's book, which ultimately led to a rift between the siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/madonnas-brother-christopher-ciccone-defends-kim-davis_us_55ecdda5e4b093be51bbc284|title=Here's Why Madonna's Gay Brother Is Defending Kentucky Clerk Kim Davis|last=Wong|first=Curtis M.|date=July 9, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2018|work=[[HuffPost]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530142232/https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/madonnas-brother-christopher-ciccone-defends-kim-davis_us_55ecdda5e4b093be51bbc284|archivedate=May 30, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different academic essays, dissertations as well as analysis of the singer gave rise to a term called [[Madonna Studies]], denoted by author Robert Miklitsch as a "political-cultural" phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Miklitsch"&gt;{{harvnb|Miklitsch|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Stewart from ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' observed in 1991 that scholars about Madonna's work were increasing in the United States and included professors of English, anthropology as well as media communication. The subject faced ridicule and indignation overseas. [[CBS News]] president [[Fred W. Friendly]] noted, "Writing a major paper is supposed to be an intellectual achievement—a serious matter. Madonna is a media freak. How the media made her—I could see studying that."&lt;ref name="Orlando"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-01-06/news/9101030989_1_madonna-ciccone-madonna-videos-thesis|title=The Madonna Thesis: Is Madonna Just A Well-toned Rock Star, Or Is She Affecting Your View of the World?|date=January 6, 1991|accessdate=February 10, 2015|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|first=Barbara|last=Stewart|pages=1–3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126062811/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-01-06/news/9101030989_1_madonna-ciccone-madonna-videos-thesis|archivedate=January 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlo Maria Maggi''' ([[Milan]], 1630 – Milan, 1699) was an Italian scholar, writer and poet. Despite being an [[Accademia della Crusca]] affiliate, he gained his fame as an author of "dialectal" works (poems and plays) in [[Milanese]] language, for which he is considered the father of [[Milanese literature]]. Maggi's work was a major inspiration source for later Milanese scholars such as [[Carlo Porta]] and [[Giuseppe Parini]].&lt;ref name="answers"/&gt;
[[File:Rime varie di Carlo Maria Maggi.tif|thumb|''Rime varie'', 1688]]

His prominent works belong to the [[commedia dell'arte]] theatrical genre. Some of Maggi's most famous plays in Milanese are ''Il manco male'' (1695), ''Il Barone di Birbanza'' (1696), ''I consigli di Meneghino'' (1697), ''Il falso filosofo'' (1698), and ''Concorso de' Meneghini'' (1699). This last work may be considered as a sort of [[manifesto]] of dialectal poetry, as it explicitly celebrates the virtues of the Milanese language: ''che apposta la pär fä / par dì la veritä'' ("which seems as if it was specifically designed to tell the truth").&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/carlo-maria-maggi Carlo Maria Maggi]&lt;/ref&gt; This equation between the Milanese language (and people) and sincerity is clearly embodied in the ''commedia'' character of [[Meneghino]], which is supposedly Maggi's creation, and was later developed by other authors (most notably Carlo Porta) to eventually become a prominent symbol of Milan and the Milanese for [[antonomasia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sartonidanilo.it/Meneghino_eng.html Meneghino]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another recurring theme of Milanese literature first established by Maggi's works is the celebration of the ''[[Verziere|verzee]]'' (Milan's vegetable market) as the place where the spirit of the city was most genuinely expressed.&lt;ref name="answers"/&gt;

The '''chord-scale system''' is a method of matching, from a list of possible [[chord (music)|chords]], a list of possible [[scale (music)|scales]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge 266"&gt;Mervyn Cooke, David Horn (2003). ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge companion to jazz]]'', p.266. {{ISBN|0-521-66388-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The system has been widely used since the 1970s and is "generally accepted in the [[jazz]] world today".&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Peter (2001). ''Jazz theory handbook'', p.115. {{ISBN|0-7866-5328-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the majority of older players used the chord tone/chord arpeggio method. The system is an example of the difference between the treatment of [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] in jazz and classical [[harmony]]: "Classical treats all notes that don't belong to the chord...as potential dissonances to be [[resolution (music)|resolved]]...Non-classical harmony just tells you which note in the scale to [potentially] [[avoid-note|avoid]]..., meaning that all the others are okay".&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Carl (2002). ''The Piano Handbook'', p.126. {{ISBN|0-87930-727-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chord-scale system may be compared with other common methods of improvisation, first, the older traditional chord tone/chord arpeggio method, and where one scale on one root note is used throughout all chords in a progression (for example the [[blues scale]] on A for all chords of the [[blues progression]]: [[dominant seventh chord|A7]] E7 D7). In contrast, in the chord-scale system, a different scale is used for each chord in the progression (for example [[Mixolydian scale]]s on A, E, and D for chords A7, E7, and D7, respectively).&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; Improvisation approaches may be mixed, such as using "the blues approach" for a section of a progression and using the chord-scale system for the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Reed (2002), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chord-scale A7 and A mixolydian.png|thumb|left|350px|Dominant seventh chord normally paired with mixolydian scale,&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;Reed, Scott (2002). ''Getting Into Guitar Improvising'', p.30. {{ISBN|0-7866-6247-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth mode of the major scale.]]

The scales commonly used today consist of the seven [[musical mode|modes]] of the [[diatonic scale]], the seven modes of the [[minor scale|melodic minor]] scale, the [[octatonic scale|diminished scales]], the [[whole tone scale|whole-tone scale]], and [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] and [[bebop scale]]s.&lt;ref name="Spitzer 43"&gt;Spitzer (2001), p.43 and 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In the example below featuring C7#11 and C lydian dominant every note of the scale may be considered a chord tone&lt;ref name="Spitzer 43"/&gt; while in the example above featuring A7 and A mixolydian the scale is thought of as a 'filling in' of the steps that are missing between members of the chord.&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; Students now typically learn as many as twenty-one scales, which may be compared with the four scales commonly used in jazz in the 1940s (major, minor, mixolydian, and blues) and the two later added by bebop (diminished and whole-tone) to the tonal resources of jazz.&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 123"&gt;Cooke &amp; Horn (2003), p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thirteenth chord C lydian dominant.png|thumb|right|350px|The corresponding scale for the [[Eleventh|C7{{music|sharp}}11 chord]], with added 9th and 13th tensions, is C [[Lydian dominant scale|lydian dominant]], the fourth mode of the ascending melodic minor.&lt;ref name="Spitzer 43"/&gt;]]

Originating with [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s ''[[Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization]]'' (1959),&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 123"/&gt; the chord-scale system is now the "most widely used method for teaching [[jazz improvisation]] in college".&lt;ref name="Ake"&gt;Ake, David Andrew (2002). ''Jazz Cultures''. p.122. {{ISBN|0-520-22889-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is found in instructional books including [[Jerry Bergonzi]]'s ''Inside Improvisation'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerrybergonzi.com/books.htm|title=Jerry Bergonzi – books|publisher=Advance Music|accessdate=Jul 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized by the highly influential&lt;ref name="Ake"/&gt; ''Play-A-Long'' series by [[Jamey Aebersold]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge 266"/&gt; There are differences of approach within the system. For example, Russell associated the C major chord with the lydian scale, while teachers including [[John Mehegan]], [[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]], and Mark Levine teach the major scale as the best match for a C major chord.&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 123"/&gt;

Miles Davis's ''Lydian Chromatic Concept''-influenced first [[modal jazz]] album ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', is often given as an example of chord-scale relationships in practice.&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 192"&gt;Cooke &amp; Horn (2003), p.192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chord-scale system provides familiarity with typical chord progressions, technical facility from practicing scales and chord [[arpeggio]]s, and generally succeeds in reducing "clams", or notes heard as mistakes (through providing note-choice possibilities for the chords of progressions), and building "chops", or virtuosity.&lt;ref name="C&amp;S 267"&gt;Cooke, Horn (2003), p.267.&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantages include the exclusion of non-chord tones characteristic of bop and free styles, the "in-between" sounds featured in the blues, and consideration of directionality created between the interaction of a solo and a chord progression: "The disadvantages of this system may become clear when students begin to question why their own playing does not sound like such outstanding linear-oriented players as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Sonny Stitt]] or [[Johnny Griffin]] (or, for that matter, the freer jazz stylists)":&lt;ref name="C&amp;S 267"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The chord-scale method's 'vertical' approach...is 'static,' offering little assistance in generating musical direction through the movement of chords. Hence the importance of knowing the older chord tone approach. But...Swing- and bop-era songforms operate teleologically with regard to harmony. Highly regarded soloists in those styles typically imply the movements of chords...either by creating lines that voice-lead smoothly from one chord to another or by confounding the harmony pull through anticipating or delaying harmonic resolution.&lt;ref name="Ake 126"&gt;Ake (2002), p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essential considerations of a style such as Charlie Parker's, including "rhythm, phrase shape and length, dynamics, and [[timbre|tone color]]," as well as "[[passing tone]]s, [[appoggiatura]], and '[[blue note]]s'" are unaddressed.&lt;ref name="Ake 126"/&gt; This appears to have led educators to emphasize a specific repertoire of pieces most appropriate to the chord-scale system, such as [[John Coltrane]]'s "[[Giant Steps]]", while excluding others, such as Coltrane's later styles of composition, and producing generations of "pattern" players among college-educated musicians.&lt;ref name="Ake 126"/&gt;

'''Daniel Decatur "Dan" Emmett''' (October 29, 1815 – June 28, 1904)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5971798 Findagrave: Dan Emmett]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American songwriter, entertainer, and founder of the first troupe of the [[blackface]] minstrel tradition, the [[Virginia Minstrels]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Music'', Oxford University Press 1955 ([[Percy A. Scholes]], ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Of [[Irish American|Irish ancestry]], Dan Emmett was born in [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]], then a frontier region.  Growing up with little formal education, he learned popular tunes from his musical mother, and taught himself to play the fiddle. At age 13, he became an apprentice printer and enlisted in the United States Army. He became an expert fifer and drummer at Newport Barracks, [[Newport, Kentucky]], and published his own Fifer’s and Drummer’s Guide in 1862 in cooperation with [[George G. Bruce]]. After receiving his discharge from the army on July 8, 1835, he joined a Cincinnati circus. In 1840–1842 he toured with Angevine and other circuses as a blackface banjoist and singer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08773?q=dan+emmett&amp;article_section=all&amp;search=article&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit at www.oxfordmusiconline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Emmett was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSLCS7hg-DEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Daniel%20Emmett&amp;f=false|title=The Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi : a history|last=1951–|first=Newton, Michael,|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|year=|isbn=9780786457045|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=95|oclc=567910513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In association with [[Billy Whitlock]], [[Dick Pelham]], and [[Frank Brower]], he organized the [[Virginia Minstrels]], which made their first appearance before a paying audience at the Chatham Theatre in New York City in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Whitlock, who detailed the beginnings of the group, stated that the event was a benefit for Pelham. See Lawrence Hutton, "The Negro on the Stage," ''Harpers New Monthly Magazine'', June 1889, p. 140. Such an event occurred on January 31. See ''The New York Herald'', January 31, 1843, p. 3. The following day the ''Herald'' reported that the troupe would be appearing at the Bowery Amphitheatre, and an advertisement in February 6 issue refers to their first performance that evening.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although blackface performance, in which white men painted their faces and hands black and impersonated caricatures of African-American men and women, was already an established performance mode at that time&amp;mdash;[[Thomas D. Rice]] had created the character of [[Jump Jim Crow|Jim Crow]] nearly a decade earlier, and blackface had been widely popular ever since&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~amerimus/Minstrelsy.html |title=Blackface Minstrelsy |publisher=Center for American Music, [[University of Pittsburgh]] |accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;Emmett's group is said to be the first to "black up" an entire band rather than one or two performers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The group's full-length blackface performance is generally considered to have been the first true [[minstrel show]]: previous blackface acts were usually either an [[entr'acte]] for a play or one of many acts in a comic variety show.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Emmett is traditionally credited with writing the famous song "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]." The story that he related about its composition varied each time he told it, but the main points were that he composed the song in New York City while a member of [[Bryant's Minstrels]]. The song was first performed by Emmett and the Bryants at [[Mechanics' Hall, New York City|Mechanics' Hall]] in New York City on April 4, 1859. The song became a runaway hit, especially in [[Southern United States|the South]], and the piece for which Emmett was most well known. Emmett himself reportedly told a fellow minstrel: "If I had known to what use they [Southerners] were going to put my song, I will be damned if I'd have written it."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Col. T. Allston Brown to T.C. De Leon. Published in De Leon, ''Belles, Beaux, and Brains'' and quoted in Nathan 275.&lt;/ref&gt; After the South began using his song as a rallying call, Emmett wrote the fife-and-drum manual for the Union Army. Emmett's song was a favorite of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], who said after the war ended in 1865, "I have always thought that 'Dixie' was one of the best tunes I ever heard... I insisted yesterday that we had fairly captured it."&lt;ref&gt;Speech given on April 10, 1865 and quoted in Hall 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another writer named [[William Shakespeare Hays]] (1837–1907) (pen name: Will S. Hays) claimed to be its true author.&lt;ref&gt;Abel, E. Lawrence (2000). ''Singing the New Nation: How Music Shaped the Confederacy, 1861–1865''. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Snowden Family Band|Snowden Family]] of [[Knox County, Ohio]], have also been named as writers of the song.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Howard L. and Sacks, Judith Rose (1993). ''Way up North in Dixie: A Black Family's Claim to the Confederate Anthem''. Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and posthumous recognition ==
After a tour that was notably successful in the South, Emmett retired to his hometown of Mount Vernon in 1888&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally taking part in performances: "Dan Emmett, whenever he is physically able and can get the chance, 'rosins his bow' for a dance party in Chicago."''New York Times'', July 10, 1887: 'Drop-Curtain Monographs'&lt;/ref&gt; where he died on June 28, 1904, aged 88 years. From 1893 to the time of his death, he was aided by a weekly allowance from the [[Actors Fund|Actors Fund of America]]. Emmett was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970. A [[biographical film]] of his life was produced in 1943, titled [[Dixie (film)|''Dixie'']]. Starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]], it is a [[musical film|musical]] directed by [[A. Edward Sutherland]].
 
Numerous schools, businesses, and other institutions in Mount Vernon, Ohio, are named after Emmett. The official memorial to him is a large boulder with a placard attached located in front of the Knox County Historical Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/06/05/15/dan.emmett.html Dan Emmett memorial re-dedicated | mountvernonnews.com&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094306/http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/06/05/15/dan.emmett.html|date=September 29, 2007}} at www.mountvernonnews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmett published at least 30 songs between 1843 and 1865, most of which are banjo tunes or walk-arounds. Between 1859 and 1869, he composed another 25 tunes that are in manuscript at the Ohio Historical Society in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08773?q=dan+emmett&amp;article_section=all&amp;search=article&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit at www.oxfordmusiconline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered by [[Diana Deutsch]] in 1973, '''Deutsch's "scale illusion"''' is an [[auditory illusion]] in which principles of grouping by [[frequency]], [[proximity space|proximity]], and spatial [[Sound localization|location]] are put into conflict and in which frequency proximity wins out.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, Albert (1994). ''Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound'', p.76. {{ISBN|0-262-52195-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by simultaneous ascending and descending [[major scale]]s beginning in separate [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] channels with each successive [[note (music)|note]] being switched to the opposite [[stereo channel|channel]]. With the left channel: C'-D-A-F--A-D-C'; and the right: C-B-E-G-E-B-C; the ear hears both: C'-B-A-G--A-B-C'; and: C-D-E-F--E-D-C. The tones are equal-amplitude [[sine wave]]s, and the sequence is played [[repeat sign|repeatedly]] without [[rest (music)|pause]] at a rate of four tones per second. (Listen to the Stereo Sound Example linked below.)

When listening to the illusion over [[headphone]]s, most [[handedness|right-handers]] hear a [[melody]] corresponding to the higher tones as on the right and a melody corresponding to the lower tones as on the left. When the earphone positions are reversed, the higher tones continue to appear to be coming from the right and the lower tones from the left. Other people experience different illusions, such as the higher tones on the left and the lower tones on the right, or a pattern in which the sounds appear to be localized in different and changing ways. [[Right-handedness|Right-handers]] and [[Left-handedness|left-handers]] differ statistically in how the scale illusion is perceived.

In a clinical study, patients with [[hemispatial neglect]] were shown to experience the scale illusion. Further, in an MEG study on normal listeners the scale illusion was found to be neurally represented at or near the auditory cortex.

In [[economics]], '''dynamic inconsistency''' or '''time inconsistency''' is a situation in which a decision-maker's [[preferences]] change over [[time]] in such a way that a preference can become [[inconsistent]] at another point in time. This can be thought of as there being many different "selves" within decision makers, with each "self" representing the decision-maker at a different point in time; the inconsistency occurs when not all preferences are aligned.

The term "dynamic inconsistency" is more closely affiliated with [[game theory]], whereas "time inconsistency" is more closely affiliated with [[behavioral economics]].{{Vague|date=March 2009}}{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==In game theory==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2009}}
In the context of [[game theory]], dynamic inconsistency is a situation in a [[dynamic game]] where a player's best plan for some future period will not be optimal when that future period arrives. A dynamically inconsistent game is [[subgame perfect equilibrium|subgame imperfect]]. In this context, the inconsistency is primarily about [[Personal commitment|commitment]] and [[Non-credible threat|credible threats]]. This manifests itself through a violation of [[Bellman's Principle of Optimality]] by the leader or dominant player, as shown in {{harvs |last1=Simaan|last2=Cruz|year=1973a|year2=1973b|txt=yes }}.

For example, a [[business|firm]] might want to commit itself to dramatically dropping the [[price]] of a product it sells if a rival firm enters its [[Market (economics)|market]]. If this threat were credible, it would discourage the rival from entering. However, the firm might not be able to commit its future self to taking such an action because if the rival does in fact end up entering, the firm's future self might determine that, given the fact that the rival is now actually in the market and there is no point in trying to discourage entry, it is now not in its interest to dramatically drop the price. As such, the threat would not be credible. The present self of the firm has preferences that would have the future self be committed to the threat, but the future self has preferences that have it not carry out the threat. Hence, the dynamic inconsistency.&lt;!-- game theory has the idea of making binding commitments to avoid these inconsistencies; we should link to an article covering these commitments. --&gt;

==In behavioral economics==
In the context of [[behavioral economics]], time inconsistency is related to how each different self of a decision-maker may have different preferences over current and future choices.

Consider, for example, the following question:
*(a) Which do you prefer, to be given 500 dollars today or 505 dollars tomorrow?  
*(b) Which do you prefer, to be given 500 dollars 365 days from now or 505 dollars 366 days from now?
When this question is asked, to be time-consistent, one must make the same choice for (b) as for (a). According to [[George Loewenstein]] and [[Drazen Prelec]], however, people are not always consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, G. and D. Prelec (1992), "Anomalies in Intertemporal Choice: Evidence and an Interpretation", ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 107, 2, pp. 573–597.&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to choose "500 dollars today" and "505 dollars 366 days later", which is different from the time-consistent answer.

One common way in which selves may differ in their preferences is they may be modeled as all holding the view that "[[Present (time)|now]]" has especially high value compared to any future time. This is sometimes called the "immediacy effect" or "[[temporal discounting]]". As a result, the present self will care too much about himself and not enough about his future selves. The [[self control]] literature relies heavily on this type of time inconsistency, and it relates to a variety of topics including [[procrastination]], [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]], efforts at [[weight loss]], and saving for [[retirement]].

Time inconsistency basically means that there is disagreement between a decision-maker's different selves about what actions should be taken. Formally, consider an [[economic model]] with different mathematical [[weighting]]s placed on the [[Utility|utilities]] of each self. Consider the possibility that for any given self, the weightings that self places on all the utilities could differ from the weightings that another given self places on all the utilities. The important consideration now is the relative weighting between two particular utilities. Will this relative weighting be the same for one given self as it is for a different given self? If it is, then we have a case of time consistency. If the relative weightings of all pairs of utilities are all the same for all given selves, then the decision-maker has time-consistent preferences. If there exists a case of one relative weighting of utilities where one self has a different relative weighting of those utilities than another self has, then we have a case of time inconsistency and the decision-maker will be said to have time-inconsistent preferences.

It is common in [[economic model]]s that involve decision-making over time to assume that decision-makers are [[Exponential discounting|exponential discounters]]. Exponential discounting posits that the decision maker assigns future utility of any good according to the formula

:&lt;math&gt;U(t) = U(0) e^{-\rho t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; is the present, &lt;math&gt;U(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the utility assigned to the good if it were consumed immediately, and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the "discount factor", which is the same for all goods and constant over time. Mathematically, it is the unique continuous function that satisfies the equation

:&lt;math&gt; U(t_1)/U(t_2) = U(t_1+c)/U(t_2+c);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the ratio of utility values for a good at two different moments of time only depends on the interval between these times, but not on their choice. (If you're willing to pay 10% over list price to buy a new phone today instead of paying list price and having it delivered in a week, you'd also be willing to pay extra 10% to get it one week sooner if you were ordering it six months in advance.)

If &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the same for all goods, then it is also the case that

:&lt;math&gt; U_A(t_1)/U_B(t_1) = U_A(t_2)/U_B(t_2);&lt;/math&gt;

that is, if good A is assigned higher utility than good B at time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, that relationship also holds at all other times. (If you'd rather eat broccoli than cake tomorrow for lunch, you'll also pick broccoli over cake if you're hungry right now.)

Exponential discounting yields time-consistent preferences. Exponential discounting and, more generally, time-consistent preferences are often assumed in [[rational choice theory]], since they imply that all of a decision-maker's selves will agree with the choices made by each self. Any decision that the individual makes for himself in advance will remain valid (i.e., an optimal choice) as time advances, unless utilities themselves change.

However, [[empirical]] research makes a strong case that time inconsistency is, in fact, standard in [[human]] preferences. This would imply disagreement by people's different selves on decisions made and a rejection of the time consistency aspect of rational choice theory.

For example, consider having the choice between getting the day off work tomorrow or getting a day and a half off work one month from now. Suppose you would choose one day off tomorrow. Now suppose that you were asked to make that same choice ten years ago. That is, you were asked then whether you would prefer getting one day off in ten years or getting one and a half days off in ten years and one month. Suppose that then you would have taken the day and a half off. This would be a case of time inconsistency because your relative preferences for tomorrow versus one month from now would be different at two different points in time—namely now versus ten years ago. The decision made ten years ago indicates a preference for delayed gratification, but the decision made just before the fact indicates a preference for immediate pleasure.

More generally, humans have a systematic tendency to switch towards "vices" (products or activities which are pleasant in the short term) from "virtues" (products or activities which are seen as valuable in the long term) as the moment of consumption approaches, even if this involves changing decisions made in advance.

One way that time-inconsistent preferences have been formally introduced into economic models is by first giving the decision-maker standard exponentially discounted preferences, and then adding another term that heavily discounts any time that is not now. Preferences of this sort have been called "present-biased preferences". The [[hyperbolic discounting]] model is another commonly used model that allows one to obtain more realistic results with regard to human decision-making.

A different form of dynamic inconsistency arises as a consequence of "projection bias" (not to be confused with a [[projection bias|defense mechanism]] of the same name). Humans have a tendency to mispredict their future [[Marginal utility|marginal utilities]] by assuming that they will remain at present levels. This leads to inconsistency as marginal utilities (for example, tastes) change over time in a way that the individual did not expect. For example, when individuals are asked to choose between a piece of fruit and an unhealthy snack (such as a candy bar) for a future meal, the choice is strongly affected by their "current" level of hunger. Individuals may become addicted to smoking or drugs because they underestimate future marginal utilities of these habits (such as craving for cigarettes) once they become addicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=George Loewenstein |last2=O'Donoghue |first2=T. |last3=Rabin |first3=M. |title=Projection Bias in Predicting Future Utility |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=118 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=1209–1248 |url=http://economics.cornell.edu/CAE/Project.pdf |doi=10.1162/003355303322552784 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616195737/http://economics.cornell.edu/CAE/Project.pdf |archivedate=June 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylized examples==
*In a game theory context, an announced government policy of never negotiating with terrorists over the release of hostages constitutes a time inconsistency example, since in each particular hostage situation the authorities face the dilemma of breaking the rule and trying to save the hostages. Assuming the government acted consistently in not ever breaking the rule, it would make it irrational for a terrorist group to take hostages. (Of course, in the real world terrorists might not act rationally.)
*Students, the night before an [[exam]], often wish that the exam could be put off for one more day. If asked on that night, such students might agree to commit to paying, say, $10 on the day of the exam for it to be held the next day. Months before the exam is held, however, students generally do not care much about having the exam put off for one day. And, in fact, if the students were made the same offer at the beginning of the [[academic term|term]], that is, they could have the exam put off for one day by committing during registration to pay $10 on the day of the exam, they probably would reject that offer. The choice is the same, although made at different points in time. Because the outcome would change depending on the point in time, the students would exhibit time inconsistency.

{{Anchor|Monetary policy inconsistency}}
*[[Monetary policy]] makers suffer from dynamic inconsistency with [[inflation]] expectations, as politicians are best off promising lower [[inflation]] in the future. But once tomorrow comes lowering inflation may have negative effects, such as increasing [[unemployment]], so they do not make much effort to lower it. This is why [[Central bank#Independence|independent]] [[central bank]]s are believed to be advantageous for a country. Indeed, "a central bank with a high degree of discretion in conducting monetary policy would find itself under constant political pressure to boost the economy and reduce unemployment, but since the economy cannot exceed its potential GDP or its [[natural rate of unemployment]] over time, this policy would instead only lead to higher inflation [[Long run and short run|in the long run]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christopher Crowe| author2 = Ellen E. Meade|title=The Evolution of Central Bank Governance Around the World| journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]| date=Fall 2007 |volume=21 |issue =4| pages =69–90|doi=10.1257/jep.21.4.69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first paper on this subject was published by [[Finn E. Kydland]] and [[Edward C. Prescott]] in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' in 1977, which eventually led to their winning the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = [[Finn E.

*One famous example in literature of a mechanism for dealing with dynamic inconsistency is that of [[Odysseus]] and the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]]. Curious to hear the Sirens' songs but mindful of the danger, Odysseus orders his men to stop their ears with beeswax and ties himself to the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] of the ship.  Most importantly, he orders his men not to heed his cries while they pass the Sirens; recognizing that in the future he may behave irrationally, Odysseus limits his future agency and binds himself to a [[Commitment device|commitment mechanism]] (i.e., the mast) to survive this perilous example of dynamic inconsistency. This example has been used by economists to explain the benefits of commitment mechanisms in mitigating dynamic inconsistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Martin Wolf]] | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Why_Globalization_Works.html?id=mpv_P3kmoC4C  |title=Why Globalization Works |chapter=  The Market Crosses Borders |page= 91 |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2004 |location= New Haven, CT |isbn= 9780300102529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A curious case of dynamic inconsistency in psychology is described by {{harvtxt|Read|Loewenstein|Kalyanaraman|1999}}. In the experiment, subjects of the study were offered free rentals of movies which were classified into two categories - "lowbrow" (e.g., ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'') and "highbrow" (e.g., ''[[Schindler's List]]'') - and researchers analyzed patterns of choices made. In the absence of dynamic inconsistency, the choice would be expected to be the same regardless of the delay between the decision date and the consumption date. In practice, however, the outcome was different. When subjects had to choose a movie to watch immediately, the choice was consistently lowbrow for the majority of the subjects. But when they were asked to pick a movie to be watched at later date, highbrow movies were chosen far more often. Among movies picked four or more days in advance, over 70% were highbrow.
*People display a consistent bias to believe that they will have more time in the future than they have today. Specifically, there is a persistent belief among people that they are "unusually busy in the immediate future, but will become less busy shortly". However, the amount of time you have this week is generally representative of the time you have in future weeks. When people are estimating their time and when deciding if they will make a commitment, they anticipate more "time slack" in future weeks than the present week. Experiments by {{harvtxt|Zauberman|Lynch|2005}} on this topic showed that people tend to discount investments of time more than money. They nicknamed this the "Yes...Damn!" effect because people tend to commit themselves to time-consuming activities like traveling to a conference under the false impression that they will be less busy in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Wayne McIntyre| title=Watch Out for the 'Yes, Damn!'

'''Eastern Bloc media and propaganda''' was controlled directly by each country's [[Communist party]], which controlled the [[state media]], [[censorship]] and [[propaganda]] organs. State and party ownership of print, television and radio media served as an important manner in which to control information and society in light of [[Eastern Bloc]] leaderships viewing even marginal groups of  [[soviet dissident|opposition intellectuals]] as a potential threat to the bases underlying Communist power therein.

Circumvention of dissemination controls occurred to some degree through [[samizdat]] and limited reception of western radio and television broadcasts. In addition, some regimes heavily restricted the flow of information from their countries to outside of the Eastern Bloc by heavily regulating the travel of foreigners and segregating approved travellers from the domestic population.

==Background==

===Creation===
[[File:EasternBlocAfter.svg|right|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Eastern Bloc]] (until 31 December 1992)]]
[[Bolsheviks]] took power following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, coinciding with the [[Red Army]]'s entry into [[Minsk]] in 1919, Belarus was declared the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]]. After more conflict, the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was declared in 1920. With the defeat of the [[Ukraine]] in the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]], after the March 1921 [[Peace of Riga]] following the [[Polish–Soviet War]], central and eastern Ukraine were annexed into the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1922, the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Ukraine SSR]], Byelorussian SSR and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|officially merged]] as republics creating the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ([[Soviet Union]]).

At the end of [[World War II]], all eastern and central European capitals were controlled by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="wettig69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final stages of the war, the Soviet Union began the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by occupying several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were originally effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. These included eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; part of eastern [[Finland]] (became [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northeastern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name="stalinswars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirer794"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1945, these additional annexed countries totaled approximately 180,000 further square miles (465,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or slightly more than the area of West Germany, East Germany and Austria combined.&lt;ref name="graubard150"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graubard|1991|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],&lt;ref name="granville"&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of Romania]], the [[People's Republic of Albania]],&lt;ref name="cook17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[East Germany]] from the Soviet zone of German occupation.&lt;ref name="wettig96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] was also wrongfully considered part of the Bloc,&lt;ref name="crampton216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=216–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern bloc'', ''The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition.

Throughout the Eastern Bloc, both in the Soviet Socialist Republic and elsewhere, Russia was given prominence, and referred to as the ''naibolee vıdayuşayasya naciya'' (the most prominent nation) and the ''rukovodyaşy narod'' (the leading people).&lt;ref name="graubard150"/&gt; The Soviets encouraged the admiration of everything Russian and the reproduction of their own Communist structural hierarchies in each of the Bloc states.&lt;ref name="graubard150"/&gt;

The defining characteristic of Communism as implemented in the Eastern Bloc was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.&lt;ref name="hardt11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], multi-party governance (dubbed "[[bourgeois democracy]]" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.&lt;ref name="hardt12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviets mandated expropriation and ''etatization'' of private property.&lt;ref name="roht83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet-style "replica regimes" that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet [[command economy|command economies]], but also adopted the methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.&lt;ref name="roht83"/&gt; Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc saw even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the basis underlying Communist power.&lt;ref name="Pollackxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression of dissidence and opposition was a central prerequisite for the security of Communist power within the Eastern Bloc, though the degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and period.&lt;ref name="Pollackxiv"/&gt;

While over 15 million Eastern Bloc residents migrated westward from 1945 to 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|pp=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; emigration was effectively halted in the early 1950s, with the Soviet approach to controlling national movement emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref name="dowty114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Eastern Bloc experienced economic mis-development by central planners resulting in those countries following a path of extensive rather than intensive development, and thus lagging far behind their western European counterparts in per capita Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name="hardt15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and information control===
{{further|Deutscher Fernsehfunk|Rundfunk der DDR|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia|Soviet Information Bureau}}
In the [[Eastern Bloc]], the state owned and operated the means of mass communication.&lt;ref name="frucht489"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ruling authorities viewed media as a propaganda tool, and widely practiced censorship to exercise almost full control over the information dissemination.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt;  The press in Communist countries was an organ of, and completely reliant on, the state.&lt;ref name="oneil15"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the late 1980s, all Eastern Bloc radio and television organizations were state-owned (and tightly controlled), while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local Communist party.&lt;ref name="oneil25"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth newspapers and magazines were owned by youth organizations affiliated with the communist party.&lt;ref name="oneil25"/&gt;  The governing body in the Soviet Union was "USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting", or USSR Gosteleradio (Государственный комитет по телевидению и радиовещанию СССР, Гостелерадио СССР), which was in charge both of [[Soviet TV]] and [[Radio in the Soviet Union]].

The Communist party exercised control over the media and was responsible for censorship.&lt;ref name="oneil25"/&gt; Media served as an important form of control over information and thus of society.&lt;ref name="oneil1"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eastern Bloc authorities viewed the dissemination and portrayal of knowledge as vital to the survival of Communism and thus stifled alternative concepts and critiques.&lt;ref name="oneil1"/&gt;  Several state Communist Party newspapers were published. Radio was initially the dominant medium, with television being considered low on the priority list when compiling [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-year plans]] during the [[industrialisation]] of the 1950s.

===Censorship and squashing of dissent===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|image2=The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|width=180|caption2=[[Nikolai Yezhov]], the young man strolling with [[Joseph Stalin]] to his right, was shot in 1940.

{{further|Censorship in East Germany|Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|Censorship in the Soviet Union|   Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Anti-Soviet agitation}}
Strict censorship existed in the Eastern Bloc, though it was at times circumvented by those engaging in [[samizdat]].&lt;ref name="major6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorship institutions in the countries of the Bloc were organized differently.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; For example, censorship in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] was clearly identified whereas it was loosely structured, but no less efficient, in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; Strict censorship was introduced in the [[People's Republic of Albania]] and [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] as early as 1944, though it was somewhat relaxed in Yugoslavia after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] of 1948.&lt;ref name="frucht127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the rest of the Eastern Bloc, relative freedom existed for three years in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] until Soviet-style censorship was fully applied in 1948,&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; along with the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]].

Throughout the Bloc, the various ministries of culture held a tight rein on writers.&lt;ref name="major15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural products reflected the propaganda needs of the state&lt;ref name="major15"/&gt; and Party-approved censors exercised strict control in the early years.&lt;ref name="crampton247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Stalinist period, even the weather forecasts were changed if they would have otherwise suggested that the sun might not shine on [[May Day]].&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt;  Under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], weather reports were doctored so that the temperatures were not seen to rise above or fall below the levels which dictated that work must stop.&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt;

In each country, leading bodies of the ruling Communist Part exercised hierarchical control of the censorship system.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; Each Communist Party maintained a department of its [[Central Committee]] apparatus to supervise media.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  Censors employed auxiliary tools such as: the power to launch or close down any newspaper, radio or television station, licensing of journalists through unions and the power of appointment.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; Party bureaucrats held all leading editorial positions.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  One or two representatives of censorship agencies modeled on the Soviet GLAVLIT (Main Administration for the Protection of Official and Military Secrets) worked directly in all editorial offices.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  No story could be printed or broadcast without their explicit approval.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;

Initially, [[East Germany]] presented unique issues because of rules for the occupying powers in the divided Germany (e.g. regarding media control) that prevented the outright seizure of all media outlets.&lt;ref name="pike219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet occupation administration (SVAG) directed propaganda and censorship policies to East German censorship organs through its "sector for propaganda and censorship".&lt;ref name="pike217"/&gt; While the initial SVAG policies did not appear to differ greatly from those in the western occupation zones governing [[denazification]],&lt;ref name="pike220"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=220–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; censorship became one of the most overt instruments used to manipulate political, intellectual and cultural developments in East Germany.&lt;ref name="pike217"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=217–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art societies and associations that had existed prior to World War II were dissolved and all new theatres and art societies had to register with SVAG.&lt;ref name="pike221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art exhibits were put under a blanket ban unless censorship organs approved them in advance.&lt;ref name="pike221"/&gt;

After East Germany's official establishment, while the original constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ddr/verfddr1949.html October 7, 1949 Constitution of East Germany], German Document Archive {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided that "censorship of the media is not to occur", both official and unofficial censorship occurred, although to a lesser extent during its later years. Thereafter, official East German censorship was supervised and carried out by two governmental organizations, the ''Head office for publishing companies and bookselling trade'' (Hauptverwaltung Verlage und Buchhandel, HV), and the ''Bureau for Copyright'' (Büro für Urheberrechte). The HV determined the degree of censorship and the method of publishing and marketing works. The Bureau for Copyright appraised the work, then decided if it or another publication was permitted to be published in East Germany or in foreign country. For theatres, a "repertory commission" was created that consisted of the ''Ministerium für Volksbildung'' (MfV), the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the applicable theatre union and the East German office for theatrical affairs.&lt;ref name="pike236"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long visa procurement process, western visitors driving over the West German border to East Germany had their car strip-searched for prohibited Western "propaganda material."&lt;ref name="philipsen9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Philipsen|1993|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the East German authorities found it extremely difficult to prevent their citizens listening to Western radio stations and [[ARD (broadcaster)|Western TV]] was available across most of the GDR. Technical and diplomatic considerations meant attempts at [[Radio jamming|jamming]] Western Stations were (unlike in other Eastern bloc countries) soon abandoned.

In the Soviet Union, in accordance with the official ideology and politics of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]], [[Goskomizdat]] censored all printed matter, [[Goskino]] supervised all [[film|cinema]], [[Gosteleradio]] controlled radio and television broadcasting and the [[First Department]] in many agencies and institutions, such as the State Statistical Committee ([[Goskomstat]]), was responsible for assuring that state secrets and other sensitive information only reached authorized hands. The Soviets destroyed pre-revolutionary and foreign material from libraries, leaving only "special collections" (''[[spetskhran]]''), accessible by special permit from the [[KGB]]. The [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union also censored images]], included removing repressed persons from texts, posters, paintings and photographs.

Throughout the Eastern Bloc, artists or those attempting to disseminate dissenting views were repressed, with a few of the more prominent victims including:

Other artists, such as [[Geo Bogza]], used subtle imagery or allegories within their works to criticize regimes.

==List of media entities==
{{Further|Printed media in the Soviet Union|Television in the Soviet Union|Radio in the Soviet Union|Internet in the Soviet Union}}&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt;
The major newspapers were traditionally the daily official publications of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; Newspapers served as the main party organs of record and provided official political roadmaps for officials and other readers who needed to be informed.&lt;ref name="frucht639"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=639}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, the press provided a significant source of income for the ruling Communist parties.&lt;ref name="frucht639"/&gt; Radio and television was controlled by the state.&lt;ref name="frucht490"/&gt;  The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS) was the central agency for collection and distribution of internal and international news for all Soviet newspapers, radio and television stations. TASS monopolized the supply of political news.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; It was frequently infiltrated by Soviet intelligence and security agencies, such as the [[NKVD]] and [[GRU]]. TASS had affiliates in 14 Soviet republics, including the [[Lithuanian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], [[Estonian SSR]], [[Moldavian SSR]]. [[Ukrainian SSR]] and [[Byelorussian SSR]].

Despite outward similarities in press policy, large differences existed in the roles and functions of the mass media in Eastern Bloc countries.&lt;ref name="frucht640"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the press was allowed more freedom, such as in Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, a national subtext and a significant element of entertainment flourished.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt; In some cases, newspapers and magazines served as the most visible part of liberalizing forces, such as in Poland in 1956 and 1980–81, in Hungary in 1956, and in Czechoslovakia in 1968.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;

In many instances toward the end of the Eastern Bloc's existence, the ruling Communist parties' messages in the press increasingly diverged from reality, which contributed to the declining faith of the public in Communist rule.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;  At the same time, some press in the Eastern Bloc became more open in the 1980s in countries such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;  In Yugoslavia, the press after Tito's reign turned increasingly nationalistic.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt; Only in Romania and Albania did the press remain under tight dictatorial control right up until the end of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;

In [[East Germany]], where initial control could be less overt because of shared allied occupation rules, the Soviet SVG set up the Deutsche Verwaltung für Volksbildung (DVV) in the fall of 1945.&lt;ref name="pike217"/&gt; The SVAG and DVV controlled and approved all publication licenses needed to publish newspapers, books, journals and other materials.&lt;ref name="pike225"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=225–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those agencies also provided the top publishing priorities and would apportion paper used for printing to the various publications in accordance with those priorities.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt; The SVAG initially licensed some private publishers which required the employment of a greater number of censors.&lt;ref name="pike227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control of information flow out of the Eastern Bloc==
Beginning in 1935, [[Joseph Stalin]] effectively sealed off outside access to the [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (and until his death), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.&lt;ref name="laqueur22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, and even for 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents that were permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few miles of Moscow, their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="laqueur22"/&gt;  Dissenters who approached such foreigners were arrested.&lt;ref name="laqueur23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not know the number of arrest or executed Soviet citizens, or how poorly the Soviet economy had performed.&lt;ref name="laqueur23"/&gt;

Similarly, the regimes in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]] carefully controlled foreign visitors in order to restrict the flow of information coming out of (and into) Romania.&lt;ref name="deletantix"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, activities in Romania remained, until the late 1960s, largely unknown to the outside world.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; As a result, until 1990, very little information regarding labour camps and prisons in Romania appeared in the West.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; When such information appeared, it was usually in Romanian émigré publications.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; Romania's [[Securitate]] secret police were able to suppress information leaking to the west about resistance to the regime.&lt;ref name="deletantxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stalinist [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], which had become increasingly paranoid and isolated after [[de-Stalinization]] and the death of [[Mao Zedong]],&lt;ref name="olsen19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsen|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; restricted visitors to 6,000 per year, and segregated those few that traveled to Albania.&lt;ref name="turnock48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnock|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda efforts==
{{further|Communist propaganda|Propaganda in the People's Republic of Poland|Propaganda in the Soviet Union}}
Communist leaders in the Eastern Bloc openly discussed the existence of propaganda efforts. Communist propaganda goals and techniques were tuned according to the target audience. The most broad classification of targets was:&lt;ref name=clews&gt;John C. Clews (1964) ''Communist Propaganda techniques'', printed in the USA by ''[[Frederick A. Praeger|Praeger]]'' and in Great Britain&lt;/ref&gt;
*Domestic propaganda
*External propaganda
*Propaganda of Communist supporters outside the Communist states

Communist Party documents reveal a more detailed classification of specific targets (workers, peasants, youth, women, etc.).&lt;ref name=clews/&gt;

Because the Communist Party was portrayed under [[Marxist-Leninist]] theory as the protagonist of history pushing toward the inevitable end result of historical materialism as a "vanguard of the working class", Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the purported historical end itself.&lt;ref name="Satter1"&gt;[[David Satter]]. ''Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union'', [[Yale University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Propaganda often worked itself beyond [[agit prop]] plays into traditional productions, such as in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]], where the director of the National Theatre produced a version of ''Macbeth'' in which the villainous king was revealed as none other than hated (in the Eastern Bloc) Yugoslavian Leader [[Josip Broz Tito]].&lt;ref name="crampton269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding economic woes, debilitating wage cuts following economic stagnation were referred to as "blows in the face of imperialism", while forced loans were called "voluntary contributions to the building of socialism".&lt;ref name="crampton273"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in his ''[[The ABC of Communism]]'' wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] ''The ABC of Communism'' (1969 translation: {{ISBN|0-14-040005-2}}), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/10.htm Chapter 10: Communism and Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The State propaganda of communism becomes in the long run a means for the eradication of the last traces of bourgeois propaganda dating from the old régime; and it is a powerful instrument for the creation of a new ideology, of new modes of thought, of a new outlook on the world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:West german tv penetration.svg|thumb|200px|right|Penetration of West German TV reception (grey) in East Germany for [[Das Erste|ARD]] (regional channels  [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]], [[Hessischer Rundfunk|HR]], [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] and [[Sender Freies Berlin|SFB]]) . Areas with no reception (black) were jokingly referred to as "Valley of the Clueless" ''(Tal der Ahnungslosen)'' while ARD was said to stand for "Außer (except) Rügen und Dresden" .]]
Some propaganda would "retell" the western news, such as the [[East German]] television program [[Der schwarze Kanal]] ("The Black Channel"), which contained [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] programs from [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]] with added [[Communist]] commentary.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.transdiffusion.org/intertel/countries/gdr.php | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130416082604/http://www.transdiffusion.org/intertel/countries/gdr.php | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-04-16 | title = Fade to black | accessdate = 2006-02-20 | last = Hancock | first = Dafydd | date = 2001-01-01 | publisher = Intertel from Transdiffusion }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Black channel" was a play on words deriving from the term German plumbers used for a sewer. The program was meant to counter ideas received by some from West German television because the geography of the divided [[Germany]] meant that West German television signals (particularly [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]) could be received in most of East Germany, except in parts of Eastern [[Saxony]] around Dresden, which consequently earned the latter the nickname "valley of the clueless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/11/09/east.php | title = East Germany Struggles, 5 Years After Wall Fell | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | last = Mitchener | first = Brandon | date = 1994-11-09 | publisher = International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; (despite the fact that some Western radio was still available there).

Eastern Bloc leaders, including even [[Joseph Stalin]], could become personally involved in dissemination. For example, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="roberts97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, one month later, the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]''.&lt;ref name="henig67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts96"/&gt; Stalin personally edited the book, rewriting entire chapters by hand.&lt;ref name="roberts96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book claimed, for instance, that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;  The book also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning [[German–Soviet Axis talks|the Soviet offers to join the Axis]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|until the Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"/&gt;

The book referred to "the American falsifiers and their British and French associates",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed "[a]s far back as in 1937 it became perfectly clear that a big war was being hatched by Hitler with the direct connivance of Great Britain and France",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; blasted "the claptrap of the slanderers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated "[n]aturally, the falsifiers of history and slanderers are called falsifiers and slanderers precisely because they do not entertain any respect for facts. They prefer to gossip and slander."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Germany]], the Soviet SVAG and DVV initially controlled all publication priorities.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt; In the initial months of 1946, the Soviets were unsure how to merge propaganda and censorship efforts in East Germany.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt;  The SVAG engaged in a broad propaganda campaign that moved beyond customary political propaganda to engage in the practice at unions, women's organizations and youth organizations.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt;

==Bypassing censorship==

===Clandestine information passing===
{{main|Samizdat|Magnitizdat|Polish underground press}}
[[Samizdat]] was the clandestine copying and distribution of government-suppressed literature or other media in [[Eastern bloc]] countries. Copies were often made in small quantities of handwritten or typed documents, while recipients were expected to make additional copies. Samizdat traders used underground literature for self-analysis and self-expression under the heavy censorship of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} ''[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter16a.htm#_VPID_36 History of Dissident Movement in the USSR. The birth of Samizdat]'' by [[Ludmila Alekseyeva]]. Vilnius, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was fraught with danger as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying [[censorship|censored]] materials.   Former Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] defined it as follows: "I myself create it, edit it, censor it, publish it, distribute it, and [may] get imprisoned for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} "Самиздат: сам сочиняю, сам редактирую, сам цензурирую, сам издаю, сам распространяю, сам и отсиживаю за него." (autobiographical novel ''И возвращается ветер...'', ''And the Wind returns...'' NY, Хроника, 1978, p.126) Also online at [http://www.vehi.net/samizdat/bukovsky.html]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the longest-running and well-known samizdat publications was the information bulletin "Хроника текущих событий" (Khronika Tekushchikh Sobitiy; ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/chr/index.htm Chronicle of Current Events] Archive at memo.ru&lt;/ref&gt; which contained anonymously published pieces dedicated to the defense of [[human rights]] in the USSR. Several people were arrested in connection with the ''Chronicle'', including [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Yuri Shikhanovich]], [[Pyotr Yakir]], [[Victor Krasin]], [[Sergei Kovalev]], [[Alexander Lavut]], [[Tatyana Velikanova]], among others.

[[Magnitizdat]] (in Russian магнитиздат) is the process of re-copying and self distributing live audio tape recordings in the Soviet Union that were not available commercially. The process of magnitizdat was less risky than publishing literature via samizdat, since any person in the USSR was permitted to own a private reel-to-reel tape recorder, while paper duplication equipment was under control of the state.  "Tamizdat" refers to literature published abroad (там, tam, meaning "there"), often from smuggled manuscripts.

===Western role in propaganda war===
{{further|British Broadcasting Corporation|Voice of America|Radio Free Europe}}
Western countries invested heavily in powerful transmitters which enabled broadcasters to be heard in the Eastern Bloc, despite attempts by authorities to [[Radio jamming|jam]] such signals. In 1947, VOA started broadcasting in [[Russian language|Russian]] with the intent to counter Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies, and disseminate pro western propaganda directed against Soviet leaders and policies.&lt;ref name='whitton'&gt;''Cold War Propaganda'' by John B. Whitton, [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 45, No. 1 (Jan., 1951), pp. 151–153&lt;/ref&gt;  These included [[Radio Free Europe]] (RFE)), [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor|RIAS (Berlin)]] the [[Voice of America]]  (VOA), [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio France International]] and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).&lt;ref name="frucht490"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet Union responded by attempting aggressive, electronic [[Radio jamming|jamming]]  of VOA (and some other Western) broadcasts in 1949.&lt;ref name='whitton'/&gt;  The [[BBC World Service]] similarly broadcast language-specific programming to countries behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

RFE was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1950, it obtained a transmitter base at [[Lampertheim]], [[West Germany]] and on July 4 of the same year, RFE completed its first broadcast aimed at [[Czechoslovakia]]&lt;ref&gt;Mickelson, Sig, "America's Other Voice: the Story of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty" (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1983): Mickelson 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasts were often banned in Eastern Europe and Communist authorities used sophisticated [[Radio jamming|jamming]] techniques in an attempt to prevent citizens from listening to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1950, RFE began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, and became more than just a "mouthpiece for exiles" who had fled Eastern Bloc countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; While RFE was cleared of charges that it gave Hungarian listeners false hope during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], its Broadcast Analysis Division was established to ensure that broadcasts were accurate and professional while maintaining the journalists' former [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1960 study concluded that RFE possessed considerably more listeners than the BBC or VOA.&lt;ref name="puddington131"/&gt; The study concluded that the BBC was regarded as the most objective and the VOA had suffered a notable decline since it stopped critical broadcasts on the communist world after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], focusing instead on world news, American culture and jazz.&lt;ref name="puddington131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''From the Land of the Moon''''' ({{lang-it|'''Mal di Pietre'''}}) is a 2006 [[novella]] by the Italian writer [[Milena Agus]]. It was translated into English in 2010 by [[Ann Goldstein (translator)|Ann Goldstein]]. [[Milena Agus|Agus]] asked that the passages of her work that were written in Sardinian dialect be kept, a wish that was respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sachs|first1=Julian|title=From the Land of the Moon|url=http://www.iitaly.org/node/17453|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The novella was adapted as a French film, ''Mal de pierres'' (2016), released with subtitles in English as ''[[From the Land of the Moon (film)|From the Land of the Moon]]'', written and directed by [[Nicole Garcia]] and starring [[Marion Cotillard]].

==Plot==
A young woman recounts her grandmother's past life in Italy, beginning in 1943 in the middle of the Second World War, when her grandmother had reached her 30s and was still unwed. Considered an old maid by her parents, the she was married off to a man who had come to the town after his home had been bombed. She told him she would not have a sexual relationship with him, and he agreed as long as she permitted him to go to brothels. Shortly afterward, the couple moved to the man's home in [[Cagliari]]. 

The woman began to have sex with her husband in order to save the money he would have spent on brothels, but they were unable to conceive a child. She had painful kidney stones, which resulted in several miscarriages. After several years, in 1950 the woman's doctor recommended that she go to [[Civitavecchia]] for thermal treatments at a well-known spa. While there, the married woman met a war veteran, and they bonded over their artistic passions, his for music and hers for writing. He had lost a leg in the war, was married, and lived in [[Milan]] with his wife and child. 

Nine months later, the formerly childless married woman had a son. When he is seven, she goes to work as a maid so that he can have piano lessons. The son takes after his father and grows up to be a classical pianist. He in turn marries and has a daughter. The daughter and her grandmother become close; the older woman eventually tells her granddaughter about her affair with the veteran so many years ago. 

The grandmother also confides that in 1963 she, her husband and son visited [[Milan]] to see her younger sister. The grandmother somehow thought she would encounter her former lover and leave with him. Instead, she was overwhelmed by the city and had a miserable time, although the rest of the family remember the trip as one of the best of their lives. After the trip to [[Milan]] the woman resigns herself to life with her husband. Sometime later, she dies of kidney failure. 

The granddaughter comes to believe that her real grandfather is the veteran. After her grandmother's death, the granddaughter learns that at one point her great-grandparents wanted to commit their daughter to an asylum. She had been cutting herself and wrote erotic poetry (which they considered obscene) to any attractive man who caught her eye.

The granddaughter becomes engaged to a man and the two begin to renovate her family apartment. They discover a notebook hidden in a wall. It belonged to the grandmother and includes a letter from the veteran. It reveals that the account of a sexually charged relationship between the grandmother and the veteran was entirely fictional; she sent him that story sometime after they had parted to ask his opinion. He responded that passages were beautiful, nearly causing him to regret that they never did make love. He encouraged the woman in her writing and reassured her that she was not mad.
 
==Adaptations==
In 2014 it was announced that [[Nicole Garcia]] would adapt the book for the screen with [[Marion Cotillard]] in the lead role. The film premiered at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keslassy|first1=Elsa|title=Marion Cotillard Set To Topline Nicole Garcia’s ‘Mal de Pierres,’ Produced by Alain Attal (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/global/marion-cotillard-set-to-topline-nicole-garcias-mal-de-pierres-produced-by-alain-attal-exclusive-1201217300/|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The novella was positively reviewed. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it a "spare, fable-like novella".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CROUCH|first1=IAN|title=From the Land of the Moon|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/05/02/from-the-land-of-the-moon|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gardening in Spain''' reflects the different styles of [[Spanish art]], including influences from [[Roman garden|Roman]], [[Islamic garden|Islamic]], [[Giardino all'italiana|Italian]], [[Parterre|French]], and [[English landscape garden|English]] gardens. Modern Spanish gardening emphasize gardens and their surroundings, focusing heavily on both [[urbanism|urban horticulture]] and [[landscape architecture]].

[[Spanish garden]]s are affected by the [[Climate of Spain|climate]] and [[orography]] of [[Spain]]. The ground in Spain is generally drier than in its neighboring countries of [[Portugal]] and [[France]]. High levels of summer solar radiation in Spain have led to the creation of smaller, indoor gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Kluckert|2007|p = 232.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many historical [[List of national parks of Spain|parks]] and gardens in Spain. The first Spanish [[botanical garden]] was created near [[Valencia]] in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=John H.|date=1974-01-01|title=Spanish Gardens in Their Historical Background|jstor=1586307|journal=Garden History|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.2307/1586307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new gardens were created during the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] with Islamic influences. Up until the 19th century, the majority of gardens were promoted by the royalty and the aristocracy. After that, social changes facilitated the creation of parks and public gardens for the use and enjoyment of all citizens. Urban gardening evolved during the 20th century, as well as ecological awareness, which has led to the creation of new parks around Spain.

== Influences ==

=== Roman period ===
[[File:Achille benouville, veduta di una villa romana, 1844.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Modern vision of a [[Roman villa]].]]
Gardening in Spain began during the Roman period. [[Ancient Rome]] was very advanced in regards to its architecture and engineering, and their [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s helped irrigate gardens in remote areas. Because of this, they were able to create swimming pools and lakes, which emphasized the beauty of the gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Páez de la Cadena|1998|pp = 47–48.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans also used [[topiary]] in their gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Fernández Arenas|1988|pp = 322–324.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman gardens were linked to the ''[[domus]]'', the home of the Roman upper class. The entrances of these homes were typically decorated with [[sculpture]]s and led to gardens containing [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] vegetation. This model also arose the ''villa'', a rustic farm that generally served to accommodate middle-class civilians. There were also urban gardens were organized around an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] and served as a communal area for all the social classes. The center of atriums had a lake decorated with [[mosaic]]s, vases, or statues, and walls decorated with [[fresco]]s.

Roman gardens usually had structural and architectural elements such as porticos, [[arch]]es, [[column]]s, [[exedra]]s, swimming pools, wooden kiosks, [[pergola]]s, arbours, and even artificial grottos ([[Nymphaeum|ninfeos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Bazin|1990|p = 26.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water ran in abundance through channels and pilones, sometimes with small jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Bazin|1990|pp = 27–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from Roman domūs and villas, there were several other urban areas with greenery, such as gymnasiums and [[Roman theater (structure)|theatres]]. An example is the ''porticus post scaenam'' of the [[Roman Theatre (Mérida)|Theatre of Mérida]], which had a garden, sculptures, and a [[sundial]].&lt;ref name="añón2"&gt;{{Harvard citation|Añón Feliú|Luengo|2003|p = 17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic period ===
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Patio_de_los_Naranjos,_Mezquita_de_Córdoba.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Playground of the Naranjos, [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Mosque of Córdoba]].]]
[[Islamic culture]] in Spain greatly influenced Spanish gardening. After conquering the peninsula, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] established many gardens, especially in its capital city of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation|Fernández Arenas|1988|pp = 324–326.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic gardens had a lot of shade, as such gardens were usually located in arid regions. They usually had a fountain in the middle, surrounded by a walkway and greenery.

=== Renaissance period ===
During the [[Renaissance]], [[topiary]] grew in popularity, and gardens were filled with sculptures from [[Italy]] and [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=John H.|date=1974-01-01|title=Spanish Gardens in Their Historical Background|jstor=1586307|journal=Garden History|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.2307/1586307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke of Alba's estate had a large private Flemish garden with topiary, waterworks, and grottoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=John H.|date=1974-01-01|title=Spanish Gardens in Their Historical Background|jstor=1586307|journal=Garden History|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.2307/1586307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myrtles and lemon and orange trees were also often used in Renaissance gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=John H.|date=1974-01-01|title=Spanish Gardens in Their Historical Background|jstor=1586307|journal=Garden History|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.2307/1586307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] also greatly influenced Spanish gardening. He created many new gardens, and imported several foreign plants such as the [[Elm|English Elm tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=John H.|date=1974-01-01|title=Spanish Gardens in Their Historical Background|jstor=1586307|journal=Garden History|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.2307/1586307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

This is an extended usage of word [[gridlock]] specifically in economics to describe the common situation that occurs in the competition within an industry or a company. The similar usage of gridlock can be seen in politics as well. See also [[Gridlock (politics)|gridlock (Politics)]]. However, the term gridlock was first used in engineering as, "A state of severe road congestion arising when continuous queues of vehicles block an entire network of intersecting streets, bringing traffic in all directions to a complete standstill; a traffic jam of this kind." &lt;ref name="test"&gt;[Gridlock. oed.com. Oxford University Press. Retrieve May 3, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

In microeconomics, gridlock refers to the difficult situation of firms to invest in long-term and sustainable business, especially in a fiercely competitive industry where most firms focus on the short-term returns. It is very hard for any player to make move towards sustainable and health direction, since if one party initiates the long-term investment, which is not very profitable in the short-term, the other competitors can easily take advantage of the situation to outcompete that firm, and even drive that firm out of market. As a result, no party will take the risk to make a move. This phenomenon is also called first-mover disadvantage. In the end, the unhealthy situation of the industry can be hardly improved by the market leaders themselves. In the business as in traffic, when gridlock happens, an industry is unable to function at a healthy level, which can be highly problematic and costly.

Not only in an industry, gridlock can also happen at company level. If there are several groups with conflicting interests exist within one company competing to gain the control and power, this can create a situation in which business transactions can not be completed until the problem is solved.&lt;ref name="Heath1999"&gt;[Heath, Joseph (1999). Normative economics, Chapter 2, Section 3. Retrieved on March 19, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of dilemma is also very often cited in [[game theory]]. If all the parties can cooperate, for example, companies can collaboratively invest in a sustainable way, the gridlock can be easily solved and the industry will function in a healthy way. But this is not happening because of the desire to maximize one's own benefit given the uncertainty about the others’ commitment to cooperation.

== Solution ==

Naturally to solve this problem, it requires institutions within the industry or company to regulate rules and prevent the inefficient situation to happen. Thus institution plays a role of traffic lights or traffic police in the conjunction of business world.

In the book Institutional Economics an introduction, professor John Groenewegen, Antoon Spithoven and Annette van den Berg explained approaches of analyzing this kind of situation and suggest the solutions to similar problems from institutional prospective. See also [[Institutional economics]].

==History==
Grupo Corpo was created in [[Belo Horizonte]] by [[Paulo Pederneiras]]. It is a [[contemporary dance]] company, which is typically Brazilian in its creations.

'''Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders)''' is the name of a fictional [[superheroine]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Kendra Saunders was created by writer [[David S. Goyer]], [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] and artist [[Stephen Sadowski]], and first appeared in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA: Secret Files and Origins]]'' #1 (August 1999). 

==Publication history==
The new Hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the JSA monthly title. The new Hawkgirl is Kendra Saunders, granddaughter of the Golden Age Hawkgirl's cousin, [[Speed Saunders]]. Hawkgirl would continue to appear regularly in the monthly ''JSA'' series and later in the ''Hawkman'' monthly. In 2006, the ongoing ''Hawkman'' monthly series was retitled ''Hawkgirl'' starting with issue #50 as part of the "[[One Year Later]]" jump forward; Kendra replaced Hawkman as the lead character. The ''Hawkgirl'' comic book series was finished with issue #66.

Kendra was a recurrent member of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. [[Oracle (DC Comics)|Oracle]] first solicits her assistance in issue #104 in dealing with the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], for which Oracle rewards her with a car. Throughout the Russian arc, Hawkgirl serves as a team member and develops a rivalry with Secret Six member [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal]].

She was a member of the [[Justice League of America]] at its relaunch, but left the team due to injuries sustained in ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Kendra and the original Hawkman (Carter Hall) were killed during the ''Blackest Night'' storyline; Katar Hol had been killed previously in a final battle with the Hawkgod, and Carter Hall, who had reincarnated in a new body, replaced him as Hawkgirl's partner. Carter and Shiera were resurrected after ''Blackest Night'', but Kendra has since been killed again.

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Hawkgirl.JL3.jpg|thumb|Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders).&lt;br&gt; Art by [[DC Comics|Jorge Jiménez]].]]
Kendra Saunders was a young hispanic woman who committed [[suicide]]. When Kendra's [[soul]] left her body, that of her grandfather's first cousin Shiera Hall, the Golden Age Hawkgirl entered it, making Kendra a [[walk-in]]. Her grandfather, former OSS agent and globe-trotting adventurer [[Speed Saunders]], recognized this, in part due to a change in eye color, and encouraged his granddaughter to embrace her destiny as the "new" Hawkgirl.

Kendra had a daughter named [[List of minor DC Comics characters|Mia]], who is not shown but mentioned.

Still believing herself to be Kendra, she debuted as a hero using the original Hawkgirl's equipment and set out in search of a being called the Fate-Child (actually her own reincarnated son, [[Hector Hall]]). This led to a meeting with the [[Justice Society]] and Kendra's induction to that team.

She currently has all of Kendra's memories, but almost none of Shiera's save for fighting experiences. This creates tension with Hawkman since he remembers all of their past lives together and believes they are destined for each other. Kendra has been presented as a very troubled young woman, haunted by the murder of her parents by a corrupt cop and confused by her jumble of memories and feelings. She has operated as [[Hawkman]]'s partner but only recently begun to actually admit her attraction to him. The truth about Kendra's identity was eventually revealed to her by the angel [[Zauriel]].

She is one of the heroes who fought in space during the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. Following the events of Infinite Crisis, a [[Rann#Rannian technology|Zeta Beam]] transporter malfunction injured many of the superheroes in space, including Hawkgirl, causing her to grow over twenty feet tall. [[One Year Later|Some time later]], her proper stature restored, Kendra was shown living in [[St. Roch, Louisiana]], working in Stonechat Museum and protecting the city as Hawkgirl.

She is also a returning member of the new [[Justice League]], having effectively served with the team when the original members were previously missing. A brewing relationship between Hawkgirl and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] became one of the major subplots in the series though it appears to have ended. Hawkgirl is now 100% Kendra Saunders. Shiera Sanders' soul left Kendra's body and moved on to the afterlife. Shiera hopes her passing on will finally remove the curse of Hath-Set.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #66 (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hawkman'' Vol. 4 (2002–2006)===
In the ''[[Hawkman]]'' ongoing monthly comic book series, Hawkgirl was presented as a very afflicted young woman, seeking clarity regarding the murder of her parents by a corrupt cop and confused by her jumble of memories and feelings. She had all of Kendra's memories but almost none of Shiera's. This created tension with [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] since he remembered all of their past lives together and believed they were destined for each other. She operated as Hawkman's partner, but eventually began to actually admit her attraction to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' #1 (May 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kendra's past lives is revealed as the bounty hunter, [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]], a reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara. As such, she becomes the lover of Prince Khufu's reincarnation, the hero [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]]. When Cinnamon is assaulted by the burglar [[Gentleman Ghost|"Gentleman Jim" Craddock]], Nighthawk hangs him up, thereby tying his destiny to theirs. Cinnamon, along with Nighthawk, is killed by the latest incarnation of [[Hath-Set]], their biggest enemy.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' #7 (September 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kendra eventually meets with the police officer [[Hawkwoman]], who was searching for her missing partner [[Katar Hol]], previously possessed by a creature known as the Hawk Avatar. Also seeking to arrest the Thanagarian criminal [[Byth|Byth Rok]], Shayera Thal asked for Kendra's help. Working together they were able to defeat the villain. Before departing to [[Thanagar]] with Byth as her prisoner, Hawkwoman gave Hawkgirl her harness as symbol of their recently formed friendship.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' #17 (July 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkgirl felt that she wasn't the first person [[Hawkman]] would turn to in a moment of crisis, treating her as a damsel in distress incapable of holding her own, and degrading her position in both the eyes of the [[Justice Society of America]] and in their partnership. She observed that he would frequently treat her as a [[sidekick]], a relationship that Kendra denied, wanting to be seen as his equal.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' #42 (October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of the series Hawkgirl reveals all of her feelings to [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter]], causing him to apologize and admit that he was treating her wrongly all along. The story finishes on a romantic note with the Hawks fighting together during the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' #49 (April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hawkgirl'', the series===
The ''Hawkman'' ongoing monthly series was retitled to ''[[Hawkman|Hawkgirl]]'', with Kendra replacing Carter as the lead character. Hawkgirl is seen protecting [[St. Roch, Louisiana]] in the absence of Hawkman, and working in Stonechat Museum. She fights Khimaera several times,&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #50 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; finally killing her.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #56 (November 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; She is later abducted and put on mock trial for high treason against her people by a group of rogue Thanagarian criminals, at the instigation of Blackfire.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #57 (December 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; After declaring her guilty, one of the rogues ties her hands behind her back, covers her mouth with a piece of duct tape, and attempts to execute her by hanging — whereupon Kendra finds that she can hover without her wings, and is thus able to fake her death and defeat the criminals.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #58 (January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Kendra then becomes a direct target of [[Blackfire (DC Comics)|Blackfire]] who decides to go to Earth, herself, to kill Hawkgirl and Hawkman. Together, the Hawks defeat her and take away her powers.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #59 (February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kendra later fights alongside the Furies of [[Darkseid]] when St. Roch is attacked by an evil doomsday weapon of [[Apokolips]], a stolen Beta-3 Gizmoid. It turns out that the gizmoid is linked to the Hawks' old enemy, Hath-Set, as it had been taken to Earth ages ago and landed in Ancient Egypt during Hath-Set's reign, and hidden in a canopic jar.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #60 (March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Hath-Set's efforts to reacquire the jar, the gizmoid is reactivated near Stonechat Museum. According to its programming, it spots Hawkgirl and, choosing her as a template, assumes her form in order to begin Earth's eradication. Tracking it, the [[Female Furies]] arrive by Boom Tube but are rendered conscious.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #61 (April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a giant mechanized version of Hawkgirl, the gizmoid begins attacking St. Roch with its arsenal of weaponry. [[Bernadeth]] and the other Furies try to destroy the gizmoid but are unsuccessful. But, due to her brief connection with the gizmoid, Hawkgirl discovers a weakness whereby she and the Furies are able to defeat it.&lt;ref&gt;''HawkGirl'' #62 (May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkgirl's plan works and the gizmoid falls to pieces, but afterward the vampiric [[Bloody Mary (DC Comics)|Bloody Mary]], one of the Furies, turns on Hawkgirl as she lies unconscious. Fortunately, Danny Evans had been following the battle and shows up just in time. He manages to delay Bloody Mary just long enough for Hawkgirl to reawaken and subdue her. The Female Furies collect Bloody Mary and reluctantly thank Hawkgirl for her efforts before departing.

Kendra finally resolves to take the fight to her mortal enemy, [[Hath-Set]], who had been spying on her for some time. Hawkgirl starts getting closer to finding him with the assistance of [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Batgirl|Oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkgirl'' #63(June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; During her search Kendra is kidnapped by Hath-Set and taken to Egypt. [[Hawkman]] follows on a rescue mission, but is captured and imprisoned by Hath-Set's minions. Meanwhile Hawkgirl is able to free herself. She encounters Hath-Set, and after a final battle, kills him and saves Hawkman. The two now finally find peace, breaking the cycle of reincarnation and failure. They can see themselves falling in love again, but with Hawkgirl asserting that, this time, Carter must earn her love.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkgirl'' #66 (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Justice League of America''===
{{Main|Justice League}}
Hawkgirl's main story arc in the early issues of [[Justice League of America|Justice League of America Vol. 2]] centered around her relationship with [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]]. Initially both were looking for a fling, but then found themselves in love, with Hawkgirl even meeting his daughter Lian, a result of his former romance with [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' #11 (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Their relationship became one of the major subplots of the series, with [[Black Canary]]'s disapproval of the relationship bringing some tension to it. Additionally, [[Powergirl|Power Girl]] advised Red Arrow not to get involved with Hawkgirl, as she was destined to eventually return to [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)]]. Despite of everything the two started dating, with the [[Justice League]] later finding out after [[Red Tornado]] caught Hawkgirl and Red Arrow sleeping together.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' #12 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the beginning of a turbulent relationship, with past relationships, parenting, and the inability to express their feelings to each other causing problems. Red Arrow's constant pain due [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]'s absence, and Hawkgirl conflicted feelings regarding [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] brought stress in their romance, causing the couple to fight regularly. Eventually the relationship dissolved and Red Arrow left the [[Justice League]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' #30 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

While in a mission with the [[Justice League]] inside the ''[[Salvation Run|Prison Planet]],'' Hawkgirl discovered another ability provided by the [[Nth Metal]], the power to weaken forces drawn from the fabric of space-time. Thus, Kendra was the only member not affected by [[Kanjar Ro]], enabling her to fight against the villain and rescue her friends. Hawkgirl then left the [[Justice League]] due to injuries sustained in [[Final Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' #31 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Blackest Night''===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
In ''Blackest Night'' #1, Kendra is shown having an argument with Hawkman over whether or not to visit [[Jean Loring]]'s grave with the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. As the two heroes quarrel, the reanimated corpses of [[Elongated Man|Ralph]] and [[Sue Dibny]], now members of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], enter Hawkman's sanctuary. The Black Lanterns attack, Sue impaling Hawkgirl on a spear. Ralph taunts Hawkman, telling him that Hawkgirl never loved him; a claim she refutes with her dying breath. Hawkman is killed shortly afterward, and both heroes are reanimated as Black Lanterns by [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] himself.&lt;ref name="bn1"&gt;''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the battling at Coast City, the Atom is chosen by the [[Indigo Tribe]] to be more effective against [[Nekron]]'s forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Atom tells Indigo-1 to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to legitimately resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.&lt;ref&gt;''The Atom and Hawkman'' #46 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the final battle, the duo are transformed by Hal Jordan into the White Lantern Corps and upon Nekron's destruction, they are both resurrected. Hawkgirl says she remembers all her past lives, then unmasks to reveal herself to be Shiera, she and Carter joyfully reuniting.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Brightest Day''===
{{Main|Brightest Day}}
In the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover, Carter and Shiera follow Hath-Set, who has collected the bones from all of their past bodies, and created from them a portal to [[Hawkworld]]. While there, Shiera is told by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] to stop Hath-Set from killing Carter because if he dies one more time, he will not undergo the cycle of resurrection again.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Shiera is attacked in Hawkworld's dungeon and captured by Hath-Set. She is then taken to the Queen of Hawkworld, who reveals to Shiera that she is her mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #8 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkgirl is tied by Hath-Set and Queen Khea to the gateway, and they strike her in order to lure Hawkman to the location. Hawkman and his group of the panthera attack the Manhawks homeworld. When Hawkman arrives and draws his attention, Shiera turns the tables on Hath-Set and uses her legs to snap his neck, killing him. In the meantime, Hawkman is held by Queen Khea's control of Nth metal mace and armor, and she puts Carter with Shiera. Queen Khea opens the gateway and enters the portal to the [[Zamaron]] homeworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #13 (November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrives on the Zamaron homeworld, Star Sapphire ([[Carol Ferris]]) frees them both to stop Queen Khea's invasion. Hawkgirl soon faces her mother, but the Predator feels the lack of love inside Khea's heart bond with her and does not know if she truly is able to contain the power of true love.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #17 (January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Predator makes Khea his host, but Shiera and Carter manage to separate both of them by stabbing Khea at the same time with weapons made of Zamaronian crystals. The bones of the past lives of Hawkman and Hawkgirl separate from the gateway and, animated by the power of the violet light of love, grab Khea and imprison her in the Zamaronian Central Power Battery. Shiera and Carter, with both of their missions accomplished, have their lives returned and Carol teleports both of them back to the museum of St. Roch. There, the couple, happy for finally defeating the curse, start to take off their clothes in order to make love, but they are suddenly interrupted by the apparition of [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], brought there by his white ring. The ring gives Shiera and Carter an order that they must live separately to live life stronger (because they appreciate love more than life itself), but when Carter replies by saying they are not going to live apart again, the ring responds "So be it" and unleashes a blast of white light that turns Hawkman and Hawkgirl into white dust, while Deadman looks in horror.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Deadman orders the ring to resurrect both Hawkman and Hawkgirl, but the ring refuses, and tells him that Hawkgirl is unique and that she was brought back life to overcome what held her back in her past life because she is essential in saving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #19 (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the "Dark Avatar" made his presence known, Hawkgirl and Hawkman are revealed to be part of the Elementals. They were transformed by the Entity to become the element of air and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar, which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the [[Swamp Thing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The Elementals are then fused with the body of [[Alec Holland (comics)|Alec Holland]] in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing appears to have brought the Elementals back to normal; however, as Hawkman looks around for Shiera, he discovers that she was not brought back like he was. He is later told by Swamp Thing that Shiera is everywhere, revealing that she is still the elemental of air. Afterward, Hawkman returns home yelling "Shiera".&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The New 52''===
[[File:Earth 2 Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|Hawkgirl on the cover of ''[[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]'' #4 (October, 2012). Art by [[Ivan Reis]].]]
In 2011, [[DC Comics]] rebooted its continuity as part of the publishing event ''[[The New 52]]''. Following this, a reimagined Kendra Saunders version of Hawkgirl features in the comic book ''[[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]'', set in the parallel reality of that designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=38543 |title=EXCLUSIVE: "Earth 2" #4 Cover Introduces Hawkgirl |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her full origin has not been revealed other than some insinuation of her background as part of a secret program that included [[Al Pratt (comics)|Al Pratt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #6 (January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed that Kendra Munoz-Saunders is a professional treasure hunter, and was hired by the World Army before an unrevealed event occurred in Egypt that resulted in the grafting of wings to Kendra's back, the same time [[Doctor Fate#Khalid Ben-Hassin|Khalid Ben-Hassin]] found the Helmet of Fate.

Some time later, Kendra met with [[the Flash]] in Europe. She was guided by a certain Fate as to where she might find him. Together, they went to Washington, D.C. and fought [[Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], without much success.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #4 (October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; They were later joined by Green Lantern, and subsequently by the Atom. To defeat Grundy, [[Green Lantern]] carried him out of the Earth's atmosphere, and stranded him on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #5 (December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his help against Grundy, the Atom, under orders from the World Army, tried to capture Hawkgirl, but she escaped with the help of the Flash. Green Lantern then returned to Earth after removing the danger of the nuclear missiles that the World Army launched under the advice of [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Terry Sloan]]. Unfortunately, he had run out of power, after using so much of it to defeat Grundy. He was saved by Hawkgirl, who caught him in mid-free fall.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #7 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkgirl then visited the apartment of Alan Scott who was still mourning over the death of his partner Sam. Hawkgirl's detective skills allowed her to discover that Alan and Green Lantern were one and the same. She tried to convince him to join her and the Flash to form a team against the coming danger.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #7 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Hawkgirl alongside [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|the Flash]], [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] and [[Doctor Fate#Khalid Ben-Hassin|Doctor Fate]] formed the [[Justice Society of America|Wonders of the World]].

During the events of ''The Tower of Fate'' Hawkgirl is seen New Orleans trying to make Khalid join her in an attempt to fight against the war with [[Apokolips]]. Later, she is shown in Louisiana locating a parademon cell, [[Green Lantern]] appears and asks for her help with finding why his husband was murdered. Together with Kendra, Alan manages to learn much more about Sam, and within the span of a few hours the treasure huntress has completely outclassed all of the detectives earlier hired by Mr. Zhao. They are flying above the Chinese harbor when Kendra notes that they've reached the point where there was supposed to be a clue, as one of the containers contain something which is connected to Sam's death. Once they open the container however, Alan and Kendra discover to their shock numerous dead [[Parademons]] heaped atop one another. Surprised by their findings and wondering how this got Sam killed, they decide to backtrack to their previous source, the mob leader Eddie Kai.

Unfortunately, before they can continue their search [[the Green (comics)|the Green]] reaches out to Alan and implores him to return to America. While Alan resists as much as he can, the force of the command proves too irresistible and he's forced to leave Kendra behind despite her protests, when he leaves however he begs Kendra to keep looking in his place. Still helping Alan with his problem, Hawkgirl is seen in a graveyard searching for answers, there she is attacked by genetically enhanced Apokorats ridden by Apokolips warriors, [[Dr. Thomas Wayne|Batman]] assists her and tells her to go search for Kanto, the assassin of Apokolips. She finds out that Alan's dead husband, was mixed up with Apokolips battle tech.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #13 (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the second invasion of Apokolips in Earth-2 happened, the Wonders of the World, tried to save Earth-2 from destruction, unsuccessfully, they had to evacuate to an Earth twin, only two million survived the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #32 (May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the follow-on series called ''Earth 2: Society'' showed the survivors of Earth-2's war with Apokolips, such as Hawkgirl, Green Lantern and The Flash, finding themselves on a new world having to create a fresh life there.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2: Society'' #1 (August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In stories set on DC's Prime Earth, the ''Savage Hawkman'' story arc "Hawkman Wanted" (''Savage Hawkman'' #13-16, and optionally issues #0 and #12) explains the character's place in the New 52. Shayera Thal is revealed as the princess of Thanagar, former lover of [[Katar Hol]] and sister of the Emperor Corsar. Initially, she is depicted as a villain, seeking revenge against Katar and coming to Earth to bring Katar to justice for his crimes against [[Thanagar]] and the murder of Corsar. It is later evident that Katar was innocent and Shayera is surprised when she discovers her brother alive and behind Katar's arrest in the attempt to part Katar from the [[Nth metal]] and own it for himself. She then sacrifices herself in order to save Katar's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage Hawkman'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

Following DC's ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' storyline, [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] version of Hawkgirl is featured in a [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-''Crisis'']] universe. With the story taking place right after the events of the acclaimed ''[[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Shadow of War]]'' miniseries, [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] and [[Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]] have been captured inside a domed [[Gotham City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman: Convergence'' #1 (June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; They are featured working as curators in the city's museum, while also fighting crime against hidden [[Thanagarians]] that had the original intent of conquest over the [[DC Multiverse|Earth]], admitting later that they abandoned it when the dome came down. One of the rogues explains that they have seen the future, and that their universe will not survive. Hawkman and Hawkgirl watch as their world starts collapsing due to the Crisis, but they also realize that there might be a new beginning and they fly off with hope in their hearts.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman: Convergence'' #2 (July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''DC Rebirth''===
In March 2016, [[DC Comics]] developed ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', as a relaunch of its entire [[line (comics)|line]] of ongoing monthly superhero [[American comic books|comic books]]. Using the end of ''[[The New 52]]'' initiative in May 2016 as its launching point, ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' restored the [[DC Universe]] to a form much like that prior to the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' storyline while still incorporating numerous elements of ''[[The New 52]]'', including its continuity.

One night, [[Hawkman|Khufu]] and Chay-Ara discovered a [[Thanagar|Thanagarian]] ship that had landed on Earth. The ship was made of the mysterious [[Nth Metal]]. Exposure to the metal forced Chay-Ara and Khufu, as well as their enemy [[Hath-Set]], into a cycle of endless reincarnation through time and space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hawkman]] #1 (July 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Chay-Ara lived countless lives, before being reborn most recently as Kendra Saunders, while her lover's latest incarnation is [[Hawkman|Carter Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Dark Nights Metal #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkgirl is also a member of the [[Dark Nights: Metal|Immortal Men]], a group of the oldest beings of Earth. As such, she was entrusted by the Immortals with the mission of using the [[Anti-Monitor|Anti-Monitor's]] astral brain in the [[Rock of Eternity]] to destroy the [[Dark Knight Universe|Dark Knights]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Nights: Metal'' #2 (September 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; However, when she tried to do so, she was interrupted by [[Dark Knight Universe|Barbatos]] who transformed her into a dark-hawk version of herself called [[Lady Blackhawk]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Knights: Metal'' #4 (December 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; It's later revealed that because of [[Dark Knight Universe|Barbatos]]'s influence, Kendra's bond to the [[Nth Metal]] was merged into her being. She now boasts an altered physiology reminiscent to her past life as a Thanagarian, which resulted in the grafting of [[Nth Metal]] wings to Hawkgirl's back.&lt;ref&gt;Justice League #7 (September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Hawkgirl regained control of her body after [[Wonder Woman]] used her [[Lasso of Truth]] on her, restoring Kendra's memories. After finding [[Hawkman|Hawkman's]] [[Nth Metal]] mace, Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl traveled through a portal to [[Earth-0|Earth]], where they ended up fighting various corrupted versions of the [[Justice League]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Nights: Metal'' #5 (January 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; During their battle, Hawkgirl encountered [[Hawkman]] possessed by the darkness of ''[[Dark Knight Universe|Barbatos]]''. She was able to release him from the villain's command after encouraging Carter to remember all their past lives together. After assisting in the defeat of ''[[Dark Knight Universe|Barbatos]]'' and the ''[[Dark Knight Universe|Dark Knights]]'', Hawkgirl is recruited to join the new [[Justice League]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Nights: Metal'' #6 (March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikuō has a chain of noodle shops named after him called "Kikuzō Ramen." On ''Shōten'', he often advertises Kikuzō Ramen, but other members joke about it being very flavorless.

It was a division of PEAK Adventure Travel Group, a joint venture of Intrepid Group and TUI Group which owned several adventure tour operator companies, but the principals separated in 2015.

Under Intrepid Group, Darrell Wade and Geoff Manchester took back ownership of a group of tour operator brands, including Intrepid Travel, Adventure Tours Australia, Geckos Adventures (for travelers 29 and younger), Peregrine Adventures, and Urban Adventures. The group also includes the not-for-profit The Intrepid Foundation, and 20 individual destination management companies operating under the PEAK DMC brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.travelpulse.com/news/tour-operators/intrepid-group-and-tui-group-end-peak-adventure-travel-group-joint-venture.html | title=Intrepid Group and TUI Group End PEAK Adventure Travel Group Joint Venture | first=David | last=Cogswell | work=Travel Pulse | date=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content, which looked like it bridged the gap between ''Birth by Sleep'' and the original ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', was believed to be a potential future game in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/19/kingdom-hearts-birth-by-sleep-volume-2-teased-by-final-mix-sec/|title=Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep: Volume 2 teased by Final Mix secret ending|last=Yoon|first=Andrew|publisher=Joystiq via [[Engaget]]|date=January 19, 2011|accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, on the content seen in the secret ending, series director [[Tetsuya Nomura]] stated, "It shows the existence of [[Aqua (Kingdom Hearts)|Aqua]]'s story in the Realm of Darkness. It means that she didn't just wander about in the Darkness for ten years, but that she passed through many experiences. However, it is a "Fragmentary Passage", as the name suggests–that story was severed and wasn't told. I hope I can tell it when given the opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kh13.com/news/nomura-hopes-to-tell-birth-by-sleep-volume-2-s-story-one-day|title=Nomura hopes to tell Birth by Sleep -Volume 2-'s story one day|publisher=KH13|date=October 1, 2014|accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance}}

The title takes place after the events of ''[[Kingdom Hearts coded|Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]'', the game focuses on [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Riku|Riku]]'s Mark of Mastery exam in which they have to protect parallel worlds in preparation for the return of [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Xehanort|Master Xehanort]].

The collection features an HD remaster of ''Dream Drop Distance'',&lt;ref name="GIReveal" /&gt; which Nomura stated was essentially a full remake of the game, since the original utilized the two screens of the [[Nintendo 3DS]].&lt;ref name="Siloconera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gematsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/09/kingdom-hearts-0-2-uses-kingdom-hearts-iii-technology|title=Kingdom Hearts 0.2 uses Kingdom Hearts III technology|last=Romano|first=Sal|publisher=Gematsu|date=September 20, 2015|accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minigames from the original 3DS version that utilized that console's dual touch screens, were reworked into a card-based system,&lt;ref name="IGNE32016Demo" /&gt; while enemies were made "less offensive than they originally were", a complaint from players in the original.

'''''La Belle Paree''''' was a musical [[revue]] that launched the legitimate theatre career of [[Al Jolson]]. The book was by [[Edgar Smith (librettist) |Edgar Smith]], music by [[Jerome Kern]] and Frank Tours and lyrics by [[Edward Madden]]. Billee Taylor provided additional music and lyrics, and [[M. E. Rourke]] and Frederick Day provided additional lyrics.{{fact|date=June 2014}} It premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1911.

==Production==
''La Belle Paree'' was staged between 20 March 1911 and 10 June 1911 at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] in New York, running for 104 performances. At first it was staged along with various companion pieces, including an overture, a one-act opera set in China, called ''Bow-Sing'', an exotic dance sequence called ''Tortajada and Her Sixteen Moorish Dancing Girls in a Spanish Ballet'', and an afterpiece.
After opening night, the show was trimmed and reorganized, and the companion pieces were soon dropped.{{sfn|Bowers|2012|pp=8–13}}
The show was produced by [[Lee Shubert]] and [[Jacob J. Shubert]], staged by [[J. C. Huffman]] and William J. Wilson, and choreographed by Wilson.{{sfn|La Belle Paree, IBDB}}
The production was briefly revived in September of the same year and then toured from September to November.{{sfn|McLellan|2008}}

==Show==
The [[Shubert Brothers]] engaged [[Al Jolson]] for his first Broadway appearance in ''La Belle Paree'', which was the first show to play at their new Winter Garden Theatre.{{sfn|Reublin|2002}}  
The piece concerned Bridgeeta McShane, a wealthy American widow visiting Paris for her health, who meets a number of suitors and eccentric characters, including Erastus Sparkler, played by Jolson.{{sfn|McLellan|2008}} 
Jolson soon converted this supporting role into a star vehicle, and he would make a dozen further Broadway appearances (often at the Winter Garden) in his varied career.{{sfn|Freedland|1972|p=55–57}}

The first performance was overlong and dragged in places, continuing until almost 1:00 am, and some of the audience left before the end. The reviews were mixed, and Jolson was disappointed with his own performance. Jolson was scheduled late in the program, as ''La Belle Paris'' followed most of the companion pieces. Jolson played a phony "colored aristocrat", the boyfriend of Bridgeeta's Black maid, played by Mayhew. He wore [[blackface]], and together they sang [[Jerome Kern]]'s [[coon song]] ''Paris is a Paradise for Coons'', about the freedoms African-Americans supposedly enjoyed living in Paris rather than in "Yankee Land".{{sfn|Bowers|2012|pp=8–13}}
They also sang another song together, Jolson gave a monologue and sang a third song during the evening.{{sfn|Freedland|1972|p=55–57}}
Many of the critics had already left before Jolson came on, to make their publication deadlines, but the critics that mentioned Jolson and Mayhew, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised them.{{sfn|Hischak|2013|p=105}}

During the second performance, Jolson interrupted the performance to talk to the audience about the poor reviews, and then asked them if they would rather hear him sing. When they agreed, Jolson launched into a series of his own numbers.
This time the reviews were very positive, and the show played for the rest of the season to solid audiences.{{sfn|Reublin|2002}}

'''Ladram Bay''' is a secluded bay with pebble beach, between the coastal towns of [[Budleigh Salterton]] and [[Sidmouth]], on the south coast of [[Devon]], [[England]]. It is about {{convert|11|mi|km}} southeast of [[Exeter]], just under {{convert|2|mi|km}} southwest of Sidmouth and about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} northeast of Budleigh Salterton.

Directly southwest of Ladram Bay are [[Smallstones Point]] and [[Chiselbury Bay]]. To the east is a hill called [[High Peak, Devon|High Peak]] and below the hill are the Hern Point and Big Picket Rocks.

== Geology ==
Among the most impressive sights along the [[Jurassic Coast]] are the [[stack (geology)|sea stack]]s at Ladram Bay. The [[sandstone]]s contain numerous vertical fractures and joints that were formed deep in the Earth's crust during past mountain building periods. The sea picked out these planes of weakness to form caves and natural arches that have since collapsed to produce sea stacks. The “Otter Sandstone” that forms the cliffs and sea stacks were deposited in a hot dry climates in the [[Triassic Period]] about 220 Million years ago. The stacks are composed of the same rock, which is relatively soft, but they have a harder band of sandstone at their base which prevents their rapid erosion by the sea. The striking red colour of the rock is caused by iron oxide, which indicate that the layers were formed in a desert. The presence of ripple marks and channels in the sandstones, together with the remains of the long-extinct plants, insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles, show that the desert was crossed by fertile river valleys.

The [[Otter Sandstone Formation]] is the richest source of Triassic reptile remains in Britain and one of the most important in the world. At the south-west end of the bay, the most common fossils in the sandstone are networks of vertical, tube-like carbonate petrifactions ([[Rhizolith|rhizocretions]]): these represent the roots of plants that were able to survive in the harsh dry climate of the Triassic Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/environmentplanning/natural_environment/geology/easterndevon.htm#24|title=Geology to see in Eastern Devon|publisher=Devon County Council|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bay is sited on the same band of sandstone that forms the oil reservoir at the [[Wytch Farm]] oilfield on the [[Isle of Purbeck]].

== Leisure ==
The [[Campsite#Holiday park|holiday park]] at Ladram Bay is the second largest holiday centre in Devon. It was started by FWS Carter in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ladrambay.co.uk/about-us/|title=About Us|website=Ladram Bay Holiday Park|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the site of the first [[digital TV]] transponder in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) 2 Durlston Head to Rame Head Appendix E – Issues and Objectives Evaluation|url=http://www.sdadcag.org/docs/Appendices/Appendix_E_FINAL.pdf|publisher=SDADCAG|accessdate=7 July 2016|page=E26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lady Penelope''''' was a British weekly [[comic]] book magazine for girls which ran from 1966 to 1969. The title character was based on [[Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward]], the secret agent seen in the television series ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''. Most of the other strips in the comic were also based on popular television shows of the era.

==Publication history==

===Background===
Before ''Lady Penelope'' became an independent comic, a strip featuring the title character was one of four colour strips to launch the  [[TV Century 21]]. It was published while ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' was still being made and the script acted as a prelude to the upcoming ''Thunderbirds'' comic.

=== ''Lady Penelope'' ===
Following the success of the ''Lady Penelope'' strip a ''Lady Penelope'' was launched as the sister publication to ''[[TV Century 21]]'', marketed as ''the comic for girls who love television''. It ran for 204 issues with the first dated 22 January 1966.

The title changed to ''The New Lady Penelope'' with issue 53, back to ''Lady Penelope'' with issue 63 and then to ''Penelope'' from issue 123 onwards.

The run ended with issue 204, dated 13 December 1969, after which the title joined with ''[[Princess Tina]]''. This merge appears to have been arranged hastily and would have left some of the weekly comic strip serials unfinished, so the endings of these were included in the form of text stories in issue 204.

Despite the combined title, only one comic serial from ''Penelope'' survived the merge, albeit with the format and main character's name altered. The title would revert to ''Princess Tina'' before the end of 1970.

==Notable comic strips==
*Lady Penelope - based on the secret agent seen in the television series ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.
*The Angels - stories set around the pilots from ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]''.
* [[The Monkees]] - based on the [[NBC]] television series.
*[[The Beverly Hillbillies]] - based on the [[CBS]] television series.
*[[Bewitched]] - based on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series. This was the only strip other than Lady Penelope's to last until the end of the run.
*Class Six Sterndorf - about a special class where young girls are trained to become spies. Created by [[Angus Allan]].
*Creighton Ward - stories about a young nurse, Pat, on a children's hospital ward.
*[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]] - based on the [[Associated TeleVision|ATV]] series.
*[[Daktari]] - based on the CBS television series.
*[[The Man From U.N.C.L.E.]] - based on the NBC television series.
*[[The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.]] - based on the NBC television series.
*Jenny Ware - humorous stories about a girl who accidentally discovers a chemical that sends her backward or forward in time.
*Marina, Girl of the Sea - stories about Marina, the mute undersea girl seen in ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]''.
*Penny - stories about Lady Penelope when she was a young girl.
*Perils of Parker - humorous stories based loosely on the character from ''Thunderbirds''.
*[[Space Family Robinson]] - original stories using the characters and technology from the [[Gold Key Comics]] title.
*What Did That Dog Say? - humorous stories about a girl who can understand the language of dogs thanks to a magic ring. Created by [[Angus Allan]], this first appeared in ''Lady Penelope'' as a text story. It was popular enough with readers to become a weekly comic strip. Later it would be renamed ''What Did That Dog (And Cat) Say?'' when the main character, Cathy, gains the ability to understand cats as well as dogs.

==Makeup techniques==
; Fashion
Fashion makeup is used in magazine photography as well as on the fashion runway. [[Avant-garde]] makeup is also an applicable technique used for projects that require experimental themes. Fashion makeup is also commonly used in [[television]] and [[film]] ranging for the natural ''prime look'' to more sophisticated applications such as ''color balance''.
; Theatrical makeup
Stage makeup is used as a method in conjunction with stage lighting to highlight the actors' faces in order to make expressions visible to the audience from moderate distances.  This often includes defining the eyes and lips as well as the highlights and lowlights of the facial bones.
; Special make-up effects (FX makeup)
{{main|Prosthetic makeup}}
The use of special effects techniques enhancing physical features to exhibit {{clarify|text=[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] characteristics|date=January 2016}} as well as fantasy makeup. The use of prosthetics and plaster casting are also required for projects that entails non-human appearances. Accents such as [[theatrical blood]] and ooze are also techniques applicable to this type of makeup.
; Airbrushing
The use of an [[airbrush]] which is a small air-operated device that sprays various media some products and water-based makeup by a process of nebulization.  The earliest record of this type of cosmetic application dates back to the 1925&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AIRBRUSH FOUNDATION MAKE-UP| url=http://www.airbrushbodyart.com.au/foundation_make-up.htm | work=Airbrush Body Art | accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; film version of Ben-Hur, it has recently been re-popularized by the advent of HDTV and digital photography, where the camera focuses on higher depths of detail. Liquid foundations that are high in coverage but thin in consistency are applied with the airbrush for full coverage without a heavy build-up of product.
; Bridal makeup
Bridal makeup is a new segment in a makeup artist's repertoire.  From ethnic, to glamorous, to contemporary, makeup artists are now an important part of wedding planning in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America.
; High definition
This is an art which involves the use of light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Top High Definition Makeup | url=http://makeup.about.com/od/topsplurg8/tp/Top-High-Definition-Makeup.htm | work=Makeup.com| accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflectors and ingredients such as minerals to give the skin a flawless finish. This was developed due to the further development of [[HDTV|high definition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1955 the [[Bollywood]] group Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) created a rule that did not allow women to obtain memberships as makeup artists.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Samyabrata Ray Goswami |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1141111/jsp/frontpage/story_19024241.jsp#.VTaWKul0wdk |title=Women get makeup justice |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014 the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that this rule was in violation of the Indian constitutional guarantees granted under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to carry out any profession) and Article 21 (right to liberty).&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; The judges of the Supreme Court of India stated that the ban on women makeup artist members had no "rationale nexus" to the cause sought to be achieved and was "unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to the citizens.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; The Court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist, female or male, to work in the industry, they must have domicile status of five years in the state where they intend to work.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"/&gt; In 2015 it was announced that Charu Khurana had become the first woman to be registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amit Anand Choudhary|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bollywood/Bollywood-make-up-artists-group-inducts-first-woman-after-SC-rap/articleshow/46995208.cms |title=Bollywood make-up artists’ group inducts first woman after SC rap |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist &amp; Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) authorised an official protest on the movie set of [[Bang Bang!]] in protest of a foreign makeup artist, Daniel Bauer working on the movie for its lead actress, [[Katrina Kaif]]. The CCMAA and 15 of its members protested on the movie set as Daniel Bauer was not registered with the Union, despite the Union banning foreign artists working in Bollywood. The issue was resolved with the CCMAA granting Daniel Bauer full membership &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/salman-khan-comes-to-katrina-kaif-s-rescue/story-GMCYL9HKR55xcJU3pXZB7O.html|title=Salman Khan comes to Katrina Kaif's rescue|author=|date=28 June 2014|website=hindustantimes.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Musical Ride''' of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is a [[Formality|formal]] event showcasing the [[equestrianism|equestrian]] skills performed by 32 [[cavalry]] who are regular members of the force. The event is held in Canada and worldwide to promote the RCMP. The first official ride was held in 1887 in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina, District of Assiniboia]], and was commanded by [[Inspector]] William George Matthews.

The Musical Ride was featured on the [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill]] of the [[Scenes of Canada]] banknote series produced from 1969 to 1979.

'''''{{Lang|it|Ossia}}''''' {{IPA-it|osˈsiːa|}} is a musical term for an alternative passage which may be played instead of the original passage. The word ''[[Wikt:ossia|ossia]]'' comes from the Italian for "alternatively" and was originally spelled ''o sia'', meaning "or be it" (Fallows 774).

''Ossia'' passages are very common in [[opera]] and solo-[[piano]] works. They are usually an easier version of the preferred form of passage, but in [[Mily Balakirev]]'s ''[[Islamey]]'', for instance, the [[Urtext edition|urtext]] has ossia passages of both types (simpler and more difficult). [[Bel canto]] vocal music also frequently uses ''ossia'', also called ''[[Wikt:oppure|oppure]]'', passages to illustrate a more embellished version of the vocal line (Fallows 774).

On the other hand, an ''ossia'' marking does not always indicate a change in difficulty; the piano solo music of [[Franz Liszt]] is typically full of alternative passages, often no easier or more difficult than the rest of the piece. This reflects Liszt's desire to leave his options open during a performance. Many of his ''ossia'' passages are [[cadenza]]s.

An unusual use of ''ossia'' is found in Alban Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] where several ''ossia'' parts are included for the solo violin. If the soloist chooses to play these, the [[concertmaster]] is required to play a different ossia (which takes part of the solo violin line that is lost in favor of the soloist's ossia).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5200">'''Oubapo''' ({{IPA-fr|ubapo}}, short for {{lang-fr|'''Ou'''vroir de '''ba'''nde dessinée '''po'''tentielle}}; roughly translated: ''"workshop of potential [[comic book art]]"'') is a [[Comic book|comics]] movement which believes in the use of [[Formalism (art)|formal]] [[Constrained comics|constraints]] to push the boundaries of the medium. OuBaPo is styled after the [[France|French]] literary movement [[Oulipo]] (''Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle''), founded by [[Raymond Queneau]] and [[Georges Perec]]. Oubapo was founded in November 1992 in the [[Ouxpo|Ou-X-Po]] and announced in [[L'Association]]'s French comics edition.

== Meaning of the name ==
The term "ouvroir," originally used in conjunction with works of charity, was reused by Queneau for a blend of "ouvroir" and "œuvre" ("work") and roughly corresponds to the English "workshop." The term "potential" is used in the sense of that which is possible, or realisable if one follows certain rules. Thus, "OuBaPo" can be roughly translated as "Potential Comics Workshop."

== Constraints ==
Some OuBapoian constraints:&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

; '''Reduction''': A book or comic summarized in very few panels
; '''Reversibility''': A comic that can be read back to front
; '''Iconic Alliteration''': The same drawing reproduced throughout the whole comic with only the words changing

== History ==
By the late 1980s, cartoonist [[Lewis Trondheim]] had established a reputation for his various conceptual comics, such as ''Le dormeur'' and ''Psychanalyse'', both of which were created entirely with a single photocopied panel. Similarly, ''Bleu'' and ''La nouvelle pornographie'' were both billed as "abstract comic books." After completing ''Psychanalyse'', Trondheim was challenged by fellow cartoonist [[Jean-Christophe Menu]] to write a story with only four panels, drawn by Menu. After some strips, Trondheim asked for four more panels, and wrote the highly dense comic book, ''Moins d'un quart de seconde pour vivre''. The [[constrained writing]] results, reminiscent of [[OuLiPo]] writers, became the basis for OuBaPo.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/tcj-300/tcj-300-conversations-jean-christophe-menu-sammy-harkham/ "TCJ 300 Conversations: Jean-Christophe Menu &amp; Sammy Harkham,"] ''The Comics Journal'' #300 (Dec. 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; (During this period, Trondheim, Menu, and a few other cartoonists had also co-founded the publisher [[L'Association]], which later published many of the group's books.)

Menu, Trondheim, six other cartoonists, and comic-book historian [[Gilles Ciment]] often frequented the Parisian artists' studio Nawak (French slang for "nonsense"), where they discussed comic book constraints over snacks and beer. The group founded OuBaPo under the mantra that "constraints free the artistic mind."&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Colchester, Max. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704515904576075980439410992 "Jerry Lewis Is Funny to the French, but Comic Books Are Serious Business: Ruling Clique Squabbles Over 'Ninth Art'; 'We Laughed About It, Later We Wept'."] ''Wall Street Journal'' (Jan. 21, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next decade, the nine founding members met three times a year and worked on various constraints. OuBaPo created a board game called '''Scroubabble''' — based on [[Scrabble]] but with comic-book panels instead of letters. They also created a comic-book tale that repeated itself endlessly. Their first collection of works, ''OuPus 1'', was published in 1997; three more ''OuPus'' books were published between 2003–2005. In addition, the group held several exhibitions in Paris.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

In 2005, Trondheim and Menu had a falling out over the direction of the group, with Trondheim leaving the group in the fall of 2006. In 2007, another one of the founders quit after a disagreement with Menu. In 2008, founder Ciment (director of a French cultural center dedicated to comics) left after also arguing with Menu.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

In November 2010, an OuBaPo delegation went to [[Rennes]] to celebrate Oulipo's 50th anniversary. There, the OuBaPo members played Scroubabble before a live audience.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

== Membership ==
A very select group, there is no membership application to OuBaPo. Candidates are singled out and elected by unanimous acclimation of the existing members.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; The group's nine current members live in France, the United States, Spain, and Switzerland. American cartoonist [[Matt Madden]] is OuBaPo's "U.S. correspondent."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

The '''Plasmatron''', or technically '''plasma addressed liquid crystal''' ('''PALC'''), is a [[color television]] display technology developed by [[Tektronix]] and [[Sony]] in the 1990s. PALC displays combine rows formed from [[liquid crystal display|liquid crystals]] with columns formed from [[plasma display|plasma cells]], the latter replacing the transistorized switching in a conventional LCD.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Normile, "Liquid crystals meet plasma", ''Popular Science'','''Vol. 247''', No. 4, page 50, Oct 1995, Bonnier Corporation ISSN 0161-7370, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EzktJTiKxFIC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=plasmatron+TV&amp;lr=&amp;ei=VSy8SbysO5b0ygSC28GaCw retrieved 14 March 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although PALC was successfully developed,  [[thin-film transistor]] based LCD devices were improved which offset PALC's advantages. PALC development has been largely abandoned since the early 2000s.

==History==
PALC was originally developed by Thomas Buzak, who worked at [[Tektronix]] in the U.S. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s he developed and patented a number of concepts that used [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] to provide a switching element for a variety of uses. When the project he was working on was canceled, he turned his attention to using the plasma elements as LCD switches, and the PALC system was born.&lt;ref&gt;''Discover'', July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Tektronix licensed the technology to [[Sony]], and together they started development of the Plasmatron televisions. In October 1996 Sony entered a three-year arrangement with [[Sharp Electronics]] to share development, with Sharp's role being to help improve the effective display angles. In July 1997 the group was joined by [[Philips Electronics]] to improve the resolution of the devices, reduce power consumption and increase brightness.&lt;ref&gt;''PALC''&lt;/ref&gt; Sony and Sharp both produced [[high-definition television]] prototypes using the PALC technology, but these never made it to production.

PALC was offset by the rapid introduction of [[thin-film transistor]]s, which allowed individual cells of the LCD to be addressed directly. A grid of rows and columns allows the transistors to be turned on or off just like the plasma cells, but without the need for high voltages or resetting pulse. At first these devices were difficult to produce, but as processes improved the printing methods developed from the semiconductor industry replaced the mechanical complexity of the PALC cell. PALC is no longer being actively developed.&lt;ref&gt;''PALC''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{unreferenced|section|date=March 2009}}
A conventional LCD consists of a grid of individual LCD "cells" with red, green or blue (RGB) colored filters in front of them. A back light source, typically a [[fluorescent lamp]] or [[LED]] in modern systems, shines white light through the cells. By changing the opacity of the cells, differing quantities of RGB light are produced at any one triplet of cells, producing a single color as seen by the eye. The main problem with producing such a display is the need to individually address the enormous number of cells; in a modern [[high definition television]] with a 1080p display, this requires 1080 rows of 1920 triplet cells per row, or 6,220,800 individual LCD cells.

PALC displays attempted to address this problem by introducing an intermediate area between the backlight and the LCD on top that used plasma techniques as a "switch". Instead of using individual cells, the display was arranged as a series of rows of LCDs, arranged in an RGB pattern. Beneath the LCD, and above the backlight, was a plasma display consisting of columns of anodes. A clear conductive cathode was positioned above every LCD row.

To produce a display, the system powered each row of the cathodes in turn, along with lit anodes in the plasma layer. This produced a field between the anodes in the columns and cathodes on the rows, producing individually addressed cells. A small amount of ionized gas is pushed towards the LCD in the cells that are powered, creating a small charged spot just below the LCD layer. This switches the LCD, and the amount of power controls the resulting opacity. Cells had to be "erased" to re-draw, by passing a high negative voltage through the cell to push the gas off the LCD layer.

'''''Rampage Knights''''' is a 2015 indie video game by [[Rake In Grass]].&lt;ref name=RPS1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Graham|title=Rampage Knights Is The Binding Of Golden Axe|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/rampage-knights/|website=Rocket, paper, shotgun|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The game is inspired by ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' and ''[[Golden Axe (series)|Golden Axe]]''. It was announced on 8 March 2013 as a mixture of fast action beat ‘em up game and dungeon crawler with a focus for exploration.&lt;ref name=RIG1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chmelar|first1=Frantisek|title=Rampage Knights (Working Title)|url=http://www.rakeingrass.com/2013/03/rampage-knights/|website=RakeInGrass.com|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamescz1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loukota|first1=Ladislav|title=Český tým Rake in Grass se hlásí se slibnou arkádou Rampage Knights|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/cesky-tym-rake-in-grass-se-hlasi-se-slibnou-arkadou-rampage-knights-240475|website=Games.cz|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers later changed their plans so the game was to be more linear because the map with exploring was making too much frustration. Developers also released a playable demo and started an [[Indiegogo]] campaign and a [[Steam Greenlight]] campaign. The game was Greenlighted on 11 June 2014 but the indiegogo campaign was unsuccessful. Developers then announced they plan to finish the game. Unsucces on Indiegogo means stripping of the unnecessary extra features intended. They also mentioned of possibility that the game will be released in Early Access.&lt;ref name=RIG2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chmelar|first1=Frantisek|title=RAMPAGE KNIGHTS: UPDATE|url=http://www.rakeingrass.com/2014/05/rampage-knights-update/|website=RakeInGrass.com|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=75 Titles Greenlit Today|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/765/announcements/detail/162444381341778403|website=Steam Greenlight|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rampage Knights post-Indiegogo update|url=http://www.rakeingrass.com/2014/07/rampage-knights-post-indiegogo-update/|website=RakeInGrass.com|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was released as early access on 29 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rampage Knights launches tomorrow!|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/314410/announcements/detail/136572238832584485|website=Steam|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on September 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chmelař|first1=František|title=RAMPAGE KNIGHTS RELEASE DATE|url=http://www.rakeingrass.com/2015/08/rampage-knights-release-date/|website=Rake In Grass|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The player controls a Knight who fights enemies in a procedurally generated dungeon. He can upgrade his character as he progresses in the game and also buy him a better equipment. Player can also unlock new characters. The fighting system is based on [[Golden Axe (series)|Golden Axe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7884">The term  '''studio recording''' means any [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] made in a [[Recording studio|studio]], as opposed to a [[live music|live]] recording, which is usually made in a [[concert]] venue or a [[theatre]], with an audience attending the [[performance]].

==Studio cast recordings==

In the case of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals, the term studio cast recording applies to a recording of the show which does not feature the cast of either a [[Stage (theater)|stage production]] or [[film]] version of the show.

The practice has existed since before the advent of Broadway [[cast album]]s in 1943. That year the songs from [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', performed by the show's cast, were released on a multi-record 78-RPM album by American [[Decca Records|Decca]]. (London original cast albums have existed since the early days of recording, however, and there are recordings in existence of excerpts from such shows as ''[[The Desert Song]]'', ''[[Sunny (musical)|Sunny]]'', and ''[[Show Boat]]'', all performed by their original London stage casts.)

===History===
Before 1943, musicals were recorded in the U.S. with what might be termed studio casts, although in many cases, such as  those of [[Walter Huston]] from ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' and [[Helen Morgan]] from ''[[Show Boat]]'', singer-actors from a musical ''did'' make recordings of songs from the shows they appeared in. Another such example is [[Ethel Merman]], who recorded virtually all of the songs that she made famous, even when there was no original Broadway cast album of a smash hit that she had starred in, as is the case with ''[[Girl Crazy]]'', ''[[Panama Hattie]]'', and ''[[Anything Goes]]''. [[Paul Robeson]], who appeared in several productions of ''Show Boat'' (though not the original Broadway production), made many recordings of the song ''[[Ol' Man River]]'' from the show.

However, early "studio cast" albums were very different from those made today, or even those made from 1950 onward. Many of them were simply a collection of songs from a show, and made no attempt to recreate what a performance of the show was actually like. (In the [[liner notes]] for the new studio cast recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1947 semi-flop ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'', former [[Columbia Records]] president [[Goddard Lieberson]] is given credit for virtually inventing the idea of a studio cast recording.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001L5DSP2|title=Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Allegro" First Complete Recording|author=|date=3 February 2009|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Hummel, the author of “The Collector’s Guide to the American Musical Theatre” (Scarecrow Press, 1984) was the first person to come up with the term “studio cast” in lists he was making of Broadway recordings.  In these lists, which date back to the 1950s, he documented Original Cast (OC), Soundtrack (ST) and when the Goddard Lieberson cast recordings came out he wasn’t sure how to catalog them so the term “studio cast” (SC) came into being.  Author Stanley Green even wrote to Mr. Hummel asking if he could use the term.  Mr. Hummel responded that he didn’t own the term; it was just something he came up with for his lists so the recordings could be catalogued.

Beginning in 1943, then-current revivals of musicals began to be recorded with their stage casts, a custom that persists today. Therefore, we have recordings of the 1943 cast of [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', the 1946 cast of [[Jerome Kern|Kern]] and Hammerstein's ''Show Boat'' and the 1951 cast of [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]'s ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'', all of them pre-1943 musicals. But there are no actual original Broadway cast albums of any of these shows.

Studio cast recordings have become especially useful in the era of [[compact disc]]s after being overshadowed for years by original cast albums - in nearly all cases, moderate to large numbers of songs (or instrumental music) were left out of original cast albums of older shows because there was simply no room for all of them on a single LP, even one that lasted 50 minutes. The extended length of a typical CD makes it possible to include all the songs and music from one show on one or more discs, and studio casts have had to be the ones to record new albums of older shows, since, in many cases, original cast members are either long retired or have died.

In the past, studio cast albums have almost invariably used different orchestrations and vocal arrangements from those heard in the show, but with interest growing in the way shows from the past first sounded on Broadway, these albums are now nearly always recorded using the original orchestral and vocal arrangements of the shows in question, especially after the 1982 discovery in a [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] [[Warner Bros.]] warehouse of the original manuscripts of many classic Broadway shows in their original orchestrations. One such example is the aforementioned ''Of Thee I Sing'', which was recorded on CD with its original orchestrations and vocal arrangements for the first time in 1987, featuring a cast headed by [[Larry Kert]] and [[Maureen McGovern]].

Occasionally, film scores were recorded with studio casts, especially in the days before [[soundtrack album]]s. One such example is Decca's 1939 album of songs from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which featured [[Judy Garland]] singing ''Over the Rainbow'' and the deleted song ''The Jitterbug'', but the [[Ken Darby]] Singers singing the rest of the score.

==The process==
[[Click track]]s (i.e. metronome recordings at a certain tempo) are often used to keep the musicians in perfect time; these can be played in musicians' ears through [[headphones]], and so, barring any bleed, will not be picked up by the microphones and thus be silent on the final track.

In bands, different groups have different orders of recording instruments. Some record the entire group at the same time, as would be played in a live performance, though this can cause some instruments to be picked up on the microphones of others, which can complicate [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]: partition screens are available to counter this. Others choose to add tracks one by one. For example, a group may choose to have the drum and bass guitar record first, so that the following instruments keep in time, and can play to a better 'feel' of the song. Vocals are usually added last, only followed by backing vocals or solos, which may change or be complicated, meaning that multiple attempts could be useful before deciding on a final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearldrummersforum.com/showthread.php?t=161949&amp;page=1&amp;pp=12 |title=Default  click tracks?????? |accessdate=2008-03-21 |date=December 2006 |publisher=Pearl Drummers Forum |pages=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scratch tracks are tracks that are played through roughly at first, so other musicians have something to work with, and can play to support the other parts. However, it is not final, and once the other musicians have recorded their parts, it will be rerecorded, when the musician will be able to play against the strengths of the parts already recorded, and have a better grasp of the feel of the music. In the previous example, the bass guitar part that was recorded first might just be a scratch track, to help the drummer get a feel of where emphasis and space in the song is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pearldrummersforum.com/showthread.php?p=305585 |title=Metronome/Click Track |accessdate=2008-03-21 |author=Praetor70 |date=2003-08-18 |publisher=Pearl Drummers Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tale Spinners for Children''' was a series of stories and novels adapted for young audiences on vinyl records in the early 1960s. They included a collection of old [[fairy tales]], [[folklore]], literary classics such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and time-honored [[fables]], with the title role sometimes played by a renowned theatrical actor or actress. (Many of the actors who appeared, however, such as [[Maggie Smith]] or [[Alec McCowen]], became more famous for other roles years after the albums were released, and some of the actors, such as [[Donald Pleasence]], who played Don Quixote, or [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]], who played several villainous roles, were not even identified on the album covers.) The series gave children an exposure to timeless classic stories.

Originally only 30 records were pressed in England and France and sold as [[Atlas Talespinners]] under the [[Atlas Record]] label, and included an easy to follow story booklet. Within a few years, these records were introduced to the U.S. as Tale Spinners for Children under the [[United Artists Records]] label. What was known as the Atlas Theatre Company in England was marketed as the Famous Theatre Company in the United States. The story booklets were not included in the U.S. releases.

UA continued to produce more stories records until the early 1970s, and distribute them in the Canadian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Canada by The Compo Company Ltd., Lachine, Que.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Australia Under License from United Artists Records, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; markets as well.

With popular children's record companies like [[Walt Disney Records]] already on the market, a host of other record companies followed: [[Mercury Storyteller]] series, [[Golden Records]], [[Telegeneral Let's Pretend]], [[Riverside Wonderland]] and [[Pathways of Sound]].

==History==
United Artists released the 30 original stories in the US in 1962. The recording labels changed when [[Liberty Records]] (its budget subsidiary [[Sunset Records]]) and [[United Artists Records]]&lt;ref&gt;©LIBERTY/UA, INC., Los Angeles, Calf.&lt;/ref&gt;  merged in 1968 after [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]]&lt;ref&gt;DEPT. SUS 6920 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, Calif. (90028)&lt;/ref&gt; bought Liberty. All labels were merged under United Artists in 1971. When Liberty was deactivated in 1971 (for the first time) both the Sunset and Talespinners series was leased by [[Springboard International]]&lt;ref&gt;Distributed by SPRINGBOARD INTERNATIONAL RECORDS, INC., 947 U.S. Highway 1, Rahway, New Jersey 07065&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of the Talespinners series they used the same catalog numbers until 1975. When Springboard International Records went bankrupt 1984 [[Gusto Records]] acquired some of their catalogues from [[Jay-Koala]].

==Music==
''Tale Spinners for Children'' used classical music as background and linking music in their productions.  Examples of this include:
* ''Robin Hood'' (UAC 11001) - [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Violin Concerto in E minor]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''William Tell'' (UAC 11002) - [[William Tell Overture]] and Overture from ''[[La Gazza Ladra]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]]
* ''The Three Musketeers'' (UAC 11007) - "The Dance of the Furies" from ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' by [[Christoph Gluck]]
* ''Treasure Island'' (UAC 11013) - [[Symphonie fantastique]] by [[Hector Berlioz]] ''(also used in "Hiawatha" [UAC 11054])''
* ''Sinbad the Sailor'' (UAC 110020) - [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] ''(also used in "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" [UAC 11018] and "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp" [UAC 11019])''
* ''Rip Van Winkle'' (UAC 11034) - [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|Overture for A Midsummer Night's Dream]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''Christopher Columbus'' (UAC 11040) - [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|New World Symphony]] by [[Antonín Dvořák]]
* ''The Little Mermaid'' (UAC 11042) - [[Piano Concerto (Grieg)|Piano Concerto in A minor]] by [[Edvard Grieg]]
* ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' (UAC 11044) - [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6]] by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]

[[File:MOVIE THEATRE - NARA - 550685.jpg|thumb|right|''The Cheerleaders'' playing at a movie theater in [[Berlin, New Hampshire]] (June 1973)]]
'''''The Cheerleaders''''' (UK theatrical title: '''''The 18 Year Old Schoolgirls''''') is a 1973 [[comedy film]] directed by [[Paul Glickler]], starring Stephanie Fondue and Denise Dillaway.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The film was made in the summer of 1972 in the cities of Cupertino, California and Sunnyvale, California.  The high school scenes were shot at [[Monta Vista High School]] in Cupertino, California. The administration of Monta Vista high school claimed to not be aware of the racy elements and theme of the movie. Many of the football player extras were recent graduates of local high schools from these two cities.  The red uniforms in the film representing the home team high school Amarosa High School were actual uniforms of Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, California from that same year.  One of the identified extras is [[Carl Ekern]], who later played professional football for the Los Angeles Rams. He was a student football player at San Jose State University when the movie was made.

The film's success spawned a [[#Sequels|series of sequels]] during the 1970s.

==Plot==
A group of high school cheerleaders have sex with the opposing team's players to make them too tired to play football properly, allowing their team to win an unprecedented series of games.

The film courted controversy due to its plot and subject matter:  the titular cheerleaders are seen seducing, among others, the football coach, a female gym coach, and the school bus driver.  There was also [[female on male rape]] when the cheerleaders kidnap and then have sex with the members of the opposing football team the night before the big game.  In areas where the age of consent was 18 at the time, or where the laws on consent prohibited under-18s having sex with over-18s, there was controversy over [[statutory rape]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Re-releases of the film have been renamed as "The Eighteen Year Old Schoolgirls" in some regions,{{Clarify|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} presumably so as to remove at least part of that particular controversy, as the exact age of the girls was never stated within the film.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Cast==
* [[Stephanie Fondue]] (actual name [[Enid Finnbogason]]) as Jeannie
* [[Denise Dillaway]] as Claudia
* [[Jovita Bush]] as Bonnie
* [[Sandy Evans (actress)|Sandy Evans]] as Suzie

* [[Jonathan Jacobs]] as Norm
* [[Richard Meatwhistle]] as Jon
* [[Patrick Wright (actor)|Partick Wright]] as Coach Gannon

==Sequels==
''The Cheerleaders'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]) was followed by ''[[The Swinging Cheerleaders]]'' ([[1974 in film|1974]]), directed by Jack Hill, ''[[Revenge of the Cheerleaders]]'' ([[1976 in film|1976]]), directed by Richard Lerner, and ''[[The Great American Girl Robbery]]'' ([[1979 in film|1979]]) (aka ''Cheerleaders Wild Weekend''), directed by Jeff Werner.
