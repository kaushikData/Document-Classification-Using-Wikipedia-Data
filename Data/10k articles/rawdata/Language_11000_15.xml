'''Aboutness''' is a term used in [[library and information science]] (LIS), [[linguistics]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[philosophy of mind]]. In LIS, it is often considered synonymous with [[subject (documents)]]. In the philosophy of mind it has been often considered synonymous with [[intentionality]], perhaps since [[John Searle]] (1983). In the philosophy of logic and language it is understood as the way a piece of text relates to a subject matter or topic.

R. A. Fairthorne (1969) is credited with coining the exact term "aboutness", which became popular in LIS since the late 1970s, perhaps due to arguments put forward by [[William John Hutchins]] (1975, 1977, 1978). Hutchins argued that "aboutness" was to be preferred to "subject" because it removed some epistemological problems. [[Birger Hjørland]] (1992, 1997) argued, however, that the same epistemological problems also were present in Hutchins' proposal, why "aboutness" and "subject" should be considered synonymous.

While information scientists may well be concerned with the literary aboutness (John Hutchins, 1975, 1977, 1978), philosophers of mind and psychologists with the psychological or [[intentionality|intentional]] aboutness (John Searle, 1983) and [[language of thought]] (Jerry Fodor, 1975), and [[semantic externalism|semantic externalists]] with the external state of affairs (Hilary Putnam, 1975). These seminal perspectives are respectively analogous to [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards|Richards]]' ''literary, psychological, and external contexts'' (1923), as well as [[Karl Popper]]'s [[Popper's three worlds|World 1, 2, and 3]] (1977).

== Organization ==
The Academy is composed of two sections:

* Social Sciences and Albanological Section
* Natural and Technical Sciences Section

It also includes the following units:

* Projects of Technological and Innovation Development,
* Branch for Foreign and Public Relations,
* Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akad.edu.al/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D68%26Itemid%3D63|title=Biblioteka|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Academy of Sciences of Albania|language=Albanian|trans-title=Library|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216223443/http://www.akad.edu.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=63|archivedate=February 16, 2010|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Publishing

The Academy of Sciences of Albania has the country's largest [[academic library]]. Founded in 1975 starting with 10,000 volumes, it included 812,000 volumes by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=academy+of+sciences+of+albania&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=academy%20of%20sciences%20of%20albania&amp;f=false|title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services|last=|first=|publisher=American Library Association|year=1993|isbn=9780838906095|editor-last=Wedgeworth|editor-first=Robert|editor-link=Robert Wedgeworth|edition=3rd|location=Chicago|pages=40&amp;ndash;42|chapter=Albania|oclc=300362088|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Ó Dónalláin was a member of a minor family of [[bard]]s based at Ballydonnellan, [[Loughrea]], [[County Galway]], in what was then the kingdom of [[Uí Maine]]. Their [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] is given in Leabhar Uí Maine:

gave their descent as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''[[Domnallan mac Maelbrigdi]], mic Grenain, mic Loingsich, mic Domnallain, mic Bresail, mic Dluthaig, mic Fithchellaig, mic Dicholla, mic Eogain Find.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Domnallain mac Maelbrigdi was alive about the reign of king Muirgus mac Domnaill (973-986.

An alternative term for them and their associated families was Clan Breasail, indicating their joint descent from Breasail mac Dluthaig.

Ó Dónalláin is known from a single extant poem of 192 verses, ''Cuige Connacht'', in praise of Aedh Mac Diarmata ([[MacDermot]]) of [[Moylurg]]. This is either Aedh Mac Diarmata (reigned 1368–1393) or Aedh mac Diarmata, (1458–1465).

O'Reilly specifically states that he was a poet to the MacDermots.

An '''annotation''' is a [[metadata|metadatum]] (e.g. a post, explanation, [[markup language|markup]])  attached to location or other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/annotation|title=Definition of ANNOTATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and education==

===Textual scholarship===
{{Main|Textual scholarship}}
[[Textual scholarship]] is a discipline that often uses the technique of annotation to describe or add additional historical context to texts and physical documents.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Student uses===
Students often [[Highlighter|highlight]] passages in books in order to refer back to key phrases easily, or add [[marginalia]] to aid studying.  One educational technique when analyzing prose literature is to have students or teachers circle the names of [[Character (arts)|characters]] and put rectangular boxes around phrases identifying the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of a given scene.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Annotated bibliography|Annotated bibliographies]] add commentary on the relevance or quality of each source, in addition to the usual bibliographic information that merely identifies the source.

===Learning and instruction ===
From a cognitive perspective annotation has an important role in learning and instruction.  As part of guided noticing it involves highlighting, naming or labelling and commenting aspects of visual representations to help focus learners' attention on specific visual aspects. In other words, it means the assignment of typological representations (culturally meaningful categories), to topological representations (e.g. images).&lt;ref&gt;Pea, R. D. (2006). Video-as-Data and Digital Video Manipulation Techniques for Transforming Learning Sciences Research, Education, and Other Cultural Practices. In J. Weiss, J. Nolan, J. Hunsinger, &amp; P. Trifonas (Eds.), The International Handbook of Virtual Learning Environments (pp. 1321-1393. Dordrecht: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important when experts, such as medical doctors, interpret visualizations in detail and explain their interpretations to others, for example by means of digital technology.&lt;ref&gt;Coiera E. Communication spaces. J Am Med Inform Assoc 2013 Sep 4. [doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001520] [Medline: 24005797]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, annotation can be a way to establish [[Grounding in communication|common ground]] between interactants with different levels of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Clark HH. Using Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The value of annotation has been empirically confirmed, for example, in a study which shows that in computer-based teleconsultations the integration of image annotation and speech leads to significantly improved knowledge exchange compared with the use of images and speech without annotation.&lt;ref&gt;Pimmer, C., Mateescu, M., Zahn, C., &amp; Genewein, U. (2013). Smartphones as multimodal communication devices to facilitate clinical knowledge processes - a randomized controlled trial. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 15(11), e263. {{doi|10.2196/jmir.2758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software engineering ==

=== Text documents===
[[Markup language]]s like [[XML]] and [[HTML]] annotate text in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from that text.  They can be used to add information about the desired visual presentation, or machine-readable semantic information, as in the [[semantic web]].&lt;ref name="Web Annotation Data Model"&gt;{{cite web | title = Web Annotation Data Model | url =http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ | publisher = [[World Wide Web Consortium]] | date = 11 December 2014 | accessdate = {{CURRENTDAY}} {{User:Ed Poor/this month}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Source control ===
The "annotate" function (also known as "blame" or "praise") used in [[source control]] systems such as [[Git (software)|Git]], [[Team Foundation Server]] and [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] determines who [[Revision control#Common vocabulary|committed]] changes to the source code into the repository.  This outputs a copy of the source code where each line is annotated with the name of the last contributor to edit that line (and possibly a revision number).  This can help establish blame in the event a change caused a malfunction, or identify the author of brilliant code.

=== Java annotations ===
{{Main|Java annotation}}
A special case is the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], where annotations can be used as a special form of syntactic [[metadata]] in the source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html|title = JDK 5.0 Developer's Guide: Annotations|date = 2007-12-18|accessdate = 2008-03-05|publisher = [[Sun Microsystems]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306060928/http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html| archivedate= 6 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Classes, methods, variables, parameters and packages may be annotated. The annotations can be embedded in [[class (file format)|class files]] generated by the compiler and may be retained by the [[Java virtual machine]] and thus influence the [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] behaviour of an application. It is possible to create meta-annotations out of the existing ones in Java.

==Computational biology==
{{main|DNA annotation}}
Since the 1980s, [[molecular biology]] and [[bioinformatics]] have created the need for [[DNA annotation]]. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it.

==Imaging==
In the [[digital imaging]] community the term annotation is commonly used for visible [[metadata]] superimposed on an [[digital image|image]] without changing the underlying master image, such as [[sticky note]]s, virtual laser pointers, circles, arrows, and black-outs (cf. [[redaction]]).

In the [[medical imaging]] community, an annotation is often referred to as a [[region of interest]] and is encoded in [[DICOM]] format.

==Law==

In the United States, legal publishers such as [[Thomson West]] and [[Lexis Nexis]] publish annotated versions of [[statutes]], providing information about [[Legal opinions|court cases]] that have interpreted the statutes. Both the federal [[United States Code]] and state statutes are subject to interpretation by the [[courts]], and the annotated statutes are valuable tools in [[legal research]].

==Linguistics==

In [[linguistics]], annotations include comments and [[metadata]]; these non-transcriptional annotations are also [[linguistics|non-linguistic]]. A collection of texts with linguistic annotations is known as a [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] (plural ''corpora''). The Linguistic Annotation Wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annotation.exmaralda.org/|title=LinguisticAnnotation|website=annotation.exmaralda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes tools and formats for creating and managing linguistic annotations.

'''BeeChi''' (1913–1980) was a well-known humorist in the [[Kannada]] language. His real name was '''Rayasam Bheemasena Rao'''. He preferred to write his pen name bilingually as '''ಬೀchi'''. He was also known as [[Karnataka]]'s [[George Bernard Shaw]].

==Early life and career==
Beechi was born in 1913 in [[Harapanahalli]] of then the [[Davanagere]] district of [[Karnataka]] state, [[India]]. His father was Srinivas Rao and mother was Bharatamma. He discontinued studies after [[SSLC]] and joined a Government office as an attender.&lt;ref name="beechi"&gt;A brief biography about Beechi is mentioned by {{cite web|url=http://thatskannada.oneindia.in/sahitya/nri3/020603bhoomika.html |title=Bhoomika to re-chew Beechi jokes |work=Online Webpage of Thatskannada.com |publisher=Greynium Information Technologies Pvt. Ltd. |accessdate=1 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165029/http://thatskannada.oneindia.in/sahitya/nri3/020603bhoomika.html |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later worked for the CID for a substantial amount of time. He was married to Seetabai.

==Motivation==
Having no formal exposure to [[Kannada]] or its literature, Beechi was motivated towards Kannada literature after reading [[A. N. Krishna Rao]]'s novel ''Sandhyaraga'' (ಸಂಧ್ಯಾರಾಗ) on a long train journey. He considered A. N. Krishna Rao as his [[guru]]. In Beechi's own words:

:"I started reading ''Sandhyaraga'' by placing the book inside the folds of the Illustrated Weekly paper. I remember only that I started to read. I don't know how many times my eyes went moist and how many times my heart skipped beats; but I woke up only after completely reading the book."

==Literature==
Beechi's writings were humour-based, and his first novel was ''Dasakoota'', published when he was 32. ''Dasakoota'' is the tale of a man(Umesh) fed up with the subservience of, at the surface, government employees to corruption, but relates to the broad servitude of men to conservatism. The protagonist undergoes many travails in his life, working under corrupt superiors, faced with the prospect of a father remarrying a very young woman who will be his stepmother, eventually even joining [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]'s ("Netaji") Indian National Army (INA) briefly. Scenarios with characters getting enmeshed in trouble inadvertently are created cleverly in the story. For example, after returning from imprisonment due to his participation in the freedom struggle in the ranks of Bose's army, Umesh is sitting at home and drinking coffee. When he finds it bitter, he asks for some sugar. Just then, news arrives announcing that [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] has been assassinated. When rioters break into their house, they see Umesh consuming sugar. Thinking he is celebrating the Mahatma's death, they go on a rampage inside. Refreshing, original and daring, the novel brought Beechi much fame, being a startlingly confident debut, and he went on to more, perhaps greater, works.

His primary character/alter-ego was ''timma'' () (''timma'' being a name colloquially used in [[Kannada]] to denote a man who is considered SIMPLETON). Beechi released a lot of books with ''timma'' in the title. Churning out novels at a prolific rate, he wrote around 60 books in his lifetime.

His autobiography, entitled ''Nanna bhayagraphy'' (ನನ್ನ ಭಯಾಗ್ರಫ಼ಿ – the title is a pun on the words biography and the Kannada word Bhaya, meaning scary), met with some controversy upon its release. References within the book to Omar Khayyam's 'Rubaiyyat' and how the great Kannada poet G. P. Rajaratnam seemed to have been inspired by it greatly sparked much anger in Rajaratnam and his admirers(Rajaratnam is said to have written his 'Nirbhayagraphy' (ನಿರ್ಭಯಾಗ್ರಫ಼ಿ) in protest). ''Nanna bhayagraphy'' is perhaps Beechi's most philosophical work. Detailing his life in necessary, but not excruciating, detail, it amuses, provokes, depresses and ultimately enlightens the reader(the ideal autobiography, in many ways). Despite the painful losses he suffered early on in his life and the unpleasant experiences he subsequently underwent—his father dying as soon as he was born(this is described in a heartbreakingly light manner in the very first chapter), the lack of money to pay his school fees and the indifference of his relatives when he asked for their help("Who's going to cry if you don't study? I don't have spare money to pay your school fees. Go away now."), the petty casteist bickerings in his village(it was divided into small localities, or ''keri''s – pronounced cay-ri and not kerry—based on caste. Members of one ''keri'' never crossed over into another unless it was inevitable.), his practically lifelong struggle with alcoholism and the troubles and patience of his family when dealing with this, the loss of his son and the trauma of having to light his own son's pyre—Beechi is never bitter about his lot. The tone is one of endurance, forgiveness and understanding. And the humour in the book is never forced, never awkward or inappropriate. (Beechi is never inhibited, though. In an early chapter, he describes how all the teenage boys of his village would go up to a nearby hill and indulge in masturbation. In another, he narrates how an elderly widow of the village tries to get her widowed daughter to seduce a young Beechi and how he escaped that situation. Both incidents are peppered with humour and make for delightful reading; not in the least bit vulgar.) It comes from a man who has seen it all and understood what life should be about. The last paragraph of the book, perhaps one of the most memorable pieces of writing in Kannada, expresses his philosophy of life.

In addition, the reverse effect is argued, where it is proposed that language comprehension influences movement and sensation. Proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action conduct and interpret [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Cognitive science|cognitive]], and [[Kinesiology|movement]] studies within the framework of [[embodied cognition]] and [[embodied language processing]]. '''Embodied language''' developed from embodied cognition, and proposes that sensorimotor systems are not only involved in the comprehension of language, but that they are necessary for understanding the [[Semantics|semantic]] meaning of words.

Action-oriented models of cognition propose that cognitive processes stem from action (bottom, red), thereby necessitating sensorimotor systems for higher cognitive processes like language comprehension. Adapted from Kilner et al. (2016).]]
The theory that sensory and motor processes are coupled to cognitive processes stems from action-oriented models of cognition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://bernhard-hommel.eu/SFR18_10%20Kilner%20et%20al.pdf|title=The Pragmatic Turn: Toward Action-Oriented Views in Cognitive Science|last=Kilner|first=J.|last2=Hommel|first2=B.|last3=Bar|first3=M.|last4=Barsalou|first4=L.W.|last5=Friston|first5=K.J.|last6=Jost|first6=J.|last7=Maye|first7=A.|last8=Metzinger|first8=T.|last9=Pulvermuller|first9=F. et al.,|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=|volume=18|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=159–173|chapter=Action-oriented models of cognitive processing: A little less cogitation, a little more action please}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories, such as the [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] and [[Situated cognition|situated]] cognitive theories, propose that cognitive processes are rooted in areas of the brain involved in [[Motor cortex|movement planning and execution]], as well as areas responsible for [[Primary sensory areas|processing]] [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] input, termed sensorimotor areas or areas of action and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barsalou|first=L.W.|year=2008|title=Grounded Cognition|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=59|pages=617–645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to action-oriented models, higher cognitive processes evolved from sensorimotor brain regions, thereby necessitating sensorimotor areas for cognition and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; With this organization, it was then hypothesized that action and cognitive processes exert influence on one another in a bi-directional manner: action and perception influence language comprehension, and language comprehension influences sensorimotor processes.

Although studied in a unidirectional manner for many years, the bi-directional hypothesis was first described and tested in detail by Aravena et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors utilized the [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]], a task commonly used to study the relationship between action and language, to test the effects of performing simultaneous language comprehension and motor tasks on neural and behavioral signatures of movement and language comprehension.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These authors proposed that these two tasks cooperate bi-directionally when compatible, and interfere bi-directionally when incompatible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when the movement implied by the action language stimuli is compatible with the movement being performed by the subject, it was hypothesized that performance of both tasks would be enhanced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neural evidence of the bi-directional hypothesis was demonstrated by this study,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the development of this hypothesis is ongoing.

== Effects of Language Comprehension on Systems of Action ==
Language comprehension tasks can exert influence over systems of action, both at the neural and behavioral level. This means that language stimuli influence both electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain, as well as actual movement.

=== Neural activation ===
Language stimuli influence electrical activity in sensorimotor areas of the brain that are specific to the bodily-association of the words presented. This is referred to as [[Semantics|semantic]] [[Somatotopic arrangement|somatotopy]], which indicates activation of sensorimotor areas that are specific to the bodily association implied by the word. For example, when processing the meaning of the word “kick,” the regions in the motor and somatosensory cortices that represent the legs will become more active.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hauk|first=O.|last2=Johnsrude|first2=I.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2004|title=Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex|url=|journal=Neuron|volume=41|pages=301–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boulenger|first=V.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2009|title=Grasping ideas with the motor system: Semantic somatotopy in idiom comprehension|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=19|pages=1905–1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulenger et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; demonstrated this effect by presenting subjects with action-related language while measuring neural activity using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]]. Subjects were presented with action sentences that were either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the object”) or with the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the object”). The medial region of the [[motor cortex]], known to represent the legs, was more active when subjects were processing leg-related sentences, whereas the lateral region of the motor cortex, known to represent the arms, was more active with arm-related sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This body-part-specific increase in activation was exhibited about 3 seconds after presentation of the word, a time window that is thought to indicate [[semantic processing]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, C., Binder, J.R., Medler, D.A., Liebenthal, E. (2007). "Time-course of semantic processes during sentence comprehension: an fMRI study." ''Neuroimage''. '''36''': 924-932.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this activation was associated with subjects comprehending the meaning of the word. This effect held true, and was even intensified, when subjects were presented with [[idiom]]atic sentences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Abstract language that implied more figurative actions were used, either associated with the legs (e.g. “John kicked the habit”) or the arms (e.g. “Jane grasped the idea”).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increased neural activation of leg motor regions were demonstrated with leg-related idiomatic sentences, whereas arm-related idiomatic sentences were associated with increased activation of arm motor regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This activation was larger than that demonstrated by more literal sentences (e.g. “John kicked the object”), and was also present in the time window associated with semantic processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Action language not only activates body-part-specific areas of the motor cortex, but also influences neural activity associated with movement. This has been demonstrated during an [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] task, a common test used to study the relationship between language comprehension and motor behavior.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenberg|first=A. M.|last2=Kaschak|first2=M.P.|date=2002|title=Grounding language in action|url=|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=9|pages=558–565}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task requires the subject to perform movements to indicate understanding of a sentence, such as moving to press a button or pressing a button with a specific hand posture, that are either compatible or incompatible with movement implied by the sentence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, pressing a button with an open hand to indicate understanding of the sentence "Jane high-fived Jack" would be considered a compatible movement, as the sentence implies an open-handed posture. Motor potentials (MP) are an [[Event-related potential|Event Related Potentials]] (ERPs) stemming from the motor cortex, and are associated with execution of movement.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Enhanced amplitudes of MPs have been associated with precision and quickness of movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatta|first=A.|last2=Nishihira|first2=Y.|last3=Higashiura|first3=T.|last4=Kim|first4=S.R.|last5=Kaneda|first5=T.|date=2009|title=Long-term motor practice induces practice-dependent modulation of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) preceding self-paced non-dominant handgrip movement in kendo players|url=|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=459|pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobounov|first=S.|last2=Johnston|first2=J.|last3=Chiang|first3=H.|last4=Ray|first4=W.J.|date=2002|title=Motor-related cortical potentials accompanying enslaving effect in single versus combination of fingers force production tasks|url=|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=113|pages=1444–1453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-afferent potentials (RAPs) are another form of ERP, and are used as a marker of sensory feedback&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deecke|first=L.|date=1987|title=Bereitschaftspotential as an indicator of movement preparation in supplementary motor area and motor cortex|url=|journal=Ciba Foundation Symposium|volume=132|pages=231–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=A.L.|last2=Staines|first2=W.R.|date=2006|title=Cortical adaptions and motor performance improvement associated with short-term bimanual training|url=|journal=Brain Research|volume=1071|pages=165–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MP and RAP have been demonstrated to be enhanced during compatible ACE conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These results indicate that language can have a facilitory effect on the excitability of neural sensorimotor systems. This has been referred to as [[Priming (psychology)#Semantic|semantic]] [[Priming (psychology)|priming]],&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grisoni|first=L.|last2=Dreyer|first2=F.R.|last3=Pulvermüller|first3=F.|date=2016|title=Somatotopic Semantic Priming and Prediction in the Motor System|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=26|pages=2353–2366}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that language primes neural sensorimotor systems, altering excitability and movement.

=== Movement ===
The ability of language to influence neural activity of motor systems also manifests itself behaviorally by altering movement. Semantic priming has been implicated in these behavioral changes, and has been used as evidence for the involvement of the motor system in language comprehension. The [[Embodied language processing#Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect .28ACE.29|Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)]] is indicative of these semantic priming effects. Understanding language that implies action may invoke motor facilitation, or prime the motor system, when the action or posture being performed to indicate language comprehension is compatible with action or posture implied by the language. Compatible ACE tasks have been shown to lead to shorter reaction times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwaan|first=R.A.|last2=Taylor|first2=L.J.|date=2006|title=Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=135|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been demonstrated on various types of movements, including hand posture during button pressing,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; reaching,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and manual rotation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Language stimuli can also prime the motor system simply by describing objects that are commonly manipulated. In a study performed by Masson et al., subjects were presented with sentences that implied non-physical, abstract action with an object (e.g. "John thought about the calculator" or "Jane remembered the thumbtack").&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After presentation of language stimuli, subjects were cued to perform either functional gestures, gestures typically made when using the object described in the sentence (e.g. poking for calculator sentences), or a volumetric gesture, gestures that are more indicative of whole hand posture (e.g. horizontal grasp for calculator sentences).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Target gestures were either compatible or incompatible with the described object, and were cued at two different time points, early and late. Response latencies for performing compatible functional gestures significantly decreased at both time points, whereas latencies were significantly lower for compatible volumetric gestures in the late cue condition.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masson|first=M.E.|last2=Bub|first2=D.N.|last3=Newton-Taylor|first3=M.|date=2008|title=Language-based access to gestural components of conceptual knowledge|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=61|pages=869–882}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results indicate that descriptions of abstract interactions with objects automatically (early time point) generate motor representations of functional gestures, priming the motor system and increasing response speed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The specificity of enhanced motor responses to the gesture-object interaction also highlights the importance of the motor system in semantic processing, as this enhanced motor response was dependent on the meaning of the word.  
[[File:Olmstead et al. figure.png|left|thumb|Change in relative phase shift (RPS), indicating movement coordination, as a function of language stimuli. Subjects exhibited a significant change in RPS only when presented with performable sentences. Adapted from Olmstead et al. (2009).]]
A study performed by Dr. Olmstead et al.,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olmstead|first=A.J.|last2=Viswanathan|first2=N.|last3=Aicher|first3=K.A.|last4=Fowler|first4=C.A.|date=2009|title=Sentence comprehension affects the dynamics of bimanual coordination: Implications for embodied cognition|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=62|pages=2409–2417}}&lt;/ref&gt; described in detail [[Embodied cognition#Language comprehension|elsewhere]], demonstrates more concretely the influence that the semantics of action language can have on movement coordination. Briefly, this study investigated the effects of action language on the coordination of rhythmic bimanual hand movements. Subjects were instructed to move two [[pendulum]]s, one with each hand, either in-[[Phase (waves)|phase]] (pendulums are at the same point in their cycle, [[phase difference]] of roughly 0 degrees) or anti-phase (pendulums are at the opposite point in their cycle, phase difference of roughly 180 degrees).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Robust behavioral studies have revealed that these two phase states, with phase differences 180 and 0 degrees, are the two stable relative phase states, or the two coordination patterns that produce stable movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information, natural law, and the self-assembly of rhythmic movement|last=Kugler|first=P.|last2=Turvey|first2=M.|publisher=Routledge|year=1987|isbn=|location=Hillside, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pendulum swinging task was performed as subjects judged sentences for their plausibility; subjects were asked to indicate whether or not each presented sentence made logical sense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plausible sentences described actions that could be performed by a human using the arms, hands, and/or fingers ("He is swinging the bat"), or actions that could not be performed ("The barn is housing the goat").&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Implausible sentences also used similar action verbs ("He is swinging the hope"). Plausible, performable sentences lead to a significant change in the relative phase shift of the bimanual pendulum task.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The coordination of the movement was altered by action language stimuli, as the relative phase shift that produced stable movement was significantly different than in the non-performable sentence and no language stimuli conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This development of new stable states has been used to imply a reorganization of the motor system utilized to plan and execute this movement,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and supports the bi-directional hypothesis by demonstrating an effect of action language on movement.

== Effects of Systems of Action on Language Comprehension ==
The bi-directional hypothesis of action and language proposes that altering the activity of motor systems, either through altered neural activity or actual movement, influences language comprehension. Neural activity in specific areas of the brain can be altered using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), or by studying patients with [[Neuropathology|neuropathologies]] leading to specific sensory and/or motor deficits. Movement is also used to alter the activity of neural motor systems, increasing overall excitability of motor and pre-motor areas.

=== Neural activation ===
Altered neural activity of motor systems has been demonstrated to influence language comprehension. One such study that demonstrates this effect was performed by Dr. Pulvermüller et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Hauk|first2=O.|last3=Nikulin|first3=V.|last4=Ilmoneimi|first4=R.J.|date=2005|title=Functional links between motor and language systems|url=|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=21|pages=793–797}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMS was used to increase the excitability of either the leg region or the arm region of the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Authors stimulated the left motor cortex, known to be more closely involved in language processing in right-handed individuals, the right motor cortex, as well as a sham stimulation where stimulation was prevented by a plastic block placed between the coil and the skull.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During the stimulation protocols, subjects were shown 50 arm, 50 leg, 50 distractor (no bodily relation), and 100 pseudo- (not real) words.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subjects were asked to indicate recognition of a meaningful word by moving their lips, and response times were measured.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the left leg region of the motor cortex significantly reduced response times for recognition of leg words as compared to arm words, whereas the reverse was true for stimulation of the arm region.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Stimulation site on the right motor cortex, as well as sham stimulation, did not exhibit these effects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, somatotopically-specific stimulation of the left motor cortex facilitated word comprehension in a body-part-specific manner, where stimulation of the leg and arm regions lead to enhanced comprehension of leg and arm words, respectively.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This study has been used as evidence for the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action, as it showcases that manipulating motor cortex activity alters language comprehension in a semantically-specific manner.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A similar experiment has been performed on the articulatory motor cortex, or the mouth and lip regions of the motor cortex used in the production of words.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schomers|first=M.R.|last2=Kirilina|first2=E.|last3=Weigand|first3=A.|last4=Bajbouj|first4=M.|last5=Pulvermüller|first5=F.|date=2014|title=Causal influence of articulatory motor cortex on comprehending single spoken words: TMS evidence|url=|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=25|pages=3894–3902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two categories of words were used as language stimuli: words that involved the lips for production (e.g. "pool") or the tongue (e.g. "tool).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Subjects listened to the words, were shown pairs of pictures, and were asked to indicate which picture matched the word they heard with a button press.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; TMS was used prior to presentation of the language stimuli to selectively facilitate either the lip or tongue regions of the left motor cortex; these two TMS conditions were compared to a control condition where TMS was not applied.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was found that stimulation of the lip region of the motor cortex lead to a significantly decreased response time for lip words as compared to tongue words.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, during recognition of tongue words, reduced reaction times were seen with tongue TMS as compared to lip TMS and no TMS.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this same effect was not seen with lip words, authors attribute this to the complexity of tongue as opposed to lip movements, and the increase difficulty of tongue words as opposed to lip.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Overall, this study demonstrates that the activity in the articulatory motor cortex influences the comprehension of single spoken words, and highlights the importance of the motor cortex in speech comprehension&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Lesions of sensory and motor areas have also been studied to elucidate the effects of sensorimotor systems on language comprehension. One such example of this is the patient JR; this patient has a lesion in areas in the auditory association [[Auditory cortex|cortex]] implicated in processing [[Auditory system|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trumpp|first=N.M.|last2=Kliese|first2=D.|last3=Hoenig|first3=K.|last4=Haarmeier|first4=T.|last5=Kiefer|first5=M.|date=2013|title=Losing the sound of concepts: Damage to auditory association cortex impairs the processing of sound-related concepts|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=474–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; This patient showcases significant impairments in conceptual and perceptual processing of sound-related language and objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, processing the meaning of words describing sound-related objects (e.g., "bell') was significantly impaired in JR as compared to non-sound-related objects (e.g., "armchair").&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These data suggest that damage of sensory regions involved in processing auditory information specifically impair processing of sound-related conceptual information,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; highlighting the necessity of sensory systems for language comprehension.

=== Movement ===
Movement has been shown to influence language comprehension. This has been demonstrated by priming motor areas with movement, increasing the excitability of motor and pre-motor areas associated with the body part being moved.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mollo|first=G.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|last3=Hauk|first3=O.|date=2016|title=Movement priming of EEG/MEG brain responses for action-words characterizes the link between language and action|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=74|pages=262–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that motor engagement of a specific body part decreases neural activity in language processing areas when processing words related to that body part.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This decreased neural activity is a feature of semantic priming, and suggests that activation of specific motor areas through movement can facilitate language comprehension in a semantically-dependent manner.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; An interference effect has also been demonstrated. During incompatible ACE conditions, neural signatures of language comprehension have been shown to be inhibited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Combined, these pieces of evidence have been used to support a semantic role of the motor system.

Movement can also inhibit language comprehension tasks, particularly tasks of verbal working memory.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shebani|first=Z.|last2=Pulvermüller|first2=F.|date=2013|title=Moving the hands and feet specifically impairs working memory for arm-and leg-related action words|url=|journal=Cortex|volume=49|pages=222–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to memorize and verbally recall four-word sequences of either arm or leg action words, performing complex, rhythmic movements after presentation of the word sequences was demonstrated to interfere with memory performance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This performance deficit was body-part specific, where movement of the legs impaired performance of recall of leg words, and movement of the arms impaired recall of arm words.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These data indicate that sensorimotor systems exhibit cortically specific "inhibitory casual effects" on memory of action words,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; as impairment was specific to motor engagement and bodily association of the words.

== Organization of Neural Substrates ==
Relating cognitive functions to brain structures is done in the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. This field attempts to map cognitive processes, such as language comprehension, onto neural activation of specific brain structures.The bi-directional hypothesis of language and action requires that action and language processes have overlapping brain structures, or shared [[neural substrate]]s, thereby necessitating motor areas for language comprehension. The neural substrates of embodied cognition are often studied using the cognitive tasks of [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object recognition]], [[Activity recognition|action recognition]], [[Working memory|working memory tasks]], and [[Sentence processing|language comprehension]] tasks. These networks have been elucidated with behavioral, computational, and imaging studies, but the discovery of their exact organization is ongoing.

It has been proposed that the control of movement is organized hierarchically, where movement is not controlled by individually controlling single neurons, but that movements are represented at a gross, more functional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawato|first=M.|last2=Furukawa|first2=K.|last3=Suzuki|first3=R.|date=1987|title=A hierarchical neural-network model for control and learning of voluntary movement|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=57|pages=169–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept has been applied to the control of cognition, resulting in the theory of cognitive circuits.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulvermüller|first=F.|last2=Garagnani|first2=M.|last3=Wennekers|first3=T.|date=2014|title=Thinking in circuits: toward neurobiological explanation in cognitive neuroscience|url=|journal=Biological cybernetics|volume=108|pages=573–593}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory proposes that there are functional units of neurons in the brain that are strongly connected, and act coherently as a functional unit during cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These functional units of neurons, or "thought circuits," have been referred to as the "building blocks of cognition".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thought circuits are believed to have been originally formed from basic anatomical connections, that were strengthened with correlated activity through [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]] and plasticity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Formation of these neural networks has been demonstrated with computational models using known anatomical connections and Hebbian learning principles.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pulvermüller, F., &amp; Garagnani, M. (2014). From sensorimotor learning to memory cells in prefrontal and temporal association cortex: a neurocomputational study of disembodiment. ''Cortex,'' '''57:''' 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sensory stimulation through interaction with an object activates a distributed network of neurons in the cortex. Repeated activation of these neurons, through Hebbian plasticity, may strengthen their connections and form a circuit.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doursat, R., &amp; Bienenstock, E. "Neocortical self-structuration as a basis for learning." ''5th International conference on development and learning (ICDL 2006)''. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory circuit may then be activated during the perception of known objects.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

This same concept has been applied to action and language, as understanding of the meaning of action words requires an understanding of the action itself. During language and motor skill development, one likely learns to associate an action word with an action or a sensation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This action or sensation, and the correlated sensorimotor areas involved, are then incorporated into the neural representation of that concept.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This leads to semantic topography, or the activation of motor areas related to the meaning and bodily-association of action language.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These networks may be organized into "kernels," areas highly activated by language comprehension tasks, and "halos," brain areas in the periphery of networks that experience slightly increased activation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; It has been hypothesized that language comprehension is housed in the left-perisylvian neuronal circuit, forming the "kernel," and sensorimotor regions are peripherally activated during semantic processing of action language, forming the "halo".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Evidence for shared neural networks ===
Many studies that have demonstrated a role of the motor system in semantic processing of action language have been used as evidence for a shared neural network between action and language comprehension processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, facilitated activity in language comprehension areas, evidence of semantic priming, with movement of a body part that is associated with the action word has also been used as evidence for this shared neural network.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A more specific method for identifying whether certain areas of the brain are necessary for a cognitive task is to demonstrate impaired performance of said task following a functional change to the brain area of interest.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Shallice, T. ''From neuropsychology to mental structure''. Cambridge University Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  A functional change may involve a lesion, or altered excitability through stimulation, or utilization of the area for another task.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to this theory, there is only a finite amount of neural real-estate available for each task. If two tasks share a neural network, there will be competition for the associated neural substrates, and the performance of each task will be inhibited when performed simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Using this theory, proponents of the bi-directional hypothesis have postulated that performance of verbal working memory of action words would be impaired by movement of the concordant body part.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This has been demonstrated with the selective impairment of memorization of arm and leg words when coupled with arm and leg movements, respectively.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This implies that the neural network for verbal working memory is specifically tied to the motor systems associated with the body part implied with the word.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This semantic topography has been suggested to provide evidence that action language shares a neural network with sensorimotor systems, thereby supporting the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action.

'''Christiaan Maurits van den Heever''', almost universally known '''C.M. van den Heever''' (27 February 1902 in the [[concentration camp]] near [[Norvalspont]] in [[Cape Province]], now [[Northern Cape Province]], [[South Africa]] – 8 July 1957), was an [[Afrikaans]]-language novelist, poet, essayist, and biographer.

Counted among the [[Dertigers]], van den Heever is noted for his most famous novels: ''Somer'' ("Summer") and ''Laat vrugte'' ("Late Fruits").  The latter won the [[Hertzog Prize]] for prose in 1942.

Van den Heever studied at the [[University of the Free State]] in [[Bloemfontein]] and the [[University of Utrecht]] in [[the Netherlands]].  Upon his return to South Africa, he gained a teaching position at the University of the Free State.  After completing his dissertation on the poet [[Totius (poet)|Totius]], he finished his academic career at [[Witwatersrand University]].

{{wiktionarypar|niggardly|niggard}}
In the United States, there have been several '''controversies concerning the word "niggardly"''', an adjective meaning "stingy" or "miserly", because of its [[phonetics|phonetic]] similarity to the [[racial slur]] "[[nigger]]". [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the two words are unrelated.

==Etymology==
"[[wikt:niggardly|Niggardly]]" (noun: "niggard") is an adjective meaning "stingy" or "miserly". It can be traced back at least to the [[Middle English]] word ''{{lang|enm|nigon}}'', which has the same meaning, and is related to the [[Old Norse]] verb ''{{lang|non|nigla}}'', which means "to fuss about small matters".&lt;ref name="Garner2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bryan A. Garner |title=Garner on Language and Writing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_PdSrVNTUUC |accessdate=21 March 2013|date=31 March 2009 |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |isbn=978-1-61632-679-1 |pages=236–238 |chapter=Words, Words, Words—and Race }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Nigger]]", a racial epithet in English, derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''{{lang|es|negro}}'', meaning "[[black]]", and the [[French language|French]] word ''{{lang|fr|nègre}}''. Both ''{{lang|es|negro}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|noir}}'' (and therefore also ''{{lang|fr|nègre}}'' and ''nigger'') ultimately come from ''{{lang|la|nigrum}}'', the [[accusative case]] singular masculine and neuter &lt;!-- Nouns in Western Romance languages typically come from the accusative case, rather than the nominative case that we quote in English. --&gt; form of the [[Latin]] masculine adjective ''{{lang|la|niger}}'', meaning "black" or "[[dark]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nigger?s=t |title=''Nigger'' Usage Note |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=17 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared in 1574, and first took on a derogatory meaning in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Christopher|title=Bestial Traces: Race, Sexuality, Animality|date=2013|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=0823245209|page=91|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=_Z54563cYpoC&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patricia T. O'Conner, Stewart Kellerman|title=Origins of the Specious: Myths and Misconceptions of the English Language|date=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=0812978102|page=134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hsu47CBwJPUC&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Howard incident==
On January 15, 1999, David Howard, an aide to [[Anthony A. Williams]], the mayor of [[Washington, D.C.]], used "niggardly" in reference to a budget.&lt;ref name="Dowd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|title=Liberties; Niggardly City|work=The New York Times|page=17|date=31 January 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/opinion/liberties-niggardly-city.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This apparently upset one of his black colleagues (Howard is [[White people|white]]), identified by Howard as Marshall Brown, who misinterpreted it as a racial slur and lodged a complaint. As a result, on January 25, Howard tendered his resignation, and Williams accepted it.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/williams/williams020499.htm|title=D.C. Mayor Acted 'Hastily,' Will Rehire Aide|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|accessdate=2009-10-25|date=February 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after public pressure, an internal review into the matter was brought about, and the mayor offered Howard the chance to return to his position as Office of the Public Advocate on February 4. Howard refused but accepted another position with the mayor instead, insisting that he did not feel victimized by the incident. On the contrary, Howard felt that he had learned from the situation. "I used to think it would be great if we could all be colorblind; that's naïve, especially for a white person, because a white person can't afford to be colorblind. They don't have to think about race every day. An African American does."&lt;ref name="washpost"/&gt;

It had been speculated that this incident inspired [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Human Stain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/969/ |title=Sight &amp; Sound – The Human Stain (2003) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401003346/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/969 |archivedate=2009-04-01 |first=Xan |last=Brooks |publisher=British Film Institute |date=March 2004 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Roth has stated that his source was an incident in the career of [[Melvin Tumin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-open-letter-to-wikipedia |title=An Open Letter to Wikipedia |first=Philip |last=Roth |authorlink=Philip Roth |date=March 22, 2016 |publisher=''The New Yorker''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public response===
The Howard incident led to a national debate in the U.S., in the context of racial sensitivity and [[political correctness]], on whether use of ''niggardly'' should be avoided. As [[James Poniewozik]] wrote in ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', the controversy was "an issue that opinion-makers right, left and center could universally agree on." He wrote that "the defenders of the dictionary" were "legion, and still queued up six abreast".&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/02/02/poni_8/|title=The little N-word|publisher=''[[Salon.com]]''|accessdate=March 20, 2014|last=Poniewozik|first=James|date=February 2, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Bond]], then chairman of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], deplored the offense that had been taken at Howard's use of the word. "You hate to think you have to censor your language to meet other people's lack of understanding", he said. "David Howard should not have quit. Mayor Williams should bring him back—and order dictionaries issued to all staff who need them."&lt;ref&gt;Demarco, Donald, "Acting Niggardly", article reprinted at the ''Catholic Education Resource Center'' Web site, which states the article originally appeared in ''Social Justice Review'' 91, no. 3–4 (March–April, 2000): 45–48; the article cites ''The Washington Post'', January 29, 1999, page A24, Web page accessed March 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Bond also said, "Seems to me the mayor has been niggardly in his judgment on the issue" and that as a nation the US has a "hair-trigger sensibility" on race that can be tripped by both real and false grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GXcfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ky8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6910,3749147&amp;dq=hair-trigger-sensibility&amp;hl=en|title=NAACP official calls word flap overreaction|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|publisher=Associated Press|date=January 29, 1999|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Wisconsin–Madison incident==
Shortly after the Washington incident, another controversy erupted over the use of the word at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. At a February 1999 meeting of the Faculty Senate, Amelia Rideau, a junior English major and vice chairwoman of the Black Student Union told the group how a professor teaching [[Chaucer]] had used the word ''niggardly''. She later said she was unaware of the related Washington, D.C., controversy that came to light just the week before. She said the professor continued to use the word even after she told him that she was offended. "I was in tears, shaking," she told the faculty. "It's not up to the rest of the class to decide whether my feelings are valid."&lt;ref name=kors&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/1999/07/01/cracking-the-speech-code|title=Cracking the speech code|publisher=''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''|accessdate=2009-10-25|author=[[Alan Charles Kors]]|date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student's plea, offered as evidence in support of the school's [[speech code]], instead struck an unintended chord helping to destroy it. "Many 'abolitionists', as they now were called, believe that [the student's] speech, widely reported, was the turning point," according to an article in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine. An editorial in the ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' addressed the student who complained, saying: "Thank you [...] for clarifying precisely why the UW–Madison does not need an academic speech code. [...] Speech codes have a [[chilling effect]] on [[academic freedom]] and they reinforce defensiveness among students who ought to be more open to learning."&lt;ref name=kors/&gt;

==Wilmington, North Carolina incident==
In late January or early February 2002, a white fourth-grade teacher in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], was formally reprimanded for teaching the word and told to attend sensitivity training.&lt;ref name=adv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Site=WM&amp;Date=20020904&amp;Category=NEWS&amp;ArtNo=209040302&amp;Ref=AR&amp;Profile=1004&amp;template=printart|title=Teacher reprimanded for word choice|publisher=''[[Wilmington Star-News]]''|accessdate=2009-10-25|date=September 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher, Stephanie Bell, said she used "niggardly" during a discussion about literary characters. Parent Akwana Walker, who is black, protested the use of the word, saying it offended her.&lt;ref name=adv/&gt;

Bell's teacher's association, the [[North Carolina Association of Educators]], told her not to speak about the situation, so her son, Tarl Bell, spoke to the newspaper. Tarl Bell said his mother received a letter from the school principal stating that the teacher used poor judgment and instructing her to send an apology to the parents of her students, which was done. The principal's letter also criticized the teacher for lacking sensitivity.&lt;ref name=adv/&gt; The daughter of the complaining parent was moved to another classroom.

Norm Shearin, the deputy superintendent of schools for the district, said the teacher made a bad decision by teaching the word because it was inappropriate for that grade level.&lt;ref name=adv/&gt;

==Mendocino County, California incident==
In early 2009,&lt;ref name="Ukiah Daily Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/ZZ/20100707/NEWS/100707418|website=www.ukiahdailyjournal.com|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Boaz, a history teacher, sued the administrators of the [[Mendocino County]] Office of Education for [[defamation]]. Boaz, who was bargaining for Ukiah schoolteachers, wrote a letter saying that the "tenor of the negotiation tactics of the district office has become increasingly negative and niggardly." The response was a memo from one defendant of the lawsuit that implied that Boaz was racist, and a letter cosigned by the other defendant and nine other individuals in the Mendocino County school system stating that Boaz's comments were "racially charged and show a complete lack of respect and integrity toward Dr. Nash, Ukiah Unified District Superintendent," who is a black woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/ci_13557869|title=Uproar over word choice results in lawsuit by Ukiah teacher|publisher=''Ukiah Daily Journal''|accessdate=2009-10-25|date=October 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other complaints==
===Letter to ''The Economist'' magazine, 1995===
In 1995, London-based magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' used the word "niggardly" in an article about the impact of computers and productivity: "During the 1980s, when service industries consumed about 85% of the $1 trillion invested in I.T. in the United States, productivity growth averaged a niggardly 0.8% a year." ''The Economist'' later pointed out with amusement that it received a letter from a reader in Boston who thought the word "niggardly" was inappropriate. "Why do we get such letters only from America?" the British magazine commented.&lt;ref name=jd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire091702.asp|title=Niggling doubts|publisher=''[[National Review Online]]''|accessdate=2009-10-25|last=Derbyshire|first=John|date=September 17, 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502072428/http://old.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire091702.asp|archivedate=May 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dallas Morning News''===
At some point before the Washington, D.C., incident (of early 1999), ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' had banned the use of the word after its use in a restaurant review had raised complaints.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Even before the Washington incident, the ''Dallas Morning News'' had ixnayed the word after its use in a restaurant review raised ire."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acampo, California===
On March 31, 2010, a billboard appeared along the frontage of [[California State Route 99]] in [[Acampo, California]], that referred to [[Barack Obama]], the first black [[President of the United States]], as "niggardly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox40.com/news/headlines/ktxl-news-obamasign0331,0,1047633.story|title='Niggardly Obama' Billboard Generates Outrage In Acampo|first=Matthew|last=Keys|work=fox40.com|date=March 31, 2010|accessdate=July 15, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318151315/http://www.fox40.com/news/headlines/ktxl-news-obamasign0331%2C0%2C1047633.story|archivedate=March 18, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign was placed among several billboards advertising a local coffee shop that was going out of business that week. The restaurant's owner stated that they were unaware of the Obama sign until contacted by a local news station. The sign was removed shortly after news reports about it appeared on local television stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=78454|title=Acampo anti-Obama sign taken down|first=James|last=Scullary|work=news10.net|date=March 31, 2010|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broward County, Florida===
In November 2011, a [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] drug counsellor was fired and another suspended for an incident in which the word "niggardly" was used. A substance-abuse client filed a complaint saying a counsellor called him "niggardly dumb" in a June meeting with two workers at a county rehab center. In an investigative report, the county's professional standards office found the workers, who are both white, engaged in "unprofessional, unethical and discriminatory" behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/columnists/fl-niggardly-mayocol-b110811-20111107,0,488452.column|title=Is using this N-word (niggardly) a firing offense?|first=Michael|last=Mayo|work=sun-sentinel.com|date=November 11, 2011|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicity and racial use==
The public controversies caused some commentators to speculate that "niggardly" would be used more often, both in its correct sense and as fodder for humor, as a racist [[Code word (figure of speech)|code word]], or both.

"The word's new lease of life is probably among manufacturers and retailers of sophomoric humor," wrote [[John Derbyshire]], a conservative commentator, in 2002. "I bet that even as I write, some adolescent boys, in the stairwell of some high school somewhere in America, are accusing each other of being niggardly, and sniggering at their own outrageous wit. I bet ... Wait a minute. 'Sniggering'? Oh, my God. ..."&lt;ref name=jd/&gt; Derbyshire wrote that although he loved to use words that are sometimes considered obscure, he would not use the word among black people, especially among less-educated black people, out of politeness and to avoid causing someone to feel uncomfortable, regardless of any non-racial meanings he would intend.&lt;ref name=jd/&gt;

Shortly after the Washington, D.C., incident, [[James Poniewozik]] wrote in his column at ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' online magazine that some were already using "niggardly" in a way that made their motives ambiguous. He quoted a posting by "chill10d"&lt;!--this spelling is correct--&gt; at a reader forum at the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' website "who just happened to use 'niggardly'—linguistically correctly" in commenting on two witnesses to a Congressional investigation:&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

{{quote|[[Betty Currie|B. Curry]] [sic] got a pc pass because her testimony like that of all Clintonistas was niggardly with the truth. It is predictable that [[Vernon Jordan|V. Jordan]] will have his opportunity to be equally niggardly in this regard. Witnesses? A woman (child), a negro, and a jew—very PC indeed!}}

"You can't say chill10d&lt;!--this spelling is correct--&gt;—white, black or [[Klingon]] for all I know—had racist motives. And you can't exactly not say it," Poniewozik wrote. He expected a number of "pinheads" to be asking "black waitresses not to be 'niggardly' with the coffee".&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; But there would be a different reaction in polite company, especially in racially diverse company, so the word would probably be thought of only when people think of racial epithets. "In theory, you, I and the columnist next door will defend to the death our right to say 'niggardly.' But in practice, will we use it?"&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

'''Court hand''' (or '''common law hand''') was a style of handwriting used in medieval English law [[courts]]. Originally used by the official courts, it later came into use by professionals such as lawyers and clerks. "It is noticeably upright and packed together with exaggeratedly long [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descenders]], the latter often and the former occasionally brought round in sweeping crescent shaped curves".&lt;ref name=plym&gt;Plymouth City Council, "[http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/archivesquillsandcourthand Quills and court-hand writing]."&lt;/ref&gt;

The hand took its name from the fact that it was particularly associated with formal records of the courts of [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]] and [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's (or Queen's) Bench]], although its use was not confined to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L.C. |last=Hector |title=The Handwriting of English Documents |place=London |publisher=Edward Arnold |edition=2nd |year=1966 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries the writing became increasingly stylised, to the point that it was virtually illegible to any reader unfamiliar with its conventions. The hand was banned from English law courts in 1731 by the [[Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730|Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act]] (4 Geo. II, c. 26), which required that, with effect from 25 March 1733, court proceedings "shall be written in such a common legible Hand and Character, as the Acts of Parliament are usually ingrossed in ... and not in any Hand commonly called ''Court Hand'', and in Words at Length and not abbreviated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Barrett |first2=David |last2=Iredale |title=Discovering Old Handwriting |publisher=Shire Publications |place=Princes Risborough |year=1995 |ISBN=0-7478-0268-8 |page=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1731 Act did not apply to Welsh courts, but this omission was rectified shortly afterwards by the [[Courts in Wales and Chester Act 1732]] (6 Geo. II, c.14).&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 19th century, however, an ability to read court hand was considered useful for anyone who had to deal with old court records.&lt;ref&gt;Wright and Martin, ''Court-Hand Restored'', pp. vii-viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural references ==
In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' (written c.1591), Act 4, scene 2, Dick the Butcher says of Emmanuel, Clerk of Chatham, "He can make Obligations, and write court-hand."

In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852–3), Lady Dedlock begins a significant subplot by noticing a particular "law hand" on a legal document.

Court hand is referred to in [[T. H. White]]'s novel ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (1938).

A '''cuddy''' is a small room or cupboard, particularly on a boat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cuddy cuddy] Oxford dictionary. Retrieved 31 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a cuddy refers to a small but cosy hut.&lt;ref name=TeAra /&gt; The origin of the term is not clear. Cuddy was in use in colonial America as early as 1655.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Records of the colony or jurisdiction of New Haven, from May, 1653, to the union. Together with New Haven code of 1656|date=1858|publisher=Printed by Case, Lockwood and Co.|location=Hartford|page=134|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/1545383.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may derive from the Dutch ''kajuit'', meaning a small cabin, or from the French ''cahute'', meaning a hut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Cuddy cubbyhole] Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved 31 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Nautical uses==
The term cuddy is used particularly in nautical contexts. In the 19th century it referred to a saloon cabin at the stern of immigrant ships, where wealthy immigrants could travel in greater comfort than the [[Steerage (deck)|steerage]] passengers below.&lt;ref name =TeAra&gt;John Wilson (2012) [http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/the-voyage-out/page-3 The voyage out - Cabin and steerage], Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Updated 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cuddy boat is a boat with a small shelter cabin with maybe a small [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. It may have a small [[Berth (sleeping)|berth]] also. The cuddy on cuddy boats is usually not tall enough to stand in. Typical lengths of cuddy boats range from {{convert|18|to|28|ft}}. The term "cuddy cabin", is still somewhat used (cuddy itself can mean cabin), and is a common term among small boaters.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary (2013) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=8Dd2llqh5nsC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=Cuddy+cabin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjihtyX09LKAhUIxqYKHabkDW4Q6AEIVjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cuddy%20cabin&amp;f=false ''Boating Skills and Seamanship''], 14th Edition, McGraw-Hill, page 20–21. {{ISBN|9780071829328}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuddy boats are popular as recreational boats with people who want a little shelter and storage space but do not want to upgrade to a full cabin boat. Cuddy cabin fishing boats are also used as near-shore fishing boats.&lt;ref&gt;Spira, Jeff (2007) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=XKJGCTJWqlwC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Cuddy+cabin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjihtyX09LKAhUIxqYKHabkDW4Q6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Cuddy%20cabin&amp;f=false ''Saltwater Angler's Guide to Southern California''] Wilderness Adventures Press, page 402. {{ISBN|9781932098402}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
In  ''Dear Ijeawele'' Adichie attempts to challenge the prejudices of [[gender role]]s and expectations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[wikt:Special:Search/epistolary|epistolary form]] literary device was used to give the reader a personal and intimate impression of the manifesto.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/chimamanda-ngozi-adichies-voice-speaks-above-the-noise-with-her-guide-to-raising-a-feminist|title=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Voice Speaks Above The Noise with her Guide to Raising a Feminist|last=Ahsan|first=Sadaf|date=April 6, 2017|work=National Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using language intended to be seen as clear, direct, and simple,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the manifesto is meant to provide parents with the tools to combat situations of gender inequality when raising daughters.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The manifesto covers issues ranging from domestic duties such as cooking, to gendered baby clothes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The manifesto asserts that central to raising feminist daughters is the embracing of feminist ideals by mothers raising daughters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One piece of advice that Adichie gives is to "Ask for help. Expect to be helped...Domestic work and care-giving should be gender-neutral."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Adichie rejects the idea of the manifesto as "a parenting book."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The manifesto references notable figure [[Hillary Clinton]]'s title of "wife" on her [[Twitter]] account to exemplify claims of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The overarching goal of the manifesto is [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Contents of Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions ==
''Dear Ijeawele'' prefaces with Adichie's "two 'Feminist Tools'", of which the first is:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;your premise, the solid unbending belief that you start off with. What is your premise? Your feminist premise should be: I matter. I matter equally. Not 'if only.' Not 'as long as.' I matter equally. Full stop.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The fifteen suggestions of ''Dear Ijeawele'' begin, respectively, with the following prompts:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

# Be a full person. 
# Do it together.
# Teach her that 'gender roles' is absolute nonsense.
# Beware the danger of what I call Feminism Lite. 
# Teach Chizalum to read.
# Teach her to question language. 
# Never speak of marriage as an achievement.
# Teach her to reject likeability.
# Give Chizalum a sense of identity.
# Be deliberate about how you engage with her and her appearance. 
# Teach her to question our culture's selective use of biology as 'reasons' for social norms.
# Talk to her about sex and start early.
# Romance will happen so be on board.
# In teaching her about oppression, be careful not to turn the oppressed into saints.
# Teach her about difference.

==Reception==
''[[The Guardian]]'' has reviewed the work in its book format, writing that "It would be difficult not to like this little book, which shines with all Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s characteristic warmth and sanity and forthrightness" and that "Some of the suggestions feel like mountains of difficulty made simple: but then that’s what manifestos are for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/04/dear-ijeawele-or-a-feminist-maniesto-in-fifteen-suggestions|title=Dear Ijeawele by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie review – a feminist manifesto|last=Hadley|first=Tessa|date=May 4, 2017|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' wrote favorably about the book, stating that it "sets a standard for feminism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/3/29/feminist-manifesto-review/|title=‘Dear Ijeawele’ Sets a Standard for Feminism|last=Aguilar|first=Marianne T.|date=March 29, 2017|website=The Harvard Crimson|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital master''' is an [[image]], [[PDF]] file, [[digital recording]] or another [[digital asset]] preserved as the "original" for the purpose of archival storage, reuse and re-expression. For [[image]]s, it is the digital analogue to a [[photographic negative]].

As the master from which variations for specific uses can be derived, the digital master may be in the form of its initial capture (like an un[[retouched]] photograph) or in a form that has been somehow enhanced, reformatted or edited (like a manipulated photo or a completed film).

The '''Faculty of Translation and Interpreting '''of Granada (Spanish: ''Facultad de Traducción e Interpretación de Granada''), also known as FTI UGR, is the translation and interpreting school of the [[University of Granada]], considered one of the best academic institutions for [[Translation studies|translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpreting]] studies in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://hosting01.uc3m.es/semanal3/documents/rankingelmundo_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is located at the 18th century Palace of the Counts of Luque (Spanish: ''Palacio de los Condes de Luque''), better known as Palace of the Columns, in the heart of the city of [[Granada]]. Their motto is ''Fidus interpres''.

Being one of the first Spanish institutions to offer studies in the field of Translation and Interpreting, the school has a large teaching experience in the field and offers the widest language range in the country: four languages B (first foreign language: Arabic, English, French and German), nine languages C (second foreign language: Arabic, Chinese, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Russian), plus other four optional languages (Dutch, Polish, Galician and Czech). It was also the first Spanish academic institution to offer Translation and Interpreting studies with Arabic as first foreign language.

Member of the ''Conférence Internationale Permanente d'Instituts Universitaires de Traducteurs et d’interprètes'' (CIUTI), it is a centre of national and international prestige. It hosts several research groups, carries out European R+D projects, elaborates award-winning programmes for fresh approaches to teaching and publishes two magazines (''Sendebar'' and ''Puentes''). FTI also orientates its curriculum to the current demands of the profession, which usually guarantees work opportunities to its graduates.

== Timeline ==

=== From the former Institute of Languages to the ''EUTI'' ===

The roots of the current Faculty of Translation and Interpreting of Granada are in the former Institute of Languages of the University of Granada, which dates back to 1929.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugr.es/~rasensio/docs/Proyecto_docente_1999.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Patio de la Facultad de Traducción e Interpretación de Granada.jpg|thumb|390px]]

The long tradition of the Institute, together with the considerable number of students enrolled in, was reason enough to adapt the former studies to new ones that responded to an increasing demand of professionals within the field of translation and interpreting. Thus, in 1979 the former Institute of Languages of the University of Granada became the School of Translators and Interpreters (Spanish: ''Escuela Universitaria de Traductores e Intérpretes'', EUTI) by decree 2572/1979 of 14 September (BOE 09.11.79). At that time, there was only one centre with similar characteristics: the School of Languages of the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (BOE September 22, 1972), which already offered courses on Translation and Interpreting since 1972, although it was not officially recognised as EUTI until 1984.

The first programme of the EUTI of Granada was of three years' duration, having two separate specialties (Translation and Interpreting), three first foreign languages (German, French and English) and eight-second foreign languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian).

The EUTI of Granada was established as the Spanish public college training the largest number of translators and interpreters with Spanish as native language (or Language A). The origin of its students was 50% from [[Andalusia]] and 50% from the rest of Spain and from 23 foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugr.es/~rasensio/docs/Proyecto_docente_1999.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; That is how the EUTI of Granada began to gain international prestige. Similarly, it is important to highlight the great range of courses and seminars offered by the EUTI from its beginnings, with the collaboration of professionals on the field from all around the world. Granada thus gained a reputation as academic space in the field of Translation and Interpreting.

The EUTI of Granada also pioneered the introduction of [[Terminology]] as an academic discipline, as well as its participation in the programme of Applied European Languages (AEL).&lt;ref&gt;http://grados.ugr.es/traduccion/pages/infoacademica/programaael&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the ''EUTI'' to the current Faculty of Translation and Interpreting ===

In 1992, with the adaptation of the old programme to the new degree in Translation and Interpreting (BOE number 149 of July 23, 1994), now of four years’ duration, the EUTI changed its name and established as the new Faculty of Translators and Interpreters. It was in 1994 when the Faculty took its current name, that is, the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting.

The most relevant event of this new era was the establishment in 1993 of the new Department of Translation and Interpreting of the University of Granada,&lt;ref&gt;http://tradinter.ugr.es/&lt;/ref&gt; which is now responsible for teaching and research. Two new languages C (second foreign languages) were included (Dutch and Modern Greek) and also a new first foreign language: Arabic. Thus, the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting of Granada became the first Spanish college in granting, through the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the qualification of [[Translating for legal equivalence|sworn translator and interpreter]] (Spanish: ''Traductor/Intérprete jurado'') with Arabic as first foreign language (language B).

[[Image:FTIGRANADA.jpg|thumb|270px|Front facade of the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting of the [[University of Granada]].]]

In 2003 the MA in Translation and Interpreting (research focus)&lt;ref&gt;http://masteres.ugr.es/masterentraduccion/&lt;/ref&gt; was opened, which arose from two doctoral programmes of the Department of Translation and Interpreting, quality accredited by the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Ministry of Education]]. 
 
With the adoption of the [[European Higher Education Area|EHEA]], the degrees programmes of the faculty underwent important changes. From 2010 the new undergraduate programme is the BA in Translation and Interpreting, of four years' duration. Moreover, the MA from 2003 has been replaced by two new postgraduate programmes: the MA in Professional Translation and the MA in Conference Interpreting. This reorganisation responses to both an adaptation into a new stage of study (EHEA) and a need to offer a solid specialisation for future graduates.

== Facilities and services ==

The main building of the school is the Palace of the Counts of Luque, better known as Palace of the Columns, of architect unknown (although some attribute it to Juan de Villanueva). It was restored in 1946 by architects Luis Álvarez de Cienfuegos and Juan de Dios de Wilhelmi so it could host the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters (''Facultad de Filosofía y Letras''), later the Institute of Languages (''Instituto de Idiomas'') and, since 1979, the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting.

The name ''Palacio de las Columnas'' was probably inspired by the Doric and Ionic columns that decorate its facade. The building, one of the most notable examples of secular Neoclassical architecture in Granada, has a U-shaped plant surrounding an ample garden, with a main body and two wings that rise over the downhill-sloped streets on either side. It contains the library, a multimedia classroom, computer and language labs, and administrative and faculty offices.

These premises are supplemented by another building in calle Buensuceso, holding mostly offices plus the ''Salón de Grados'', ''Sala de Tutorías'', student union, Servicio de Traducción Universitario (STU), a small company created by the students themselves, the offices of the Sendebar magazine, and a study room.

'''Francis Tregian''' the Younger (1574–1618) was an English [[recusant]].  Once thought to have been the copyist of a handful of important [[music manuscript]]s, his musical activities are the subject of dispute.

== Biography ==
Francis Tregian was the son of [[Francis Tregian the Elder]] and Mary Stourton. He is thought to have been born in 1574.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=1-2}} (The birth year is derived from a household list drawn up in 1594 at the death of his teacher [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]] which referred to Tregian as being 20 years old: "molto nobile, di 20 anni, se colare di ingennio delicessimo dotto in filosofia, in musica et nella lingua latina." Not only is this the only document suggesting his age but it is also the only document associating him with music.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=21-22}}{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=12}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=14}}) In 1577 his father was arrested for being a Roman Catholic and sheltering priests. He was imprisoned and dispossessed, and the Tregian family had to leave their manor house in [[Probus, Cornwall]].

Tregian's mother and her children travelled 200 miles to London.  She hoped that her brother [[John Stourton, 9th Baron Stourton]], could intercede for her husband.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=14}}  She lodged in [[Clerkenwell]] with her mother, who had remarried after her father's death (her father had been executed). She eventually moved to her husband's prison.

The younger Tregian was sent to France sometime between 1582 and 1586.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=16-17}} Despite a statute enacted in 1585 by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] which levied a penalty on religious dissidents who sent their children to school overseas, on 29 September 1586, he entered the [[English College, Douai|English College]] in [[Douai]], a stronghold of Roman Catholicism.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=17}}  As fees had to be paid in advance, Persons surmises that the elder Tregian arranged payment of fees in advance with the College's agent based in London.
At English College he probably undertook the typical course of study required of all beginning students which included Latin and Greek literature and grammar. {{sfn|Persons|1969|p=18}}  Persons notes there was no evidence of Tregian's possible musical training at the English College.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=18}} The younger Tregian apparently did well; he was chosen to give the congratulatory address to the [[Filippo Sega|Bishop of Piacenza]] on the latter's visit in 1591.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=19}}

He obtained a position as chamberlain to [[William Allen (cardinal)|Cardinal William Allen]], and left for Rome on 11 July 1592{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=17}} (It was once thought that Tregian encountered the composer [[Peter Philips]] who was serving William Allen in Rome. But Philips's stay in Rome was from 1582–1585, well before Tregian graduated the English College at Douai.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=22}}) On Allen's death in 1594 Tregian appears to have gone to [[Brussels]]. A document from 1603 acknowledges Tregian as "being with the Archduke" there (the archduke being [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert]]).{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;Persons cites: Public Record Office, London, "State Papers Domestic, James I" III, 77 as quoted by Pearl A. Boyan, ''Francis Tregian'', London: Sheed and Ward, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find a musical association, Persons notes that composer [[Peter Philips]] was the court organist to Archduke Albert from 1597 until after 1610 and that during the time Tregian was also associated with the Archduke, the two might have come into contact.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=22-23}}

The situation of the Tregian family improved somewhat when James I came to the throne. The elder Tregian was released from prison and went into exile. It is known the younger Tregian was still in Brussels in 1606 when his father visited.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=24}} Also in 1606 the younger Tregian returned to England to reclaim his father's estates.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=25}} Existing documents show that he purchased an interest in his family estate, the manor house "Golden" together with surrounding lands, from [[Elizabeth Spencer, Baroness Hunsdon|Elizabeth Spencer]] for £6500 in 1607.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=25}} The earliest record of his being convicted of recusancy is dated 7 July 1607 where the proceeds of his conviction are given to George Bland.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=13}} The elder Tregian died in 1608. By September the Crown had seized two-thirds of the Tregian property as a fine for recusancy.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=13}}

By 1608–09 he was imprisoned [[Fleet Prison]] in London. Documents as to the actual cause of his incarceration are lacking, but Persons, citing Boyan, appears to believe it was because he was unable to repay the large sums of money borrowed to repurchase the family estate.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=25}} That, combined with his recusancy, were sufficient reasons for incarceration.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=26}} In 1614, the people from whom he had borrowed money petitioned the [[House of Lords]] to sell the Tregian lands to repay their loans.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=25}}

Persons, citing Boyan, mentioned a document that reads: "A warrant was issued by the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall to inquire about the division of lands of the late Francis Tregian, Recusant, in May 28, 1619" indicating that he died prior to that date.&lt;ref&gt;Persons 1969 p.27 quoting Boyan, p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, living at Fleet Prison allowed Tregian a modicum of style and he maintained a library of "many hundred books" according to Alexander Harris, the prison warden.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=27}} Probably due to unpaid debts, the library was dispersed and nothing is known about its eventual disposition.{{sfn|Persons|1969|p=27}} After Tregian's death his mother accused him of defrauding her by furtive financial transactions, and another "kynsman," John Arundell, accused him of financial impropriety.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=13}} Thompson concludes that Tregian's imprisonment was probably much more about improper handling of finances than it was about recusancy.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=14}}

== How Tregian's name became associated with music ==

===Historiography===
There are four manuscript collections that have been associated with Tregian:
* The [[Fitzwilliam Virginal Book]] in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], the best-known of the anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;edited in 1899 by Fuller-Maitland and Barclay Squire, who suggested that the manuscript was compiled by the younger Francis Tregian; see Jonathan Wainwright, ''Musical Patronage in Seventeenth-century England: Christopher, first Baron Hatton '', 1997:190.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Egerton 3665]], a manuscript in the [[British Library]]&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript has been published in fascimile: ''The Tregian Manuscript'', with introduction by Frank A. D'Accone ('Renaissance Music in Facsimile', viia), New York &amp; London, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drexel 4302]], The ''Sambrook Book'' in the [[Drexel Collection]], in the [[New York Public Library]].
* Music MSS 510-14A in Christ Church, Oxford

Intrigued by the supposed connection between these four manuscripts, [[Ruby Reid Thompson]], archivist at the [[University of Cambridge]], undertook a thorough examination of all four manuscripts, physically examining every one of their over 2,200 pages, including a detailed look at three of the manuscripts' [[watermark]]s (the custodians of the Fitzwilliam Museum did not permit watermark tracings of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book).{{sfn|Thompson|1992|p=202-03}} In two articles (which are a preparation for her doctoral dissertation), Thompson provided an extensively researched historiography of how Tregian's name became so closely associated with music and why it persists despite lack of evidence and presentation of new information.{{sfn|Thompson|1992|ps=. The thorough examination of all four manuscripts is the subject of Thompson's forthcoming dissertation of which the two articles are summaries of her findings.}}{{sfn|Thompson|2001}}

The origins of the association appear to have begun by [[William Chappell (writer)|William Chappell]].{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=1}} Writing about the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book in 1855, he mentioned the name Tregian based on six ambiguous abbreviations and only one instance of the name actually spelled out (no. 315, the "Pavana chromatica" has a marginal note to "Mrs Katherin Tregians Pauern" [i.e. Pavane].{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=2}} Based on this casual association, Chappell does not mention Tregian being a composer or copyist, merely that he was associated with the manuscript.

[[Musicologist]] [[William Barclay Squire]] elaborated on Chappell's random notes. In 1889 for the article on "Virginal music" written for the first edition of [[George Grove]]'s ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Squire provided biographies of both elder and younger Tregians and introduced the idea that the younger Tregian might have copied the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=3}} In 1893,&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Fuller Maitland and A. H. Mann, editors, ''Catalogue of Music in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge'' (Cambridge, 1893), p. 104-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Squire elaborated upon his 1889 biography of the younger Tregian, adding that he had studied "philosophy, music and Latin."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=3}} Thompson quotes Squire:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it were not for the dates of the younger Tregian's death and of the composition of Dr. Bull's 'Jewel' [1621], it might be conjectured that the MS was transcribed by the younger Tregian while a prisoner in the Fleet. If this is impossible, there can be but little doubt that it was written by some of his associates, possibly by one of his sisters, who were in England with him.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thompson then adds her own astute observation: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Squire had apparently become locked into these lines of reasoning as the only explanation for the origin of the manuscript, and he did not consider any other. He was adamant in assigning the compilation of [the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book] to a member of the Tregian family, in spite of the lack of archival corroboration.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Squire continued to elaborate upon his supposed Tregian connection for the 1899 publication of music from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.  Recognizing that the John Bull piece was not the 1621 work removed the obstacle to hypothesizing that Tregian was the copyist.  In the introduction to the edition, Squire wrote "...it may be conjectured with much plausibility that [the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book] was written by the younger Tregian to while away his time in prison."&lt;ref&gt;''The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book'', ed. W. Barclay Squire &amp; J. A. Fuller Maitland (Leipzig: Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1894–1899), p. v–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The editors added some scepticism, noting that handwriting samples would be needed to verify Tregian's handwriting. Because of the wide distribution of this 1899 edition of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book due to reprints,&lt;ref&gt;such as the inexpensive and easily available Dover edition: ''The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book'', New York: Dover, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Squire's strongest endorsement of Tregian has gained near-acceptance as fact.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}} In the second (1910) and third (1928) editions of  ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', Squire mitigated his view of Tregian's responsibility, retreating from the claim that he had copied the work, but believing that it was still associated with him.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}}

Thompson then examined the seven references mentioned by Chappell, noting that the one unambiguous reference to Mrs. Katherin Tregian could have been either be the younger Tregian's grandmother or aunt.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}} Noting that the reference itself could be a dedication, Thompson noted that a number of works in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book are dedicated to various people, none known to be connected with the Tregian family.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}}  The presence of two instances of the marking "Treg" in titles as well as ambiguous abbreviations—and noting that all these annotations are missing in other manuscript versions of these works—leads Thompson to find a slim basis for Squire's declaration of Tregian being the copyist in 1899, and no surprise that he later retreated from the claim.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=5}}

In 1951, Bertram Schofield and Thurston Dart's article on the then newly purchased manuscript Egerton 3665 declared that manuscript to be in the same hand as the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: "The two hands are identical, even down to minute details of erasure, pagination, correction of mistakes and numbering of the content of the books."{{sfn|Schofield|1951|p=206}} Noting that two of its pieces had composer attributions abbreviated as "F." and F.T.",{{sfn|Schofield|1951}} and then adding Drexel 4302 making a group of four manuscripts, Schofield and Dart paradoxically announced their idea of Tregian as copyist was "more probable than ever"{{sfn|Schofield|1951|p=208}} while admitting there was "no final proof."{{sfn|Schofield|1951|p=206}}

Elizabeth Cole claimed to have found this proof in 1952.{{sfn|Cole|1952}} Thinking that the attempts to buy back the Tregian family home must be documented, Cole found "no less than twenty-eight signatures" in the "Truro Museum" (the [[Royal Cornwall Museum]]). She was particularly taken by two legal documents and showed photographs of them to Schofield who--"perhaps little cautiously" in Thompson's characterisation{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=6}}--"saw no reason to doubt but that Tregian was indeed the scribe of Egerton 3665 and, therefore, the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book."{{sfn|Cole|1952|p=30}} Thompson was able to not only track down the document that had convinced Cole and which she reproduced, but found one that could have been even more convincing.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=9}} Despite Cole's assertion of similarity of hands, Thompson reproduces fragments of writing from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, Egerton 3665 and Christ Church MS. 510–14, and concludes that while the writing shows similarities of style, none of the works can be shown to be in the same hand.  She even notes that Dart was not totally convinced as he later stated that Egerton 3665 was  "almost certainly in [Tregian's] hand."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=9}}

In reviewing the biography of Francis Tregian the elder, Thompson notes that his well-documented biography includes only a single link to a musician, the brother of composer [[William Byrd]] (this information having been supplied by Benjamin Beard, one of the elder Tregian's informers).{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=11}} Beyond this one link, she is unable to find much more evidence of Tregian's musical engagement, certainly not enough to promote him as "English musician" as did the fifth and sixth editions of ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians''.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=15-16}} Even if the sources for the pieces in the manuscript labelled "F." and "F.T." proved to be that of Tregian, Thompson felt that information would not overturn the question of responsibility for all the manuscripts.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=16}} At the end of her review of Schofield's and Dart's and Cole's ideas, she concludes: "It seems likely that Cole and Schofield allowed their judgement to be swayed by their own hopes or expectations."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=9}}

=== Physical evidence ===
Physical examination of the four manuscripts brought Thompson to a new train of thought based on her conclusions.
*Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: Thompson found that the entire manuscript was written on high-quality Swiss paper made by the Düring family of [[Basle]].{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=17}} She concluded that "The manuscript appears to have been planned professionally as a unified project for which enough paper of uniform quality was obtained beforehand."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=16}} 
*The Christ Church manuscript was also made of the same high-quality Düring paper.  Thompson concluded: "The regularity of the partbooks indicates that they were planned as a unit and professionally put together, and that they have been carefully handled or stored since compilation."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=18}}
*Egerton 3665: In this manuscript Thompson finds the same high-quality Düring paper used for 154 folios and 364 folios made by Wendelin Riehl mills in [[Strasbourg]]. She notes that the lack of uniformity in the size of the gatherings is evidence that the manuscript was not planned as a whole from the outset.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=19}} She observes that the gatherings were subject to independent use, and may not have been copied in the order in which they are currently bound.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=21}}
*Drexel 4302: Of its 257 folios, only five are of the high-quality Düring paper, the remainder being the Wendelin Riehl paper.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=21}} Showing varied signs of wear like Egerton 3665, Thompson declared Drexel 4302 to be an aggregate volume (composed of smaller gatherings) which had been used independently and brought together when bound.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=21}}

'''Paper'''. Thompson notes that both paper types are rare in England; no other music manuscripts were identified using these paper types. {{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=22}} for the paper from the Wendelin Riehl mills, Thompson identified a circa 1598 copy of ''The Visitation of Lancashire'' edited by William Smith, Rouge Dragon—a copy directly connected to the royal court.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=23}} Thompson consulted the Basle paper museum, known as the [[Basel Paper Mill]].{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=23}} According to the Mill, the paper used for the score manuscripts was created during the first quarter of the 17th century. Paper similar to the Wendelin Riehl but with a different watermark was used by architect [[Inigo Jones]] for three drawings made between 1619 and 1624, all of them directly related to the royal court.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=23}} A search of over 30 English archives failed to reveal any more of the Düring paper.  With only a few examples of the Wendelin Riehl paper, Thompson concludes that "All the manuscripts containing such papers are found in documents relating to the cultural activities or the official business of the royal courts. Thus a corresponding connection may exist between the four music manuscripts and musical activities of the English court."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=23}}

Thompson then begins a discussion of physical attributes of the graphic style used in the four manuscripts. She warns against superficial examination by noting that similarity of layout can be deceptive and that one must thoroughly analyze various characteristics such as margins, rulings, scripts, corrections, annotations.  In her 2001 article she focused on ruling and music script. She notes how each of the manuscripts have a relative small ruled area ranging from 55.6% (for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book) to 58.8% for Egerton 3665), observing that conservation of paper was not an issue and that these scores must have been intended for presentation.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=24-25}} Based her observations on the principle that similarly ruled paper would have been created at the same time.  She notes this is consistent for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Christ Church MSS 510–14.  It is not true for both Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302, leading her to conclude that these two manuscripts were not planned as single units (which would have had identical ruling) but portions made at different times.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=26}}

'''Ruling'''. Thompson acknowledges the four manuscript share an orderly layout and similar graphic style, creating the appearance of uniformity.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=24}} Yet she warns that each manuscript page is a "complex object built up from different layers of scribal features applied in a given sequence. Each item (e.g. margins, rulings, scripts, corrections, annotations) when detached from the written web, provides evidence about the genesis of the manuscripts, and throws light on the chronology of scribal activity."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=24}} She warns against studying only one of these characteristics and drawing conclusions based on information in isolation. Clearly having done the work as part of her dissertation, she chose to focus on staff ruling and music script.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=24}}

Allowing for reduction of page size due to trimming and binding, Thompson reveals that the average amount of page used in the manuscripts was rather small (55.6% in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, 54% in Christ Church manuscript 510–14, 58.8% in Egerton 3665 and 56.6% in Drexel 4302), indicating that saving paper was clearly not a major consideration, whereas attractive presentation was apparently important.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=24}} She remarks on the "elegant proportions" of Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and the Christ Church manuscripts 510–514 nothing that they were probably intended as fair or presentation copies.

Noting the complexity of analysing staff ruling, Thompson restricts her comments to general ones. She notes that measurements on each page of all four manuscripts indicate that ruling was done in gatherings, rather than on individual pages.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=25}} For the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and the Christ Church manuscripts 510–514, Thompson notes the high degree of consistency in the rulings of both manuscripts "confirms" that they were ruled for a specific project.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=26}} This is unlike Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302 which show considerable variations in ruling not only between gatherings but even within them. This leads to Thompson's conclusion that these latter two manuscripts were not planned as unified works where the staves needed to have similar rulings.  Some of their gatherings were possibly used individually and trimmed at different times which accounts for the variety in the dimensions of the margins.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=26}}

'''Script'''. Thompson notes that many features of the music script can give the impression of uniformity, suggesting that standards of copying the music text were in place before copying began.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=26}} But her close inspection of the four manuscripts show distinct scripts.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=27}} She makes a distinction between "music hand" ("the product of an individual's pen) and "music script" ("the form of notation, apart of who may have written it") and warns that excessive initial focus on the music hand can allow too many subjective decisions for a proper analysis.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=27}} Thompson identifies two features which can reveal music script variations between different hands: the shape of white notes (that is, [[half note]]s) with stems below their noteheads, and the angle and the point of attachment of stems.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=27}}

There is considerable diversity in the way half notes are made in the four manuscripts.  At times they are made by a single unbroken stroke (the notehead followed by the stem) and other times the notehead is drawn first followed by the stem.  The downward stems are usually drawn from the right side of the notehead, but occasionally from the center. Their orientation can be straight, bowed or bent at an angle. One would expect consistency in a single scribe, therefore Thompson notes that a mixture of forms indicates at least two scripts.  With plates showing the widely different scribal forms in the four manuscripts{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=28-29}} Thompson notes that they each have different scribal structures. Mus. 510–514 has a uniform script; the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book has mostly a uniform script that gradually switches to a smaller contrasting script several times.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=26, 30}} Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302 on the other hand show great scribal diversity. Counting sixty changes of scribal hand for Egerton 3665 and thirty for Drexel 4302, she identifies seventeen specific hands, of which nine are shared by both manuscripts. In summarising her discussion of scribal issues, Thompson acknowledges the difficulties of making determinations of a variety of music scripts, but concludes that there is no question of reducing the multiple hands to a single person.

'''Conclusion'''. Thompson's conclusion is direct: &lt;blockquote&gt;The attribution of these manuscripts to Francis Tregian's hand is thus little more than an attractive legend. Never based on very solid biographical evidence, it is contradicted by the physical characteristics of the manuscripts themselves. Their paper strongly suggests that the manuscripts were prepared by a group of professional scribes working for patrons at court or connected to court circles. But a scriptorium capable of executing these commissions could scarcely have been brought into being expressly for that purpose. It is likely to have dealt with other, not necessarily musical, tasks, although no further manuscripts prepared by the same group have yet been identified.{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=31}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David J. Smith's response to Thompson's 2001 article clearly takes the traditional view of Tregian's role by repeatedly referring to the group of four manuscripts as "The Tregian manuscripts."{{sfn|Smith|2002}}  He reproduces two documents with Francis Tregian's name (one of them being HC 2/27, the same one that Thompson and Cole had reproduced) from the Royal Cornwall Museum.  Smith states that cultivated gentlemen developed more than one script.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=7}} Recognizing the differences between signature and the body of the document as well as scribal inconsistencies within the same document, he states "...there is no reason to discard the hypothesis on ground of handwriting alone" and several lines later: "These differences, found within a document written by the same scribe at the same time, point to the pitfalls lying in the way of those who try to prove (or disprove) hypotheses by means of handwriting alone."{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=9}} (This is a [[false premise]] since Thompson used handwriting as only one of many elements to her analysis.) Where Thompson argued that the change in music script suggests more than one scribe, Smith uses exactly the same argument to argue in favour of a single scribe, since an individual's handwriting changes over time.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=9-10}} He states "The Tregian manuscripts were probably compiled over many years, so inconsistencies in their notation are only to be expected",{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=11}} deliberately ignoring Thompson's findings concerning the paper particularly of the uniformity of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Mus. 510-514A. Smith notes that both the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Drexel 4302 have empty ruled staves at their ends which he sees as evidence of a "work in progress." Referring to Thompson's conclusion, Smith states "It seems hardly credible that a scriptorium of professional scribes would have presented incomplete manuscripts to whomever commissioned them",{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=11}} ignoring Thompson's later comment "...the chequered history of [these manuscripts'] compilation may result from changes in the patron's requirements or even a change of patron."{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=31}}

Regarding the paper gatherings from which Thompson was able to determine different origins for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Mus. 510-514A as compared to Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302, Smith states "The way in which individual gatherings have been combined to form a larger work suggests that, initially, the genesis of these sources was a far more haphazard affair: they seem more the work of a committed individual pursuing a passion, collecting together materials from sources which came his way, than the product of a grand design."{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=11}} When later he does mention the paper types revealed by Thompson he again resorts to scribal issues.

Smith goes on at length to discuss particular points of the music content, an aspect that Thompson deliberately did not discuss, since she recognised that physical analysis must precede content analysis{{sfn|Thompson|1992|p=201}} Without supplying corroborative physical evidence aside from scribal issues that do not directly address or refute Thompson's discoveries, Smith feels that "there is no reason to discard the hypothesis that Tregian was the scribe."{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=15}}

Whether there is still a controversy concerning Tregian, in his ''European Music: 1520—1640'' (first published in 2006), James Haar considers the hypothesis to be "demolished" by Thompson's findings.{{sfn|Haar|2014|p=46-47}}

In [[gay slang]], a '''"friend of Dorothy"''' (occasionally abbreviated '''FOD''') is a [[gay]] man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leap |first=William |authorlink=|author2=Tom Boellstorff|title=Speaking in Queer Tongues: Globalization and Gay Language|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|location=|url=|doi=|isbn=0-252-07142-5|page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase dates back to at least [[World War II]], when [[homosexual]] acts were illegal in the [[United States]]. Stating that, or asking if, someone was a "friend of Dorothy" was a [[euphemism]] used for discussing [[sexual orientation]] without others knowing its meaning.  A similar term, "friend of Mrs. King" (i.e. Queen, in the meaning of 'gay man') was used in England, mostly in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sorcerer's Apprentice|author=Richardson, John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/richardson-apprentice.html|date=1999|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The precise origin of the term is unknown. Some believe that it is derived from ''[[The Road to Oz]]'' (1909), a sequel to the original ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The book introduces readers to [[Polychrome (Oz)|Polychrome]] who, upon meeting Dorothy's travelling companions, exclaims, "You have some queer friends, Dorothy", and she replies, "The queerness doesn't matter, so long as they're friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, it is stated that "friend of Dorothy" refers to the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' because [[Judy Garland]], who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a [[Judy Garland as gay icon|gay icon]]. In the film, Dorothy is accepting of those who are different. For example, the "gentle lion" giving the line, "I'm afraid there's no denyin', I'm just a [[dandy]] lion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/28/movies/critic-s-notebook-why-oz-is-a-state-of-mind-in-gay-life-and-drag-shows.html|author=Brantley, Ben|title=Why Oz Is a State of Mind In Gay Life and Drag Shows|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 28, 1994|page=C.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/arts/judy-garland-as-a-force-of-nature.html?pagewanted=all|author=Paglia, Camille|authorlink=Camille Paglia|title=Judy Garland As a Force Of Nature|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the original Oz books there are some LGBT-friendly plots. In the first book Dorothy admits to a crush on the China Princess. Ozma was transformed into a boy and her memories erased for most of her life. An all-female army attempted to conquer Oz. Ozma essentially marries Dorothy in book six making her a princess of Oz and her longtime companion. There are several creatures, including air elementals and some sorceresses which appear only in female groups. Glinda, the good witch, lives in a castle along with 100 of the most beautiful women in Oz who greet Dorothy and Ozma when they visit with kisses and dance for their amusement.

This is the header of ''[[The New Yorker]] magazine reporting this origin story, by Hilton Als, April 17, 1995: "Friends of Dorothy"

The late Dorothy Dean was a black woman who never much identified with blacks or women. But she did understand gay white men, and at Harvard in the bohemian fifties and in the New York of the “underground” sixties she and her entourage created a brittle aesthetic that defined a now vanished era.

== Misunderstanding ==
In the early 1980s, the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|Naval Investigative Service]] was investigating homosexuality in the [[Chicago]] area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as "friends of Dorothy". Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that there actually ''was'' a woman named Dorothy at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel, so they launched an enormous and futile hunt for the elusive "Dorothy", hoping to find her and convince her to reveal the names of gay service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shilts|first=Randy|authorlink=Randy Shilts|title=Conduct Unbecoming: Gays &amp; Lesbians in the U.S. Military|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|year=1993|work=[[Google Books]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOAmL6JPCE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York|page=387|isbn=0-312-34264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==
[[File:Dorothy's Friends And Siblings.jpg|thumb|right|The name of this cafe, Dorothy's Sister, in [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]], [[Auckland]]'s gay village, is a play on the slang term.]]
Starting in the late 1980s, on several [[cruise line]]s, gay and lesbian  passengers began approaching ship staff, asking them to publicise gatherings in the daily cruise activity list. As the cruise lines were hesitant to announce such things so blatantly in their daily publications, they would list the gathering as a "Meeting of the Friends of Dorothy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=188|title=FOD FAQ's, or Who Are the Friends of Dorothy? - Cruise Critic|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this phrase likely comes from the cruise directors who were also familiar with and using the "[[Bill W.|Friends of Bill W.]]" phrase in their programs to tell members of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] that there were support group meetings on the trip.

Such meetings have expanded in popularity and frequency over the years. Now, many cruise lines will have multiple FOD events, sometimes as many as one each night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guaracino|first=Jeff|title=Gay and lesbian tourism : the essential guide for marketing|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier/Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-7506-8232-9|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many FOD meetings have low turnout rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=188|title=FOD FAQ's, or Who Are the Friends of Dorothy?|website=Cruise Critic|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British comic, [[Viz(Comic)]] had an entry in [[Roger's Profanisaurus]] for "Friend of Jimmy", which is slang for a paedophile. While this is derived from the expression, "Friend of Dorothy" , it references the DJ , broadcaster , philanthropist, paedophile and necrophiliac, [[Jimmy Savile]].

[[File:Piratens gravsten, Ravlunda.jpg|200px|thumb|Gravestone on ''Ravlunda cemetery''. [[Epitaph|The inscription]] roughly translates into: ''Here lie the ashes of a man in the habit of putting everything off until tomorrow. He changed for the better on his deathbed, however, and did in fact die on 31 January 1972.''&lt;ref&gt;Göran Åstrand, ''Här vilar berömda svenskar''. 1999, s. 93&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Fritiof Nilsson Piraten''' ("the Pirate") (4 December 1895 in [[Vollsjö]] &amp;ndash; 31 January 1972 in [[Malmö]]), born '''Nils Fritiof Adam Nilsson''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] author, from the south-most province [[Skåne]], which plays an important role in many of his books.

Educated as a lawyer at [[Lund]] he left a successful practice in 1932 to write, and that same year published his debut, ''Bombi Bitt och jag'' ("Bombi Bitt and me"), a Scanian Tom Sawyer-like story of sorts. ''Bombi Bitt'' is what he is most remembered for; it was made into both a movie in 1936, and a TV-series in 1968, the series starring [[Stellan Skarsgård]] of present Hollywood-fame in the lead role as Bombi Bitt, with Piraten himself as the narrator. Piraten went on to write two more books about Bombi Bitt, one in 1946 and one in 1974. Most of his books are collections of bucolic anecdotes about eccentric people in [[Skåne]], such as his novel, ''Bock i örtagård'' ("Buck in [[Locus amoenus|herbal garden]]", 1933), about an illiterate horse-dealer and squire who bullies his way into a church-wardenship to win a bet. A movie was released 1958 based on this novel. A later novel, ''[[Bokhandlaren som slutade bada]]'' ("The book-dealer who ceased bathing", 1937) is a deeply tragic story, dotted with occasional comic situations, about a too-sensitive man falling in love with a woman and marrying her before he realizes who she really is, and the disasters that follow. 1969 a movie came out based on this novel. Most of his books are considered to fit well in the [[tall tale]] category.

Nilsson was deliberately non-literary, getting along with sailors, farmers and businessmen, and probably got his nickname for that reason (although he always insisted that it was there to distinguish him from another Nilsson). His humour is based more in [[understatement]] than in hyperbole, although the stories may be wild enough. His famous [[epitaph]] is representative of his style.

It is defined as “the dispersal of contaminated altered genes from genetically engineered organisms to natural organisms, esp. by cross-pollination”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/genetic-pollution?s=t|title=the definition of genetic pollution|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has come to be used in some broader ways.  It is related to the [[population genetics]] concept of [[gene flow]], and [[genetic rescue]], which is genetic material intentionally introduced to increase the fitness of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waller|first=Donald M.|date=June 2015|title=Genetic rescue: a safe or risky bet?|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=24|issue=11|pages=2595–2597|doi=10.1111/mec.13220|issn=1365-294X|pmid=26013990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is called genetic pollution when it negatively impacts on the fitness of a population, such as through outbreeding depression and the introduction of unwanted phenotypes which can lead to extinction.

Conservation biologists and conservationists have used the term to describe gene flow from domestic, feral, and non-native species into [[wildlife|wild]] [[indigenous species]], which they consider undesirable. They promote awareness of the effects of introduced [[invasive species]] that may "''hybridize with native species, causing genetic pollution''". In the fields of [[agriculture]], [[agroforestry]] and [[animal husbandry]], ''genetic pollution'' is used to describe gene flows between Genetically engineered species and wild relatives. The use of the word “pollution” is meant to convey the idea that mixing genetic information is bad for the environment, but because the mixing of genetic information can lead to a variety of outcomes, “pollution” may not always be the most accurate descriptor.

== Gene flow to Wild population ==
{{further|Gene flow}}Some [[Conservation biology|conservation biologists]] and [[conservationists]] have used genetic pollution for a number of years as a term to describe gene flow from a [[Introduced species|non-native]], [[invasive species|invasive subspecies]], [[Domestication|domestic]], or [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] population to a [[Wildlife|wild]] [[indigenous species|indigenous]] population.&lt;ref name="Genetic Pollution in Italian Wolfs 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler_1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Declan|date=18 August 1994|title=Bid to protect wolves from genetic pollution|journal=Nature|volume=370|issue=6490|pages=497|doi=10.1038/370497a0|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="potts"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potts BM, Barbour RC, Hingston AB, Vaillancourt RE | year = 2003 | title = Corrigendum to: TURNER REVIEW No. 6 ''Genetic pollution of native eucalypt gene pools—identifying the risks'' | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | page = 333 | doi = 10.1071/BT02035_CO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance ===
The introduction of genetic material into the gene pool of a population by human intervention can have both positive and negative effects on populations. When genetic material is intentionally introduced to increase the fitness of a population, this is called [[genetic rescue]]. When genetic material is unintentionally introduced to a population, this is called genetic pollution and can negatively affect the fitness of a population (primarily through [[outbreeding depression]]), introduce other unwanted phenotypes, or theoretically lead to extinction.

=== Introduced species ===
{{further|Introduced species}}An introduced species is one that is not native to a given population that is either intentionally or accidentally brought into a given ecosystem. Effects of introduction are highly variable, but if an introduced species has a major negative impact on its new environment, it can be considered an invasive species. One such example is the introduction of the Asian Longhorned beetle in North America, which was first detected in 1996 in Brooklyn, New York. It is believed that these beetles were introduced through cargo at trade ports. The beetles are highly damaging to the environment, and are estimated to cause risk to 35% of urban trees, excluding natural forests.&lt;ref&gt;Haack, Robert A., et al. Managing Invasive Populations of Asian Longhorned Beetle and Citrus Longhorned Beetle: A Worldwide Perspective. vol. 55, Annual Review of Entomology, 2010, Managing Invasive Populations of Asian Longhorned Beetle and Citrus Longhorned Beetle: A Worldwide Perspective.&lt;/ref&gt; These beetles cause severe damage to the wood of trees by larval funneling. Their presence in the ecosystem destabilizes community structure, having a negative influence on many species in the system. Introduced species are not always disruptive to an environment, however. Tomás Carlo and Jason Gleditch of Penn State University found that the number of invasive honeysuckle plants in the area correlated with the number and diversity of the birds in the Happy Valley Region of Pennsylvania, suggesting introduced honeysuckle plants and birds formed a mutually beneficial relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''2011, Invasive Plants Can Create Positive Ecological Change.''&lt;/ref&gt; Presence of introduced honeysuckle was associated with higher diversity of the bird populations in that area, demonstrating that introduced species are not always detrimental to a given environment and it is completely context dependent.

==== Invasive species ====
Conservation biologists and conservationists have, for a number of years, used the term to describe gene flow from domestic, feral, and non-native species into [[wildlife|wild]] [[indigenous species]], which they consider undesirable.&lt;ref name="Genetic Pollution in Italian Wolfs 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Butler_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="potts" /&gt;  For example, [[TRAFFIC]] is the international [[wildlife]] trade monitoring network that works to limit [[trade]] in wild plants and animals so that it is not a threat to conservationist goals. They promote awareness of the effects of introduced [[invasive species]] that may "''hybridize with native species, causing genetic pollution''".&lt;ref name="TRAFFIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/wildlife/wild6.htm|title=When is wildlife trade a problem?|website=TRAFFIC.org, the wildlife trade monitoring network, a joint programme of WWF and IUCN|publisher=The World Conservation Union|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224231437/http://www.traffic.org/wildlife/wild6.htm|archive-date=24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]], the statutory adviser to the [[Government of United Kingdom|UK government]], has stated that invasive species "will alter the genetic pool (a process called ''genetic pollution''), which is an irreversible change."&lt;ref name="JNCC"&gt;[http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1532 Effects of the introduction of invasive/non-native species] - ''Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)'', a statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation. Accessed on November 25, 2007.

: "''Occasionally non-native species can reproduce with native species and produce hybrids, which will alter the genetic pool (a process called ''genetic pollution''), which is an irreversible change.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Invasive species can invade both large and small native populations and have a profound effect. Upon invasion, invasive species interbreed with native species to form sterile or more evolutionarily fit hybrids that can outcompete the native populations. Invasive species can cause extinctions of small populations on islands that are particularly vulnerable due to their smaller amounts of genetic diversity. In these populations, local adaptations can be disrupted by the introduction of new genes that may not be as suitable for the small island environments. For example, the ''Cercocarpus traskiae'' of the Catalina Island off the coast of California has faced near extinction with only a single population remaining due to the hybridization of its offspring with ''Cercocarpus betuloides.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Donald A.|last2=Francisco-Ortega|first2=Javier|last3=Jansen|first3=Robert K. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1996-02-01|title=Hybridization and the Extinction of Rare Plant Species|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=10–16|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10010010.x|issn=1523-1739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic populations ===
Increased contact between wild and [[Domestication|domesticated]] populations of organisms can lead to reproductive interactions that are detrimental to the wild population's ability to survive. A wild population is one that lives in natural areas and is not regularly looked after by humans. This contrast with domesticated populations that live in human controlled areas and are regularly, and historically, in contact with humans. [[Gene]]s from domesticated populations are added to wild populations as a result of reproduction. In many crop populations this can be the result of pollen traveling from farmed crops to neighboring wild plants of the same species. For farmed animals, this reproduction may happen as the result of escaped or released animals.

==== Aquaculture ====
[[Aquaculture]] is the practice of farming aquatic animals or plants for the purpose of consumption. This practice is becoming increasingly common for the production of [[salmon]]. This is specifically termed [[Aquaculture of salmonids|aquaculture of salmonoids]]. One of the dangers of this practice is the possibility of domesticated salmon breaking free from their containment. The occurrence of escaping incidents is becoming increasingly common as aquaculture gains popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-atlantic-salmon-20170903-story.html|title=More than 160,000 non-native Atlantic salmon escaped into Washington waters in fish farm accident|last=Anderson|first=Rick | name-list-format = vanc |website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/08/24/545619525/environmental-nightmare-after-thousands-of-atlantic-salmon-escape-fish-farm|title='Environmental Nightmare' After Thousands Of Atlantic Salmon Escape Fish Farm|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://beta.nydailynews.com/news/national/thousands-salmon-escaped-fish-farm-no-article-1.3439097|title=Thousands of salmon escape from fish farm, and no one knows what will happen next|last=Scotti|first=Ariel | name-list-format = vanc |work=nydailynews.com|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farming structures may be ineffective at holding the vast number of fast growing animals they house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livingoceans.org/initiatives/salmon-farming/issues/escapes-net-pens-are-poor-containment-structures-and-escaped|title=Escapes: Net-pens are poor containment structures and escaped farmed salmon can compete with wild salmon for food and spawning habitat|date=2013-03-12|work=Living Oceans|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural disasters, high tides, and other environmental occurrences can also trigger aquatic animal escapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2017/08/24/how-did-the-eclipse-let-thousands-of-farmed-salmon-escape/#1ea0f1d8633e|title=How Did The Eclipse Let Thousands Of Farmed Salmon Escape?|last=Montanari|first=Shaena | name-list-format = vanc |work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/fish-spill-bigger-than-initial-estimates-farm-destroyed/|title=Spill of farmed Atlantic salmon near San Juan Islands much bigger than first estimates|date=2017-08-24|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason these escapes are considered dangers is the impact they pose for the wild population they reproduce with after escaping.

==== Crops ====
[[Crop]]s refer to groups of plants grown for consumption. Despite domestication over many years, these plants are not so far removed from their wild relatives that they could reproduce if brought together. Many crops are still grown in the areas they originated and gene flow between crops and wild relatives impacts the evolution of wild populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellstrand|first=Norman C.|last2=Prentice|first2=Honor C.|last3=Hancock|first3=James F.|date=1999|title=Gene Flow and Introgression from Domesticated Plants into Their Wild Relatives|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=30|issue=1|pages=539–563|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.30.1.539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers can avoid reproduction between the different populations by timing their planting of crops so that crops are not flowering when wild relatives would be. Domesticated crops have been changed through artificial selection and genetic engineering. The genetic make up of many crops is different than that of its wild relatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25creature.html|title=Tracking the Ancestry of Corn Back 9,000 Years|last=Carroll|first=Sean B.|date=2010-05-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the closer they grow to one another the more likely they are to share genes through pollen. Gene flow persists between crops and wild counterparts.

=== Genetically engineered organisms ===
{{see|Genetic engineering}}

Genetically engineered organisms are genetically modified in a laboratory, and therefore distinct from those that were bred through artificial selection. In the fields of [[agriculture]], [[agroforestry]] and [[animal husbandry]], ''genetic pollution'' is being used to describe gene flows between GE species and wild relatives.&lt;ref name="FAO_document1"/&gt;
An early use of the term "''genetic pollution"'' in this later sense appears in a wide-ranging review of the potential ecological effects of genetic engineering in [http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/exact/browse/307/308/6481/3/8?dps= The Ecologist magazine in July 1989]. It was also popularized by environmentalist [[Jeremy Rifkin]] in his 1998 book ''The Biotech Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jeremy | last = Rifkin | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1998 | title = The Biotech Century: Harnessing the Gene and Remaking the World | publisher = J P Tarcher | isbn = 978-0-87477-909-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While intentional crossbreeding between two genetically distinct varieties is described as [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with the subsequent [[introgression]] of genes, Rifkin, who had played a leading role in the ethical debate for over a decade before, used genetic pollution to describe what he considered to be problems that might occur due the unintentional process of (modernly) [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) dispersing their genes into the natural environment by breeding with wild plants or animals.&lt;ref name="FAO_document1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/biotech/biotech-forum/conference-7/en/ | title = Gene flow from GM to non-GM populations in the crop, forestry, animal and fishery sectors | website = Background document to Conference 7: May 31 - July 6, 2002; Electronic Forum on Biotechnology in Food and Agriculture | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldWideWords_MichaelQuinion"&gt;{{cite web | first = Michael | last = Quinion | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-gen1.htm | title = Genetic Pollution | website = World Wide Words }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Amy | last = Otchet | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1998 | url = http://www.unesco.org/courier/1998_09/uk/dires/txt1.htm | title = Jeremy Rifkin: fears of a brave new world | website = an interview hosted by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about negative consequences from gene flow between genetically engineered organisms and wild populations are valid. Most corn and soybean crops grown in the midwestern USA are genetically modified. There are corn and soybean varieties that are resistant to herbicides like glyphosate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waltz|first=Emily|date=2010-06|title=Glyphosate resistance threatens Roundup hegemony|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0610-537|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=28|issue=6|pages=537–538|doi=10.1038/nbt0610-537|pmid=20531318|issn=1087-0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corn that produces [[neonicotinoid]] pesticide within all of its tissues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krupke|first=C.

Many farmed crops may be weed resistant and reproduce with wild relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jul/25/gm.food|title=GM crops created superweed, say scientists|last=Brown|first=Paul|date=2005-07-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is necessary to understand how much gene flow between genetically engineered crops and wild populations occurs, and the impacts of genetic mixing.

==== Mutated organisms ====
Mutations within organisms can be executed through the process of exposing the organism to chemicals or radiation in order to generate mutations.  This has been done in plants in order to create mutants that have a desired trait.  These mutants can then be bred with other mutants or individuals that are not mutated in order to maintain the mutant trait.  However, similar to the risks associated with introducing individuals to a certain environment, the variation created by mutated individuals could have a negative impact on native populations as well.
{{further|Mutation breeding}}

====Preventative measures====

Since 2005 there has existed a [[GM Contamination Register]], launched for [[GeneWatch]] UK and [[Greenpeace]] International that records all incidents of intentional or accidental&lt;ref name="2001may11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/pressreleases/geneng/2001may11.html|title=Illegal Genetically Engineered Corn from Monsanto Detected in Argentina|website=GM Contamination Register|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622031622/http://archive.greenpeace.org/pressreleases/geneng/2001may11.html|archive-date=2011-06-22|deadurl=yes|access-date=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gmcontaminationregister.org/index.php?content=re_detail&amp;gw_id=131&amp;reg=cou.13&amp;inc=0&amp;con=0&amp;cof=0&amp;year=0&amp;handle2_page=  | title = Brazil – Illegal Roundup Ready cotton grown on 16,000 hectares | website = GM Contamination Register }}&lt;/ref&gt; release of organisms genetically modified using modern techniques.&lt;ref name="gmcontaminationregister.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmcontaminationregister.org/|title=GM Contamination Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic Use Restriction Technologies|Genetic use restriction technologies]] (GURTs) were developed for the purpose of property protection, but could be beneficial in preventing the dispersal of transgenes. GeneSafe technologies introduced a method that became known as “Terminator.” This method is based on seeds that produce sterile plants. This would prevent movement of transgenes into wild populations as hybridization would not be possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sang|first=Yi|last2=Millwood|first2=Reginald J.|last3=Neal Stewart Jr|first3=C.|date=2013-06-04|title=Gene use restriction technologies for transgenic plant bioconfinement|journal=Plant Biotechnology Journal|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|pages=649–658|doi=10.1111/pbi.12084|pmid=23730743|issn=1467-7644}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this technology has never been deployed as it disproportionately negatively affects farmers in developing countries, who save seeds to use each year (whereas in developed countries, farmers generally buy seeds from seed production companies).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Physical containment has also been utilized to prevent the escape of transgenes. Physical containment includes barriers such as filters in labs, screens in greenhouses, and isolation distances in the field. Isolation distances have not always been successful, such as transgene escape from an isolated field into the wild in herbicide-resistant bentgrass ''Agrostis stolonifera''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gressel|first=Jonathan|date=2014-08-15|title=Dealing with transgene flow of crop protection traits from crops to their relatives|journal=Pest Management Science|language=en|volume=71|issue=5|pages=658–667|doi=10.1002/ps.3850|pmid=24977384|issn=1526-498X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggested method that applies specifically to protection traits (e.g. pathogen resistance) is mitigation. Mitigation involves linking the positive trait (beneficial to fitness) to a trait that is negative (harmful to fitness) to wild but not domesticated individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this case, if the protection trait was introduced to a weed, the negative trait would also be introduced in order to decrease overall fitness of the weed and decrease possibility of the individual’s reproduction and thus propagation of the transgene.

====Risks====

Not all genetically engineered organisms cause genetic pollution.  Genetic engineering has a variety of uses and is specifically defined as a direct manipulation of the genome of an organism.  Genetic pollution can occur in response to the introduction of a species that is not native to a particular environment, and genetically engineered organisms are examples of individuals that could cause genetic pollution following introduction.  Due to these risks, studies have been done in order to assess the risks of genetic pollution associated with organisms that have been genetically engineered:

Not only are there risks in terms of genetic engineering, but there are risks that emerge from species hybridization In Czechoslovakia, ibex were introduced from Turkey and Sinai to help promote the ibex population there, which caused hybrids that produced offspring too early, which caused the overall population to disappear completely.&lt;ref&gt;''Genetic Rescue: a Safe or Risky Bet?''&lt;/ref&gt; The genes of each population of the ibex in Turkey and Sinai were locally adapted to their environments so when placed in a new environmental context did not flourish. Additionally, the environmental toll that may arise from the introduction of a new species may be so disruptive that the ecosystem is no longer able to sustain certain populations.

== Controversy ==

=== Environmentalist perspectives  ===
The use of the word “pollution” in the term genetic pollution has a deliberate negative connotation and is meant to convey the idea that mixing genetic information is bad for the environment. However, because the mixing of genetic information can lead to a variety of outcomes, “pollution” may not be the most accurate descriptor. Gene flow is undesirable according to some [[environmentalist]]s and [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s, including groups such as [[Greenpeace]], [[TRAFFIC]], and [[GeneWatch UK]] &lt;ref name="GE agriculture and genetic pollution"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/genetic-engineering/ge-agriculture-and-genetic-pol GE agriculture and genetic pollution] web article hosted by Greenpeace.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2001may11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gmcontaminationregister.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Say no to genetic pollution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org|title=Say no to genetic pollution|publisher=Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler_1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TRAFFIC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/sweden/PageFiles/497049/genetic_pollution.pdf|title=Genetic Pollution a Multiplying Nightmare|last=Greenpeace|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Invasive species have been a major cause of [[extinction]] throughout the world in the past few hundred years. Some of them prey on native wildlife, compete with it for resources, or spread     disease, while others may hybridize with native species, causing "'''genetic pollution'''". In these ways, invasive species are as big a threat to the balance of nature as the direct overexploitation by humans of some species.''"&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref name="mixing" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;It can also be considered undesirable if it leads to a loss of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the wild populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Milot E, Perrier C, Papillon L, Dodson JJ, Bernatchez L|date=April 2013|title=Reduced fitness of Atlantic salmon released in the wild after one generation of captive breeding|journal=Evolutionary Applications|volume=6|issue=3|pages=472–85|doi=10.1111/eva.12028|pmc=3673475|pmid=23745139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can be associated with the gene flow from a [[Mutation breeding|mutation bred]], [[synthetic biology|synthetic organism]] or [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] organism to a non GE organism,&lt;ref name="FAO_document1" /&gt; by those who consider such gene flow detrimental.&lt;ref name="GE agriculture and genetic pollution" /&gt; These environmentalist groups stand in complete opposition to the development and production of genetically engineered organisms.

=== Governmental definition  ===
From a governmental perspective, genetic pollution is defined as follows by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Uncontrolled spread of genetic information (frequently referring to transgenes) into the genomes of organisms in which such genes are not present in nature."&lt;ref name="Glossary of Biotechnology for Food and Agriculture - A Revised and Augmented Edition of the Glossary of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/biotech/biotech-glossary/en/|title=Glossary of Biotechnology for Food and Agriculture - A Revised and Augmented Edition of the Glossary of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering|date=26 October 2007|series=A FAO Research and Technology Paper|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-104683-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026141019/http://www.fao.org/biotech/biotech-glossary/en/|archive-date=30 November 2011|vauthors=Zaid A, Hughes HG, Porceddu E, Nicholas F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Scientific perspectives ===
Use of the term 'genetic pollution' and similar phrases such as ''genetic deterioration'', ''genetic swamping'', ''genetic takeover'', and ''genetic aggression'', are being debated by scientists as many do not find it scientifically appropriate. Rhymer and Simberloff argue that these types of terms: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...imply either that hybrids are less fit than the parentals, which need not be the case, or that there is an inherent value in "pure" gene pools.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-mixing-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;They recommend that gene flow from invasive species be termed '''genetic mixing''' since:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mixing" need not be value-laden, and we use it here to denote mixing of gene pools whether or not associated with a decline in fitness.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-mixing-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;Environmentalists such as [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]], an ex-member and cofounder of [[Greenpeace]], questions if the term genetic pollution is more political than scientific. The term is considered to arouse emotional feelings towards the subject matter.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-Say no to genetic pollution-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]] In an interview he comments:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you take a term used quite frequently these days, the term "genetic pollution," otherwise referred to as genetic contamination, it is a propaganda term, not a technical or scientific term. Pollution and contamination are both [[value judgment]]s. By using the word "genetic" it gives the public the impression that they are talking about something scientific or technical--as if there were such a thing as genes that amount to pollution.[[Genetic pollution#cite note-heartland-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, using the term “genetic pollution” is inherently political. A scientific approach to discussing gene flow between introduced and native species would be to use terms like genetic mixing or gene flow. Such mixing can definitely have negative consequences on the fitness of native populations, so it is important not to minimize the risk. However, because genetic mixing can also lead to fitness recovery in cases that could be described as “genetic rescue”, it is important to distinguish that just mixing genes from introduced into native populations can lead to variable outcomes for the fitness of native populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5145">'''Global index grammars''' (GIGs) are a class of grammars introduced in Castaño (2004)&lt;ref name="castano2004"&gt;Castaño, José M. 2004. ''Global Index Languages''. Dissertation, Brandeis University.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to model a number of phenomena, including natural language grammar and genome grammar. The easiest description of GIGs is by comparison to [[Indexed grammar]]s. Whereas in indexed grammars, a stack of indices is associated with each [[nonterminal symbol]], and can vary from one to another depending on the course of the derivation, in a GIG, there is a single global index stack that is manipulated in the course of the derivation (which is strictly leftmost for any rewrite operation that pushes a symbol to the stack). Because of the existence of a global stack, a GIG derivation is considered complete when there are no non-terminal symbols left to be rewritten, and the stack is empty.

==Rule Description==

GIG rules come in essentially four forms: rules that do something unconditionally, rules that do something conditioned on the topmost symbol of the stack, rules that push to the stack, and rules that pop from the stack. We can notate these in turn as:

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;A \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
| ''(unconditionally rewrite A as {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}}, doing nothing to the stack)''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;A \xrightarrow[f]{} \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
| ''(rewrite A as {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} if f is the topmost stack symbol, doing nothing to the stack)''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;A \xrightarrow[+f]{} x \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
| ''(unconditionally rewrite A as {{mvar|x&amp;alpha;}} and push f to the stack)''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;A \xrightarrow[-f]{} \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
| ''(conditionally rewrite A as {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} if f is the topmost symbol of the stack, then pop f from the stack)''
|}

where f is any index symbol, {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} is any string of terminals and/or non-terminal symbols, and x is a terminal is a terminal symbol. Because occasionally a rewrite rule might need to be conditioned on the stack being in some sense ''empty'', the symbol ''#'' is used as the bottom-most stack symbol, meaning an "empty" stack contains exactly one symbol, ''#''.

The third rule form, the push rule, should be pointed out, as it differs from the pop rule in requiring that all push operations introduce at least one new terminal symbol to the derivation string. Without this constraint, the class of grammars would be Type-0 and thus Turing Complete.

==Example==

For this example, we will denote steps in the derivation by placing the derivation string over a stack, as in &lt;math&gt;\frac{abXd}{[ffg]}&lt;/math&gt;.

GIGs (but not trGIGs as below) can generate the non-indexed language &lt;math&gt;\{ ww^{+} : w \in \{a,b\}^{*} \}&lt;/math&gt; using the following grammar:


: &lt;math&gt;S \to AS ~|~ BS ~|~ C ~|~ \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;C \to RC ~|~ L&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;R \xrightarrow[-f]{} RA&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;R \xrightarrow[-g]{} RB&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;R \xrightarrow[\#]{} \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A \xrightarrow[+f]{} a&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;B \xrightarrow[+g]{} b&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;L \xrightarrow[-f]{} La ~|~ a&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;L \xrightarrow[-g]{} Lb ~|~ b&lt;/math&gt;


A derivation for the string {{not a typo|''ababab''}} is as follows:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{S}{[\#]} \to \frac{AS}{[\#]} \to \frac{aS}{[\#f]} \to \frac{aBS}{[\#f]} \to \frac{abS}{[\#fg]} \to \frac{abC}{[\#fg]} \to \frac{abRC}{[\#fg]} \to \frac{abRBC}{[\#f]} \to&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{abRABC}{[\#]} \to \frac{abABC}{[\#]} \to \frac{abaBC}{[\#f]} \to \frac{ababC}{[\#fg]} \to \frac{ababL}{[\#fg]} \to \frac{ababLb}{[\#f]} \to \frac{ababab}{[\#]}&lt;/math&gt;


A similar derivation follows for ''{{not a typo|abbabbabb}}'', ''{{not a typo|aaabaaabaaabaaab}}'', and other such sentences.

==Computational Power==

The global index languages are a subset of the context sensitive languages, and a superset of the context free languages. It is known that GIGs can generate the MIX/Bach language &lt;math&gt;\{ p(a^n b^n c^n) : n \geq 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''p'' is the string permutation function, which is conjectured (but not proven) not to be representable as an indexed language.  It is not known whether or not all IGs are also GIGs. It is entirely possible that GIGs and IGs describe merely-overlapping subsets of the CSLs.

==trGIGs==

A subclass of GIGs is the class of trGIGs, which make the pop and push rules uniform, by requiring that pop rules also introduce at least one terminal symbol into the derivation.

===Example===

An example of such a grammar, characterizing the language &lt;math&gt;\{a^m b^n c^m d^n : m, n \geq 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;, is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}
S \to AD \\
A \to aAc ~|~ aBc \\
B \xrightarrow[+f]{} bB ~|~ b \\
D \xrightarrow[-f]{} dD ~|~ d
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


The derivation for the string ''aabbbccddd'' is then:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{S}{[\#]} &amp; \to \frac{AD}{[\#]} \to \frac{aAcD}{[\#]} \to \frac{aaBccD}{[\#]} \to \frac{aabBccD}{[\#f]} \to \frac{aabbBccD}{[\#ff]} \\
               &amp; \to \frac{aabbbccD}{[\#fff]} \to \frac{aabbbccdD}{[\#ff]} \to \frac{aabbbccddD}{[\#f]} \to \frac{aabbbccddd}{[\#]} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Zero-shot translation==
The GNMT system is said to represent an improvement over the former Google Translate in that it will be able handle "zero-shot translation", that is it directly translates one language into another (for example, Japanese to Korean).&lt;ref name="googleblog_GNMT_2016" /&gt; Google Translate previously first translated the [[source language (translation)|source language]] into English and then translated the English into the [[target language (translation)|target language]] rather than translating directly from one language to another.&lt;ref name="Biotet"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Christian |last1=Boitet |first2=Hervé |last2=Blanchon |first3=Mark |last3=Seligman |first4=Valérie |last4=Bellynck |title=MT on and for the Web |url=http://www-clips.imag.fr/geta/herve.blanchon/Pdfs/NLP-KE-10.pdf |format=PDF |date=2010|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, no non-English language pairs are supported, though.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">'''Gradualism''', from the Latin ''gradus'' ("step"), is a hypothesis, a theory or a tenet assuming that change comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in nature and happens over time as opposed to in large steps.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McGowran. (2008). ''Biostratigraphy: Microfossils and Geological Time''. Cambridge University Press. p. 384. {{ISBN|978-0521048170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uniformitarianism]], [[incrementalism]], and [[reformism]] are similar concepts.

==Geology and biology==
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

In the natural sciences, gradualism is the [[theory]] which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with [[catastrophism]].  The theory was proposed in 1795 by [[James Hutton]], a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into [[Charles Lyell]]'s theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].  Tenets from both theories were applied to [[biology]] and formed the basis of early [[evolution]]ary theory.

[[Charles Darwin]] was influenced by Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'', which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see [[catastrophism]]), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in [[Saltation (biology)|saltations]], since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against.

Gradualism is often confused with the concept of [[phyletic gradualism]]. It is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] to contrast with their model of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.&lt;ref name=punc1972&gt;Eldredge, Niles, and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism."] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper and Company, pp. 82-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phyletic gradualism ===
{{main|Phyletic gradualism}}
[[Phyletic gradualism]] is a model of [[evolution]] which theorizes that most [[speciation]] is slow, uniform and gradual.&lt;ref name=pe1972&gt;Eldredge, N. and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole [[species]] into a new one (through a process called [[anagenesis]]). In this view no clear line of demarcation exists between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless [[cladogenesis|splitting]] occurs.

=== Punctuated gradualism ===
{{main|Punctuated gradualism}}
[[Punctuated gradualism]] is a [[microevolution]]ary [[hypothesis]] that refers to a species that has "relative stasis over a considerable part of its total duration [and] underwent periodic, relatively rapid, morphologic change that did not lead to lineage branching". It is one of the three common models of [[evolution]]. While the traditional model of palaeontology, the phylogenetic model, states that features evolved slowly without any direct association with speciation, the relatively newer and more controversial idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]] claims that major evolutionary changes don't happen over a gradual period but in localized, rare, rapid events of branching speciation.  Punctuated gradualism is considered to be a variation of these models, lying somewhere in between the [[phyletic gradualism]] model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It states that speciation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another but may show rapid transitions between long-stable states.

== Politics and society ==
{{Social democracy sidebar |Development}}

In [[politics]], gradualism is the hypothesis that social change can be achieved in small, discrete increments rather than in abrupt strokes such as [[revolution]]s or [[rebellion|uprisings]]. Gradualism is one of the defining features of political [[liberalism]] and [[reformism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | work= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machiavellian]] politics pushes politicians to espouse gradualism.

In [[socialism|socialist politics]] and within the socialist movement, the concept of gradualism is frequently distinguished from reformism, with the former insisting that short-term goals need to be formulated and implemented in such a way that they inevitably lead into long-term goals. It is most commonly associated with the [[libertarian socialist]] concept of [[dual power]] and is seen as a middle way between reformism and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionism]].

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. The government wanted to try to integrate [[African-American]]s and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

== Linguistics and language change ==
In [[linguistics]], [[language change]] is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to [[Drift (linguistics)#Long-term cyclic drift|cyclic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann]] (1983). "Les réactions en chaîne en morphologie diachronique."  ''Actes du Colloque de la Société internationale de linguistique fonctionnelle'' 10.285-92.[http://www.nou-la.org/1983c-morphodia.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that [[creole language]]s are the product of [[catastrophism]] is heavily disputed.

==Morality==
===Christianity===
{{main|Law of graduality}}

Gradualism has also been used in a religious sense, especially in the [[Catholic Church]] (specifically, in [[Catholic ethics|ethics]] and [[Catholic moral theology|moral theology]]), to describe the view that certain individuals and families that make up a parish or community may be living at various points along a line extending from being in a state of [[mortal sin]], to being at least minimally in the "[[State (theology)|state]] of [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]" and able to receive the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], and to a level of greater [[Universal call to holiness|holiness]]. This view teaches that the lives and relationships of people with morally unacceptable lifestyles may have some elements of good, even of great good, such as [[Agape|sacrificial love]] and consistent respect. It holds that virtues are not all-or-nothing propositions, and that elements of good may be found even in the context of morally unacceptable situations. Catholic clergy who espouse this view include the Bishop of [[San Diego, California]], [[Robert W. McElroy]], who in 2016 wrote: {{quote|The principle of gradualness reaches far beyond the question of marriage to embrace all elements of the Christian moral life, for it really is an embodiment of the pastoral method of the Lord himself. Pope Francis repeatedly cites the example of Jesus’ conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well as a prism through which to construct the Church’s outreach to young couples, a prism which embraces them in their humanity and their love, rather than categorizing them as living in sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/church/2016/05/11/san-diego-bishop-backs-pope-on-divorced-and-remarried/|title=San Diego bishop backs pope on divorced and remarried|work=Crux|date=May 11, 2016|author=Michael O'Loughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies===
{{main|Subitism}}
&lt;!--"Five precepts" links here.--&gt; 
Gradualism is the approach of certain schools of Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies (e.g. [[Theravada]] or [[Yoga]]), that [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] can be achieved step by step, through an arduous practice. The opposite approach, that [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] is attained all at once, is called [[subitism]]. The debate on the issue was very important to the history of the development of [[Zen]], which rejected gradualism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']&lt;/ref&gt; and to the establishment of the opposite approach within the [[Tibetan Buddhism]], after the [[Debate of Samye]]. It was continued in other schools of [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Gregory | first =Peter N. (editor) | year =1991 | title =''Sudden and Gradual. Approaches to Enlightenment in Chinese Thought'' | place =Delhi | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types==
[[Lorenzo Peña#Contradictorial gradualism|Contradictorial gradualism]] is the paraconsistent treatment of [[Fuzzy logic|fuzziness]] developed by [[Lorenzo Peña]] which regards true contradictions as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence.

Gradualism in [[social change]] implemented through [[reformist]] means is a moral principle to which the [[Fabian Society]] is committed. In a more general way, [[reformism]] is the assumption that gradual changes through and within existing institutions can ultimately change a [[society]]'s fundamental [[economic system]] and political structures; and that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different economic system and form of society than present-day [[capitalism]]. That hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that [[revolution]] is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur.

In the terminology of [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Gradualism|NWO]]-related speculations, gradualism refers to the gradual implementation of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]].

In [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''Jocasta complex''' is the [[incest]]uous [[sexual desire]] of a mother towards her son.&lt;ref&gt;Jon E. Roeckelein. Elsevier's dictionary of psychological theories. Elsevier, 2006. {{ISBN|0-444-51750-2}}. Page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond de Saussure]] introduced the term in 1920 by way of analogy to its logical converse in psychoanalysis, the [[Oedipus complex]], and it may be used to cover different degrees of attachment,&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Campbell, ''Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary'' (2009)  p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; including domineering but asexual mother love – something perhaps particularly prevalent with an absent father.

==Origins==

The Jocasta complex is named for [[Jocasta]], a Greek queen who unwittingly married her son, [[Oedipus]]. The Jocasta complex is similar to the [[Oedipus complex]], in which a child has sexual desire towards their parent(s). The term is a bit of an extrapolation, since in the original story Oedipus and Jocasta were unaware that they were mother and son when they married. The usage in modern contexts involves a son with full knowledge of who his mother is.

==Analytic discussion==

[[Theodor Reik]] saw the "Jocasta mother", with an unfulfilled adult relationship of her own and an over-concern for her child instead, as a prime source of neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sutherland, ''Breakdown'' (Oxford 1998) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Devereux]] went further, arguing that the child's Oedipal complex was itself triggered by a pre-existing parental complex (Jocasta/[[Laius]]).&lt;ref&gt;George Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) pp. 209–10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] also explored the other (parental) side of the Oedipus complex, pointing to related family dramas such as "mother sleeping with daughter's boyfriend ... when mother has no son to play Jocasta with".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==
* [[Atossa]], in the Greek tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', has been seen as struggling in her dreams with a Jocasta complex.&lt;ref&gt;George Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
* Indian folk-tales often feature figures, like Jocasta, expressing maternal desire for their sons.&lt;ref&gt;L. Edmunds/A. Dundes, ''Oedipus: A Folklore Casebook'' (1995) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kadia Molodowsky''' (also: '''Kadya Molodowsky'''; [[May 10]], [[1894]], [[Byaroza]] – [[March 23]], [[1975]], [[Philadelphia]]) was an American poet and writer in the [[Yiddish|Yiddish language]], and a teacher of Yiddish and Hebrew. She published six collections of poetry during her lifetime, and was a widely recognized figure in Yiddish poetry during the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="jhom.com"&gt;"[http://jhom.com/personalities/kadya_molodowsky/index.htm Kadya Molodowsky (1894-1975)]."

==Biography==
Born in the [[shtetl]] of Byaroza-Kartuskaya (now [[Byaroza]]), in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Belarus]]), Molodowsky was educated at home in both religious and secular subjects.&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt; While her father, a teacher in a traditional Jewish elementary school ([[cheder]]), instructed her in the Hebrew Pentateuch, her paternal grandmother taught her Yiddish; with private tutors she studied secular subjects in Russian, including geography, philosophy, and world history.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt;  Molodowsky's mother ran a dry goods story and, later, a factory for making rye [[kvass]].&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt;

Molodowsky finished high school at 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt; After then obtaining her teaching certificate in Byaroza, she studied Hebrew pedagogy under [[Yehiel Halperin]] in [[Warsaw]], in 1913–1914, and, in the latter part of that period, instructed children there who had been displaced during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt; In 1916 she followed Halperin to [[Odessa]], where he had moved his course to escape the war front.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-YIVO"/&gt; In Odessa, Molodowsky taught kindergarten and elementary school.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt;

In 1917, upon attempting to return to her hometown, she was trapped in [[Kiev]], where she remained for several years; she lived through the [[Kiev pogroms (1919)|pogroms]] that occurred there in 1919.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt;

While living in Kiev, Molodowsky was influenced by the Yiddish literary circle around [[David Bergelson]],&lt;ref name="Frieden"&gt;Frieden, Ken. "[http://www.britannica.com/art/Yiddish-literature/Modern-Yiddish-literature Yiddish literature]." Section: "'Modern Yiddish Literature: Yiddish Women Writers." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.

In Warsaw, Molodowsky published her first book of poetry, ''Kheshvndike nekht'' (Nights of Heshvan), in 1927, followed by several others, including ''Dzshike gas'' (Dzshike Street), in 1933.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frieden"/&gt; Throughout her years in Warsaw she taught Yiddish in secular elementary schools run by the Central Yiddish School Organization (Tsentrale Yidishe Shul-Organizatsye; TSYSHO); she also taught Hebrew in the evenings at a Jewish community school.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-YIVO"/&gt;

Molodowsky emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1935 and settled in [[New York City]], where her husband joined her not long after.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt; Among her works in the post-World War II period, she is especially noted for her collection ''Der melekh David aleyn iz geblibn'' (Only King David Remained; 1946), poems written in response to the [[Holocaust]], including one of her best known poems, "Eyl Khanun" (Merciful God), composed in 1945.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-2003"/&gt;

From 1949 to 1952 Molodowsky and her husband lived in [[Tel Aviv]], in the new state of [[Israel]], where she edited the Yiddish journal ''Di Heym'' (Home),&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-2003"/&gt; published by the Working Women's Council (Moetzet Hapoalot).&lt;ref&gt;Rojanski, Rachel (2012).

Back in 1943 Molodowsky had co-founded the Yiddish journal, ''Di Svive'' (Milieu), in New York, publishing seven issues through 1944;&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-2003"/&gt; around 1960 she revived the journal (under the same title) and continued to edit it until near the time of her death.&lt;ref name="Klepfisz34"/&gt; Her autobiography, ''Fun Mayn Elter-zeydns Yerushe'' (From my great-grandfather’s inheritance), appeared in serialized form in ''Svive'' from March 1965 to April 1974.&lt;ref name="Hellerstein-JWA"/&gt;

In 1971, Molodowsky was honored as a recipient of the [[Itsik Manger]] Prize for Yiddish letters.&lt;ref name="jhom.com"/&gt;

Molodowsky's husband, Simcha Lev, died in New York City in 1974. In frail health, she moved to [[Philadelphia]] to be near relatives, and died in a nursing home there, on March 23, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Hellerstein (1999), "Introduction," ''Paper Bridges'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kala''', also known as Kela, is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language spoken by about 2200 people (in 2002) in several villages along the south coast of the [[Huon Gulf]] between Salamaua Peninsula and the Paiawa River, [[Morobe Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. The principal villages from north to south are: Manindala (also known as Kela), Lambu (also known as Logui), Apoze (also known as Laukanu), Kamiali (also known as Lababia), Alẽso (also known as Buso), and Kui. There are four dialects of Kala. The three southern villages share a dialect with very minor differences found in the village of Kui while each of the northern villages has its own dialect. Linguistically, Kala belongs to the [[North Huon Gulf languages]] and Kala-speakers appear to have arrived on the southern coast of the Gulf relatively recently, beginning perhaps as late as the 17th century (Bradshaw 1997).

== Phonology ==
Kala has five basic vowels (listed below), as well as contrastive nasal vowels.

The voiced alveolar fricative [z] only exists in the dialects spoken in Apoze and Lambu villages.

In 2010, anthropologists from the University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus, worked in a collaborative project with the Kala Language Committee, a group of individuals concerned with strengthening Kala language amongst their communities, to decide on a Kala orthographic system. The practical writing system for Kala includes the following letters: a, ã, b, d, e, ẽ, g, i, ĩ, k, l, m, n, ŋ, o, õ, p, s, t, u, ũ, w, y, z. The committee chose the tilda symbol to represent nasal vowels in their practical writing system as it reminded them of ocean waves (called titi in Kala) since they are coastal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/wll.18.1.08sch/details|title=Mobile Menu|website=benjamins.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most of the languages around the Huon Gulf, Kala has a system of birth-order names (Holzknecht 1989: 43-45, Devolder et al 2012). Each dialect has their own terms for birth-order names. Compare [[Numbami language|Numbami]].

== Dialects ==
Kala is spoken in six villages along the Huon Gulf, and as such is split into different dialects. The most significant differences, which are phonological and lexical, exist between the northernmost three villages and the southernmost, however, differences also exist between the individual villages, especially for Manindala (Kela) in the north. This dialect contains syllable codas, which no other dialect shows. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/796918846|title=Kala kana bi na kapia : diksineri bilong Tok ples Kala (Kala dictionary)|others=Wagner, John, 1949-, Schreyer, Christine, 1979-, DeVolder, Chara, 1989-, University of British Columbia.

'''Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao''' (28 October 1909 – 17 August 1980), also known as '''Ko Ku''', was an exponent of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] literature in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kutumba Rao, Kodavatiganti: ''Sundaram learns''. [[Sahitya Akademi]], 1998. {{ISBN|978-81-260-0059-3}}. p. 1-16 (introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that literature which criticises and enriches human life and ultimately reforms the human thought of its time is the only relevant form of literature.

== Life ==
Kodavatiganti Kutumbarao was born in to a middle-class family in [[Tenali]], [[Guntur|Guntur district]]. His schooling until 1925 was in Tenali. He lost his father in 1914 and his mother in 1920, and grew up with his uncle.  He was very familiar with village life.

His elder brother Venkatasubbiah (out of touch since 1921) was a poet-writer and he was introduced to the literary community early through him. He was introduced to western literature too during this time. His early experiments, at the age of thirteen, included an unfinished thriller and poetry, which he would soon abandon. He married eleven-year-old Padmavati in 1924, before he graduated from high school.

After Intermediate education (1925 to 1927) at [[Andhra-Christian College|A C college]], [[Guntur]], he studied for Bachelors Physics at [[Vijayanagaram]] Maharajah college. He started his serious attempts in writing during this time. Towards the end of his undergraduate education, he also became an [[atheist]]. He went to the [[Benaras Hindu University]] for his Masters in Physics. During this time, he published his first works: an essay called ''Cinema'' (1930) in the oriental weekly and ''Pranadhikam'' (1931), which won him the first prize in ''Gruhalakshmi''. His masters was cut short in the second year due to the economic depression.

Later, he worked in several places from [[Shimla]] to [[Bombay]] to [[Madras]], in such positions as a clerk, teacher, factory foreman and a film writer (including music direction for a film), before settling down in the field of journalism. After a stint in some papers, a few of which he founded himself, he was with ''[[Chandamama]]'', a popular children's magazine, as its editor in 1952 until he died in 1980.

The era when he was born and grown was the time when there were reforms in Telugu society and also in India. His elder brother Kodavatiganti Venkatasubbaya was also a great essayist, and was also a member of ''''Sahiti Samiti'''' because of which he was familiar with literature.

== Philosophy ==
Kodavatiganti Kutumbarao believed in the power of scientific method and materialism in solving the problems of humanity. The essence of his thought may be seen in a short story published in 1942 with the title, 'God and Satan'. &lt;ref&gt; Pages 530 to 533, Kutumbarao Sahityam,Volume 6, published Vishalandhra Publishing House, Hyderabad, February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==

*The 'attempts' to save people from literature, literature from politics and politics from people amuse me much
*It is foolish to say that only the politicians, but not the artists, have the right to express themselves clear opinions on dictators, unemployment, lock-outs, wars, etc. Exploitation-mongers encourage such stupidity
*That which cannot reveal the secrets of nature is no science; that which cannot alleviate the drudgery of life is no 'invention'; that which cannot illuminate every nook and corner of life is no literature
*We need to create our literature for our own times ... Fixation to the literary standards of the bygone ages is nothing but deceit

'''Maithili Sharan Gupt''' (3 August 1886 – 12 December 1964) was one of the most important modern [[Hindi]] poets.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-04/nagpur/28157631_1_premchand-hindi-literature-anthropologists&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one among the pioneers of ''[[Khariboli|Khari Boli]]'' (plain dialect) poetry and wrote in [[Khari Boli]] dialect, at a time when most Hindi poets favoured the use of [[Braj Bhasha]] dialect.&lt;ref name="SnellRaeside1998"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Rupert Snell | author2=Ian Raeside | title=Classics of Modern South Asian Literature | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9KbhnDC6FAC&amp;pg=PA240 | accessdate=26 June 2012 | year=1998 | publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag | isbn=978-3-447-04058-7 | pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a recipient of the third highest (then second highest) Indian civilian honour of [[Padma Bhushan]].&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his book Bharat-Bharati (1912),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jagran.com/sahitya/literary-works-3283.html राष्ट्रकवि व उनकी भारत भारती, जागरण, Oct 15, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; widely quoted during India's freedom struggle, he was given the title of Rashtra Kavi by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Chirgaon]], [[Jhansi]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] in the Kankane clan of the [[Gahoi]] community in a family that was once a wealthy zamidar family, but the wealth was lost by the time he was born.&lt;ref&gt;Shri hargovind, "Dadda Ki Chhaya Me", in Raashhtarkavi Maithiliisharana Gupt Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Agravaal Vaasudevasharana, 1959, Raashhtarkavi Maithiliisharana Gupt Abhinandan Committee Calcutta, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Seth Ramcharan Gupta and mother's name was Kashibai. He disliked school as a child, so his father arranged for his education at their home. As a child, Gupt studied [[Sanskrit]], [[English language|English]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. [[Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi]] was his mentor. He married in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Rishi jaimini Kaushik Barua,, "Ikhattara Varshon ki Abhinandaniya Gatha", in Raashhtarkavi Maithiliisharana Gupt Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Agravaal Vaasudevasharana, 1959, Raashhtarkavi Maithiliisharana Gupt Abhinandan Committee Calcutta, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the teacher of Dewan Shatrughan Singh(Bundelkhandi Royal), who is known as Bundelkhand Kesri &amp; Bundelkhand Gandhi.

=== Literary works ===
Gupt entered the world of Hindi literature by writing poems in various magazines, including ''[[Saraswati (magazine)|Saraswati]]''.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} In 1910, his first major work, ''Rang mein Bhang'' was published by Indian Press. With ''Bharat Bharati'', his nationalist poems became popular among Indians, who were struggling for independence. Most of his poems revolve around plots from [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Buddhist]] stories and the lives of famous religious leaders.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} His famous work ''Saket'' revolves around [[Urmila (Ramayana)|Urmila]], wife of [[Lakshmana]], from [[Ramayana]], while another of his works ''Yashodhara'' revolves around [[Yashodhara]], the wife of [[Gautama Buddha]].{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}}

प्राण न पागल हो तुम यों, पृथ्वी पर वह प्रेम कहाँ..

मोहमयी छलना भर है, भटको न अहो अब और यहाँ..

ऊपर को निरखो अब तो बस मिलता है चिरमेल वहाँ..

=== Public office ===
After India became independent in 1947, he was also made an honorary member of the [[Rajya Sabha]], where he used poetry to put his opinions before the other members. He remained a member of the Rajya Sabha till his death in 1964. He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1954.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Creative style ===

His works are based along patriotic themes, among others poets such as [[Ramdhari Singh Dinkar]] and [[Makhanlal Chaturvedi]]. His poetry is characterized by non-rhyming couplets in Khadi Boli. Although the couplet structure is non rhyming, the prominent use of [[alliterations]] lends a rhythmic backdrop due to the rhythmic alterations between vowels and consonants. He was a religious man, and this can be seen in his works.

* ''Rang mein Bhang'

'''Nivaclé''' is a [[Matacoan languages|Matacoan]] language spoken in [[Paraguay]] and  in [[Argentina]] by the [[Nivaclé]]. It is also known as Chulupí and Ashluslay, and in older sources has been called Ashluslé, Suhin, Sujín, Chunupí, Churupí, Choropí, and other variant spellings of these names. Nivaclé speakers are found in the Chaco, in Paraguay in [[Presidente Hayes Department]], and [[Boquerón Department]], and in Argentina in [[Salta Province]].

Nivaclé is complex both in its phonology and morphology. Much of what is handled in syntactic constructions in many other languages is signalled in Nivaclé by its rich bound morphology and clitics. Nivaclé has several linguistic traits that are rare elsewhere in the world or even unique.

== Phonology ==
Its phonemic inventory has 21 ''consonants'' and 6 ''vowels'', including glottalized (ejective) stops and affricates, and a unique phoneme, /k͡l/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|last2=Grondona|first2=Verónica|date=2012|title=Linguistic Acculturation in Nivaclé and Chorote|jstor=10.1086/665672|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=78|issue=3|pages=335–367|doi=10.1086/665672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within single syllables the Nivaclé consonant cluster /tš/ (orthographic &lt;tsh&gt;, IPA cluster /t+ʃ/) contrasts with the alveopalatal affricate /č/ (orthrographic &lt;ch&gt;, IPA /tʃ/), and the cluster /t+s/ contrasts with the alveolar affricate /ts/, both across morpheme boundaries and within single morphemes – this is unusual cross-linguistically.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Morphology ==

=== Word order ===
The basic ''word order'' (constituent order) is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), or, in the different formulation used by some, AVO (A = subject of transitive verb or ‘agent’, V = verb, O = object of transitive verb), though other orders are possible in less neutral contexts. It also has the basic orders GN (Genitive-Noun, that is, possessor-possessed), NA (Noun-Adjective), and NP-Rel (Head Noun-Relative Clause). It has few adpositions (prepositions or postpositions); rather these relational and locative functions are signaled by a rich set of suffixes and clitics attached primarily to verbs, but also to other parts of speech; it also has some relational nouns (possessed noun constructions that function as adpositions). The co-occurrence in a language of the orders SVO, NA, GN, and NP-Rel is somewhat unusual for a language with SVO basic word order typology, where NG (Noun + Genitive) would be the expected order, rather than Nivaclé’s GN. SVO languages also tend to have Preposition-Noun order, too, though prepositions are mostly lacking in this language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nouns ===
The main grammatical categories (parts of speech, lexical categories) of Nivaclé are noun, pronoun, demonstrative, adjective, adverb, and verb. There are significant syntactic and morphological differences in the behavior of several of these grammatical categories which distinguish them from similar categories in well-known European languages. Clitics are frequent in this language.

There is a masculine-feminine ''gender'' contrast in nouns, semantically determined for some nouns that refer to humans and certain animals, but otherwise arbitrary for most other nouns. However, the nouns themselves, in spite of their gender, generally bear no overt indication of gender assignment. This is signaled rather in the demonstratives which accompany the nouns and which agree with the gender of the noun. Also the plural markers that nouns bear differ depending on whether the noun is masculine or feminine. There are several different ''plural'' markers, a complex system.

The ''demonstrative'' (deictic) system is also complex, with numerous demonstratives which are distinguished according to several semantic traits, sensitive to whether the referent is visible or not, was witnessed previously by the speaker, is known only from reports or hearsay, or no longer exists. As mentioned, these contrasting semantic traits of the demonstratives play a role in inferring the ''tense'' of an utterance. For example, if a referent is visible, then by inference it is present, in present time; if it was witnessed earlier but is not currently visible, then typically by inference it is past.

''Evidentiality'' is also inferred from the semantic traits of the demonstratives. For example, if a speaker uses a ‘visible’ demonstrative, by inference this also indicates that he/she vouches for the truth value of the statement, for the reality of the entity modified by this demonstrative, because the speaker knows it from witnessing it. If, on the other hand, a demonstrative that indicates ‘known only by report or hearsay’ is employed, by inference this part of the utterance has the evidential sense that the speaker does not affirm the truth of what is said, but rather only reports it as something told by others and not known from personal experience. Evidentiality from demonstratives interacts with other discourse evidential markers, one word for things reported but not known and another for expressing doubt, uncertainty about the truth of an utterance. This carries over to multi-clause utterances, where subordinate clauses can contrast with regard to the conjunction that introduces them and in terms of the subject agreement markers they can take, where some are treated as real (events known to have happened or to be going to happen) and others are irrealis (things that have not happened but are hypothetical or doubtful).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Verbs ===
''Verbs'' in this language are very complex and can bear many different affixes and clitics. Nevertheless, there are no direct grammatical markers on verbs nor elsewhere in the grammar for ''tense'' or ''aspect''. The senses of tense are conveyed by the demonstratives whose semantic contrasts give temporal inferences. Nivaclé is, thus, one of the few languages of the world which have ''nominal tense'' with no verbal tense marking.

The ''verb'' ''alignment'' is ''active-stative'' – there are two series of pronominal affixes on verbs, one that indicates subjects of active verbs which report events or happenings, whether they are transitive or intransitive, and another which signals both the object of transitive verbs and also the subject of stative intransitive verbs, verbs which refer to states and not to events or happenings, as the active verbs do. Indicative, negative, and irrealis verbs have distinct morphological markings of their own for personal pronoun subject agreement. There is also distinct morphology signaling verbs of subordinate clauses.

Nivaclé distinguishes first person plural ''inclusive'' (‘we all’, ‘our [our (all)]’) and ''exclusive'' (‘we’ [I/we and other(s), but not including you], ‘ours’ [but not including yours]) in pronouns, in possessive morphology and in verbs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nivaclé has a very rich system of ''directional'' affixes and clitics, marked primarily on the verbs, sometimes on other parts of speech. As mentioned, Nivaclé generally lacks adpositions (prepositions and postpositions), as the directional affixes and clitics fulfill the roles played by adpositions in other languages. The language has a genitive noun classifier for possessed domestic animals and another for possessed prey (hunted animals). For example, it is not possible to say directly the equivalent of ''my horse'', but rather it is necessary to say the equivalent of ''my-domestic.animal.classifier horse''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Campbell, Lyle, Luis Díaz, and Fernando Ángel. 2017.

Traditionally an '''oath''' (from [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''{{lang|ang|[[:wikt:að|āð]]}}'', also called '''plight''') is either a [[utterance|statement]] of [[fact]] or a [[promise]] with wording relating to something considered [[sacred]] as a sign of verity. A common legal substitute for those who conscientiously object to making sacred oaths is to give an [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead. Nowadays, even when there is no notion of sanctity involved, certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths. "To [[:wikt:swear|swear]]" is a [[verb]] used to describe the taking of an oath, to making a solemn [[vow]].

==Divine oath==
Usually oaths have referred to a [[deity]] significant in the cultural sphere in question. The reciter's personal views upon the divinity of the aspects considered sacred in a predictated text of an oath may or may not be taken in to account. There might not be alternative personal proclamations with no mention of the sacred [[dogma]] in question, such as affirmations, to be made. This might mean an [[impasse]] to those with unwillingness to edify the dogma they see as untrue and those who decline to refer to sacred matters on the subject at hand.

The essence of a divine oath is an invocation of divine agency to be a guarantor of the oath taker's own honesty and integrity in the matter under question. By implication, this invokes divine displeasure if the oath taker fails in their sworn duties. It therefore implies greater care than usual in the act of the performance of one's duty, such as in testimony to the facts of the matter in a court of law.

A person taking an oath indicates this in a number of ways. The most usual is the explicit "I swear", but any statement or promise that includes "with * as my witness" or "so help me *", with '*' being something or someone the oath-taker holds sacred, is an oath. Many people take an oath by holding in their hand or placing over their head a book of [[scripture]] or a sacred object, thus indicating the sacred witness through their action: such an oath is called ''corporal''. However, the chief purpose of such an act is for ceremony or solemnity, and the act does not of itself make an oath.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Historical development as a legal concept==
Making vows and taking oaths became a symbolic concept in law practice that developed over time in different cultures.

=== Jewish tradition ===
The concept of oaths is deeply rooted within [[Judaism]]. It is found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:21, when God swears that he will "never again curse the ground because of man and never again smite every living thing". This repetition of the term ''never again'' is explained by [[Rashi]], the pre-eminent biblical commentator, as serving as an oath, citing the [[Talmud]] Shavous 36a for this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Metsudah Chumash and Rashi, KTAV Publishing House, 1991. page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The first personage in the biblical tradition to take an oath is held to be [[Eliezer]], the chief servant of [[Abraham]], when the latter requested of the former that he not take a wife for his son [[Isaac]] from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from among Abraham's own family.

The foundational text for oath making is in  [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 30:2: "When a man voweth a vow unto the Lord, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth." According to the Rabbis, a [[neder]] (usually translated as "vow") refers to the object, a ''shâmar'' (usually translated as "oath") to the person. The passage distinguishes between a ''neder'' and a ''shvua'', an important distinction between the two in [[Halakha]]: a ''neder'' changes the status of some external thing, while a ''shvua'' initiates an internal change in the one who swears the oath.

=== Roman tradition ===
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition, oaths were sworn upon ''[[Iuppiter Lapis]]'' or the Jupiter Stone located in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]], [[Capitoline Hill]]. ''Iuppiter Lapis'' was held in the Roman tradition to be an [[Oath Stone]], an aspect of Jupiter in his role as divine law-maker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office.

According to Cyril Bailey, in "The Religion of Ancient Rome" (1907):

{{Quote| text=We have, for instance, the sacred stone (''[[Silex#Archaic and foreign uses|silex]]'') which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the Capitol, and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of treaty-making. The [[fetial]], who on that occasion represented the Roman people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the sacrificial pig with the ''silex'', saying as he did so, "Do thou, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Diespiter]], strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day, and strike them the more, as thou art greater and stronger." Here no doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin the stone is itself the god, an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially used in this connection, ''Iuppiter Lapis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Cyril |date=1907 |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm#CHAPTER_II |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. |page=7 |access-date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The punisher of broken oaths was the [[Hell|infernal]] deity [[Orcus]].

=== Greek tradition ===
[[Walter Burkert]] has shown that since [[Lycurgus of Athens]] (d. 324 BCE), who held that "it is the oath which holds democracy together", religion, morality and political organization had been linked by the oath, and the oath and its prerequisite altar had become the basis of both civil and criminal, as well as international law.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', trans. Raffan, Harvard University Press (1985), 250ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian tradition===

Various religious groups have objected to the taking of oaths, most notably the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups, like [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Hutterite]]s and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]. This is principally based on {{Bibleverse||Matthew|5:34–37}}, the [[Antithesis of the Law]]. Here, Christ is written to say "I say to you: '[[Swear not at all]]{{'"}}. [[James the Just]] stated in {{Bibleverse|James|5:12}}, "Above all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your 'Yes' be yes, and your 'No', no, or you will be condemned." Beyond this scriptural authority, Quakers place importance on being truthful at all times, so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that "taking legal oaths implies a double standard of truthfulness"&lt;ref&gt;Faith and Practice of Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (1988) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important.

Not all [[Christianity|Christians]] interpret this reading as forbidding all types of oaths, however. Opposition to oath-taking among some groups of Christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history. [[Quaker]]s were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear [[loyalty oath]]s. Testifying in court was also difficult; [[George Fox]], Quakers' founder, famously challenged a judge who had asked him to swear, saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any [[Bible]] passage where Jesus or his apostles took oaths. (The judge could not, but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment.) Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the [[United Kingdom]] now has the right to make a solemn [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead of an oath. The [[United States]] has permitted affirmations since it was founded; it is explicitly mentioned in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. Only President [[Franklin Pierce]] has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration.

As late as 1880, [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was denied a seat as an MP in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] because of his professed [[atheism]] as he was judged unable to swear the [[Oath of Allegiance (UK)|Oath of Allegiance]] in spite of his proposal to swear the oath as a "matter of form".

=== Islam ===
Islam takes the fulfillment of oaths extremely seriously.
{{quote|God does not hold you responsible for the mere utterance of oaths; He holds you responsible for your actual intentions. If you violate an oath, you shall atone by feeding ten poor people from the same food you offer to your own family, or clothing them, or by freeing a slave. If you cannot afford this, then you shall fast three days. This is the atonement for violating the oaths that you swore to keep. You shall fulfill your oaths. God thus explains His revelations to you, that you may be appreciative.|Quran Chapter 5: Verse 89}}

=== Germanic tradition ===
{{Further|Symbel|Feudalism}}
[[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] [[warrior culture]] was significantly based on oaths of fealty.

A prose passage inserted in the eddic poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'' relates:
Hedin was coming home alone from the forest one [[Yule]]-eve, and found a [[troll]]-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hedin for his company. "Nay," said he. She said, "Thou shalt pay for this at the ''bragarfull''." That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the ''bragarfull''. Hedin vowed that he would have Sváva, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

Such Norse traditions are directly parallel to the "bird oaths" of late medieval France, such as the [[voeux du faisan]] (oath on the pheasant) or the (fictional) [[voeux du paon]] (oath on the peacock).

=== Modern law ===
{{redirect|Under oath|the American rock band|Underoath}}
In the modern law, oaths are made by a witness to a court of law before giving testimony and usually by a newly appointed government officer to the people of a state before taking office. 

However, in both of those cases, an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] can usually be replaced with a written statement, only if the author swears the statement is true. This statement is called an ''[[affidavit]]''. 

The oath given to support an affidavit is frequently administered by a [[notary]], who will certify the giving of the oath by affixing her or his seal to the document. Willfully delivering a false oath (or affirmation) is the crime of [[perjury]]. 

There are some places where there is a confusion between the "oath" and other statements or promises. For example, the current [[Olympic Oath]] is really a [[Promise|pledge]], not properly an oath, since there is only a promise but there is no appeal to a sacred witness.

Oaths may also be confused with [[vow]]s, but vows are really just a special kind of an oath.

Instead of, or in addition to, holding one's hand upon an object of ceremonial importance, it can be customary for a person swearing an oath to hold a raised hand in a specific gesture. Most often the right hand is raised. This custom has been explained with reference to medieval practices of branding palms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=454360]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''public switched telephone network''' ('''PSTN''') is the aggregate of the world's circuit-switched [[telephone]] networks that are operated by national, regional, or local [[telephony]] operators, providing [[Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] and services for public [[telecommunication]]. The PSTN consists of [[telephone line]]s, [[fiber optic cable]]s, [[microwave transmission]] links, [[cellular network]]s, [[communications satellite]]s, and [[Undersea cable|undersea telephone cables]], all interconnected by [[switching center]]s, thus allowing most telephones to communicate with each other. Originally a network of fixed-line [[analog signal|analog]] telephone systems, the PSTN is now almost entirely [[Digital data|digital]] in its [[core network]] and includes [[Mobile phone|mobile]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and other networks, as well as fixed telephones.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/public-switched-telephone-networks_b_2377773.html | title=What Are the Public Switched Telephone Networks, 'PSTN' and Why You Should Care? | publisher=Huffington Post Blog | date=7 January 2013 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Kushnick, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical operation of the PSTN adheres to the standards created by the [[ITU-T]]. These standards allow different networks in different countries to [[interconnection|interconnect]] seamlessly. The [[E.163]] and [[E.164]] standards provide a single global [[address space]] for telephone numbers. The combination of the interconnected networks and the single [[numbering plan]] allow telephones around the world to dial each other.

==History==
Commercialization of the telephone began in 1876, with instruments operated in pairs for private use between two locations. Users who wanted to communicate with persons at multiple locations had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. Alerting another user of the desire to establish a [[telephone call]] was accomplished by whistling loudly into the transmitter until the other party heard the alert. Bells were soon added to stations for [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]], so an attendant no longer needed to wait for the whistle.

Later telephones took advantage of the exchange principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a [[telephone exchange]] established for a town or area. For communications outside this exchange area, [[trunking|trunks]] were installed between exchanges. Networks were designed in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents and oceans.

Automation introduced [[pulse dial]]ing between the telephone and the exchange, so that each subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected to the same exchange, but [[long distance calling]] across multiple exchanges required manual switching by operators. Later, more sophisticated address signaling, including [[multi-frequency]] signaling methods, enabled direct-dialed long distance calls by subscribers, culminating in the [[Signalling System 7]] (SS7) network that controlled calls between most exchanges by the end of the 20th century.

The growth of the PSTN meant that [[teletraffic engineering]] techniques needed to be deployed to deliver [[quality of service]] (QoS) guarantees for the users. The work of [[Agner Krarup Erlang|A. K. Erlang]] established the mathematical foundations of methods required to determine the capacity requirements and configuration of equipment and the number of personnel required to deliver a specific level of service.

In the 1970s, the telecommunications industry began implementing [[packet switched network|packet-switched network]] data services using the [[X.25]] protocol transported over much of the end-to-end equipment as was already in use in the PSTN.

In the 1980s, the industry began planning for digital services assuming they would follow much the same pattern as voice services, and conceived end-to-end circuit-switched services, known as the [[Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network]] (B-ISDN). The B-ISDN vision was overtaken by the [[disruptive technology]] of the Internet.

At the turn of the 21st century, the oldest parts of the telephone network still use analog technology for the [[last mile]] [[local loop|loop]] to the end user. However, digital technologies such as [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]], [[ISDN]], [[Fiber to the x|FTTx]], and [[cable modems]] have become more common in this portion of the network.

Several large private telephone networks are not linked to the PSTN, usually for military purposes. There are also private networks run by large companies which are linked to the PSTN only through limited [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], such as a large [[private branch exchange]] (PBX).

== Operators ==
The task of building the networks and selling services to customers fell to the [[telephone company|network operators]]. The first company to be incorporated to provide PSTN services was the [[Bell Telephone Company]] in the United States.

In some countries, however, the job of providing telephone networks fell to government as the investment required was very large and the provision of telephone service was increasingly becoming an essential [[public utility]]. For example, the [[General Post Office]] in the United Kingdom brought together a number of private companies to form a single [[state ownership|nationalized company]]. In more recent decades, these state monopolies were broken up or sold off through [[privatization]].{{clarify|date=April 2014}}{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Regulation ==
In most countries, the central has a [[regulatory agency|regulator]] dedicated to monitoring the provision of PSTN services in that country. Their tasks may be for example to ensure that end customers are not over-charged for services where monopolies may exist. These regulatory agencies may also regulate the prices charged between the operators to [[interconnection|carry each other's traffic]].

==Technology==
=== Network topology ===
[[Cellular Network routing]]{{main|PSTN network topology}}
The PSTN network architecture had to evolve over the years to support increasing numbers of subscribers, calls, connections to other countries, direct dialing and so on. The model developed by the United States and Canada was adopted by other nations, with adaptations for local markets.

The original concept was that the [[telephone exchange]]s are arranged into hierarchies, so that if a call cannot be handled in a local cluster, it is passed to one higher up for onward routing. This reduced the number of connecting trunks required between operators over long distances and also kept local traffic separate.

However, in modern networks the cost of transmission and equipment is lower and, although hierarchies still exist, they are much flatter, with perhaps only two layers.

===Digital channels===
Most automated [[telephone exchange]]s use digital switching rather than mechanical or analog switching. The [[circuit switched|trunks]] connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog [[two-wire circuit]]s are still used to connect the [[last mile]] from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the [[local loop]]). To carry a typical phone call from a [[calling party]] to a [[called party]], the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sample rate]] with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear [[pulse code modulation]] known as [[G.711]]. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]]) between the telephone exchanges under an overall [[routing in the PSTN|routing strategy]].

The call is carried over the PSTN using a 64 [[kbit/s]] channel, originally designed by [[Bell Labs]]. The name given to this channel is [[Digital Signal 0]] (DS0). The DS0 circuit is the basic granularity of [[circuit switching]] in a telephone exchange. A DS0 is also known as a [[timeslot]] because DS0s are aggregated in [[time-division multiplexing]] (TDM) equipment to form higher capacity communication links.

A [[Digital Signal 1]] (DS1) circuit carries 24 DS0s on a North American or Japanese [[T-carrier]] (T1) line, or 32 DS0s (30 for calls plus two for framing and signaling) on an [[E-carrier]] (E1) line used in most other countries. In modern networks, the multiplexing function is moved as close to the end user as possible, usually into cabinets at the roadside in residential areas, or into large business premises.

These aggregated circuits are conveyed from the initial multiplexer to the exchange over a set of equipment collectively known as the [[access network]]. The access network and inter-exchange transport use [[synchronization|synchronous]] optical transmission, for example, [[SONET]] and [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy]] (SDH) technologies, although some parts still use the older [[Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy|PDH]] technology.

Within the access network, there are a number of reference points defined. Most of these are of interest mainly to [[ISDN]] but one – the [[V reference point]] – is of more general interest. This is the reference point between a primary multiplexer and an exchange. The protocols at this reference point were standardized in [[ETSI]] areas as the [[V5 interface]].

===Impact on IP standards===
Voice quality over PSTN networks was used as the benchmark for the development of the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]]'s TIA-TSB-116 standard on voice-quality recommendations for IP telephony, to determine acceptable levels of audio delay and echo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?item_s_key=00381377 |title=TIA TSB-116 |publisher=Global.ihs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reang''' are one of the 21 [[adivasi|scheduled tribes]] of the Indian state of [[Tripura]]. The Bru can be found all over the Tripura state in India. However, they may also be found in [[Mizoram]], Assam, [[Manipur]] and They speak the Reang dialect of [[Kokborok]] language which is of [[Tibeto-Burman language|Tibeto-Burmese]] origin and is locally referred to as '''Kau Bru'''. 

Recently, following the Union Home Ministry's decision to give voting rights to around 30,000 people who had fled from Mizoram to Tripura in 1997 in the wake of inter-community violence, The Election Commission has asked the State of Mizoram to revise its rolls for the poll this year and include the members of the internally-displaced community. As many as 32,876 people of the Reang tribe (known in Mizoram as Brus) are set to be repatriated to Mizoram after a tripartite agreement was signed between the Centre, Tripura and Mizoram. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bru people to get voting rights: Ministry |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bru-people-to-get-voting-rights-ministry/article24334042.ece |accessdate=5 July 2018 |publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The history of Bru (Reangs)==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The Bru are the second most populous tribe of Tripura after the Tripuris. According to the legend, a Tripuri prince who was once exiled by the King made his way, along with his followers, to the Mayani Thalang area of [[Lushai hills]] and founded a state over there. He proclaimed himself King and his descendants too ruled over the break-away state for generations. As it sometimes happens, there came a time when there was no heir to succeed to the throne, leading to anarchy in the kingdom. At around the same time, bitter feud and internal vendetta saw four chiefs of the following sub tribes Twikluha, Yongsika, Paisika, Tuibruha leave their hearth and home along with their entourages to migrate back to the state of Tripura. It was a long and difficult journey, fraught with danger and the travellers had to make more than a couple of attempts before they successfully made their way up the Dombur hill.

At the time, Mahendra Manikya ruled the kingdom of Tripura. The chiefs made many attempts to reach the King to request asylum. They approached ministers, bureaucrats, and courtiers for help in arranging a meeting with the King but with no success. By this time, they had exhausted their supplies and were rather anxious to catch the attention of the King. Finally in desperation, they breached the dam on the river Gumti where worshippers had gathered for prayers. This was a serious crime and all of them were immediately apprehended and brought before the king. The crime was a serious one and merited capital punishment. But before the King could pass his judgement, the chiefs managed to send word to the Queen Gunoboti. They begged her for help and she persuaded the King to forgive them. The chiefs swore fealty to the Queen and to the throne of Tripura and settled down in the Kingdom. Popular legend has it that the Queen even offered the chiefs breast milk, to symbolise their new parent-child relationship, in a large brass pan which was given to the chiefs along with other valuable things, carefully preserved by Reangs to date.

===Historical population figures===
In 1971 the Reang were the second largest of the scheduled tribes in Tripura.  There were 64,722 people accounted for in the Reang tribe in Tripura that year.  In 1961 the Reang had numbered 56,597 and in 1951 they had numbered 8,471.&lt;ref&gt;Gan-Chaudhuri, Jagadis. ''Tripura: The Land and its People''. (Delhi: Leeladevi Publications, 1980) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2001 census, there were 165,103 Reang in Tripura.&lt;ref&gt;http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_tripura.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupation, culture and custom==

The Reangs are primarily an agrarian tribe. In the past, they mostly practised the '''Huk''' or '''Jhum cultivation''' like most other Tripuri tribes. However today, most of them have adopted modern agricultural practices. Educated reangs however shy away from agriculture and seek government jobs. Many occupy high posts in the bureaucracy and a few have even started their own businesses.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Marriage system===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The Reang are an endogamous tribe who have had very little contact with the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] or other sub-tribe of Tripura. Recently, however{{When|date=February 2011}} inter-tribe marriages and inter-caste wedding have taken place. The marriage system is similar to other Tripuri tribe of Tripura. There is no dowry system, but the bridegroom has to spend a period of two years in the (future) father-in-law's house for  before marriage is performed{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}. There are two types of marriages;
* Haloksai.
* Haloksam.

Marriages between close relatives are not frowned upon but are no longer as frequent.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Cross-cousin marriage among the Reang is accidental. Child marriage is not allowed and widow remarriage is permitted. Recent widows are required to wait a whole year before wearing any ornaments and both widows, as well as widowers, are mandated twelve months of mourning during which they are forbidden from any form of entertainment. Remarriage is only allowed after a year of mourning. Bru society today is monogamous.

Marriage is arranged through the matchmaker '''Andra''', who negotiates the bride price with the bride's parents. Marriage is settled to the satisfaction of both parties and performed by the Ochai. The marriage is celebrated simply but well in the '''Kausungmo''', where pork, [[fowl]], rice, rice beer are served. The marriage laws of the Reang are few but well defined. The Reang widower, for instance, is not permitted to marry a virgin.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The marriage bond is very strong and men cannot divorce without the consent of their wives. If any Reang is accused of extramarital relationships and the accusations are proved true, a strict punishment and a heavy penalty is imposed on both parties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Dress and ornaments===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Like the other Tripuri, the traditional dress of the Reang is simple and plain. Men traditionally wear a hand woven loin cloth and a piece of cloth as a wrapper for the upper body. The women wear a long cloth called [[Mnai]], a wraparound; from the waist to down to the knees, a [[Rsa (garment)|Rsa]] covering the chest, and '''Rikatouh''' for covering the whole upper half of the body. The fabric is usually woven by the Reang women and very colourful. However modernisation has caught up with the Bru and most urban Reang no longer wear their traditional costumes.

The Reang women are very fond of personal adornment and, like other Tripuris, favour ornaments, flowers, and cosmetics. Silver ornaments, especially the necklace of silver coins, the '''Rangbauh''' have a pride of place and bestow high status.

===Dance and music===
Dance is an integral part of Reang life. The Hojagiri folk dance of Reang sub tribe is rather well known all over the world. 'Buisu', not 'bihu' is the most popular festival of reang tribes, naisingpara hojagiri group is the most popular groups all among 
them, late maniram reang is the founder of naisingpara hojagiri dance group.
hojagiri is more popular in tripura than other states.

===Customs===
Most of the disputed and differences are settled by the people of Kotor dofa, that is by the Rai and Kaskau of respective sub tribe. It is done through the customary law of the Reangs. Whenever a disputes arise in the between the member of the community, a meeting is called by the Rai. All relevant arguments are heard and then justice is done according to the principle of natural justice. Whatever verdict or punishment is pronounced in the judgment it is implemented with firm hand and payments of penalty etc. are made then and there.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Religious belief and practices==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The majority of the Reang belong to the [[Vaishnav]] school of [[Hinduism]] and claim [[Tripuri Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] status. A growing number of Christians, exists in both [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]].

Like other [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]] people, the Reang are polytheists and believe in multiple Gods and Goddesses. At the heart of the pantheon of divinities are the fourteen Gods and Goddess of Tripura. Their important festivals are the same those of prevailing in Tripura. These are Ker, Gonga Mwtai, Goria, Chitragupra, Hojagiri, Katangi Puja, Lampra Uathop. laxmi pooja is the very famous pooja, which is celebrate on karthik poornima, Religious observancse are community-based and every family in the clan or village must contribute their share of payment or tithe known locally as '''Khain'''.

All religious festivals are arranged during an annual meeting of chiefs. In such meetings political, social, and religious matters of importance are discussed and decided by the majority.

The deities of the Reangs are similar those of other Tripuri people. These are:
* ''Sibrai''', the supreme deity or '''Mtai Ktor'''
* '''Tuima''', the presiding deity of river,
* '''Mainouhma''', the goddess of paddy,
* '''Khuluhma''', the goddess of cotton,
* '''Goroia''', the god of wealth prosperity, well being, and war,
* '''Kalaia''', brother of Goria,
* '''Sangrongma''', Mother Earth,
* '''Hathaikchuma''', the goddess of the hills,
* '''Buraha''', the god of the jungle,
* '''Thuhnairou''', the god of death,
* '''Bonirou''', the god of evil spirits,
* '''Nouhsuma''', the goddess of households

===Worshipping of the deities===
The rituals of worship are similar to the mainstream Tripuri. An Ao'''kchai''' or priest performs all ceremonies aided by an assistant. A green bamboo pole is used to represent the deity. Different types of life stock such as fowl, pig, goat eggs, etc. are offered as sacrifice during worship. The place of worship is usually located at a distance from the main village. Offerings are dedicated in the names of the deities before the Wathop or green bamboo pole which represents the divine. However the Rangtouk and Nouhsuma pujas are held indoors inside the house only. Two earthen pots are filled with newly grown rice and at top of the pot some oval pebbles especially collected from huk are placed. The pebbles are called "Fortune stones". The pots ('''Rongtouh''') are decorated with the rice powder, vermilion, and garlands. Typically, one is named Mainouhgma while the other is called Khuluhgma.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Rituals on birth of a baby===
The birth of a baby is accompanied by many rituals. Several pujas like Kebengma, Abu suma, Khongkhonok kama,bachao kama, Mai tuma etc. are conducted for the welfare of the newborn. Fowl, prawns, and several leaves of trees are needed for these rituals. As the child grows up, a special form of worship has to be performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Bukhuksni the seven-guardian deities of witches are propriated with the sacrifice of a pig, four fowls, and other living beings.

===Ceremony on death===
The Reang use cremation to dispose of the mortal remains of the dead. Obsequies are performed in three stages: maibaumi, Broksakami and Kthuinaimo.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Brouhsaomo====
The corpse is first bathed with the '''Chobtui''' or "''alkali water/soap''", and '''Mairungtwi''' that is "''water obtained from the washing of raw rice''". After that it is dressed with new clean '''Rikatouh''', the head is dressed with another piece of rikatouh and wrapped just like headgear. In case of a female corpse, the rnai and rsa are used. A fowl is then sacrificed at the feet of the corpse. Later, an earthen pot filled with fish and rice placed at the feat of the deceased and it is followed by dance rituals through the night. Rice beer is distributed to all mourners except the family members of the deceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The next morning the body is placed on a pyre and cremated.

====Kthoinaimo====
'''Laotou''' or the deceased soul remains under the control of the '''Sisi Manji''' the son of Buraha, for a year and it is said that Sisi Manji is the protector of the soul. On the day of the Kathainaimi, the widow offers dried rice, meat, fish, fruits, and wine in the name of Laotau and Sisi Manji on the '''smangnouh''' and then takes the burnt bones or ashes to the '''charainouh'''. It is worshiped for over a period of one year or until the next hangrai, when it is immersed in any river or in Gomati River at Dumbur. 
In short the religious culture of the Reang is similar to that of other Tripuri of Tripura.

==Reang Refugees==

Since 1997, tens of thousands of Reangs are living as refugees in Tripura and Assam&lt;ref&gt;https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/living-in-camps-thousands-of-bruraeng-children-in-tripura-have-never-heard-of-school/1348536&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the number has declined (from 50,000 plus to 28,686 as of 2017) as a result of voluntary repatriation to Mizoram, extremely low birth rates (only 6,685 of the 28,686 refugees are below 18 years of age) and high death rates&lt;ref&gt;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Devising%20Pathways%20for%20Appropriate%20Repatriation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The Tripura government has acknowledged that among the refugees the number of deaths is more than the number of births (during 1997-00, there were a total of 1,595 births and 1,670 deaths)&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the Bru Refugee Committee, in 1997 a total of 35,822 individuals were living as refugees (out of them 6,166 being minors)&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The only organization which has provided support for the refugees is the [[Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram|Akhil Bharatiya Vanbasi Kalyan Ashram]]&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

Voting rights for Reang refugees are under threat, as the Mizo NGOs have constantly opposed their participation in the election process. Out of the 40 assembly constituencies, Reangs are a majority in two (50% in Mamit, 68% in Hachhek, 27% in Thorang), and in combination with the Chakmas (5% in Mamit, 30% in Thorang, 80% in West Tuipui and 98% in Tuichawng), they have a small chance to win one or more seats&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abplive.in/india-news/mizoram-assembly-elections-2018-bjp-asks-tripura-unit-to-woo-chakma-bru-voters-in-the-state-773435&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Saigon Sign Language''', also known as '''Ho Chi Minh City Sign Language''', is the [[deaf-community sign language]] of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon) in Vietnam. It is about 50% cognate with the other sign languages of Vietnam, and its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by the [[French Sign Language]] once taught in Vietnamese schools for the deaf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">'''Semantic prosody''', also '''discourse prosody''', describes the way in which certain seemingly neutral words can be perceived with positive or negative associations through frequent occurrences with particular [[collocation]]s. Similar to [[Prosody (linguistics)|linguistic prosody]].

An example given by [[John McHardy Sinclair|John Sinclair]] is the verb ''set in'', which has a negative prosody: e.g. ''rot'' (with negative associations) is a prime example of what is going to 'set in'.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Sinclair |first=John M. |year=1991 |title=Corpus, Concordance, Collocation |location=[[Oxford]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]] |isbn=0-19-437144-1 |chapter=Words and phrases |pages=70–75}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is the verb sense of ''cause'', which is also used mostly in a negative context (accident, catastrophe, etc.),&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, M. (1996) 'Text and Corpus Analysis'. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; though one can also say that something "caused happiness".&lt;ref&gt;Stefanowitsch, Anatol and [[Stefan Th. Gries]] (2003), 'Collostructions: Investigating the Interaction of Words and Constructions.' In: ''International Journal of Corpus Linguistics 8:2'',pp. 209-243.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, linguists have used [[corpus linguistics]] and [[concordancer|concordancing software]] to find many hidden associations that lend nonneutral connotation to the usual or majority perception of verbal expression.  The software is used to arrange [[Key Word in Context|key words in context]] from a corpus of several million words of naturally occurring text. The collocates can then be arranged alphabetically according to first or second word to the right or to the left. Using such a method, Elena Tognini-Bonelli (2001) found that the word ''largely'' occurred more frequently with negative words or expressions, while ''broadly'' appeared more frequently with positive ones. [[Lexicography|Lexicographers]] have often failed to allow for semantic prosody when defining a word, although with the recent development and increasing use of [[computer]]s, the field of corpus linguistics is now being combined with that of lexicography.

Tachylalia is a generic term for speaking fast, and does not need to coincide with other speech problems.  Tachylalia by itself is not considered a speech disorder.

Tachylalia may be exhibited as a single stream of rapid speech without [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and can be delivered quietly or mumbled.  Tachylalia can be simulated by stimulating the brain electronically.&lt;ref&gt;BÉRUBÉ, Louise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4047">'''Theomatics''' is a [[numerology|numerological]] study of the [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]]/[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] text of the [[Christian]] [[Bible]], based upon [[gematria]] and [[isopsephia]], by which its proponents claim to show the direct intervention of [[God]] in the writing of Christian scripture.

== Etymology ==
The term "theomatics" was coined by [[Del Washburn]] in 1976 as a [[portmanteau|combination]] of "[[Wiktionary:Θεός|Θεός]]" ("God") and "[[Wiktionary:mathematics|mathematics]]". Washburn wrote three books about theomatics&lt;ref&gt;The three books are:
*{{cite book|author=[[Jerry Lucas]] and Del Washburn|title=Theomatics: God's Best Kept Secret Revealed|year=1986|publisher=[[Stein &amp; Day]] Pub|isbn=0-8128-6017-9}}
*{{cite book|author=Del Washburn|title=Theomatics II : God's Best-Kept Secret Revealed|year=1994|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=0-8128-4023-2}}
*{{cite book|author=Del Washburn|title=The Original CODE in the BIBLE|year=1994|publisher=Madison Books|isbn=1-56833-115-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created a website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Del Washburn|url=http://www.theomatics.com/theomatics/whatis.html|title=What is Theomatics?|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; espousing the hypothesis.

== Methodology ==
Theomatics is not the same thing as [[Bible code]]; it uses an entirely different technique. The Bible code (also called ELS for Equidistant Letter Sequences) uses a letter skipping technique. Theomatics, on the other hand, is based on [[gematria]] and [[isopsephia]], systems which assign numerical values to letters in the ancient Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek alphabets.

== Controversy ==
An analysis and criticism of theomatics has been published by
Tim Hayes, previously under the pseudonym "A. B. Leever". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Tim|title=ABLEEVER|url=http://www.ableever.net/|accessdate=8 January 2014|quote="I am Tim Hayes, "a believer" in Jesus Christ, whom I know and love."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Tim|url=http://www.ableever.net/Apologetics/Theomatics/theomatics.html|title=Theomatics|accessdate=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German statistician, Kurt Fettelschoss, published an analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kurt Fettelschoss|url=http://www.theomatics.net/contents.html|title=Table of Contents|work=Theomatics|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that claims that "The observed quantity of theomatic hits is significantly not random".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kurt Fettelschoss |url=http://theomatics.net/cover.html |title=Cover letter |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=2006-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091625/http://theomatics.net/cover.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; A response to the findings was posted by Tim Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Tim|url=http://www.ableever.net/Apologetics/Theomatics/Theom-Lk15/Theom-Lk15-Response/theom-lk15-response.html|title=Response to Fettelschoss|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by [[Russell Glasser]], entitled "Theomatics Debunked",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Russell Glasser|url=http://www.apollowebworks.com/atheism/theomatics.html|title=Theomatics Debunked|accessdate=October 10, 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029130554/http://www.apollowebworks.com/atheism/theomatics.html|archivedate=October 29, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the same phenomenon in a secular text.

Washburn's website has a page entitled "Scientific Proof"&lt;ref name="proof"&gt;{{cite web | author=el Washburn|url=http://www.theomatics.com/theomatics/proof.html|title=Scientific Proof of the Discovery|accessdate=2005-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which discusses and responds to potential arguments against theomatics.

"Tillering" refers to the production of side shoots and is a property possessed by many species in the family [[Poaceae]]. This enables them to produce multiple stems (tillers) starting from the initial single seedling.  This ensures the formation of dense tufts and multiple seed heads. Tillering rates are heavily influenced by soil water status.  When soil moisture is low, grasses tend to develop more sparse and deep root systems (as opposed to dense, lateral systems).  Thus, in dry soils, tillering is inhibited: the lateral nature of tillering is not supported by lateral root growth.

It aims "to call attention to the continued violence, discrimination and institutionalization of our people [Trans and Gender Non-Conforming people], while simultaneously lifting up and celebrating our legacy of resilience, organizing, and community building."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alp.org/decade-resistance-ten-year-anniversary-statement|title=A Decade of Resistance; Ten Year Anniversary Statement  {{!}} Audre Lorde Project|website=alp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While addressing issues that disproportionately impact trans and gender non-conforming people, TDOA is also meant to honor and contribute to the broader "struggle for justice, liberation, and recognition for all oppressed people worldwide."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In its first year, TDOA drew over 1,000 participants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The 2016 event gathered 2,000 attendees in Washington Square, and included speakers such as Olympia Perez of the Audre Lorde Project, Jennifer Louise Lopez of Everything Transgender in NYC, and [[Jennicet Gutiérrez]] of Familia Trans Queer Liberation Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gaycitynews.nyc/trans-day-action-old-time-radical-feel/|title=Trans Day of Action With Old-Time Radical Feel|last=Humm|first=Andy|date=July 7, 2016|work=Gay City News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TDOA is supported by a range of organizations, including SALGA (South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association) and GLAAD (formerly the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=South Asian-Americans Join Gay Pride Parade In Great Numbers|last=Dutt|first=Ela|date=July 10, 2015|work=News India Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.glaad.org/blog/nyc-join-audre-lorde-project-11th-annual-trans-day-action-friday|title=NYC: Join the Audre Lorde Project at the 11th annual Trans Day of Action this Friday|last=|first=|date=2015-06-24|work=GLAAD|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event is highly intersectional, as "TGNC communities include communities of color, immigrants, youth, elders, rural communities, and differently abled communities... as TGNC communities of color, we view our struggles as one and the same as broader struggles for social justice domestically and directly connected—if not the same as—struggles for social justice globally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayashi|first=Kris|year=2008|title=Stepping Back, Looking Outward: Situating Transgender Activism and Transgender Studies|url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu|journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy|volume=5|pages=97|via=ProQuest|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205191708/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilfred Melville Bennetto''' (1902–1994) was a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] poet and novelist.

He was elected a member of [[Gorseth Kernow]] under the [[Bardic name]] of ''Abransek'' ('Bushy-browed One') in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/archives/newbards/bard1960s.htm List of bards by decade - 1960s on Gorseth website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

His poetry celebrated popular contemporary figures in Cornish life as well as the historical and mythological characters favoured in Cornish poetry at the time. He wrote ''An Gurun Wosek a Geltya'' ('The Bloody Crown of Celtia'), the first full-length novel in [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. It is written from a monarchist perspective, it is a romantic thriller set against the background of contemporary subversion and conflict in the Celtic countries.

After graduating from [[Oberlin College]] (as [[valedictorian]]) in 1862,&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt; he attended the [[Albany Law School]]&lt;ref name=Goss/&gt; and subsequently served as [[city solicitor]] of [[Lima, Ohio]],&lt;ref name=Goss/&gt; and, from 1871 to 1873,&lt;ref name=Hand&gt;[http://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/citywiseblog/brothel-not-brothel-legal-niceties-debated-cincinnati-courtrooms/ “When Is A Brothel Not a Brothel?” And Other Legal Niceties Debated In Cincinnati Courtrooms], by Greg Hand, in ''Cincinnati Magazine''; published October 20, 2016; retrieved September 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as [[prosecuting attorney]] of [[Hamilton County, Ohio]];&lt;ref name=Goss/&gt; after his term as prosecutor ended, he never ran for office again.&lt;ref name=Hand/&gt;

In 1870 he married Mary Eliza Gunckel.

In 1876, he played a role in the disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|presidential election]], traveling to Florida, where he convinced electoral officers to reject votes from two pro-[[Samuel Tilden|Tilden]] precincts in [[Hamilton County, Florida|Hamilton County]].&lt;ref name=Ford/&gt;

'''Wintu''' {{IPAc-en|w|ɪ|n|ˈ|t|uː}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is an almost extinct [[Wintuan languages|Wintuan]] language spoken by the [[Wintu]] people of [[Northern California]].
It is the northernmost member of the [[Wintun]] family of languages.
The Wintuan family of languages was spoken in the [[Sacramento River]] Valley and in adjacent areas up to the [[Carquinez Strait]] of [[San Francisco Bay]].
Wintun is a branch of the hypothetical [[Penutian]] language phylum or stock of languages of western North America, more closely related to four other families of Penutian languages spoken in [[California]]: [[Maiduan]], [[Miwokan]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Ohlone languages|Costanoan]].&lt;ref&gt;Golla 2011: 128–168&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wintu were in contact also with adjacent speakers of [[Hokan languages]] such as [[Southeastern Pomo language|Southeastern]], [[Eastern Pomo language|Eastern]], and [[Northeastern Pomo language|Northeastern Pomo]]; [[Athabaskan languages]] such as [[Wailaki]] and [[Hupa]]; [[Yukian]] languages such as [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]] and [[Wappo]]; and other [[Penutian]] languages such as [[Miwok]], [[Maidu]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Saclan]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
Besides these contiguous languages surrounding the [[Wintun]] area wider contacts with speakers of [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[English language|English]].

As of 2011, Headman Marc Franco of the Winnemem Wintu has been working with the Indigenous Language Institute on revitalization of the Winnemem Wintu language.&lt;ref name=revived&gt;{{Cite web|title=Indigenous Language Activists -  Living Tongues Institute For Endangered Languages |accessdate=2012-09-02 |url=http://www.livingtongues.org/indigenousactivists.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309170253/http://www.livingtongues.org/indigenousactivists.html |archivedate=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{IPA|/f, dʒ/}} are nonnative phonemes borrowed from English.
* {{IPA|/θ/}} is a rare phoneme that occurred, only word finally, in only one of Pitkin's [[Informant (linguistics)|informants]] (his main consultant. In other speakers, it has merged with {{IPA|/tɬ/}}.
* Dental stops are denti-alveolar: {{IPA|[d̪]}}, {{IPA|[t̪]}}, {{IPA|[t̪ʰ]}}, {{IPA|[t̪ʼ]}}. Younger speakers, however, employ  (apico-)alveolar-stop articulations as in English {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[tʰ]}}, {{IPA|[tʼ]}}, {{IPA|[d]}} .
* The lateral {{IPA|/tɬ/}} is usually a fricative {{IPA|[ɬ]}} but occasionally an affricate among McCloud speakers while Trinity speakers have only the affricate. It is interdental after non-low front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}}, post-dental after low {{IPA|/a/}}, and retroflex after non-low back {{IPA|/u, o/}}.
* In the speech of older speakers, postalveolar {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is retroflex {{IPA|[ʂ]}} adjacent to back vowels {{IPA|/u, o, a/}}.
* Velars {{IPA|/k, kʼ, x/}} are advanced before non-low front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}} and retracted before non-low back vowels {{IPA|/u, o/}}. In the manner of articulation, velars and post-velars can be glottalized and non-glottalized (voiceless).
* The trill {{IPA|/ɽ͡r/}} is apico-postalveolar retroflex. It is occurs as a flap {{IPA|[ɽ]}} between vowels.
* The glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is weakly articulated except when the speaker is being deliberate or emphatic. It is always fully articulated in word-final position.

===Vowels===
Wintu has 10 (or 11) [[vowel]]s:

| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|aː}}
|-
|&amp;nbsp;'''Anomalous '''&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | {{IPA|æ}}
|}
* Wintu has short and long vowels.
* {{IPA|/æ/}} is a phoneme that only occurs in borrowed English words.
* All vowels are slightly [[Rhinoglottophilia|nasalized before the glottal consonant]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}
* All vowels are voiced and oral (except for the above-mentioned nasal allophones).

===Syllable structure===

Segmental phonemes require obligatorily a single onset consonant. The rhyme is usually composed of a vowel nucleus of a long or a short vowel optionally followed by a single consonant. The syllabic canon is

: {{IPA|CV(ː)(C)}}.

Some examples of a generic syllable structure are:

: {{IPA|CV}}   {{IPA|[qa]}}=and, or.
: {{IPA|CVː}}  {{IPA|[miː]}}=tree
: {{IPA|CVC}}  {{IPA|[nuq]}}=pus
: {{IPA|CVːC}} {{IPA|[baːs]}}=food.

Consonant clusters result only from conjoined closed syllables. For example, clusters of consonants occur when a syllable ending in a consonant is followed in the same word by another syllable.
Some examples of consonant clusters are:

: {{IPA|CVC.CVC}}  {{IPA|[pot.xom]}}=poison oak.
: {{IPA|CVC.CVːC}} {{IPA|[net.taːn]}}=my father.
: {{IPA|CVC.CVC}} {{IPA|[ʔel.ʔih]}}=you put it in.

Vowels may be long, but sequences of vowels do not occur.

===Stress===
'''Syllable stress''' in Wintu are predictable components of two junctures hyphen/-/ and plus/+/.
There are four phonemic junctures ranked by their magnitude: Plus/+/, hyphen/-/, comma/,/ and period/./.
* '''Plus juncture''' is a central juncture. In Plus Juncture the location of the  pitch and the stress in a phonemic word is determined by the structure of the syllable and its position relative to the juncture.
Syllables are determined by the presence or absence of vowels and semi-vowels. Light syllables contain short vowels. Heavy syllables contain short vowels followed by a semi-vowel. Extra-heavy syllables contain long vowels. The prominent syllable of a phonemic word is always the first, unless the second syllable is heavier, in which case the second syllable is stressed.
* '''Degree of intensity'''
In the primary stress the greater is the magnitude of the preceding juncture, the greater is the intensity of the stress.
The secondary stress, on the other hand, occurs when a heavy syllable follows the prominent syllable and varies in intensity.
The weakest stress occurs when a syllable is not stressed and follows immediately after a phonemic juncture.

:    Ex. Extra heavy syllable: b'''ó'''•s= house.
:    Ex. Syllable with secondary stress: n'''í'''= I.
:    Ex. Light Syllable: L'''i'''lá•=to accuse.
* '''The Hyphen Juncture''' occurs with phonemic words and it represents a phonemically functional unity with particular phonetic proprieties that contrast with other junctures.
Like the plus juncture, the hyphen juncture affects the location of higher pitch and stress. But instead of conditioning the location of the syllables like the plus juncture, the hyphen shifts the pitch and the stress. The Hyphen juncture is the juncture with the least magnitude, being the only one occurring within words (for example, following certain prefixes and preceding some auxiliaries and enclitics).

:    Ex./+ma•tceki+/ ear wax.
:    Ex./+ma•t'''-'''ceki'''-'''/one split ear.
:    Ex./+ʔelwine+/ with, along, accompanying.
:    Ex./+ʔel'''-'''wine'''-'''/ to look straight in the eye.
* '''Comma juncture'''/,/
It has two phonetic features: a fully realised pause accompanied or preceded by glottal stricture.
* '''Period Juncture'''/./
It is the juncture with the greatest magnitude and it has four phonetic features:
* A fully realised pause
* An associated glottal structure
* A preceding phrasal accent of unpredictable location
* A terminal pitch contour that drops sharply in pitch level and voicing

Period juncture delimits phonemic sentences.

:    Ex. ba•-s-bo•sin+ net, nis+λiya. They threw rocks at me because I was eating.
:    Ex. ba•s-bo•sin+ mat, mis+ λiya. They threw rocks at you because you were eating.
* '''Phrasal Accent'''
It consists of very high pitch and particularly heavy stress.

:    Ex. Sukuyum+ límcada.=my dog is sick.
:    EX. S'''ú'''kuyum+ límcada.=my dog is sick.

===Phonological processes===
A vast number of phonological processes occur in the Wintu language.
* The glottalized velars are pronounced with a slight friction of the tongue when they are in contact with certain vowels in particular contexts.
For example, /k'/ becomes prevelar before /i/ and /e/ but it is velar before /ʔa/ and it is backed before /u/ and /o/.
In a similar way, the glottalized velar /q'/ is pronounced with more friction at the point of articulation as /q'ˣ/. It is in a frontal position before /i/ and /e/ and becomes backed with all the other vowels.
* Among the stop consonants only /p/, /t/, and /k/ occur finally as well as initially.
* The labiodental /f/ is an anomalous phoneme and it occurs only in two borrowed forms /foriĴulay/, Fourth of July or in /friho•  lis/ beans.
* Older speakers pronounce /s/ as /ṣ/, a retroflexed post-alveolar slit before or after /a/, /o/ and /u/ while younger speakers use /s/ everywhere.
* /h/ becomes a glottal spirant before /u/, /o/ and /a/, as in /ha•sma/, to keep on yawning.
* /r/ is a voiced trill but when it occurs between vowels it becomes a voiced flap, as for example /yor/ tear (imperative form) and /yura/ to tear (infinitive form).
* /l/ a lateral apical-alveolar, is sometime confused with /r/ as in the word /lileter/ a corn meal.

===Morphology===
Wintu possesses a sophisticated morphology with some polysynthetic characteristics. The combination of its morphemes into words involves several processes such as suffixation, prefixation, compounding, reduplication and consonant and vocalic ablaut.
Nevertheless, the most common process is suffixation, which occurs primarily in verbs.

===Vowel ablaut===
The '''Vowel Ablaut''' is a change in the height (gradation) of  the root-syllable vowels and it affects the vowel quantity.
In Wintu, the vowel ablaut occurs only in the mutations of some verb-root vowels (called dissimilation), or in some root-deriving suffixes (assimilation).
Root-vowel dissimilation is conditioned by the height of the vowel in the following syllable, while the suffix vowel assimilation is conditioned by the quantity of the vowel in the preceding syllable.
An example of dissimilation takes place when /e/ and /o/, which occurs only in root syllables, are raised in height when they are preceded by a single consonant and followed by the low vowel /a/ in the next syllable.

Ex.  lEla-/lila/ "to transform" and lElu-/lelu/ "transform".

An example of dissimilation takes place when the morphophoneme [V]assimilates completely to the quality of the  vowel that precedes  in the previous syllable.

Ex.cewVlVlVha=/ceweleleha/ "many to be wide open".

===Consonant ablaut===
A small amount of consonant ablaut is also present in Wintu, for example before word juncture /cʼ/ and /b/ change in /p/.

===Nouns===
Substantives  are marked for aspect and case.
There are two different types of substantives: those formed directly from roots (pronouns, non possessed nouns, kinship terms) and those based on forms of complex derivation from radical and stems (mostly nouns).
Pronouns can be singular, dual, and plural. They have particular suffixes (possessive for instrumental functions and for marking plural humans.) They are also very similar to verbs.
Nouns have  a variety of roots, they are an open class, they may show number in rare forms and  they do not distinguish possessive from instrumental functions. Nouns can be classified in possessed and non possessed.
The noun is composed of two elements:a stem and a suffix. The stem is usually a root. The suffixes specify numbers, animateness, personification or individuation.
Some nouns  have the same stem but have a different generic and particular meaning.
Ex. /tu/ (particular aspect) eye; (generic aspect) face(s).
The suffixes of the nouns can also have different cases: object [um](sedem-coyote), genitive[un](seden), locative [in], instrumental [r], possessive[t], emphatic possessive (reduplication of the last syllable).

===Verbs===
Verbs are the wider class of words in Wintu. Also several nouns derivate from verbs. The category of verbs has a very sophisticated morphological structure.
Pitkin (1964) identifies three stem forms: indicative, imperative and nominal.
* '''Prefixes''': optional in occurrence, when affixed directly to roots are followed by a hyphen juncture.
* '''Roots''': the most part are monosyllabic and with the shape CVC or CV•C. Two important processes are root derivation and  reduplication.
* '''Suffixes'''
** Root-deriving suffixes (suffixes added to the root): distributive, repetitive, iterative, transitive, stative, privative.
** Stem suffixes (added to the stem form):
** '''Imperative Stem Suffixation'''
** 1 position class derivation class=patient suffix, comitative suffix, generic comitative suffix
** 2 position class: reflexive
** 3 position class: causative
** 4 position class: reciprocal, benefactive
** 1 position class inflectional suffixes=warning, passive
** 2 position class. Inflectional =inevitable future, potential temporal simultaneity, jussive, hortative
** 3 position class= negative, dual hortative, necessary temporal anteriority, impersonal interrogative, temporal simultaneity or anteriority, personal object
** '''Indicative Stem Suffixation'''
** 1 position inflectional suffixes:non visual sensory evidential, hearsay evidential, inferential evidential, experiential evidential, subordinating causal anteriority, approximation
** 2 position inflectional suffixes:first person, second person, dubitative, completive, subordinating temporal anteriority, subordinating unexpected simultaneity

==Syntax==
The basic word order in Wintu is very flexible. A morphological word  is the basic syntactical unit. In some cases a morphological word that is phonemically a single word can be syntactically two different words.
A '''morphological word''',can be '''clitic''' or '''non clitic'''. The clitic word, is always dependent on the non-clitic. The clitic words can be proclitic and postclitic depending on their position. Some morphemic words can be both clitics and full words.
For example: the morphemic word / ʔel/, in, is both a full word in /qewelʔel/, in the house, and a proclitic in /ʔel-qewel/, which have the same meaning.
The largest syntactic unit is the '''sentence'''. Sentences are considered a sequences of full words terminated by a period juncture /./. The sentence can be considered a '''clause''' if it contains verbs, sentence if it contains nouns. Sentences never contains main verbs.
Clauses can be dependent or independent. This depends on the kind of suffix who forms the verb. Independent verbs take the personal inflectional suffixes while dependent verbs are characterised by the subordinating suffixes{r},{tan},{ʔa], {n},}{so}, and {ta}.
In the sentences the syntactic relationships between full words and clitics are indicated by the word order and by the inflectional and derivational suffixes.
Four types of functions can be distinguished for the sentences: '''head''', '''attributive''', '''satellite''', and '''conjunction'''.
The head is usually a noun and it is not dependent on other forms as for example /winthu/Wintu people. The attributive preceded  and modify the head as for example in /winthu•n qewelin/ in a Wintu house.
On the other hand, the satellite only occurs in clauses. A satellite could be either the subject or the object of a verb. If the satellite is the subject of the verb, it precedes the verb, as for example /po• m yel-hura/land destroyed, but if the satellite is the object and it is in a dependent clause or a noun-phrase containing a genitive attributive, follows.
For example: /sedet ʔelew'kiyemti•n/ coyote never speaks wisely, or /wayda me•m hina/ a northern flood of water (will) arrive.
