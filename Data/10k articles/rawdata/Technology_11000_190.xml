==4K standards and terminology==
The term "4K" is generic and refers to any resolution with a horizontal pixel count of approximately 4,000.&lt;ref name="UHD State of the Industry"&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Consumer Electronics Association |date=August 2013 |title=CEA Market Research Report — Ultra High-Definition: State of the Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=2|quote=The term “4K” is generally used by content and production companies to refer to horizontal display resolution of 3,840 pixels or greater. “Ultra HD” and “Ultra High-­‐Resolution” are terms defined by the Consumer Electronics Association to identify displays of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels in resolution, with other requirements as discussed in the section Requirements for Using “Ultra HD”.}} Several different 4K resolutions have been standardized by various organizations.

===DCI Digital Cinema System Specification===

In 2005, [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] (DCI), a prominent standards organization in the cinema industry, published the '''Digital Cinema System Specification'''. This specification establishes standardized 2K and 4K container formats for digital cinema production, with resolutions of 2048{{resx}}1080 and 4096{{resx}}2160 respectively.&lt;ref name="DCI v1.2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Cinema System Specification Version 1.2 with Errata as of 30 August 2012 Incorporated|url=http://dcimovies.com/specification/DCI_DCSS_v12_with_errata_2012-1010.pdf|publisher=[[Digital Cinema Initiatives|Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC]]|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=October 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527180135/http://dcimovies.com/specification/DCI_DCSS_v12_with_errata_2012-1010.pdf|archive-date=2016-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=§4.3.1}} The resolution of the video content inside follows the SMPTE 428-1 standard,&lt;ref name="DCI v1.2" /&gt;{{rp|at=§3.2.1}} which establishes the following resolutions for a 4K distribution:&lt;ref name="SMPTE 428-1"&gt;{{Citation |title=SMPTE 428-1-2006: D-Cinema Distribution Master - Image Characteristics|publisher=Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE)|date=September 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=6}}

Some articles claim that the terms "2K" and "4K" were coined by DCI and refer exclusively to the 2K and 4K formats defined in the DCI standard.&lt;ref name="extech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/174221-no-tv-makers-4k-and-uhd-are-not-the-same-thing|title=4K vs. UHD: What’s the difference? – ExtremeTech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, usage of these terms in the cinema industry predates the publication of the DCI standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swinson|first1=Peter|title=DCI and Other Film Formats|url=http://www.edcf.net/edcf_docs/DCI%20and%20OTHER%20Film%20Formats.pdf|publisher=Peter Swinson Associates, Limited|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining 2K &amp; 4K|url=http://www.cinematography.net/edited-pages/Defining_2K_and_4K.htm|website=Cinematography Mailing List|accessdate=April 29, 2018 |date=March 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php?t-71619.html|title=2K Film Resolution|website=CGSociety|date=June 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forums.creativecow.net/docs/forums/post.php?forumid=19&amp;postid=182104&amp;univpostid=182104&amp;pview=t&amp;archive=T|title=what resolution/retio/frame rate?|website=CreativeCOW.net|date=September 25, 2002|accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are generally understood as casual terms for any resolution approximately 2000 or 4000 pixels in width, rather than names for specific resolutions.&lt;ref name="UHD State of the Industry" /&gt;{{rp|page=2|quote=The term “4K” is generally used by content and production companies to refer to horizontal display resolution of 3,840 pixels or greater. “Ultra HD” and “Ultra High-Definition” are terms defined by the Consumer Electronics Association to identify displays of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels in resolution, with other requirements as discussed in the section Requirements for Using “Ultra HD”.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WEAPON/EPIC-W 8K S35 Operation Guide v7.0 |publisher=[[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]] |url=http://docs.red.com.s3.amazonaws.com/955-0138_v7.0/REV-G/955-0138_v7.0%20Rev-G%20%20%20RED%20PS%2C%20WEAPON-EPIC-W%20Operation%20Guide.pdf |accessdate=May 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528193817/http://docs.red.com.s3.amazonaws.com/955-0138_v7.0/REV-G/955-0138_v7.0%20Rev-G%20%20%20RED%20PS%2C%20WEAPON-EPIC-W%20Operation%20Guide.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=109}}

===SMPTE UHDTV Standard===

In 2007, the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] published '''SMPTE ST 2036-1''', which defines parameters for two UHDTV systems called '''UHDTV1''' and '''UHDTV2'''.&lt;ref name="SMPTE OV 2036-0"&gt;{{cite web |title=SMPTE OV 2036-0:2015 |publisher=Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) |date=March 27, 2015 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395479 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528191719/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395479 |archive-date=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1"&gt;{{cite |title=SMPTE ST 2036-1:2014 |publisher=Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) |date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard defines the following characteristics for these systems:
* A resolution of 3840{{resx}}2160 (UHDTV1) or 7680{{resx}}4320 (UHDTV2)&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1" /&gt;{{rp|at=§5.2}}
* Square ({{ratio|1|1}}) pixels, for an overall image aspect ratio of {{ratio|16|9}}&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1" /&gt;{{rp|at=§5.1}}
* A framerate of 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 59.94, 60, 100, 119.88, or 120{{nbsp}}Hz with progressive scan&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1" /&gt;{{rp|at=§1.2}}
* RGB, {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4, 4:2:2, or 4:2:0 pixel encoding&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1" /&gt;{{rp|at=§7.7}}
* 10{{nbsp}}bpc (30{{nbsp}}bit/px) or 12{{nbsp}}bpc (36{{nbsp}}bit/px) color depth&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1" /&gt;{{rp|at=§1.2}}
* Colorimetry characteristics as defined in the standard, including color primaries, quantization parameters, and the electro-optical transfer function. These are the same characteristics later standardized in [[BT.2020|ITU-R BT.2020]]. UHDTV1 systems are permitted to use [[BT.709]] color primaries up to 60{{nbsp}}Hz.&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1" /&gt;{{rp|at=§6.2}}

===ITU-R UHDTV Standard===

In 2012, the [[ITU-R|International Telecommunication Union, Radiocommunication Sector]] published '''[[Rec. 2020|Recommendation ITU-R BT.2020]]''', also known as the '''Ultra High Definition Television (UHDTV) standard'''.&lt;ref name="Rec. 2020 PR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultra High Definition Television: Threshold of a new age|url=https://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2012/31.aspx|publisher=[[ITU-R]]|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard adopts the same image parameters defined in [[#SMPTE UHDTV Standard|SMPTE ST 2036-1]].&lt;ref name="ITU-R BT.2020"&gt;{{cite web|title=ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020-2: Parameter values for ultra-high definition television systems for production and international programme exchange|url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bt/R-REC-BT.2020-2-201510-I!!PDF-E.pdf|publisher=[[ITU-R]]|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the UHDTV standard does not define any official names for the formats it defines, ITU typically uses the terms "4K", "4K UHD", or "4K UHDTV" to refer to the 3840{{resx}}2160 system in public announcements and press releases ("8K" for the 7680{{resx}}4320 system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New ITU reports help shape next TV revolution: High Dynamic Range (HDR)|url=http://news.itu.int/next-revolution-television-hdr/|website=ITU News|publisher=ITU-R|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of ITU's other standards documents, the terms "UHDTV1" and "UHDTV2" are used as shorthand.&lt;ref name="ITU-R BT.2077"&gt;{{cite web|title=ITU-R Recommendation BT.2077-2: Real-time serial digital interfaces for UHDTV signals|url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bt/R-REC-BT.2077-2-201706-I!!PDF-E.pdf|publisher=ITU-R|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CEA Ultra HD===
In October 2012, the [[Consumer Technology Association|Consumer Electronics Association]] (CEA) announced their definition of the term '''Ultra High-Definition''' (or '''Ultra HD''') for use with marketing consumer display devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Electronics Industry Announces Ultra High-Definition|url=https://www.dpreview.com/articles/7695547320/cea-confirms-ultra-high-definition-4k-video-spec-with-3480-2160-pixel-minimum|website=Digital Photography Review|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEA defines an ''Ultra HD'' product as a TV, monitor, or projector with the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="CEA UHD Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=CEA Updates Characteristics for Ultra High-Definition Displays|url=https://www.cta.tech/News/Press-Releases/2014/June/CEA-Updates-Characteristics-for-Ultra-High-Definit.aspx|publisher=[[Consumer Technology Association|Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)]]|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A resolution of 3840{{resx}}2160 or larger
* An aspect ratio of 1.{{overline|77}}∶1 ({{ratio|16|9}}) or wider
* Support for color depth of 8{{nbsp}}bpc (24{{nbsp}}bit/px) or higher
* At least one HDMI input capable of supporting 3840{{resx}}2160 at 24, 30, and 60{{nbsp}}Hz progressive scan (though not necessarily with RGB / {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 color), and HDCP{{nbsp}}2.2
* Capable of processing images according to the color space defined in [[Rec. 709|ITU-R BT.709]]
* Capable of upscaling HD content (i.e. 720p / 1080p)

The CEA definition does allow manufacturers to use other terms—such as ''4K''—alongside the Ultra HD logo.&lt;ref name="UHD State of the Industry" /&gt;{{rp|page=9|quote=Since the CEA announcement of “Ultra HD” and “Ultra High-Definition”, the terms have quickly become standard, but there are still some variations in usage. Some brands are adding “4K” to the name, as is allowed by the CEA definition.}} Since the resolution in CEA's definition is only a minimum requirement, displays with higher resolutions such as 4096{{resx}}2160 or 5120{{resx}}2880 also qualify as "Ultra HD" displays, provided they meet the other requirements.

===2160p resolution===

Some 4K resolutions, like 3840{{resx}}2160 are often casually referred to as ''2160p''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nick Pino, Jon Porter |title=4K and Ultra HD: Everything you need to know about the hot new resolution |url=https://www.techradar.com/news/television/ultra-hd-everything-you-need-to-know-about-4k-tv-1258884 |website=Tech Radar |accessdate=September 1, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819192631/https://www.techradar.com/news/television/ultra-hd-everything-you-need-to-know-about-4k-tv-1258884 |archivedate=August 19, 2018 |date=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alexander Thomas |title=Just how useful is 2160p aka 4K? |url=https://www.dr-lex.be/info-stuff/ultrahighdef.html |accessdate=September 1, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171126053552/https://www.dr-lex.be/info-stuff/ultrahighdef.html |archivedate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name follows from the previous naming convention used by [[HDTV]] and [[SDTV]] formats, which refer to a format by the number of pixels/lines along the vertical axis (such as "1080p" for 1920{{resx}}1080 progressive scan, or "480i" for the 480-line interlaced SDTV formats) rather than the horizontal pixel count (≈4000 or "4K" for 3840{{resx}}2160).

The term "2160p" could be applied to any format with a height of 2160 pixels, but it is most commonly used in reference to the 4K UHDTV resolution of 3840{{resx}}2160 due to its association with the well-known 720p and 1080p [[HDTV]] formats. Although 3840{{resx}}2160 is both a 4K resolution and a 2160p resolution, these terms cannot always be used interchangeably since not all 4K resolutions are 2160 pixels tall, and not all 2160p resolutions are ≈4000 pixels wide. However, some companies have begun using the term "4K" to describe devices with support for a 2160p resolution, even if it is not close to 4000 pixels wide. For example, many "4K" dash cams only support a resolution of 2880{{resx}}2160 (4∶3);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=STERIO 4K 2880x2160/P24 Dash Cam |url=https://www.amazon.com/STERIO-2880x2160-Dashboard-Recording-Detection/dp/B07439HNFT/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901182521/https://www.amazon.com/STERIO-2880x2160-Dashboard-Recording-Detection/dp/B07439HNFT/ |archivedate=September 1, 2018 |website=Amazon.com |quote=Super HD 4K 2880x2160P Resolution and 170 Degree A+ Ultra Wide Angle---Record every detail with the latest technique of car video shooting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AUKEY 4K Dash Cam |url=https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Wide-Angle-Dashboard-Recording-Additional/dp/B0771DYFTZ/ |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=September 1, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901181959/https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Wide-Angle-Dashboard-Recording-Additional/dp/B0771DYFTZ/ |archivedate=September 1, 2018 |quote=An advanced image sensor and super-wide field of view capture everything in ultra-sharp 4K(2880 x 2160 @24fps) video with HDR.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is a 2160p resolution, it is not a 4K resolution.

===DVB===

In 2014, the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] Project released a new set of standards intended to guide the implementation of high resolution content in broadcast television. Dubbed '''DVB-UHDTV''', it establishes two standards, known as '''UHD-1''' (for 4K content) and '''UHD-2''' (for 8K content). These standards use resolutions of 3840{{resx}}2160 and 7680{{resx}}4320 respectively, with framerates of up to 60{{nbsp}}Hz, color depth up to 10{{nbsp}}bpc (30{{nbsp}}bit/px), and [[HEVC]] encoding for transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rivington|first1=James|title=4K TV channels on the way as DVB-UHDTV standard is approved|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/television/tv/4k-tv-channels-on-the-way-as-dvb-uhdtv-standard-is-approved-1256181|website=TechRadar|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVB is currently focusing on the implementation of the UHD-1 standard.&lt;ref name="DVB Phasing in UHD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phasing in Ultra High Definition|url=https://www.dvb.org/resources/public/factsheets/dvb_-_phasing_in_uhd.pdf|website=www.dvb.org|publisher=DVB Project Office|accessdate=April 29, 2018|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DVB finalized '''UHD-1 Phase 2''' in 2016, with the introduction of service by broadcasters expected in 2017. UHD-1 Phase 2 adds features such as [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (using [[Hybrid Log-Gamma|HLG]] and [[Perceptual Quantizer|PQ]] at 10 or 12 bits), wide color gamut ([[Rec. 2020|BT. 2020]]/[[Rec. 2100|2100]] colorimetry), and [[high frame rate]] (up to 120{{nbsp}}Hz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DVB On Course for Future UHDTV System|url=https://www.dvb.org/resources/public/pressreleases/dvb_pr254_dvb_on_course_for_future_uhdtv_system.pdf|website=www.dvb.org|publisher=DVB Project Office|accessdate=April 29, 2018|location=Geneva|date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DVB Phasing in UHD"/&gt;

[[File:JVC DLA-X550R (4K projector).jpg|thumb|A JVC "e-shift" ([[pixel shifting]]) projector results in 4K pixel resolution on the screen]]

Though experiencing rapid price drops beginning in 2013 for viewing devices, the home cinema [[digital video projector]] market saw little expansion, with only a few manufacturers (only Sony {{as of|2015|lc=y}}) offering limited 4K-capable lineups, with native 4K projectors commanding five-figure price tags well into 2015 before finally breaking the US$10,000 barrier.&lt;ref name="CNET350es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/products/sony-vpl-vw350es/ |title=Sony VPL-VW350ES review |publisher=CNET |date=March 30, 2015 |first= David |last=Katzmaier |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics state that at normal direct-view panel size and viewing distances, the extra pixels of 4K are redundant at the ability of [[Visual acuity|normal human vision]]. Projection home cinemas, on the other hand, employ much larger screen sizes without necessarily increasing viewing distance to scale. JVC has used a technique known as "e-shift" to extrapolate extra pixels from 1080p sources to display 4K on screens through [[Video scaler|upscaling]] or from native 4K sources at a much lower price than native 4K projectors.&lt;ref name="cnet2013jvc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/jvc-debuts-cheaper-pseudo-4k-projectors/ |title=JVC debuts cheaper pseudo-4K projectors |publisher=CNET |first=Ty |last=Pendlebury |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology of non-native 4K entered its fourth generation for 2016.&lt;ref name="jvc1stparty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://procision.jvc.com/product.jsp?modelId=MODL029571 |title=DLA-X550R Overview |publisher=JVC |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HTabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaternewsandtrends/fl/JVC-Intros-4th-Generation-e-Shift-4K-Projectors-at-CEDIA-2015.htm |title=JVC Intros 4th Generation e-Shift 4K Projectors at CEDIA 2015 |publisher=[[About.com]] |first=Robert |last=Silva |date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/JVC/Projectors/4K/Ultra_HD/hdr/high-dynamic-range/hdcp-22/HDMI_2.0/jvc-readies-new-eshift-4k-dila-projectors-with-hdr/26904 |title=JVC Readies New eShift 4K D-ILA Projectors with HDR |first=Steven |last=Cohen |publisher=High-Def Digest|date= October 19, 2015 |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; JVC used this same technology to provide [[8K resolution|8K]] [[flight simulation]] for [[Boeing]] that met the limits of 20/25 visual acuity.&lt;ref name="shephard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/training-simulation/iitsec-2015-new-training-approaches-boeing/ |title=I/ITSEC 2015: New training approaches for Boeing |date=November 25, 2015|publisher=Shephard Media |first=Grant |last=Turnbull |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pixel shifting, as described here, was pioneered in the consumer space by [[JVC]], and later in the commercial space by [[Epson]]. That said, it isn't the same thing as "true" 4K.  More recently, some DLP projectors claim 4K UHD (which the JVCs and Epsons do not claim).

As noted above, DCI 4K is 4096{{resx}}2160, while 4K UHD is 3840{{resx}}2160, producing a slight difference in aspect ratio rather than a significant difference in resolution.  Traditional displays, such as LCD or OLED, are 3840 pixels across the screen, with each pixel being 1/3840th of the screen width. They do not overlap—if they did, they would suffer reduced detail.  The diameter of each pixel is basically 1/3840th of the screen width or 1/2160th of the screen height - either gives the same size pixel.  That 3840{{resx}}2160 works out to 8.3 megapixels, the official resolution of 4K UHD (and therefore Blu-ray UHD discs).

The 4K UHD standard doesn't specify how large the pixels are, so a 4K UHD projector (Optoma, BenQ, Dell, et al.) counts because these projectors have a 2718{{Thinsp}}&amp;times;{{Thinsp}}1528 pixel structure.  Those projectors process the true 4K of data and project it with overlapping pixels, which is what pixel shifting is.  Unfortunately, each of those pixels is far larger:  each one has 50% more area than true 4K.  Pixel shifting projectors project a pixel, shift it up to the right, by a half diameter, and project it again, with modified data, but that second pixel overlaps the first.

In other words, pixel shifting cannot produce adjacent vertical lines of RGBRGB or other colors where each line is one pixel (1/3840th of the screen) wide.  Adjacent red and green pixels would end up looking like yellow, with a fringe on one side of red, on the other of green - except that the next line of pixels overlapps as well, changing the color of that fringe. 4K UHD or 1080p pixel shifting cannot reveal the fine detail of a true 4K projector such as those Sony ships (business, education and home markets).  Also, JVC has one true 4K projector priced at $35,000 (as of mid-2017).

So while 4K UHD sounds like it has a pixel structures with 1/4 the area of 1080p, that does not happen with pixel shifting. Only a true 4K projector offers that level of resolution.  That's why "true" 4K projectors cost so much more than 4K UHD projectors with otherwise similar feature sets. They produce smaller pixels, finer resolution, no compromising of detail or color from overlapping pixels. By comparison, the slight difference in aspect ratio between DCI and 3840{{Thinsp}}&amp;times;{{Thinsp}}2160 pixel displays without overlap is insignificant relative to the amount of detail.

==Broadcasting==
In November 2014, United States satellite provider [[DirecTV]] became the first pay TV provider to offer access to 4K content, although limited to selected video-on-demand films.&lt;ref name="cnet-4kdirectv"&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV launches 4K exclusive to Samsung TVs|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/directv-launches-4k-exclusively-to-samsung-tvs/|website=CNET|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, British sports network [[BT Sport]] launched a 4K feed, with its first broadcast being the [[2015 FA Community Shield]] football match. Two production units were used, producing the traditional broadcast in high-definition, and a separate 4K broadcast. As the network did not want to mix 4K footage with upconverted HD footage, this telecast did not feature traditional studio segments at pre-game or half-time, but those hosted from the stadium by the match commentators using a 4K camera. BT envisioned that if viewers wanted to watch studio analysis, they would switch to the HD broadcast and then back for the game. Footage was compressed using [[H.264]] encoders and transmitted to [[BT Tower]], where it was then transmitted back to BT Sport studios and decompressed for distribution, via 4K-compatible [[BT TV]] set-top boxes on an eligible [[BT Infinity]] internet plan with at least a 25&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s connection.&lt;ref name=gizmodo&gt;{{cite web|title=BT Sport Ultra HD Made Even My Mum Want to Watch 4K Football|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2015/08/bt-sport-ultra-hd-made-even-my-mum-want-to-watch-4k-football/|website=Gizmodo UK|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techradar-btsport4k"&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the scenes of BT Sport's 4K Ultra HD revolution|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/news/television/behind-the-scenes-of-bt-sport-s-4k-ultra-hd-revolution-1301138|website=Techradar|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015 and January 2016, three Canadian television providers{{snd}} including [[Quebec]]-based [[Videotron]], Ontario-based [[Rogers Cable]], and [[Bell Fibe TV]], announced that they would begin to offer 4K compatible set-top boxes that can stream 4K content to subscribers over gigabit internet service.&lt;ref name="torstar-4kreality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gandm-4kcanada"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why you should add a 4K television to your holiday shopping list|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/gadgets-and-gear/why-you-should-add-a-4k-television-to-your-holiday-shopping-list/article27889576/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 5, 2015, alongside the announcement of its 4K set-top box and gigabit internet, Canadian media conglomerate [[Rogers Communications]] announced that it planned to produce 101 sports telecasts in 4K in 2016 via its [[Sportsnet]] division, including all [[Toronto Blue Jays]] home games, and "marquee" [[National Hockey League]] games beginning in January 2016.

===3840{{resx}}2160===

The resolution of 3840{{resx}}2160 is the dominant 4K resolution used in the consumer media and display industries. This is the resolution of the '''UHDTV1''' format defined in SMPTE ST 2036-1,&lt;ref name="SMPTE ST 2036-1" /&gt; as well as the '''4K [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHDTV]]''' format defined by ITU-R in [[Rec. 2020]],&lt;ref name="Rec. 2020 PR" /&gt; and is also the minimum resolution for CEA's definition of ''Ultra HD'' displays and projectors.&lt;ref name="CEA UHD Definition" /&gt; The resolution of 3840{{resx}}2160 was also chosen by the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] Project for their 4K broadcasting standard, '''UHD-1'''.&lt;ref name="DVB Phasing in UHD" /&gt;

This resolution has an aspect ratio of 16∶9, with 8,294,400 total pixels. It is exactly double the horizontal and vertical resolution of 1080p (1920{{resx}}1080) for a total of 4 times as many pixels, and triple the horizontal and vertical resolution of 720p (1280{{resx}}720) for a total of 9 times as many pixels. It is sometimes referred to as "2160p", based on the naming patterns established by the previous 720p and 1080p [[HDTV]] standards.

Televisions capable of displaying UHD resolutions are seen by [[consumer electronics]] companies as the next trigger for an upgrade cycle after a lack of consumer interest in [[3D television]].&lt;ref name="fbc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/4k-ultra-hd-tv-faces-bandwidth-challenge-to-get-into-homes-1200570763/ |title=Ultra-HD TV Faces Bandwidth Challenge to Get Into Homes |author=David S. Cohen |accessdate=30 May 2014 |date=1 August 2013 |work=variety.com |publisher=Variety Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4096{{resx}}2160===

This resolution is used mainly in digital cinema production, and has a total of 8,847,360 pixels with an aspect ratio 256∶135 (≈19∶10). It was standardized as the resolution of the 4K container format defined by [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] in the Digital Cinema System Specification, and is the [[native resolution]] of all DCI-compliant 4K [[digital projector]]s and [[computer monitor|monitors]].&lt;ref name="DCI v1.2"/&gt; The DCI specification allows several different resolutions for the content inside the container, depending on the desired aspect ratio. The allowed resolutions are defined in &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;SMPTE 428-1&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;ref name="DCI v1.2" /&gt;{{rp|at=§3.2.1}} &lt;ref name="SMPTE 428-1" /&gt;{{rp|at=p. 6}}

* 4096{{resx}}2160 (full frame, 256∶135 or ≈1.90∶1 aspect ratio)
* 3996{{resx}}2160 (flat crop, 1.85∶1 aspect ratio)
* 4096{{resx}}1716 (CinemaScope crop, ≈2.39∶1 aspect ratio)

The DCI 4K standard has twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of DCI 2K (2048{{resx}}1080), with four times as many pixels overall.

Digital movies made in 4K may be produced, [[motion picture film scanner|scanned]], or stored in a number of other resolutions depending on what [[storage aspect ratio]] is used.&lt;ref name="rsta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://renderman.pixar.com/view/resolution-table |title=Resolution Table |work=Resolution Table |publisher=Pixar |accessdate=21 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=4K+resolution&amp;i=57419,00.asp |title=4K resolution Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia |publisher=PC Magazine |date=1994-12-01 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the digital cinema production chain, a resolution of 4096 × 3112 is often used for acquiring "open gate" or anamorphic input material, a resolution based on the historical resolution of scanned Super&amp;nbsp;35mm film.&lt;ref name="diffv"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Intermediates for Film and Video |last=James |first=Jack |year=2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0240807022 |page=125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMYR00OxN8EC |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other 4K resolutions===

Various other non-standardized 4K resolutions have seen use in displays, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3941">The '''AN/APG-65''' and '''AN/APG-73''' are designations for a family of all-weather multimode [[airborne radar system]]s designed by [[Hughes Aircraft]] (now [[Raytheon]]) for the [[F/A-18 Hornet]], and used on a variety of [[fighter aircraft]] types. The [[APG-79]] is an upgraded [[Active Electronically Scanned Array|AESA]] version.

These [[I band (NATO)|I band]] (8 to 12 [[GHz]]) [[pulse-Doppler radar]] systems are designed for both air-to-air and air-to-surface missions. For air-to-air operations they incorporate a variety of search, track and [[track-while-scan]] modes to give the pilot a complete look-down/shoot-down capability. Air-to-surface modes include Doppler beam sharpened sector and patch mapping, medium range [[synthetic aperture radar]], fixed and moving ground target track and sea surface search. In the F/A-18, the radar is installed in a slide-out nose rack to facilitate maintenance.

== AN/APG-65 ==
[[File:An apg65 h.jpg|thumb|AN/APG-65 radar installed in an F/A-18 Hornet.]]
The APG-65 was developed in the late 1970s and has been operational since 1983. The radar includes a velocity search (to provide maximum detection range capability against nose aspect targets), range-while-search (to detect all-aspect targets), track-while-scan (which, when combined with an autonomous missile such as [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120]], gives the aircraft a fire-and-forget capability), single target track, gun director and raid assessment (which enables the operator to expand the region centred on a single tracked target, permitting radar separation of closely spaced targets) operating modes.

Although no longer in production, the APG-65 remains in service in [[F/A-18 Hornet]] strike fighters of the [[U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and the air forces of [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Spain]]. It has also been adapted to upgrade the [[Germany|German]] and [[Greece|Greek]] [[F-4 Phantom]] aircraft, and the [[AV-8B Harrier II]] Plus for the U.S. Marine Corps and the Spanish and Italian Navies.

== AN/APG-73 ==
The APG-73 is a late 1980s "upgrade of the APG-65 that provides higher throughputs, greater memory capacity, improved reliability, and easier maintenance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Products &amp; Services |url=http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/apg73/ |format=Raytheon Company Website product page |publisher=Raytheon.com |accessdate=2015-10-22 |quote=''is an upgrade of the APG-65 that provides higher throughputs, greater memory capacity, improved reliability, and easier maintenance''}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce production costs, many of the upgraded radar's modules are common with the [[APG-63 and APG-70|APG-70 (F-15E Strike Eagle) radar]]; its software engineers chose the [[JOVIAL]] programming language so that they could borrow and adapt existing software written for the APG-70. When fitted with a motion-sensing subsystem and stretch waveform generator and special test equipment, the APG-73 can generate high resolution ground maps and make use of 'advanced' image correlation algorithms to enhance weapon designation accuracy.

Since 1992 the APG-73 has been operational in U.S. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18C and D aircraft; early models of the U.S. Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet; and in the air forces of [[Finland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Malaysia]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]]. A total of 932 APG-73 systems were delivered, with the final delivery in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=149999&amp;TICK=RTN&amp;STORY=/www/story/06-05-2006/0004374390&amp;EDATE=Jun+5,+2006 "Raytheon Delivers Final APG-73 Radar for Super Hornet," Raytheon press release, June 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is renowned for its production of [[sujuk]] and [[pastirma]].&lt;ref name=Kayseri /&gt;&lt;ref name="2-Kayseri" /&gt; Apikoğlu is the first company to [[mass production|mass-produce]] meat products in Turkey and serve the demand of its entire national market.&lt;ref name=dana /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afişe edilen Apikoğlu'ndan açıklama" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gida /&gt;&lt;ref name="100 years" /&gt;&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:Apikoglu.jpg|thumbnail|Krikor Apikoğlu. Founder of the Apikoğlu Company.&lt;span style="float:right"&gt;''(circa 1923)''&lt;/span&gt;]]
Apikoğlu was founded in [[Kayseri]] in 1910 by ethnic [[Armenian people|Armenian]] Krikor Apikoğlu (1878–1945).&lt;ref name=lezzet /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kayseri /&gt;&lt;ref name=lezzet12 /&gt; Apikoğlu moved its base of operations to [[Istanbul]] in 1920, opening its production facility in a neighborhood of the [[Maltepe, Istanbul|Maltepe]] suburb called [[İdealtepe]].&lt;ref name=Kayseri /&gt;&lt;ref name="100 years" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ors /&gt; The company's headquarters occupied the lower level of the family's home, limiting their domicile to the upper levels.&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt;

==The brothers take charge==
As business expanded, the company eventually outgrew the [[Maltepe, Istanbul|Maltepe]] facility, subsequently moving its manufacturing operations to Alibeyköy. The factory in Alibeyköy was managed by brothers, Agop and Hayk Apikoğlu. This is when the company began [[doing business as]] (dba) Apikoğlu Brothers.&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ors /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ors /&gt; Apikoğlu Brothers was soon selling its products throughout Turkey.&lt;ref name="100 years" /&gt;&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt;&lt;ref name=lezzet12 /&gt;

===Innovations===
Efforts to meet the increasing national demand spawned an innovation Apikoğlu Brothers was able to incorporate from the 1960s. Their patented system made it possible to produce marketable [[halal]] meats directly from the slaughterhouse.&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt; The technique had the cow dangling upside down so that when the cow was slaughtered, the blood could easily flow out of its body.&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt; The technique had never been practiced in the manufacturing of [[foodstuffs]] and the precedent quickly became standard practice throughout Turkey, and eventually the entire [[meat packing industry]].&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt; In order to supply the increasing needs of national demand, Apikoğlu Brothers increased its workforce to 200 people in 1987.&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt; They also purchased a {{convert|45000|m2|sqft}} modern facility in [[Tuzla]]. As of 2013, Apikoğlu Brothers are continuing their manufacturing operations from the Tuzla facilities, with no indications that Tuzla operations will discontinue at any time in the near future.&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 2009 book: ''Markaların Öyküsü'', (English translation: ''The History of Brands'') Apikoğlu is described as one of "the 304 most famous brands in the world".&lt;ref name=kutlayacak /&gt;&lt;ref name=Apikoglu12 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Markaların Öyküsü- A (Apikoğlu)" /&gt; This designation preceded the Apikoğlu Brothers celebration of 100 continuous years in operation on its 2010 anniversary.&lt;ref name="100 years" /&gt;

The Apikoglu Brothers were mentioned in [[Nobel Prize]] winning author [[Orhan Pamuk]]'s book Istanbul: Memories of a City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pamuk|first=Orhan|title=Istanbul : memories and the city|year=2005|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=9781400040957|page=129|edition=1. American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Apikoğlu Brothers received the Altın Marka Award for two consecutive years (2005&amp;ndash;06).&lt;ref name=Apikoglu12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apikoglu bi kez daha Altin Marka Ödülünu kazandi|url=http://www.apikoglu.com.tr/resimler/basindan/1_64168069_024.jpg|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=BizimMarket|date=April 2006|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became a subsidiary of [[NCR Corporation]] in 1980, which sold the ''Mentor 2000'' professional [[computer]] in the [[United States]] in 1986.

The ''Mentor 2000'' ran at 5&amp;nbsp;MHz using a [[Zilog]] processor, 640&amp;nbsp;KB RAM, and included one 60MB [[hard disk]]. It used the [[Pick operating system]] and [[database management system]]. It was able to manage 16 or 32 video terminals at once.

==History==

Founded in 1967 by Michael A. McNeilly and others, Applied Materials [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 1972.  In subsequent years, the company diversified, until James C. Morgan became CEO in 1976 and returned the company's focus to its core business of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Tyya N.|title=Vault Guide to the Top Manufacturing Employers|date=14 June 2005|publisher=Vault|isbn=978-1581313246|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6puQvy0Yf8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCaffery|first1=Richard|title=TMF Interview With  Applied Materials Chairman and Chief Executive James Morgan|url=http://www.fool.com/foolaudio/transcripts/1999/stocktalk991222_amat.htm|accessdate=16 April 2016|work=The Motley Fool|date=17 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, sales increased by 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wheelwright|first1=Steven C.|title=Managing New Product and Process Development: Text Cases|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451602319|page=428|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awmav051w24C&amp;pg=PA428|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Applied Materials became the first U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturer to open its own technology center in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. chip firm constructs R&amp;D center in Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mW5f8lXoEYC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119|accessdate=16 April 2016|work=ComputerWorld|date=15 October 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first semiconductor equipment company to operate a service center in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Applied Materials expands presence in China|url=http://electroiq.com/blog/2001/10/applied-materials-expands-presence-in-china/|accessdate=16 April 2016|work=Solid State Technology|date=18 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Applied introduced a CVD machine called the Precision 5000, which differed from existing machines by incorporating diverse processes into a single machine that had multiple process chambers.&lt;ref name="Silicon Dragon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsai|first1=Terence|last2=Cheng|first2=Borshiuan|title=The Silicon Dragon: High-tech Industry in Taiwan|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=1840642408|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBNEaMFMPsMC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the corporation settled a lawsuit with three former employees for an estimated $600,000. The suit complained that the employees were driven out of the company after complaining about the courses [[Applied Scholastics]] had been hired to teach there.&lt;ref name=Scientologizing&gt;{{Cite news

In 1993, the Applied Materials' Precision 5000 was inducted into the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s permanent collection of [[Information Age]] technology.&lt;ref name="Silicon Dragon"/&gt;

In November 1996, Applied Materials acquired two [[Israel]]i companies for an aggregate amount of $285 million. Opal Technologies and Orbot Instruments for $175 million and $110 million in cash, respectively. Orbot produces systems for inspecting patterned silicon wafers for yield enhancement during the semiconductor manufacturing process, as well as systems for inspecting masks used during the patterning process. Opal develops and manufactures high-speed [[metrology]] systems used by semiconductor manufacturers to verify critical dimensions during the production of integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Applied Materials Buys Orbot Instruments, Opal for $285 Mln; Opal chairman Meny Erad: "This is a great day for Israeli high-tech." |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=352491 |newspaper=Globes |date=26 November 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116102738/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=352491 |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Applied is organized into three major business sectors: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.&lt;ref name="Aug16 PR"&gt;{{cite press release |date=18 August 2016 |title=Applied Materials Announces Record Results |url=http://www.appliedmaterials.com/company/news/press-releases/2016/08/applied-materials-announces-record-results |publisher=Applied Materials |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Materials also operates a [[Venture Capital|venture]] investing arm called Applied Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Malia|title=Why Intel, Applied Materials are banking on a Corvallis startup|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/morning_call/2014/02/why-corvallis-may-be-critical-to-the.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=Portland Business Journal|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiconductor Systems ===
The company develops and manufactures equipment used in the wafer fabrication steps of [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|creating a semiconductor device]], including [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD), [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD), [[rapid thermal processing]] (RTP), [[chemical mechanical polishing]] (CMP), etch, [[ion implantation]] and wafer inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shields|first1=Anne|title=Overview of Applied Materials Silicon Systems segment|url=http://marketrealist.com/2015/01/overview-applied-materials-silicon-systems-segment/|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=Market Realist|date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company acquired Semitool for this group in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pimentel|first1=Benjamin|last2=Bartash|first2=Jeffry|title=Applied Materials to acquire Semitool for $364 million|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/applied-materials-to-buy-semitool-for-364-millon-2009-11-17|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=MarketWatch|date=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied Global Services ===
The Applied Global Services (AGS) group offers equipment installation support and warranty extended support, as well as maintenance support. AGS also offers new and refurbished equipment, as well as upgrades and enhancements for installed base equipment. This sector also includes automation software for manufacturing environments.&lt;ref name="Aug16 PR" /&gt;

=== Display and Adjacent Markets ===

AGS combined an existing business unit with the display business of [[Applied Films Corporation]], acquired in mid-2006.

The manufacturing process for [[TFT LCD]]s (thin film transistor liquid crystal displays), commonly employed in computer monitors and televisions, is similar to that employed for [[integrated circuit]]s. In cleanroom environments both TFT-LCD and integrated circuit production use [[photolithography]], chemical and physical vapor deposition, and testing.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Energy and Environmental Solutions (former sector) ===

In 2006, the company acquired Applied Films, a glass coating and web coating business. Also in 2006, Applied announced it was entering the solar manufacturing equipment business. The solar, glass and web businesses were organized into the company's Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) sector.

In 2007, Applied announced the Applied SunFab [[thin film]] photovoltaic module production line, with [[single-junction cell|single]] or [[Tandem cell|tandem junction]] capability. SunFab applies [[silicon thin film]] layers to glass substrate that then produce electricity when exposed to sunlight. In 2009, the company's SunFab line was certified by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2009/01/amats-sunfab-modules-awarded-iec-certification-54520.html "AMAT's SunFab Modules Awarded IEC Certification." ''Renewable Energy World.'' January 16, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Applied announced that it was abandoning the thin film market and closing down their SunFab division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kanellos| first = Michael| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Applied Materials Kills its SunFab Solar Business| work = | publisher = Greenech Media| date = 21 July 2010| url = http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/applied-materials-kills-its-sunfab-solar-business| format = | doi = | accessdate = 3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, the company acquired privately held, Switzerland-based HCT Shaping Systems SA, a specialist in wafer sawing tools for both solar and semiconductor wafer manufacture, paying approximately $475 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2007/06/applied-materials-acquires-solar-wafer-manufacturer-49130.html "Applied Materials Acquires Solar Wafer Manufacturer." ''Renewable Energy World.'' June 27, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Applied acquired privately held, Italy-based Baccini SpA for $330M, company that worked in the metallization steps of solar cell manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2007/11/applied-materials-to-accelerate-its-solar-roadmap-with-acquisition-of-baccini-50648.html "Applied Materials to Accelerate Its Solar Roadmap with Acquisition of Baccini." ''Renewable Energy World.'' November 26, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was listed at the top of [[VLSI Research]]'s list of supplier of photovoltaic manufacturing equipment for 2008, with sales of $797M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/news/_a/applied_tops_vlsis_top_10_pv_manufacturing_equipment_suppliers_for_2008/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714232834/http://www.pv-tech.org/news/_a/applied_tops_vlsis_top_10_pv_manufacturing_equipment_suppliers_for_2008 |archivedate=2009-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since July 2016 this sector is no longer reported separately. Remaining solar business activities have been included in "Corporate and Others".&lt;ref name="Aug16 PR" /&gt;

The company has setup over 20 charging points across the city, as of July 2018&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ather 450 ==
[[File:TR02 - 5Dph (33).jpg|thumb|Ather 450]]
The Ather 450 is the more powerful version of the two scooters' sold by Ather. The scooter is constructed using an all aluminium frame, comes with a 5.4kW (7.2 BHP) [[Brushless DC electric motor]], and a 2.4 kWh [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium ion battery pack]]. The scooter can accelerate to 40 km/h in 3.9 seconds, attain a top speed of 80 km/h, and can travel 75 km on one charge in city riding conditions(107 km in the [[Driving cycle|Indian Drive Cycle]]). 

The scooter features a 7-inch touchscreen dashboard, and comes with features like on-board navigation, diagnostics, all-LED lighting, auto-cancelling indicators, smartphone integration, and cloud connectivity to send and receive data from Ather's servers.  

== AtherGrid: Charging Network ==
[[File:Ather Grid Location.jpg|thumb|AtherGrid Location]]
Ather has started setting up its own charging network dubbed as [https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/technology/ather-energy-unveils-its-charging-infrastructure-network-athergrid/64259682 AtherGrid], in Bengaluru. These [[Charging station|DC-fast-charging stations]] use Ather's proprietary charging method and connector to charge the scooters at a rate of 1km/min. The charging points are also equipped with a 3-pin wall socket to supply AC power to other electric vehicles that do not use Ather's connector. Other vehicle can connect to the charging point and start charging using the AtherGrid App for iOS and Android.

Ather has plans to setup around 60 points in Bengaluru, and setup more [https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/electric-scooter-maker-ather-energy-sets-up-charging-points-in-bengaluru-open-to-all-evs/article23953312.ece AtherGrid] in other cities as it expands. Ather also sets up a home charging point at customer's homes which will charge the Ather 450 to 80% in 2 hours 40 minutes and to 100% in 4 hours 18 minutes.

== AtherSpace: Experience Centers ==
Unlike most auto-manufactures in India, Ather Energy owns and operates its Experience Centers, the company claims that this helps in maintaining end-to-end customer experience. The experience centers dubbed, AtherSpace, are aimed at increasing product understanding, providing customer education, and giving a first-hand experience of the product to consumers. Test rides are also provided at the experience centers and can be pre-booked on the company's website. 

Experience centers have components of the scooter displayed with useful information provided alongside each of them. There is also a fully built naked scooter on display to show the chassis of the scooter.

The [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/bikes/ather-450-and-340-smart-electric-scooters-launched-starts-at-rs-1-1-lakh/articleshow/64465822.cms first experience center opened] to consumers on June 8, 2018 at 100-ft road Indiranagar, Bengaluru.

== Response ==
Since the launch, the Ather 450 has gained [https://www.bikedekho.com/ather-energy/ather-450/road-test-ather-450-electric-scooter-first-ride positive reviews from auto-journalists], based on early testing. The response by consumers has also been mostly positive on various social media platforms. Most reviews claiming the scooter to be the best electric scooter in the country by a fair margin. Ather has provided close to 2,500 test rides at AtherSpace, and has already sold out the Ather 450 until early 2019.

== Deliveries ==
Ather 450 deliveries began on 11th, September, 2018. A set of ten vehicles was handed over to the customers at a special delivery event held at Ather's vehicle factory.

The [[Information Age]] is generally understood to have arrived with the [[Internet]] as it was developed through the 1970s and rolled out throughout the 1980s, and continues evolving to this day. So too the adoption of digital techniques in aviation also arrived progressively at around the same time and also continues today.

The use of digital computers in aircraft design was developed by large aerospace companies throughout the 1970s and included technique such as CAD, CAM, structural component stress analysis using FEA and for aerodynamic modelling.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html Introduction to Finite Element Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514233218/http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/97ClassProj/num/widas/history.html |date=2011-05-14 }}'', Laboratory for Scientific Visual Analysis (recovered 21 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Composite material]]s lend themselves better than metal to fluid "organic" aerodynamic shapes of high efficiency, and the advent of sophisticated computer-aided design and modelling has led to an expansion in the use of these materials and forms.

Digital systems also appeared in the aircraft themselves and grew steadily in sophistication. The first FADEC ([[Full Authority Digital Engine Control]]) trials took place in 1968, with the first operational system entering service in 1985.&lt;ref name=flight1968&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202110.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gunston1990&gt;Gunston (1990) ''Avionics: The story and technology of aviation electronics'' Patrick Stephens Ltd, Wellingborough UK. 254pp, {{ISBN|1-85260-133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first operational fully authoritative [[fly-by-wire]] system was developed for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and its introduction in 1978 heralded a revolution in taking over the task of ensuring stability in flight from the traditional aerodynamic stabilizers. This use of "relaxed static stability" allowed aircraft to be made more manoeuvrable and to be given an artificial "feel" to aid pilots in their main task. Meanwhile, the "glass cockpit" was replacing the traditional analogue electro-mechanical instrumentation with graphical digital displays which could display any information selected. Early glass cockpits provided less critical flight information in the form of the EFIS system, with fully glass systems appearing from 1988.

The Cold War era ended shortly after the arrival of digital technologies, bringing a marked decrease of military aviation among the major powers. More recently the rise of the Indian and Chinese economies has spurred development of military aircraft in these countries.

==Aircraft==

===Relaxed static stability===
The first operational fully authoritative [[fly-by-wire]] system was developed for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and its introduction in 1978 heralded a revolution in taking over the task of ensuring stability in flight from the traditional aerodynamic stabilizers. This use of "relaxed static stability" allowed aircraft to be made more manoeuvrable and to be given an artificial "feel" to aid pilots in their main task.

===Composite materials===
[[Composite material]]s lend themselves better than metal to fluid "organic" aerodynamic shapes of high efficiency, and the advent of sophisticated computer-aided design and modelling has led to an expansion in the use of these materials and forms.

===Engines===
This period has seen an upsurge in the use of electrical power systems for light aircraft and UAVs. Enabling technologies include the widespread availability and affordability of new high-performance battery technologies, high-strength [[rare-earth magnet]]s in electric motors, falling costs of [[solar cell]]s and sophisticated computerised control and management systems.

Meanwhile, conventional aero engines, both piston- and turbine-based, have continued the process of refinement, becoming steadily more reliable and fuel-efficient, while at the same time less polluting.

===Avionics===
Digital systems also appeared in the aircraft themselves and grew steadily in sophistication. Early digital systems were self-contained with limited functionality. The first FADEC ([[Full Authority Digital Engine Control]]) trials took place in 1968, with the first operational system entering service in 1985.&lt;ref name=flight1968 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gunston1990 /&gt;

Integrated data systems require a digital data bus. The [[MIL-STD-1553]] bus was defined in 1973. This enabled the first operational fully authoritative [[fly-by-wire]] system to be developed for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]]. The introduction of this aircraft in 1978 heralded a revolution in taking over the task of ensuring stability in flight from the traditional aerodynamic stabilizers. This use of "relaxed static stability" allowed aircraft to be made more manoeuvrable and to be given an artificial "feel" to aid pilots in their main task. Meanwhile, the "glass cockpit" was replacing the traditional analogue electro-mechanical instrumentation with graphical digital displays which could display any information selected. Early glass cockpits provided less critical flight information in the form of the EFIS system, with fully glass systems appearing from 1988.

===Unmanned Aerial Vehicles===
{{Main|History of unmanned aerial vehicles}}
Prior to the Digital Age, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones were of limited use, having either limited guidance capability or a vulnerable radio-control link back to a remote pilot.

The development of lightweight and low-cost sensors such as digital cameras together with mobile computing technologies has allowed UAVs to become more sophisticated and to undertake autonomous flight decisions. UAVs are being increasingly used in both civil and military roles.

UAVs are an attractive attack weapon because they combine the flexibility and firepower of a manned aircraft with the expendability of a missile. They have come to the fore through their use for air-to-ground surgical strikes in [[Afghanistan]]. However such use is controversial due to the risk of causing civilian deaths by mistake.

In the 21st century, civilian UAVs such as the [[quadcopter]] are increasingly being used for recreational purposes and for aerial observation via a digital camera.

A micro-UAV is small enough for several to be carried at once, and these are finding applications in military reconnaissance and scientific research.

==Civil aviation==
During this period, civil aviation continued to expand. Airliners and engines grew larger and more fuel-efficient, while digital systems progressively took over the flight control and other avionics. Modern jet airliners have [[glass cockpit]]s, full-authority digital engine and fly-by-wire computerised flight controls and, most recently, Mobile Internet communications connectivity.

Major disruptions to [[air travel]] in the 21st century included the [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks|closing of U.S. airspace]] due to the [[September 11 attacks]], and the closing of most of European airspace after the [[2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull]].

===General aviation===
[[Ultralight]] and [[microlight]] aircraft have grown in popularity, along with other sporting activities such as [[paragliding]].

In 1986 [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] flew the [[Rutan Voyager]] around the world non-stop and with no aerial refuelling. 

In 1999 [[Bertrand Piccard]] became the first person to circle the earth in a balloon.

==Military aviation==
The use of digital fly-by-wire systems and relaxed static stability gave military aircraft increased manoeuvrability without sacrificing safety or flyability. Advanced tactical manoeuvres such as [[Pugachev's Cobra]] became possible.

===Missiles===
Digital technology allowed missile guidance systems to shrink in size and to compute and correct their flight path en route. The use of onboard maps, video processing and terrain comparison ([[TERCOM]]) software gave cruise missiles unprecedented accuracy.

===Stealth===
During the postwar period, radar detection was a constant threat to the attacker. Attack aircraft developed the tactic of flying at low level, "under the radar" where they were hidden by hills and other obstacles from the radar stations. The advent of low-level radar chains, as a defence against cruise missiles, made this tactic increasingly difficult. At the same time, advances in electromagnetic radiation-absorbent materials (RAM) and electromagnetic modelling techniques offered the opportunity to develop "stealthy" aircraft which would be invisible to the defending radar. The first stealthy attack aircraft, the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] entered service in 1983. Today, stealth is a requirement for any advanced attack aircraft.{{fact|date=January 2016}}

==Ground activities==

The ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'' was established in 1999 to encourage the broadest national and international participation in the celebration of 100 years of powered flight.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/2004NtlPlan/sec1.htm |title=Executive Summary |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924020739/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/2004NtlPlan/sec1.htm |archivedate=2006-09-24 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It publicized and encouraged a number of programs, projects and events intended to educate people about the history of aviation.

===Manufacturing===
The widespread use of digital techniques throughout design and manufacture has led to a revolution in aircraft design. Now, a designer can create an aircraft, model its aerodynamic and mechanical characteristics, design the production components and have them manufactured on the shop floor, all within a single end-to-end digital domain.

The increasing use of fibre composite materials has also led to ever-larger autoclaves for applying and curing the resin which binds the structural fibres in place. Novel test and inspection techniques have also had to be developed, as the failure modes and symptoms of composite components tend to be very different from those made of metal. For example, layers of fibre can delaminate within a multi-layer component, weakening it with no outward visible sign of cracking. Where a metal skin tends to conduct the current from a lightning strike in all directions and to shield sensitive components, carbon fibre tends to conduct along the fibres and to allow more of the energy into the interior, requiring more careful design to protect critical flight components from [[lightning]] [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]].

The increasing sophistication of avionics systems has led to longer development times. In particular the use of digital flight systems such as fly-by-wire has led to an ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of the control software, which can take many years to develop and validate. During this period, any change to the aircraft's physical design may require revision and revalidation of the associated software.

===Air traffic control===

As computers became more sophisticated in the 2000s, they began to take over routine aspects of the air traffic controller's task. Up until then all air traffic in nearby airspace was tracked and displayed, with the air traffic controller responsible for monitoring its position and assessing any need for action. Modern computerised systems are capable of monitoring the flight paths of many more aircraft at a given time, allowing the controller to manage more aircraft and to focus on the decision-making and follow-up processes.

{{Wiktionary|blunger}}

A '''blunger''' is a machine commonly used in the [[pottery]] industry for mixing slip, a mixture of [[clay]] and [[water]].  A blunger usually consists of a round or octagonal tank with a mixer. Clay is added to the water-filled blunger and then mixed into a [[slurry]], which is also called [[slip (ceramics)|slip]].  The electrical charge of the clay particles is neutralized by the addition of a [[deflocculant]], which assists in keeping the particles in suspension.  This slip can be then sieved as it is emptied from the blunger.

In the potbanks around Stoke-on-Trent the blunger was fed by the "sliphouse blunger charger", who was often assisted by the "sliphouse blunger charger's mate". Different types and amounts of clay and marl had to be shovelled in manually to be mixed with water.

Blungers are often used in the [[kaolin]] mining industry to mix certain grades of [[kaolin]] clay with water.

'''Claude Chappe''' (25 December 1763 – 23 January 1805) was a French inventor who in 1792 demonstrated a practical [[semaphore line|semaphore system]] that eventually spanned all of [[France]]. This was the first practical [[telecommunication]]s system of the industrial age, making Chappe the first telecom mogul with his "mechanical internet."&lt;ref name ="beyer"&gt;Beyer, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Télégraphe Chappe - tour Jonquières 7.JPG|thumbnail|left|One example of [[Chappe telegraph]] tower, in [[Narbonne]], in the south of France.]]
Chappe was born in Brûlon, [[Sarthe]], France, the grandson of a French baron. He was raised for church service, but lost his sinecure during the [[French Revolution]]. He was educated at the ''[[Lycée Pierre Corneille (Rouen)|Lycée Pierre Corneille]]'' in Rouen.&lt;ref name="LyCo6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6|title=Lycée Pierre Corneille de Rouen - The Lycée Corneille of Rouen|author=|date=|website=lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His uncle was the astronomer [[Jean-Baptiste Chappe d'Auteroche]] famed for his observations of the [[Transit of Venus]] in 1761 and again in 1769. The first book Claude read in his youth was 
his uncle's journal of the 1761 trip, "Voyage en Siberie". His brother, Abraham, wrote "Reading this book greatly inspired him, and gave him a taste for the physical sciences. From this point on, all his studies, and even his pastimes, were focused on that subject." Because of his astronomer uncle, Claude may also have become familiar with the properties of telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/papers/Early_History_of_Data_Networks/The_Early_History_of_Data_Networks.html|title=The Early History of Data Networks|author=|date=|website=people.seas.harvard.edu|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401225210/http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/papers/Early_History_of_Data_Networks/The_Early_History_of_Data_Networks.html|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his four unemployed brothers decided to develop a practical system of semaphore relay stations, a task proposed in antiquity, yet never realized.

Claude's brother, Ignace Chappe (1760–1829) was a member of the Legislative Assembly during the [[French Revolution]]. With his help, the Assembly supported a proposal to build a relay line from Paris to Lille (fifteen stations, about 120 miles), to carry dispatches from the war.
[[File:Télégraphe Chappe 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Chappe's telegraph]]
The Chappe brothers determined by experiment that the angles of a rod were easier to see than the presence or absence of panels. Their final design had two arms connected by a cross-arm. Each arm had seven positions, and the cross-arm had four more permitting a 196-combination code. The arms were from three to thirty feet long, black, and counterweighted, moved by only two handles. Lamps mounted on the arms proved unsatisfactory for night use. The relay towers were placed from 12 to 25&amp;nbsp;km (10 to 20 miles) apart. Each tower had a telescope pointing both up and down the relay line. Chappe first called his invention the "tachygraph", which means fast writer&lt;ref name ="beyer"/&gt; but the army started the word telegraph meaning far writer coined by the statesman [[André François Miot de Mélito]].&lt;ref&gt;Le Robert historique de la langue française, 1992, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, the first messages were successfully sent between Paris and Lille.&lt;ref name="tour"&gt;French source: [http://www.saintefoyleslyon.fr/index.php?rubrique=142 Tour du télégraphe Chappe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928210813/http://www.saintefoyleslyon.fr/index.php?rubrique=142 |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794 the semaphore line informed Parisians of the capture of [[Condé-sur-l'Escaut]] from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred. Other lines were built, including a line from Paris to Toulon. The system was widely copied by other European states, and was used by [[Napoleon]] to coordinate his empire and army.&lt;ref name ="tour"/&gt;

In 1805, Claude Chappe killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106172/Claude-Chappe|title=Claude Chappe (French engineer)|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=August 7, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625025421/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106172/Claude-Chappe|archivedate=June 25, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to be depressed by illness, and claims by rivals that he had plagiarized from military semaphore systems.
[[File:Chappe semaphore.jpg|thumb|upright|Demonstration of the semaphore]]
In 1824 Ignace Chappe attempted to increase interest in using the semaphore line for commercial messages, such as commodity prices; however, the business community resisted.

In 1846, the government of France committed to a new system of [[electric telegraph]] lines. Many contemporaries warned of the ease of [[sabotage]] and interruption of service by cutting a wire. With the emergence of the electric telegraph, slowly the Chappe telegraph ended in 1852.&lt;ref name ="tour"/&gt;

==Popular culture==
The Chappe semaphore figures prominently in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. The Count bribes an underpaid 
operator to transmit a false message.

A bronze sculpture of Claude Chappe was erected at the crossing of Rue du Bac and Boulevard Raspail, in Paris. It was removed and melted down during the Nazi occupation of Paris, in 1941 or 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.messynessychic.com/2016/01/07/where-the-statues-of-paris-were-sent-to-die/|title=Where the Statues of Paris were sent to Die|author=|date=7 January 2016|website=messynessychic.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319083007/http://www.messynessychic.com/2016/01/07/where-the-statues-of-paris-were-sent-to-die/|archivedate=19 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corrinne Yu''' is an [[United States|American]] [[game programmer]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Yu attended [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] to study [[electrical engineering]] before beginning her career as a professional programmer.&lt;ref name="allgame bio"/&gt;

===Game development===
Yu's early career was as a programmer for the ''[[King's Quest]]'' series for the [[Apple II]] although she had her own [[3D engine]] projects that she sold to various companies.&lt;ref name=ch9/&gt; She programmed for [[QuickDraw 3D]], an early [[rasterisation]] [[Application programming interface|API]].&lt;ref name=ch9/&gt; She worked on the game ''Zombie'', and created the video game engine used in ''Spec Ops''.&lt;ref name=zombie/&gt; In November 1997, she was employed by video game developer [[Ion Storm]].&lt;ref name="allgame bio"/&gt; She worked on the 2001 video game ''[[Anachronox]]'' and served as Director of Technology at the studio.&lt;ref name="allgame bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fast"/&gt; While at Ion she was responsible for the ''[[Quake 2]]'' code base used in their games and any games based on that engine.&lt;ref name="quake"/&gt; In November 1998, she left Ion Storm and later became the Lead Technology Programmer at [[3D Realms]].&lt;ref name="allgame bio"/&gt; Yu worked as an engine programmer at [[Gearbox Software]], creator of ''[[Brothers in Arms (series)|Brothers in Arms]]'' and ''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]''. Yu worked to heavily modify the Epic [[Unreal Engine]] 3 with an emphasis on lighting, shadows and physics.&lt;ref name=borderlands/&gt; Yu was a founding member of Microsoft's [[Direct 3D]] Advisory Board. She participated in [[CUDA]] and [[GPU]] simulation at [[NVidia]].&lt;ref name=gaspowered/&gt;

In 2008, [[Microsoft Studios]] hired Yu as the Principal Engine Architect for an internal studio, [[343 Industries]].&lt;ref name="kotaku1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku2"/&gt; 343 Industries was established in 2007 to oversee the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' franchise following [[Bungie]]'s separation from Microsoft. Yu programmed lighting, facial animation, and developed new technology for the 2012 video game ''[[Halo 4]]''.&lt;ref name=award/&gt; While coding on Halo team, Yu researched new lighting techniques, and invented new dynamic radiosity algorithms. Microsoft applied a software patent for Yu's Halo lighting work.&lt;ref name=radiosity/&gt;

In November 2013, Yu joined [[video game developer]] [[Naughty Dog]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], to work as a graphic programmer on [[PlayStation 4]] projects.&lt;ref name="naughtydog"/&gt; In November 2014, she left Naughty Dog and joined [[Amazon.com]] to work on their [[Amazon Prime Air]] program.&lt;ref name="polygon_amazon" /&gt; In March 2018, she left Amazon and joined [[General Motors]] as a VP of Engineering.

===Other works and awards===
Besides working as a [[game programmer]], Yu programmed on the [[Space Shuttle program]] at [[Rockwell International|Rockwell International California]]. She designed and conducted accelerator experiments at [[LINAC]] in [[California]] and the accelerator at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. Her [[nuclear physics]] research won her a national award from the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].

The '''decibel''' (symbol: dB) is a [[logarithmic unit|unit]] of measurement used to express the ratio of one value of a [[physical property]] to another on a logarithmic scale. It can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&amp;nbsp;dB or &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a reference value; when used in this way, the decibel symbol should be appended with a suffix that indicates the reference value, or some other property. For example, if the reference value is 1&amp;nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is "[[#Voltage|V]]" (e.g., "20&amp;nbsp;dBV"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is "[[dBm|m]]" (e.g., "20&amp;nbsp;dBm").&lt;ref name="clqgmk"/&gt;

There are two different scales used when expressing a ratio in decibels depending on the nature of the quantities: [[Field, power, and root-power quantities|power and field (root-power)]]. When expressing power quantities, the number of decibels is ten times the [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]] of the ratio of two power quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |ISBN=0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&amp;nbsp;dB change in [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]]. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&amp;nbsp;dB change in level. The extra factor of two is due to the logarithm of the quadratic relationship between power and amplitude. The decibel scales differ so that direct comparisons can be made between related power and field quantities when they are expressed in decibels.

The definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.

In the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a [[unit of measurement]] for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the  [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.&lt;ref name="standardization2006"&gt;{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==
The decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally ''Miles of Standard Cable'' (MSC). 1&amp;nbsp;MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1&amp;nbsp;[[mile]] (approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000&amp;nbsp;[[radian]]s per second (795.8&amp;nbsp;Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was "a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88&amp;nbsp;Ohms per loop-mile and uniformly distributed [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitance]] of 0.054&amp;nbsp;[[microfarad]]s per mile" (approximately corresponding to 19&amp;nbsp;[[wire gauge|gauge]] wire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Kenneth Simonds |title=Transmission Circuits for Telephonic Communication: Methods of analysis and design |date=1944 |publisher=[[D. Van Nostrand Co.]] |location=New York |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] received favorable response to a new unit definition among members of the [[International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony]] in Europe and replaced the MSC with the ''Transmission Unit'' (TU). 1&amp;nbsp;TU was defined such that the number of TUs was ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of measured power to a reference power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sound system engineering |edition=2nd |author-first1=Don |author-last1=Davis |author-first2=Carolyn |author-last2=Davis |publisher=[[Focal Press]] |date=1997 |isbn=978-0-240-80305-0 |page=35 |url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=9mAUp5IC5AMC|page=35}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The definition was conveniently chosen such that 1&amp;nbsp;TU approximated 1&amp;nbsp;MSC; specifically, 1&amp;nbsp;MSC was 1.056&amp;nbsp;TU. In 1928, the Bell system renamed the TU into the decibel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Bell Laboratories Record |title='TU' becomes 'Decibel' |author-first=R. V.

It was named the ''bel'', in honor of the telecommunications pioneer [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-last=Martin |author-first=W.

Since the earliest days of the telephone, the need for a unit in which to measure the transmission efficiency of telephone facilities has been recognized. The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the "mile of standard" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the "decibel" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.

The decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;0.1&lt;/sup&gt; and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;''N''(0.1)&lt;/sup&gt;. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&amp;nbsp;...}}

In 1954, C. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name 'logit' for "standard magnitudes which combine by addition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C.

In April&amp;nbsp;2003, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) considered a recommendation for the inclusion of the decibel in the [[International System of Units]] (SI), but decided against the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CC/CCU/CCU16.pdf |publisher=Consultative Committee for Units |title=Meeting minutes |at=Section 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decibel is recognized by other international bodies such as the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and [[International Organization for Standardization]]  (ISO).&lt;ref name="IEC60027-3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 |title=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units |id=IEC&amp;nbsp;60027-3, Ed.&amp;nbsp;3.0 |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission |date=19 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEC permits the use of the decibel with field quantities as well as power and this recommendation is followed by many national standards bodies, such as [[NIST]], which justifies the use of the decibel for voltage ratios.&lt;ref name="NIST2008"/&gt;  The term ''field quantity'' is [[deprecation|deprecated]] by ISO 80000-1, which favors [[#Field quantities and root-power quantities|root-power]]. In spite of their widespread use, [[#Suffixes and reference values|suffixes]] (such as in [[A-weighting|dBA]] or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.

==Definition==
ISO 80000-3 describes definitions for quantities and units of space and time. The decibel for use in acoustics is defined in ISO 80000-8. The major difference from the article below is that for acoustics the decibel has no absolute value.

The ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-3:2006]] defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: {{nobreak|1=1 dB = 0.1 B}}. The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nobreak|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nobreak|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nobreak|1=1 dB = 0.11513… Np = 0.11513…}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.

Therefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;1/10&lt;/sup&gt;, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|20}}&lt;/sup&gt; (1.12202).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[…] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=206 |isbn=0-12-772690-X |quote=[…] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.  Thus, five one-thousandths of a bel would normally be written '0.05&amp;nbsp;dB', and not '5 mB'.&lt;ref&gt;Fedor Mitschke, ''Fiber Optics: Physics and Technology'', Springer, 2010 {{ISBN|3642037038}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of expressing a ratio as a level in decibels depends on whether the measured property is a ''power quantity'' or a ''field quantity''; see [[Field, power, and root-power quantities]] for details.

===Power quantities===
When referring to measurements of ''[[Power (physics)|power]]'' quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] in decibels by evaluating ten times the [[base-10 logarithm]] of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value. Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (reference power) is represented by ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;, that ratio expressed in decibels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is calculated using the formula:&lt;ref name="standardization2006"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_P = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nobreak|1=''P'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the above equation, then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; is negative.

Rearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
P = 10^\frac{L_P}{10\,\mathrm{dB}} P_0.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Field quantities and root-power quantities===
{{main|Field, power, and root-power quantities}}
When referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and it is desirable for the two decibel formulations to give the same result in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:
:&lt;math&gt;
L_F = \ln\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB} = 20 \log_{10} \left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The formula may be rearranged to give
:&lt;math&gt;
F = 10^\frac{L_F}{20\,\mathrm{dB}} F_0.
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is held constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
G_\mathrm{dB} = 20 \log_{10}\!\left (\frac{V}{V_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the voltage being measured, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a specified reference voltage, and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;dB&lt;/sub&gt; is the power gain expressed in decibels. A similar formula holds for current.

The term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.

===Conversions===
Since logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.

|}

===Examples===
All of these examples yield dimensionless answers in dB because they are relative ratios expressed in decibels. The unit dBW is often used to denote a ratio for which the reference is 1 W, and similarly dBm for a {{nobreak|1 mW}} reference point.
* Calculating the ratio of {{nobreak|1 kW}} (one kilowatt, or 1000 watts) to {{nobreak|1 W}} in decibels yields:
::&lt;math&gt;
G_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{1000~\mathrm{W}}{1~\mathrm{W}}\right) = 30.
&lt;/math&gt;
* The ratio of {{nobreak|1={{radic|1000}} V ≈ 31.62 V}} to {{nobreak|1 V}} in decibels is
::&lt;math&gt;
G_\mathrm{dB} = 20 \log_{10} \left(\frac{31.62~\mathrm{V}}{1~\mathrm{V}}\right) = 30.
&lt;/math&gt;
{{nobreak|1=(31.62 V/1 V)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 1 kW/1 W}}, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that ''G''&lt;sub&gt;dB&lt;/sub&gt; has the same value, 30, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.
* The ratio of {{nobreak|1 mW}} (one milliwatt) to {{nobreak|10 W}} in decibels is obtained with the formula
::&lt;math&gt;
G_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{0.001~\mathrm{W}}{10~\mathrm{W}}\right) = -40.
&lt;/math&gt;
* The power ratio corresponding to a {{nobreak|3 dB}} change in level is given by
::&lt;math&gt;
G = 10^\frac{3}{10} \times 1 = 1.99526... \approx 2.
&lt;/math&gt;

A change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of {{nobreak|10 dB}}. A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&amp;nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is ±3.0103&amp;nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to "3&amp;nbsp;dB" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nobr|{{sqrt|2}} ≈ 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as "6&amp;nbsp;dB" rather than ±6.0206&amp;nbsp;dB.

Should it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.00&amp;nbsp;dB is a power ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|3|10}}&lt;/sup&gt;, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.00&amp;nbsp;dB is the power ratio is {{nobr|10&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|6|10}}&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.

==Properties==
The decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.

===Reporting large ratios===
The [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a similar manner to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See [[Bode plot]] and [[semi-log plot]].  For example, 120&amp;nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than "a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing".

===Representation of multiplication operations===
Level values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, log(''A''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''C'') = log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&amp;nbsp;dB is approximately 26% power gain, 3&amp;nbsp;dB is approximately 2× power gain, and 10&amp;nbsp;dB is 10× power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:
*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&amp;nbsp;dB, 8&amp;nbsp;dB, and 7&amp;nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&amp;nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&amp;nbsp;dB, this is:
*:: 25&amp;nbsp;dB = 10&amp;nbsp;dB + 10&amp;nbsp;dB + 3&amp;nbsp;dB + 1&amp;nbsp;dB + 1&amp;nbsp;dB
*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately
*:: 1&amp;nbsp;W × 10 × 10 × 2 × 1.26 × 1.26  ≈ 317.5&amp;nbsp;W
*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&amp;nbsp;W × 10&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|25|10}}&lt;/sup&gt; = 316.2&amp;nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.
However, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.&lt;ref name="Hickling"&gt;R. Hickling (1999), Noise Control and SI Units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3048&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Addition}}Representation of addition operations===
{{Details|Logarithmic addition}}
According to Mitschke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fiber Optics |publisher=Springer |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The advantage of using a logarithmic measure is that in a transmission chain, there are many elements concatenated, and each has its own gain or attenuation. To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors." However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Peters, ''Acoustics and Noise Control'', Routledge, November 12, 2013, 400 pages, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; "if two machines each individually produce a [sound pressure] level of, say, 90&amp;nbsp;dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93&amp;nbsp;dB, but certainly not to 180&amp;nbsp;dB!"  "suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87&amp;nbsp;dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83&amp;nbsp;dBA. ... the machine noise [level (alone)] may be obtained by 'subtracting' the 83&amp;nbsp;dBA background noise from the combined level of 87&amp;nbsp;dBA; i.e., 84.8&amp;nbsp;dBA." "in order to find a representative value of the sound level in a room a number of measurements are taken at different positions within the room, and an average value is calculated. (...) Compare the logarithmic and arithmetic averages of ... 70&amp;nbsp;dB and 90&amp;nbsp;dB: [[logarithmic average]] = 87&amp;nbsp;dB; [[arithmetic average]] = 80&amp;nbsp;dB."

Addition on a logarithmic scale is called [[logarithmic addition]], and can be defined by taking exponentials to convert to a linear scale, adding there, and then taking logarithms to return. For example, where operations on decibels are logarithmic addition/subtraction and logarithmic multiplication/division, while operations on the linear scale are the usual operations:
:&lt;math&gt;87\,\mathrm{dBA} - 83\,\mathrm{dBA} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\bigl(10^{87/10} - 10^{83/10}\bigr)\,\mathrm{dBA} \approx 84.8\,\mathrm{dBA}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
M_\mathrm{lm}(70, 90) &amp;= \left(70\,\mathrm{dBA} + 90\,\mathrm{dBA}\right)/2 \\
&amp;= 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\bigl(10^{70/10} + 10^{90/10}\bigr)/2\right)\,\mathrm{dBA} \\
&amp;= 10 \cdot \left(\log_{10}\bigl(10^{70/10} + 10^{90/10}\bigr) - \log_{10} 2\right)\,\mathrm{dBA}
\approx 87\,\mathrm{dBA}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the logarithmic mean is obtained from the logarithmic sum by subtracting &lt;math&gt;10\log_{10} 2&lt;/math&gt;, since logarithmic division is linear subtraction.

==Uses==

===Perception===
The human perception of the intensity of sound and light approximates the logarithm of intensity rather than a linear relationship ([[Weber–Fechner law]]), making the dB scale a useful measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=1SMXAAAAQBAJ |page=268 |title=Sensation and Perception}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=BggrpTek5kAC |page=SA19-PA9 |title=Introduction to Understandable Physics, Volume 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=ukvei0wge_8C |page=356 |title=Visual Perception: Physiology, Psychology, and Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=-QIfF9q6Q_EC |page=407 |title=Exercise Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=oUNfSjS11ggC |page=83 |title=Foundations of Perception}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=w888Mw1dh_EC |page=304 |title=Fitting The Task To The Human}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustics===
[[File:300x0w(3).jpg|thumb|Examples of sound levels in decibels from various sound sources and activities, taken from the "How loud is too loud" screen of the NIOSH Sound Level Meter app]]
The decibel is commonly used in [[acoustics]] as a unit of [[sound pressure level]]. The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are [[Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure|common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure]]. Sound pressure is a field quantity, therefore the field version of the unit definition is used:
:&lt;math&gt;
L_p = 20 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{p_{\mathrm{rms}}}{p_{\mathrm{ref}}}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[root mean square]] of the measured sound pressure in [[pascals]] and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard reference sound pressure of 20 [[micropascal]]s in air or 1 micropascal in water.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 1683:2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the decibel in underwater acoustics leads to confusion, in part because of this difference in reference value.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Clay (1999), Underwater sound transmission and SI units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3047&lt;/ref&gt;

The human ear has a large [[dynamic range]] in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509092930/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |archive-date=9 May 2016 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in [[logarithmic scale]]: the base-10 logarithm of 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120&amp;nbsp;dB re 20&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|μPa]].

Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|kHz]], are factored more heavily into some measurements using [[frequency weighting]]. (See also [[Stevens' power law]].)

The main instrument used for measuring sound levels in the environment and in the workplace is the [[Sound level meter|Sound Level Meter]]. Most sound level meters provide readings in A, C, and Z-weighted decibels and must meet international standards such as [[IEC 61672|IEC 61672 - 2013]]. 

According to Hickling, "Decibels are a useless affectation, which is impeding the development of noise control as an engineering discipline".&lt;ref name="Hickling"/&gt;

===Electronics===
In electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios ([[Gain (electronics)|gains]]), in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].

The decibel unit can also be combined with a suffix to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with "m" for "milliwatt" to produce the "[[dBm]]".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&amp;nbsp;mW).

In professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&amp;nbsp;mW (0&amp;nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&amp;nbsp;mW&amp;times;600&amp;nbsp;Ω }} ≈ 0.775&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].

===Optics===
In an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&amp;nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.&lt;ref&gt;

In spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to −1 B.

===Video and digital imaging===
In connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20 log of the ratio, even when the represented optical power is directly proportional to the voltage, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.&lt;ref&gt;

Thus, a camera [[signal-to-noise ratio]] or [[dynamic range]] quoted as 40&amp;nbsp;dB represents a power ratio of 100:1 between signal power and noise power, not 10,000:1.&lt;ref&gt;

However, as mentioned above, the 10 log intensity convention prevails more generally in physical optics,  including fiber optics, so the terminology can become murky between the conventions of digital photographic technology and physics. Most commonly, quantities called "dynamic range" or "signal-to-noise" (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.

Photographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.

==Suffixes and reference values{{anchor|Suffixes}}==
Suffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.

In cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as "absolute". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.

The SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.&lt;ref name=NIST2008&gt;Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, "Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel", ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition'', NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The proper way, according to the [[IEC 60027-3]],&lt;ref name="IEC60027-3"/&gt; is either as ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (re ''x''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;) or as ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''/''x''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''x'' is the quantity symbol and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; (re  1 μV/m) = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''E''/(1 μV/m)&lt;/sub&gt; for the [[electric field strength]] ''E'' relative to 1 μV/m reference value.

Outside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol ("W","K","m"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol ("uV" instead of μV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name ("sm" for square meter, "m" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated ("i" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, "λ" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity ("A" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a dash (dB-Hz), with a space (dB HL), with no intervening character (dBm), or enclosed in parentheses, dB(sm).

===Voltage===
Since the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measures of pressure (a field quantity) use the factor of 20, and the measures of power (e.g. dB SIL and dB SWL) use the factor of 10.
;dB SPL: dB SPL ([[sound pressure level]]) – for sound in air and other gases, relative to 20 micropascals (μPa) = 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; Pa, approximately the quietest sound a human can hear.  For [[Underwater acoustics|sound in water]] and other liquids, a reference pressure of 1 μPa is used.&lt;ref&gt;Morfey, C. L. (2001). Dictionary of Acoustics. Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;{{paragraphbreak}} An RMS sound pressure of one pascal corresponds to a level of 94&amp;nbsp;dB SPL.
;dB SIL: dB [[sound intensity level]] – relative to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is roughly the [[threshold of human hearing]] in air.
;dB SWL: dB [[sound power level]] – relative to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;W.
;dBA, dBB, and dBC: These symbols are often used to denote the use of different [[weighting filter]]s, used to approximate the human ear's [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] to sound, although the measurement is still in dB (SPL). These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dB&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or [[A-weighting|dB(A)]]. According to ANSI standards,&lt;ref&gt;[[ANSI]], [https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/002/ansi.s1.4.1983.pdf S1.4-19823 Specification for Sound Level Meters], 2.3 Sound Level, p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the preferred usage is to write L&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = x dB.  Nevertheless, the units dBA and dB(A) are still commonly used as a shorthand for A-weighted measurements. Compare [[dBc]], used in telecommunications.
;dB HL: dB hearing level is used in [[audiogram]]s as a measure of hearing loss. The reference level varies with frequency according to a [[minimum audibility curve]] as defined in ANSI and other standards, such that the resulting audiogram shows deviation from what is regarded as 'normal' hearing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;[[dBFS]]: dB([[full scale]]) – the [[amplitude]] of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] occurs. Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] or alternatively a full-scale [[square wave]]. A signal measured with reference to a full-scale sine-wave will appear 3&amp;nbsp;dB weaker when referenced to a full-scale square wave, thus: 0&amp;nbsp;dBFS(fullscale sine wave) = −3&amp;nbsp;dBFS(fullscale square wave).

===Antenna measurements===
;dBi: dB(isotropic) – the forward [[Antenna gain|gain of an antenna]] compared with the hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]], which uniformly distributes energy in all directions. [[Linear polarization]] of the EM field is assumed unless noted otherwise.
;dBd: dB(dipole) – the forward gain of an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] compared with a half-wave [[dipole antenna]]. 0&amp;nbsp;dBd = 2.15&amp;nbsp;dBi
;dBiC: dB(isotropic circular) – the forward gain of an antenna compared to a [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] isotropic antenna. There is no fixed conversion rule between dBiC and dBi, as it depends on the receiving antenna and the field polarization.
;dBq: dB(quarterwave) – the forward gain of an antenna compared to a quarter wavelength whip. Rarely used, except in some marketing material. 0&amp;nbsp;dBq = −0.85&amp;nbsp;dBi

;dBm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;: dB(m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) – decibel relative to reciprocal of meter: measure of the [[antenna factor]].

===Other measurements===
;dB-Hz: dB(Hz) – bandwidth relative to one hertz. E.g., 20&amp;nbsp;dB-Hz corresponds to a bandwidth of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz. Commonly used in [[link budget]] calculations. Also used in [[carrier-to-receiver noise density|carrier-to-noise-density ratio]] (not to be confused with [[carrier-to-noise ratio]], in dB).
;[[DBFS|dBov or dBO]]: dB(overload) – the [[amplitude]] of a signal (usually audio) compared with the maximum which a device can handle before [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] occurs.  Similar to dBFS, but also applicable to analog systems. According to ITU-T Rec. G.100.1 the Level in dBov of a digital system is defined as:: &lt;math&gt;L_\mathrm{ov} = 10\log_{10}\left ( \frac{P}{P_0} \right )\ [\mathrm{dBov}]&lt;/math&gt;, with the maximum signal power &lt;math&gt;P_0=1.0&lt;/math&gt;, for a rectangular signal with the maximum amplitude &lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{over}&lt;/math&gt;. The level of a tone with a digital amplitude (peak value) of &lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{over}&lt;/math&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;L= -3.01\ \text{dBov}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Rec.

;dBr: dB(relative) – simply a relative difference from something else, which is made apparent in context.  The difference of a filter's response to nominal levels, for instance.
;[[dBrn]]: dB above [[reference noise]].  See also '''dBrnC'''
;dBrnC: '''dBrnC''' represents an audio level measurement, typically in a telephone circuit, relative to the [[circuit noise level]], with the measurement of this level frequency-weighted by a standard C-message weighting filter.

;[[dBFS]]: dB([[full scale]]) – the [[amplitude]] of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] occurs. Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] or alternatively a full-scale [[square wave]]. A signal measured with reference to a full-scale sine-wave will appear 3&amp;nbsp;dB weaker when referenced to a full-scale square wave, thus: 0&amp;nbsp;dBFS(fullscale sine wave) = −3&amp;nbsp;dBFS(fullscale square wave).
;dBG: G-weighted spectrum
;dBi: dB(isotropic) – the forward [[Antenna gain|gain of an antenna]] compared with the hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]], which uniformly distributes energy in all directions. [[Linear polarization]] of the EM field is assumed unless noted otherwise.
;dBiC: dB(isotropic circular) – the forward gain of an antenna compared to a [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] isotropic antenna. There is no fixed conversion rule between dBiC and dBi, as it depends on the receiving antenna and the field polarization.
;dBJ: energy relative to 1 [[joule]]. 1 joule = 1 watt second = 1 watt per hertz, so [[power spectral density]] can be expressed in dBJ.
;dBk: dB(kW) – power relative to 1 [[kilowatt]].
;dBK:'''dB(K)''' – decibels relative to [[kelvin]]: Used to express [[noise temperature]].
;[[dBm]]: dB(mW) – power relative to 1 [[milliwatt]]. 
;[[dBm0]]: Power in dBm measured at a zero transmission level point.
;dBm0s: Defined by  Recommendation ITU-R V.574.
;dBmV: dB(mV&lt;sub&gt;[[root mean square|RMS]]&lt;/sub&gt;) – [[volt]]age relative to 1 millivolt across 75 Ω.
;dBo: dB optical. A change of 1 dBo in optical power can result in a change of up to 2 dBe in electrical signal power in system that is thermal noise limited.
;dBO: see dBov 
;dBov or dBO: dB(overload) – the [[amplitude]] of a signal (usually audio) compared with the maximum which a device can handle before [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] occurs.  
;dBpp: relative to the peak to peak sound pressure.
;dBpp: relative to the maximum value of the peak power.
;dBq: dB(quarterwave) – the forward gain of an antenna compared to a quarter wavelength whip. Rarely used, except in some marketing material. 0&amp;nbsp;dBq = −0.85&amp;nbsp;dBi
;dBr: dB(relative) – simply a relative difference from something else, which is made apparent in context.  The difference of a filter's response to nominal levels, for instance.
;[[dBrn]]: dB above [[reference noise]].  See also '''dBrnC'''
;dBrnC: '''dBrnC''' represents an audio level measurement, typically in a telephone circuit, relative to the [[circuit noise level]], with the measurement of this level frequency-weighted by a standard C-message weighting filter.  The C-message weighting filter was chiefly used in North America.  
;dBsm: dB(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) – decibel relative to one square meter
;dBTP: dB(true peak) – [[peak amplitude]] of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs.
;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{0.6}\,\mathrm V\, \approx 0.7746\,\mathrm V\, \approx -2.218\,\mathrm{dBV}&lt;/math&gt;}}.
;dBu0s: Defined by  Recommendation ITU-R V.574.
;dBuV: see dBμV
;dBuV/m: see dBμV/m
;dBv: see dBu 
;dBV: dB(V&lt;sub&gt;[[root mean square|RMS]]&lt;/sub&gt;) – [[volt]]age relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance.
;dBVU: dB volume unit
;dBW: dB(W) – power relative to 1 [[watt]].
;[[DBZ (meteorology)|dBZ]]: dB(Z) – decibel relative to Z = 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
;dBμ: see dBμV/m
;dBμV or dBuV: dB(μV&lt;sub&gt;[[root mean square|RMS]]&lt;/sub&gt;) – [[volt]]age relative to 1 microvolt.
;dBμV/m, dBuV/m, or dBμ: dB(μV/m) – [[electric field strength]] relative to 1 [[microvolt]] per [[meter]].

====Suffixes preceded by a space====
;dB HL: dB hearing level is used in [[audiogram]]s as a measure of hearing loss. 
;dB Q: sometimes used to denote weighted noise level
;dB SIL: dB [[sound intensity level]] – relative to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
;dB SPL: dB SPL ([[sound pressure level]]) – for sound in air and other gases, relative to 20 μPa in air or μPa in water
;dB SWL: dB [[sound power level]] – relative to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;W.

====Suffixes within parentheses====
;dB(A), dB(B), and dB(C): These symbols are often used to denote the use of different [[weighting filter]]s, used to approximate the human ear's [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] to sound, although the measurement is still in dB (SPL). These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dB&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or [[A-weighting|dBA]].

====Other suffixes====
;dB-Hz: dB(Hz) – bandwidth relative to one hertz. 
;dB/K: dB(K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) – decibels relative to [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[kelvin]]
;dBm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;: dB(m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) – decibel relative to reciprocal of meter: measure of the [[antenna factor]].

==Related units==
;mBm:mB(mW) – power relative to 1 [[milliwatt]], in millibels (one hundredth of a decibel). 100 mBm = 1 dBm. This unit is in the Wi-Fi drivers of the [[Linux]] kernel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/iw#Setting_TX_power|title=en:users:documentation:iw [Linux Wireless]|author=|date=|website=wireless.kernel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regulatory domain sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penturalabs.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/is-your-wifi-ap-missing-channels-12-13/|title=Is your WiFi AP Missing Channels 12 &amp; 13?|author=|date=16 May 2013|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Np''' or '''cNp'''
:Another closely related unit is the [[neper]] (Np) or centineper (cNp).  Like the decibel, the neper is a unit of [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]].&lt;ref name="standardization2006"/&gt; The linear approximation of 1&amp;nbsp;cNp being equivalent to 1% for small percentage differences is widely used in financial mathematics, specifically the [[Fisher equation]].

:&lt;math&gt;1\ {\rm Np} = 20 \log_{10} e \ {\rm dB} \approx 8{.}685889638 \ {\rm dB} \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Fractions==
[[Attenuation]] constants, in fields such as [[optical fiber]] communication and [[radio propagation]] [[path loss]], are often expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or ratio to distance of transmission. ''dB/m'' means decibels per meter, ''dB/mi'' is decibels per mile, for example. These quantities are to be manipulated obeying the rules of [[dimensional analysis]], e.g., a 100-meter run with a 3.5&amp;nbsp;dB/km fiber yields a loss of 0.35&amp;nbsp;dB = 3.5&amp;nbsp;dB/km × 0.1&amp;nbsp;km.

'''DevLab''' ('''Development laboratory''') is a research center headquartered in [[Eindhoven]], The [[Netherlands]]. It is an [[Business alliance|alliance]] of thirteen [[Small and Medium Enterprises]]. In close co-operation with universities, with a network of professors and lectors, research projects are carried out by graduation students, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] students, and employees of the member SMEs. With this concept DevLab is also partner in larger consortia, together with industry, universities and other research institutes.

==History==
The Development Club is one of the clusters of the Federation of Technology Branches in the Netherlands, FHI, within the branch industrial electronics. It is a network of approximately 45 technology companies working on product development in the field of electronics, mechatronics, embedded software and industrial design. The Development Club is the source of the idea to set up a co-operation where scientific research will be carried out, by and for the member companies. This eventually led to the foundation in 2004 of DevLab, Development Laboratories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6007">'''Double-spending''' is a potential flaw in a [[Digital currency|digital cash]] scheme in which the same single digital token can be spent more than once. Unlike physical cash, a digital token consists of a digital file that can be duplicated or falsified.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090174 The Double Spending Problem and Cryptocurrencies]. ''Banking &amp; Insurance Journal.'' Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 24 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/teaching/modules06/netsec/lectures/DigitalCash.html|title=Digital Cash|author=Mark Ryan|publisher=School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham|accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[counterfeit money]], such double-spending leads to [[inflation]] by creating a new amount of copied currency that did not previously exist. This devalues the currency relative to other monetary units or goods and diminishes user trust as well as the [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] and retention of the currency. Fundamental cryptographic techniques to prevent double-spending, while preserving anonymity in a transaction, are [[blind signature]]s and, particularly in offline systems, [[Secret sharing|secret splitting]].&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;

A ''double spending attack'', is a potential attack against cryptocurrencies that has happened to [[2018 double-spend attacks on Equihash-based cryptocurrencies|several cryptocurrencies]], e.g. due to the [[51% attack]]. While it hasn't happened against many of the largest cryptocurrencies, such as [[Bitcoin]] (with even the capability arising for it in 2014&lt;!--[[Ghash.io]] [[mining pool]] got up to 51%--&gt;), it has happened to one of its [[List of bitcoin forks|forks]], [[Bitcoin Gold]], then 26th largest cryptocurrency.

==Prevention==
The prevention of double-spending attack has taken two general forms: centralized and decentralized.

===Centralized===
This is usually implemented using an [[online]] central [[trusted third party]] that can verify whether a token has been spent.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; This normally represents a [[single point of failure]] from both availability and trust viewpoints.

===Decentralized===
By 2007, a number of [[distributed system]]s for the prevention of double-spending had been proposed.{{r|prop2007}}{{r|prop2008}}

The [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin]] implemented a solution in early 2009. It uses a [[cryptographic protocol]] called a [[proof-of-work system]] to avoid the need for a trusted third party to validate transactions. Instead, transactions are recorded in a public [[ledger]] called a [[blockchain]]. A transaction is considered valid when it is included in the blockchain that contains the greatest amount of computational work. This makes double-spending more difficult as the size of the overall network grows.{{r|Kopfstein}} Other cryptocurrencies also have similar features.

Decentralized currencies that rely on blockchain are vulnerable to the {{vanchor|51% attack}}, in which a malicious actor can rewrite the ledger if they control enough of the computational work being done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/24/proof-work-51-percent-attacks/|title=Why Proof-of-work isn’t suitable for small cryptocurrencies|last=Varshney|first=Neer|date=2018-05-24|work=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one could theoretically spend cryptocurrency then erase the transaction so it appears it never happened. In May 2018, this double-spending technique was used against [[Bitcoin Gold]], the 26th largest cryptocurrency,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40577194/bitcoin-gold-loses-millions-as-its-hit-by-a-double-spend-attack|title=Bitcoin Gold loses millions as it is hit by a double spend attack|date=2018-05-24|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to defraud cryptocurrency exchanges of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="btgannouncement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forum.bitcoingold.org/t/double-spend-attack-on-exchanges/1362|title=Double Spend Attack on Exchanges|website=The Bitcoin Gold Community Forum|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, exchanges repeatedly raised the threshold needed to confirm a transaction, but the attacker had enough computing power to exceed those thresholds and continued double-spending for three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-makes-over-18-million-in-double-spend-attack-on-bitcoin-gold-network/|title=Hacker Makes Over $18 Million in Double-Spend Attack on Bitcoin Gold Network|work=BleepingComputer|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btgannouncement" /&gt;

The '''Dynamic Combustion Chamber''' is an engine that allows for the combustion of gases in a vacuum or under pressure, eliminating the production of air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt; USPTO Application Number:20070224563 (Glasgow; Carl W., September 27, 2007) http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnu &lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a clean renewable source of electricity, the Dynamic Combustion Chamber would serve as a battery to store and discharge electricity when needed. This would fill in the gaps that sources of electricity such as wind and solar have during different time periods, and replace [[w:Peaking power plant|peaker plants]] or fossil fuel based power plants which supply electricity to the grid when there is a shortage.   

==How it works==

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:SOGConceptualSteamBroiler.gif|thumb|right|Cutaway of Dynamic Combustion Chamber]] --&gt;

Hydrogen and Oxygen gas are fed into a vacuum inside a chamber. The hydrogen is combusted with oxygen
to form water and heat. A heat exchanger is inside the chamber to remove the heat from the chamber.
The heat exchanger has water inside which is boiled to make steam. The steam can be used to create
electricity through a [[w:turbine|turbine]] and [[w:electrical generator|generator]], or it can be used as a source of heat. The water created in the chamber can be recycled for creating steam or for electrolysis.

==Prototypes==

SOG R&amp;D Corporation, the company which holds the patents on the Dynamic Combustion Chamber, has contracted the Hydrogen Production and Utilization Laboratory at University of California, Davis to perform the testing. A lab bench scale model was built and verified that it produced steam and also that there were no pollutants formed during the process. &lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul (2008)."Analysis of H2-O2 Combustion under various pressures in the SOG Dynamic combustion chamber"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Typically combustion based engines use the air as their source of oxygen. The problem with using
air is that it contains other gases than oxygen. Gases such as nitrogen react with oxygen at high
temperatures to form pollutants. By moving the combustion reaction inside a vacuum and using pure
oxygen, there are no pollutants formed during the reaction. 

Requiring pure oxygen limits the portability and usability of the Dynamic Combustion Chamber. A vehicle would need to carry a tank of hydrogen and oxygen. Competing technologies such as [[w:Fuel Cells|Fuel Cells]] can use hydrogen and air, however using air instead of pure oxygen makes fuel cells less efficient. Considering the need for pure oxygen as well as hydrogen, hydrolysis or
splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, seems to be the most practical source of reactants. 

To generate electricity a turbine with a generator is necessary. A fuel cell can generate electricity directly, removing extra moving parts. Since fuel cells do not have any moving parts they  do not lose energy to friction. Fuel cells generate heat as well as electricity which reduces their efficiency.

==Potential uses==

Just like other engines the Dynamic Combustion Chamber needs a source of fuel. There has been some controversy about whether hydrogen technology actually reduces pollution or just moves it to a more central source such as a power plant. By using clean renewable sources such as wind or solar, hydrogen can be produced without any pollution. This hydrogen can be transported or consumed later when needed. This adds to the portability and usability of an electricity source. Commonly in the electrical [[w:Electric power transmission|grid]] there are [[w:Base load power plant|base load power]] plants and [[w:Peaking power plant|peaker plants]].Using hydrogen as an energy storage medium would reduce emissions as peaker plants are particularly inefficient.

'''Dynamit Nobel AG''' is a German chemical and weapons company whose headquarters is in [[Troisdorf]], Germany. It was founded in 1865 by [[Alfred Nobel]].

==Creation==
After the death of his younger brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]] in an 1864 [[nitroglycerin]] explosion at the family's armaments factory in [[Heleneborg]], [[Stockholm]], Nobel founded '''Nitroglycerin AB''' in Vinterviken, Stockholm. A year later, having found some German business partners, he launched the '''Alfred Nobel &amp; Company''' in Germany, building an isolated factory in the Krümmel hills of [[Geesthacht]] near Hamburg. This business exported a liquid combination of nitroglycerin and [[gunpowder]] known as "Blasting Oil", but it was extremely unstable and difficult to transport, as shown in numerous catastrophes. The buildings of the Krümmel factory itself were destroyed in 1866 and again in 1870.&lt;ref name="nobelprize"/&gt;

In April 1866, the company shipped three unmarked crates of nitroglycerin to California for the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], who wished to experiment with its blasting capability to speed the construction of a tunnel through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] for the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]].&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tcrr/peopleevents/e_nitro.html|title=Nitroglycerin . Transcontinental Railroad . WGBH American Experience &amp;#124; PBS|publisher=pbs.org|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the crates exploded, destroying a [[Wells Fargo]] office in [[San Francisco]] and killing fifteen people, leading to a complete ban on the transport of liquid nitroglycerin in California.

Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere as well, and this finally led to Alfred Nobel &amp; Company's development of [[dynamite]] in 1867, made by mixing the nitroglycerin with the [[diatomaceous earth]] (''kieselguhr'') found in the Krümmel hills. Competitors{{which|date=September 2015}} tried to mix nitroglycerin with other inert absorbents in many different combinations to get around Nobel's tightly controlled patents.

===From 1865 to 1918===
Dynamit Nobel AG originates from the company Alfred Nobel &amp; Co., founded on 21 June 1865 in [[Hamburg]] by the Swedish chemist and industrialist [[Alfred Nobel]].&lt;ref name="vie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/biographical/timeline/|title=Alfred Nobel Timeline|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning, the company was manufacturing [[nitroglycerin]] explosives in the dynamite factory of Krümmel located in Geesthacht, near Hamburg. This factory was the first one to be located outside of Sweden.

[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|Alfred Nobel|Alfred Nobel]]

Nobel wanted to produce nitroglycerine on several sites in Europe because the transportation of explosives was very dangerous due to its well-known sensitivity to shocks.

Because of the danger associated with handling nitroglycerine, Nobel started to develop a more secure explosive commonly known as dynamite. During the experimental stage, a very severe explosion occurred in 1866 within the Krümmel factory which was nearly destroyed. He was successful in mixing nitroglycerine with [[kieselgur]] which made it less sensitive to shocks. In October 1867, Nobel filed a patent for this new explosive in Sweden, the United States of America and in the United Kingdom (the patent was not filed in Germany before 1877&lt;ref name="Troisdorf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunststoff-museum.de/index.php?id=28|title=Kunststoff Museum Troisdorf: --- Teil I, 1865 – 1900|publisher=kunststoff-museum.de|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The new explosive was marketed under the name of security powder.&lt;ref name="geschichte-s-h.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschichte-s-h.de/vonabisz/dynamit.htm|title=Gesellschaft für Schleswig-Holsteinische Geschichte|publisher=geschichte-s-h.de|accessdate=22 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731051247/http://www.geschichte-s-h.de/vonabisz/dynamit.htm|archivedate=31 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, in order to ensure a better supply of the main buyers, the mines of the region of [[Ruhr]], the company took over the Schlebusch factory in Manfort (since 1930 a district of [[Leverkusen]];&lt;ref name="Troisdorf1"/&gt; Nobel was involved in its construction since 1872 and supervised the production on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name="leverkusen.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leverkusen.com/guide/index.php?view=00114|title=Leverkusen, Dynamit Nobel|author=Andreas Born, Leverkusen, www.leverkusen.com/born|publisher=leverkusen.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1876, Nobel’s company became a limited liability company and was renamed Dynamit AG, i.e. DAG).&lt;ref name="vie"/&gt; The company started manufacturing defense equipment, and soon afterwards became the biggest manufacturer of powder and ammunitions of the [[German Reich]].

In 1884, similar to other European countries, the biggest German powder manufacturers agreed to form a cartel (here known as « Interessensgemeinschaft ») named Deutsche Union  which was led by Dynamit Nobel for five years.&lt;ref name="nobelprize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/industrial/articles/krummel/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710005656/http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/industrial/articles/krummel/index.html|archive-date=10 July 2006|dead-url=yes|title=Kr&amp;uuml;mmel|accessdate=22 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the largest manufacturers of powder of the German Reich abided by this union which prevented them from competing against each other due to their cooperation and agreement upon the export prices.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Exlosivstoffe: Nitroglyzerin und Dynamit / von Richard Escales|author=Escales, R.|date=2002|volume=3|publisher=Veit|isbn=9783831143627|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Brfvei9LceoC&amp;pg=PA295|page=295|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, they approached the English powder cartel, the Nobel Dynamite Trust Co and managed to establish the General cartel made up of both the German and English powder factories.&lt;ref name="nobelprize2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/biographical/articles/lundstrom/|title=Alfred Nobel's Dynamite Companies|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the high demand for defense equipments for the [[First World War]], the manufacturers of powder made very high profits, which were reinforced due to their cartel organisation. Furthermore, during this period, the states strongly encouraged the development and production of weapons.
In 1886, Dynamit Nobel opened a branch in Troisdorf&lt;ref name="Troisdorf1"/&gt; and as from 1905 this factory also manufactured a [[plastic]] material based on nitrocellulose (an explosive product): known as celluloid.&lt;ref name="Troisdorf2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunststoff-museum.de/index.php?id=29|title=Kunststoff Museum Troisdorf: --- Teil II: 1900 – 1945|publisher=kunststoff-museum.de|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the start of the First World War, Dynamit Nobel grew by acquiring smaller competitor companies to become the biggest explosive manufacturer in Europe. During the war, it employed prisoners of war in its factory (namely Russian prisoners in the factory of [[Dömitz]]).

Without descendants, Alfred Nobel, decided that after his death his fortune would be used to create the Nobel foundation. This was done in 1900. Each year this foundation awards the Nobel Prize. The fortune of Nobel which was converted into shares that finance the Nobel foundation.&lt;ref&gt;web|url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/will-full.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From 1918 to 1945 ===
[[File:Dynamit AG 1928.jpg|thumb|Share of the Dynamit AG, vorm. Alfred Nobel &amp; Co., issue August 1928]]
[[File:Dynamitfabrik kruemmel verwaltung.jpg|thumb|The old administrative building of the Krümmel explosive factory.]]
After the end of the war, parts of the factory’s facilities were dismantled and after the enforcement of the [[Versailles treaty]], companies were forbidden to manufacture defense equipment. As from then, the company manufactured mostly explosives destined to mines, detonators, ignition systems as well as ammunitions for hunting and sports. The end of the production of the highly profitable defense equipment caused the company to suffer from heavy financial losses. This caused the company to close down some factories while reducing the production capacities in others. In 1923, the company launched the manufacture of plastic parts made of [[nitrocellulose]]. Indeed, Dynamit Nobel aimed at reducing its dependence to the defense equipment in order to give more importance to the manufacture of chemical products.

In 1925, the Lindener Zündhütchen- und Thoonwaarenfabrik of Empelde was taken over by the Chemische Werke Lothringen GmbH, which itself belonged to [[BASF]]. Production was stopped in 1928 and did not restart until the rearmament which occurred in 1938. During the 1920s, the company collaborated closely with the Siegener Dynamitfabrik AG and the Rheinisch-Westfälischen Sprengstoff-AG which belonged to I.G. Farben since 1931.

In 1926, as a result of the fusion with Köln-Rottweil AG which belonged to ''I.G. Farben'', Dynamit Nobel was taken over by [[I.G. Farben]]. As from then, it formed a cartel with Westfalit AG (the forerunner of the WASAG, which was also taken over by I.G. Farben in 1945), which had a monopolistic position on the German powder market. In 1930, the ''Rheinische Spritzguß-Werk GmbH'' (today the Dynamit Nobel Kunststoff GmbH) was founded in Cologne. After the [[Nazism|national-socialists]] took lead of the German government, and wished to develop a strong German defense industry, the [[Wehrmacht]] explicitly requested bigger ammunition manufacturing capacities. In order to do so, the ''WASAG'' and Dynamit Nobel founded the Deutsche Sprengchemie GmbH in 1934. New factories manufacturing explosives and ammunitions were built on government lands and received help from a company which had been nationalised, the Verwertungsgesellschaft für Mountain-Industrie mbH.

Afterwards, the Deutsche Sprengchemie GmbH became the only subsidiary of WASAG. Dynamit Nobel had the same activities in Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH (i.e. Verwertchemie). The latter ran more than 30 factories, namely in [[Liebenau, Hesse|Liebenau]], [[Empelde]], and [[Stadtallendorf]]. At that time, Stadtallendorf was the largest place of ammunition production in Europe. During World War Two, more than {{formatnum:100000}} people coming from camps managed by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] were forced to work there. In 1938, a new factory manufacturing nitrocellulose was built in [[Aschau am Inn]]. After the war it became the property of WASAG due to the decartelisation of I.G. Farben.

=== From 1945 to 1992 ===
After World War Two, Dynamit Nobel began manufacturing plastic equipment and ammunition in West Germany but was not able to keep the factories located in the areas occupied by the Soviets. These factories were partly dismembered. From 1953, Dynamit Nobel tried to develop intermediary organic products in order not to rely completely on the plastic equipment. After deciding the rearmament of [[Bundeswehr]], the manufacture of ammunition was restarted in 1957, at first in the factory of Liebenau by the Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH which had survived the war.
At the beginning of the 1960s, once again, the company became the leader of the military and civil powder market in Germany, namely due to the takeover of the manufacturer of ammunitions Gustav Genschow &amp; Co. AG de Karlsruhe in 1963. At the same time, Dynamit Nobel took an increasing position in the mines market. Since 1958, around 3&amp;nbsp;million antitank mines, models DM-11 were manufactured in Liebenau under licence of the Swedish company LIAB.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Küchenmeister (1995), Deutscher Bundestag p. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in collaboration with Bölkow and Dornier, Dynamit Nobel participated to the research projects of the Ministry of nuclear energy (today known as the Federal Ministry of education and research) for the possible supply of Germany with missiles.
During the end of the 1950s, [[Friedrich Karl Flick]], who was a board member of the supervisory board before the war, started to monopolise the company to the detriment of the minority shareholders, sometimes by brutal means. Supported by the Bremen speculator Hermann Krages and partly due to the collusive trading of actions with the Feldmühle AG of which Flick was also a shareholder, he managed to obtain the majority of the shares of the company and became the president of the board of directors. As from then, Flick who already possessed 82% of the share capital,&lt;ref group=a&gt;Die Flicks p.167&lt;/ref&gt; made use of the controversial ''Umwandlungssteuergesetzes'' (fiscal law regarding commercial companies) in order to squeeze out the minority shareholders of the company, in exchange of a compensation (this tool is comparable to the one used today in order to exclude minority shareholders out of a company). After several groups of shareholders protested against this law put into place under the third Reich, the Federal Constitutional Tribunal gave a judgement in favour of Flick.&lt;ref group=a&gt;Die Flicks p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Dynamit AG changed its name to Dynamit Nobel AG, in remembrance of its famous founder. As from 1962, due to the pressure which occurred during the conference, the company which belonged to Flick started to negotiate the compensation to be given to {{formatnum:1300}} forced Jewish employees who worked in the factory of Troisdorf in 1944 and 1955. After an agreement was made, Friedrich Flick personally blocked the payment of five million [[Deutsche Mark]] and no sum of money was released until his death in 1972. In January 1970, Flick made a final statement and declared that he {{quote|was not able to admit neither moral nor humanitarian reasons warranting any payment|Friedrich Karl Flick|&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Krümmel: Heil dich doch selbst, Die Flick-Collection wird geschlossen from Die tageszeitung (1 April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;}} He affirmed that a payment would contradict his previous statements of innocence at the [[Flick trial]] and he was unwilling to make a payment to be considered as an admission of guilt. He also affirmed that the Swiss Dieter Bührle (Oerlikon-Bührle) was also a shareholder of Dynamit Nobel, being the owner of 18% of the shares.&lt;ref group=a&gt;Die Flicks p.167-169&lt;/ref&gt;

After  Bundeswehr was fully equipped with antitank mines during the late 1960s, the factory of Liebenau was sold in 1977 to the Dutch ammunitions manufacturer Eurometaal, owned by Dynamit Nobel (33% of shares). As from then, the big mines projects were put into place in Troisdorf and in Burbach-Würgendorf.
In 1986, the Flick group was bought by [[Deutsche Bank]] for an approximate amount of 5.36&amp;nbsp;billions of DM.&lt;ref group=a&gt;Die Flicks p.251&lt;/ref&gt; The latter restructured the group and sold parts of it while putting the rest of the group on the stock market. Deutsche Bank finally agreed to compensate the forced workers of ''Dynamit Nobel AG'' in respect of the conditions established in the 1960s. During the restructuring of Dynamit Nobel AG, a joint-venture was made with two of the companies of the Flick Group, namely Feldmühle AG and Buderus AG and was renamed Feldmühle Nobel AG. In 1986, the new group was introduced on the stock market. In 1988, the grand children of Friedrich Flick (Friedrich Christian Flick and his brother Gert Rudolf Flick) failed to gain control over the Feldmühle Nobel AG.&lt;ref group=a&gt;Die Flicks p.255&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 1992, Metallgesellschaft AG (today known as the GEA Group) took over the company to fraction it again. Shares of Dynamit Nobel AG and Buderus remained the property of Metallgesellschaft, while the pulp and paper division (formerly known as Feldmühle AG) was sold under the name of Feldmühle Nobel AG to the Swedish company Stora ([[Stora Enso]] since 1998).
As early as 1988, Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH, which had been managed as an affiliate, and  Dynamit Nobel put into force an agreement regarding the consolidation and profit transfer In 1990, the subsidiary was merged with another subsidiary, Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff- und Systemtechnik GmbH.

=== Since 1992 ===
At the beginning of the 1990s, the company was present in the basic and intermediary chemical products, synthetic fibres, specific chemical products (such as silicon wafers) and the processing of plastic materials (in particular [[PVC]]). About one quarter of the turnover of the company originated from the traditional sector of explosives, as well as the ammunition technology which is closely linked to the equipment projects of the Bundeswehr.
In 1992, the company took over ''Cerasiv GmbH'' and Chemetall GmbH, and in 1994 ''Sachtleben Chemie GmbH'' and Chemson GmbH were also taken over. In 1996, the company acquired ''CeramTec AG'' which belonged to Hoechst and merged with Cerasiv GmbH under the name of CeramTec Innovative Ceramic Engineering AG.
In 1997, Dynamit Nobel took over Phoenix Kunststoff GmbH in order to reinforce its position in the plastic equipments market. In 1999, Dynamit Nobel and the chemical company Solvadis were united within the MG chemical group. The scope of chemical activities within Chemetall was optimized by the acquisition of C''yprus Foote'' (1998) and ''Brent'' (1999), followed by the sale of two subsidiaries namely, ''Chemson GmbH'' (1999) et ''Coventya GmbH'' (2000).
In 2001, the industrial activities of ''Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff und Systemtechnik GmbH'' was taken over by [[Orica]]. In 2002, the Swiss group [[RUAG technology group|RUAG technology]] took over ''Dynamit Nobel Ammotec GmbH'', which had been separated from ''Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff und Systemtechnik GmbH''. In this company, the production was focussed on the manufacture of ammunitions of small calibre.
In 2004, ''MG technologies AG'' sold its chemical activities to emphasise the manufacture of equipment. Therefore, Dynamit Nobel AG was dismantled and taken over by several companies. The [[United States|American company]] ''Rockwood Specialties Group Inc'', the largest buyer, acquired ''Sachtleben Chemie GmbH'', ''Chemetall GmbH'', ''CeramTec Innovative Ceramic Engineering AG'' and ''DNSC GmbH'' as of 31 July 2004 for 2.25&amp;nbsp;billions of euros through its Luxemburg subsidiary Knight Lux 1 S.A.R.L.. Part of DNSC GmbH remains in Leverkusen and is known as ''Dynamit Nobel GmbH ES.''
''Rockwood'' is a chemical holding company that the financial investor company [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co]] had acquired. D''ynamit Nobel Kunststoff GmbH'' was taken over in 2004 by the Swedish company ''Plastal Holding AB'' for 915&amp;nbsp;million euros.

The technical armament activity was reduced under the name of Dynamit Nobel Defence GmbH, with the registered office located in Würgendorf (Burbach). The company was specialised in the manufacture of small calibres for the army, official authorities, hunters and shooting sports and was taken over by the [[Swiss]] group ''RUAG'' in 2002 and merged with its ammunitions branch. Therefore, the former companies ''Dynamit Nobel Marken RWS'', ''Rottweil'' and ''Geco'' were named ''RUAG Ammotec GmbH'' (Fürth).
The dismantlement of the Nobel group was made in close collaboration with the employees representatives, who were highly involved during the sales negotiations. Indisputably the employees’ committee would have preferred that the chemical activity remains within ''MG technologies AG'', but an agreement was reached as Rockwood Inc. certified that the long term interests of the company would be maintained and that all the German employees would keep their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Sieger Reinhold: Wir hatten einen konstruktiven Dialog, "Interview du comité d'entreprise du groupe et du conseil de surveillance de MG technologies AG" from "Magazin Mitbestimmung" (April 2005), http://www.boeckler.de/163_32323.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minenwerfer Skorpion 04.JPG|thumb|The ''Minenwurfsystem Skorpion''.]]
As from 1958, Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH/Verwertchemie, a subsidiary of ''Dynamit Nobel'' manufactured antitank mines of type [[DM-11 mine|DM-11]] in Liebenau, under licence of the Swedish company ''LIAB''.
The [[AT2 mine|AT-2]] [[antitank mine]]s were created by Dynamit Nobel and approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;millions were manufactured. The Bundeswehr ordered {{formatnum:300000}} of them for the LARS (a system of light artillery with missiles) which was into place until 2000, about {{formatnum:300000}} were manufactured for Minenwurfsystem Skorpion (a vehicle which installed mines) and {{formatnum:300000}} for [[M270]] (a multiple rocket launcher).
Between 1981 and 1986, the Bundeswehr invested 564.7&amp;nbsp;millions of DM in mines projects, .&lt;ref name="icbl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbl.org/lm/1999/germany.html|title=404 &amp;#124; ICBL|publisher=icbl.org|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minesactioncanada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesactioncanada.org/|title=Mines Action Canada|publisher=minesactioncanada.org|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the AT-2 antitank mines, Dynamit Nobel developed an antipersonnel mine AP-2, an anti-material mine, a signal mine and a shallow water mine.
[[Heckler &amp; Koch G11|HK G11]], a new assault rifle using an ammunition without casing was developed in collaboration with the weapons manufacturer ''[[Heckler &amp; Koch]]'' between 1968 and 1990, whereas ''Dynamit Nobel'' developed the ammunitions without casing. The project was completed but the Bundeswehr declined it due to financial considerations.

[[File:Panzerfaust3.jpg|thumb|Ammunition project 2010: rocket launcher ''[[Panzerfaust 3]]''.]]

Dynamit Nobel marketed the Swedish antitank mine FFV 028SN of the company ''FFV'' and took charge of the transformation of 125 000 antipersonnel mines, model DM-31 which had been manufactured between 1962 and 1967 by Industriewerke Karlsruhe (today [[KUKA]]) which belonged to the Quandt group at the time, in order to enable them to conform to the antitank mines authorised by the Ottawa convention. However, the detonator was not sufficiently modified, and it could therefore be used against people, while it should only have been used against tanks.
In respect of an agreement made in 1989, Dynamit Nobel was manufacturing blank cartridge bullets and figure targets in Würgendorf. Dynamit Nobel also agreed to develop the Panzerfaust 3, in order to progressively deliver it to the Bundeswehr and other armies as the priority antitank defence mechanism in the infantry. In 2010, several different types are manufactured for the Bundeswehr.

== Polyvinyl chloride poisoning in Troisdorf ==
Until the 1970s, Dynamit Nobel polymerised the monomer [[vinyl chloride]] into [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) in the factory of Troisdorf. At this time, about 130 to 140 employees were regularly in touch with it. In total, about 3600 persons have worked within this division since the launching of the production in Troisdorf in the 1940s.

Infringing the health and safety regulations in force at that time, the employees of Dynamit Nobel were exposed for years, with little protection, to this harmful substance which later turned out to be [[carcinogenic]]. Therefore, they were heavily contaminated by vinyl chloride gas or by cleaning up the autoclaves. At this time, most of the other manufacturers of PVC had already put into place systems of production, which were less dangerous for the health. The same had not been done at Dynamit Nobel because of financial considerations. Moreover, regular controls were not made, others were partially manipulated or the results were kept secret. Also, the company made an important contribution to the region, regularly obtained extensions of time to apply the regulations. Contamination due to vinyl chloride was so severe that for years in the company, the employees complained of damage relating to the liver, anemia, finger circulation disorder resulting in acro-osteolysis (necrosis of the first phalanxes), as well as headaches and dizziness. Cancers also resulted from the exposure.

After the announcement of the first thirteen severe diseases during spring 1972, work inspectors from Bonn ordered Dynamit Nobel to take the appropriate measures in order to improve the health and safety conditions of work. But the company took a long time to put them into place.

Afterwards, the 40 sick employees gathered together as Interessengemeinschaft der VC-Geschädigten in order to file a complaint for violation of duty against the Land of North-Rhine-Westphalia and asked for damage compensation, just like in the Contergan trial. The local committee of the DKP in Troisdorf filed a complaint for injury and involuntary homicides against the board of directors of Dynamit Nobel AG. Both complaints remained unsuccessful. After more details about the scandal were made public, employees and inhabitants of Troisdorf organised a series of demonstrations. In 1975, the company’s board of directors decided to shut down PVC polymerisation workshop to escape the expensive costs related to modernization and security of the plant.

Since the first announcement about the existing risks, the company has tried its best to keep things quiet. In that respect, it has put a lot of pressure on journalists and editors. During the following years, some employees were contaminated and died due to their disease without the company ever compensating them.

'''Faiveley Transport''' ({{IPA-fr|fɛvəlɛ tʁɑ̃spɔʁ|French}}), formerly '''Faiveley''',  is an international manufacturer and supplier of equipment for the [[Rail transport|railway industry]] founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; It introduced the [[Pantograph (rail)#Single- and double-arm pantographs|single-arm pantograph]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt; The company has subsidiaries in more than 24 countries.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; The majority of Faiveley Transport's outstanding stock is owned by [[Wabtec Corporation]], which acquired majority stock ownership from the Faiveley family in 2016.&lt;ref name=acq1&gt;{{cite web|title=WABTEC AND FAIVELEY TRANSPORT JOINTLY ANNOUNCE THAT WABTEC ACQUIRES MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF FAIVELEY TRANSPORT|url=http://www.faiveleytransport.com/news/wabtec-and-faiveley-transport-jointly-announce-wabtec-acquires-majority-ownership-faiveley-tran|publisher=Faiveley Transport|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===First years===
In 1919, Louis Faiveley founded in [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Ouen]], France, the ''Établissments Louis Faiveley'',&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt; a small assembly shop centered on [[electromechanical]] parts. It soon grew and became one of the French railway system's leading suppliers. It introduced in 1923 its first [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]. In 1930, it also ventured in the manufacture of door systems for trains. By the 30s, it was already one of France's leading companies in all its fields of activity. In 1935, the company became a Societé Anonyme, although the shares' majority stayed in hands of the Faiveley family.&lt;ref name="B2"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories |volume=31 |date=June 2001 |publisher=St. James Press |isbn=1558624449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the company quickly recovered. In 1946, it introduced [[electric heating]] systems. In 1955, it helped set a new [[high-speed rail|high-speed train]] record, as a Faiveley-equipped train exceeded 331 kilometres per hour. That year, Faiveley also introduced the first single-arm pantograph. This innovation helped the company to ensure its position as world leader in railway pantograph systems.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt;

===Internationalisation===
In 1961, the company created a [[research and development]] division with the aim of adapting electronic applications to the railroad industry, included [[automatic door]] systems. It also begun to equipe the new [[rubber]]-wheeled [[Paris Metro]] cars. In 1965, the company started to produce automatic doors for buildings, creating in 1968 a subsidiary specifically for this area: Faiveley Automatismes.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;

The company continued its expansion. In 1966, it opened a subsidiary in Spain. In 1976, one in Brazil (Equipfer). In 1979, was created the Italian branch. Attempts to enter into the American and Canadian markets, however, were not as successful. Only in the late 90s it could settle in those countries.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt;

France remained as Faiveley's core market. During the 70s, the company introduced new corail coaches for the [[SNCF]] and provided equipment for a new generation of [[subway train]]s, the MF77. In 1972, Faiveley presented its first very-high-speed pantograph. Soon after, it introduced its first electric automated road system.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;

In 1984, Faiveley purchased [[Saint-Gobain]] subsidiary Air-Industrie's transport division, giving it operations in passenger train air conditioning systems. That year, it acquired from the [[Matra]]'s subsidiary Interlec its [[tachometry]] activities. Together with the company's other transportation-related activities, these subsidiary operations were gathered into a newly created subsidiary: Faiveley Transport.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;

The company was one of the suppliers of the new SNCF's [[TGV]] trains. In 1990, its pantographs were key to achieve a new 513.3 kilometres per hour record by TGV Atlantique.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;

In 1991, the company moved its headquarters to [[Saint-Pierre-des-Corps]].&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt;

===Diversification===
[[File:Cd41-0015g.png|thumb|200px|left|Faiveley supplied the pantographs of the 1981, 1990 and 2007 TGV's record trains.]]
With competition becoming more intense in its field of activity, Faiveley decided it was time to expand their operations.

In 1992, the company acquired plastics product maker Grand-Perret. In 1993, Faiveley moved to concentrate its activities around its historic core of railroad and transportation equipment and its brand new plastics division, selling its Faiveley Automatismes subsidiary. It also made an aggressive move to increase its business in the Japanese market, one of the most important at the time, forming a joint venture with [[Nabco]] called Nabco-Faiveley [[Limited company|Ltd]] which became one of leading providers of Japan's railroad. Later, Faiveley partnered also with [[Mitsui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/equipements-ferroviairesfaiveley-s-ouvre-les-portes-du-japonallies-aux-japonais-nabco-et-mitsui-l-equipementier-ferroviaire-francais-a-decroche-une-commande-de-1040-portes-automatiques.N71467 |title=Faiveley s'ouvre les portes du Japon |work=L'Usine Nouvelle n°2448 |publisher=Usinenouvelle.com |date=17 March 1994 |language= French |trans-title=Faiveley opens the doors of Japan |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Faivaley created a British subsidiary, to take a part of the business in the recently privatised rail system.

In 1994, Faiveley was listed on the [[Paris Bourse]]. In 1995, it acquired VPI-Verchère Plastiques Industriels, a thermo-injected plastic company. The following year, Faiveley added the operations of Rhône Moulage and Sepal Ltd, two companies also centered in plastics. By the end of the decade, that material had risen to nearly 20 percent of Faiveley's total sales.

In 1995. Faiveley purchased the German railroad air conditioning company Hagenuk Fahrzeugklima from its parent company [[Siemens]]. The purchase was a key step into the German market as well as the [[Asia]]n through is Chinese subsidiary Shanghai Hagenuk Refrigerating Machine, but also brought losses to the company during the following years. This led to a reorganisation that included staff reductions in Germany and France and changes in the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="B2"/&gt;

In December 2002, Faiveley purchased a 75 percent stake in the Czech pantograph and electro-mechanical equipment supplier Lekov.&lt;ref name="C1"/&gt; In 2004, it acquired the train [[Railway brake|brakes]] manufacturer Sab Wabco and the air conditioning manufacturer Neu Systèmes. In early 2007, it purchased the electronic systems and rolling stock manufacturer ESPAS group.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manufacturingtoday-europe.com/article-page.php?contentid=2719&amp;issueid=131 |title=Faiveley is on the right track |publisher=Manufacturingtoday-europe.com |date=May–June 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faiveley CX pantographs were fitted in the V150 TGV's record-breaking attempt of 2007, which set a new world [[Land speed record for rail vehicles|railway speed record]] of 574.8 kilometres per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Pantographs participate in the TGV speed record |journal=Industrial Engineering News Europe |volume=33 |issue=8 |year=2007 |pages=15 |url=http://media.tim-europe.com/archives/IEN/2007/0809/IEN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, the company acquired from [[Carbone Lorraine]] its sintered brake material manufacturing and design department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/contractors/turnkey/faiveley/press1.html |title=Faiveley Transport Reinforces its Position in High Energy Braking by Completing Acquisition of Carbone Lorraine’s Sintered Brake Material Sector |publisher=Railway-technology.com |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July of that year, it purchased the American freight wagon components' manufacturer Ellcon-National.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/contractors/turnkey/faiveley/press4.html |title=Faiveley Transport Successfully Completes the Acquisition of Ellcon-National |publisher=Railway-technology.com |date=31 July 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 Faiveley SA and its subsidiary Faiveley Transport merged into a sole company, called Faiveley Transport SA.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot_article.asp?ticker=LEY:FP |title=Company Description: Faiveley Transport SA |work=businessweek.com |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2011, the company purchased an 80 percent stake in the rolling stock heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment manufacturer Urs Dolder AG and the remaining stake of Lekov.&lt;ref name="C1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/FAIP.PA/key-developments/article/2108795 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201225156/http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/FAIP.PA/key-developments/article/2108795 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 February 2013 |title=Faiveley Transport SA Becomes 100% Owner of Lekov, Its Czech Subsidiary, by Acquiring the Remaining 25% Capital |work=reuters.com |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/FAIP.PA/key-developments/article/2097289 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201115209/http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/FAIP.PA/key-developments/article/2097289 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 February 2013 |title=Faiveley Transport SA To Acquire 80% Interest Of Dolder AG |work=reuters.com |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2012, Faiveley Transport completed the purchase of Graham-White, an American designer and manufacturer of compressed air drying and brake systems for rail transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/FAIP.PA/key-developments/article/2474601 |title=Faiveley Transport SA Finalizes Its Acquisition of 100% of Graham-White |work=reuters.com |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the company won a trial against [[Wabtec]] for the acts of [[unfair competition]] and [[Intellectual property|secrets violation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/FAIP.PA/key-developments/article/2690359 |title=Faiveley Transport SA Wins Trial Against Wabtec Before The Court Of Appeal Of New York |work=reuters.com |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November 2016, the 51% stake of the company controlled by the Faiveley family was purchased by Wabtec, giving Wabtec controlling interest in Faiveley Transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/financial/wabtec-completes-dolus-17bn-acquisition-of-faiveley-transport.html?channel=522 |title=

A '''fan heater''', also called a '''blow heater''', is a [[heater]] that works by using a [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] to pass air over a heat source (e.g. a [[heating element]]). This heats up the [[air]], which then leaves the heater, warming up the surrounding room. They can heat an enclosed space such as a room faster than a heater without fan, but, like any fan, create audible [[noise]].

==Cost and efficiency==
Electric fan heaters can be less expensive to buy than other heaters due to simple construction. The fan carries heat away from the device, which can be made smaller without overheating. The relatively small amount of [[electricity]] used to operate the fan is partly converted to additional heat, so that efficiency is not a problem. All heaters without external ventilation are nearly 100% efficient, meaning that almost all [[energy]] input goes into the room as heat. However, if the efficiency of generating the electricity is taken into account, the overall efficiency decreases significantly.

Electric fan heaters are more expensive to run than fuel powered heaters due to the cost of electricity. This makes them best suited to occasional use rather than as regularly used heat sources.

Externally vented non-electrical (combustion powered) fan heaters lose some [[heat]] to the outdoors, and are thus less [[Efficiency|efficient]]. These are used where it is necessary not to release the fumes of [[combustion]] into the heated area.

==Control==
Most modern fan heaters have a power setting to determine power output. Some also have a [[thermostat]] which switches off heating when the desired ambient [[temperature]] is reached. They do not maintain perfect room temperature control, since
* the thermostat is usually attached to the body of the heater, and senses temperature there.
* the basic bimetal [[thermostat]]s usually used have significant [[hysteresis]].
* Remote sensors and thermostats with less hysteresis are available but are less common, as they are more expensive and the basic fan heater is satisfactory for most purposes.

==Heat sources==
While the fans in fan heaters are electrically powered, various [[heat]] sources may be used:
* Electric heating elements are common, and used in portable plug-in electric heaters. Although they may supply several kilowatts of heat, such heaters are usually small as the electric element itself is small. Since heat is removed by the fan, the body of the heater does not need to be an effective [[heat sink]].
* [[Hot water]] tubing is used where the heat is provided by a hydronic heating system.
* [[Gas]], [[kerosene]], and sometimes other [[fuel]]s such as used [[engine oil]] are burnt in high-power fan heaters.

==Safety==
Electric fan heaters are unsealed appliances with live electric parts inside, so they are not safe to use in wet environments because of the [[risk]] of [[electrocution]] if moisture provides a conductive path to electrically-live parts. Electric fan heaters usually have a [[thermal fuse]] close to the heating element(s) to protect against overheating in the event of fan failure or air intakes becoming blocked, and a tip-over switch to shut the heater off when the fan outlet is not in the required orientation. [[Metal]]-cased heaters perform better in the case of possible fire-causing faults than [[plastic]]-cased ones, since the case will stay intact and is not flammable, but the metal case presents a higher risk of electrocution if a heater malfunctions. 

Portable [[fuel]]-powered fan heaters release all the fumes of [[combustion]] into the room, creating a [[risk]] of poisoning by [[carbon monoxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Most installed fuel fan heaters in the [[first world]] use a [[heat exchanger]] and external ventilation, avoiding that [[risk]] by venting the [[combustion]] gases to the outdoors.

==Internal parts==
===Residential model===
[[image:Fan heater innards 4989-2.jpg|thumb|Typical fan heater's internal parts]]
The picture immediately to the right (the top on the mobile site) shows most of the component parts of a typical plug-in electric fan heater.

* The [[heating element]] is the coiled wire frame located behind the fan blades.
* The [[thermostat]] is at the top left.
* The heat (wattage) selector [[switch]] is at the top right.
* The switch at the bottom is a normally open switch that serves as a "tipover switch" safety device: as long as the heater is standing upright, the switch is engaged and the circuit is closed.
* The grip for the [[mains lead|power cord]] is at the bottom right.

[[image:Fan heater thermal cutouts 4999-2.jpg|thumb|Overheat cutouts]]
The next picture shows the two overheat cutouts. The bimetal cutout (left) operates if the device overheats because the intake is blocked or the fan fails, and resets automatically or manually depending on specification, once the heater cools after the operational fault is corrected. The thermal fuse (right) is a [[failsafe]] backup device that will blow and disconnect the [[heating element]] permanently should the bimetal cutout fail to operate (e.g. due to its contacts [[welding]] together) and in so doing prevent extreme overheating which could result in a fire.

===Industrial model===
Industrial fan heaters use high-output finned [[heating element]]s in front of a fan to provide a larger airflow and higher kilowatt rating than many smaller residential fan heaters.
Industrial fan heaters can be used in warehouses, shipping containers, clean rooms, shops and other general purpose heating applications.
They can also be used as [[drying|dryers]] or [[dehumidifiers]] with modified attachments or mountings. Portable industrial fan heaters tend to range from around 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW up to about 45&amp;nbsp;kW with either [[Mechanical_fan#Axial-flow_fans|axial]] or [[centrifugal fan|centrifugal]] [[Mechanical fan|fans]] and various staged controls and over-temperature safety limit controls.

'''Fruit preserves''' are preparations of [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[sugar]], often stored in glass jam jars.

Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from [[strawberry]] or [[apricot]], and savory preserves, such as those made from [[tomatoes]] or [[squash (plant)|squash]]. The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, "preserves" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies.

== Regional terminology ==
[[File:Jams, Jellies, Honeys-Minnesota State Fair.jpg|thumb|Jams, jellies and honeys, [[Minnesota State Fair]]]]
The term 'preserves' is usually interchangeable with 'jams'. Some cookbooks define preserves as cooked and gelled whole fruit (or vegetable), which includes a significant portion of the fruit.&lt;ref name="joc" /&gt; In the English speaking world, the two terms are more strictly differentiated and, when this is not the case, the more usual generic term is 'jam'.&lt;ref&gt;Howard L &amp; Patten M (eds), 1960, The Australian Women's Weekly&amp;nbsp;— Cookery in colour, Paul Hamlin LTD, London UK, sections956-971&lt;/ref&gt;

The singular ''preserve'' or ''conserve'' is used as a collective noun for high fruit content jam, often for marketing purposes. Additionally, the name of the type of fruit preserves will also vary depending on the regional variant of English being used.

== Variations ==
[[File:Ribotroshhashana.jpg|thumb|Five varieties of fruit preserves (clockwise from top): apple, quince, plum, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], orange  (in the center)]]

=== Chutney ===
{{Main|Chutney}}
A '''chutney''' is a relish of Indian origin made of fruit, spices and herbs. Although originally intended to be eaten soon after production, modern chutneys are often made to be sold, so require preservatives&amp;nbsp;– often sugar and vinegar&amp;nbsp;– to ensure they have a suitable shelf life. Mango chutney, for example, is mangoes reduced with sugar.

=== Confit ===
{{Main|Confit}}
While '''confit''', the past participle of the French verb ''confire'', "to preserve", is most often applied to preservation of meats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/sep/29/features11.g22 |title=On the menu: confit |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2008 |quote=Usually duck, pork or goose, although you can use other meats. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509095227/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/sep/29/features11.g22 |archivedate=9 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also used for fruits or vegetables seasoned and cooked with honey or sugar till jam-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/confit |title=Definition: Confit |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |work=[[American Heritage Dictionary]] |accessdate=20 September 2008 |quote=A condiment made by cooking seasoned fruit or vegetables!, usually to a jamlike consistency |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922105723/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/confit |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Savory confits, such as ones made with garlic or fennel, may call for a savory oil, such as virgin olive oil, as the preserving agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/TOMATO-CONFIT-AND-MARINATED-TOMATOES-SERVED-ON-A-CRISPY-TART-108547 |title=Tomato Confit recipe |publisher=[[Epicurious]] |work=[[Bon Appétit]] |date=September 2003 |accessdate=20 September 2008 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003035838/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/TOMATO-CONFIT-AND-MARINATED-TOMATOES-SERVED-ON-A-CRISPY-TART-108547 |archivedate=3 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/GARLIC-CONFIT-241125 |title=Garlic Confit recipe |publisher=[[Epicurious]] |work=[[Bon Appétit]] |date=January 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906015453/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/GARLIC-CONFIT-241125 |archivedate=6 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konfyt'''  ([[Afrikaans]]: "jam" or "fruit preserve"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delahunty|first1=edited by Andrew|title=From bonbon to cha-cha : Oxford dictionary of foreign words and phrases.|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199543694|pages=186|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Nvu17oLIQNgC&amp;pg=PA186|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a type of jam eaten in Southern Africa.{{clarify|date=July 2012|reason=Is this South Africa, or the southern part of Africa?}} It is made by boiling selected [[fruit]] or fruits (such as strawberries, apricots, oranges, lemons, water melons, berries, peaches, prickly pears or others) and [[sugar]], and optionally adding a small quantity of ginger to enhance the flavour. The origins of the jam is obscure but it is theorized that it came from the French. The word is also based on the French term ''confiture'' via the Dutch ''confijt'' (meaning candied fruit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osseo-Asare|first1=Fran|title=Food Culture in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313324888|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=1s-a7EMM6BgC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conserve ===
[[File:Az-Strawberry jam, making by e-citizen (moonsun1981).JPG|thumbnail|Strawberry [[varenye]] ([[murabba]]) ]]
A '''conserve''', or '''whole fruit jam''',&lt;ref name="Grange-RW"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grange|first=Cyril|title=The Right Way To Make Jams|publisher=Right Way Books|year=1992|edition=2nd|isbn=0-7160-2126-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a preserve made of fruit stewed in sugar. Traditional whole fruit preserves are particularly popular in [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]]) where they are called [[varenye]], the [[Baltic region]] where they're known by a native name in each of the countries ({{lang-lt|uogienė}}, {{lang-lv|ievārījums}}, {{lang-et|moos}}, {{lang-ro|dulceață}}), as well as in many regions of [[Western Asia|Western]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia|Southern]] Asia, where they are referred to as [[murabba]].

Often the making of conserves can be trickier than making a standard jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for just enough time to allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit,&lt;ref name="Patten-Basics"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Patten|first=Marguerite|title=Basic Basics: Jams, Preserves and Chutneys Handbook|publisher=Grub Street Books|date=February 2001|edition=2004 reprint|isbn=1-902304-72-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the setting point.&lt;ref name="Grange-RW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WI-Jam" /&gt; As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins.&lt;ref name="Patten-Basics" /&gt; [[Ribes|Currants and gooseberries]], and a number of [[plum]]s are among these fruits.

Because of this shorter cooking period, not as much pectin will be released from the fruit, and as such, conserves (particularly home-made conserves) will sometimes be slightly softer set than some jams.&lt;ref name="WI-Jam"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thomas|first=Midge|title=Best kept secrets of the Women's Institute: Jams, pickles &amp; chutneys|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|date=2 September 2002|edition=1st|isbn=0-7432-2113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative definition holds that conserves are preserves made from a mixture of fruits or vegetables. Conserves may also include dried fruit or nuts.&lt;ref name=unm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/nutrition/DJ1088.html |title=Making Jams, Marmalades, Preserves, and Conserves |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] extension school |author=Isabel D.

=== Fruit butter ===
{{Main|Fruit butter}}
'''Fruit butter''', in this context, refers to a process where the whole fruit is forced through a sieve or blended after the heating process.

:"Fruit butters are generally made from larger fruits, such as apples, plums, peaches or grapes. Cook until softened and run through a sieve to give a smooth consistency. After sieving, cook the pulp ... add sugar and cook as rapidly as possible with constant stirring.… The finished product should mound up when dropped from a spoon, but should not cut like jelly. Neither should there be any free liquid."—Berolzheimer R (ed) et al.

=== Fruit curd ===
{{Main|Fruit curd}}

'''Fruit curd''' is a dessert topping and spread usually made with lemon, [[lime (fruit)|lime]], orange, or [[raspberry]].&lt;ref name="definitional"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cake Talk: What the terms mean |work=[[The Joy of Cooking]] |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=29 June 2005 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20050629&amp;slug=caketerms29 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603133149/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20050629&amp;slug=caketerms29 |archivedate=3 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic ingredients are beaten egg yolks, sugar, fruit juice and [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] which are gently cooked together until thick and then allowed to cool, forming a soft, smooth, intensely flavored spread. Some recipes also include [[egg whites]] or butter.&lt;ref name="recipe"&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Gordon Ramsay]] |title=Lemon and Poppy Seed Scones with Homemade Lemon Curd |work=The Times |location=UK |date=20 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fruit spread ===
Although the [[FDA]] has ''Requirements for Specific Standardized Fruit Butters, Jellies, Preserves, and Related Products'',&lt;ref name="FDA-regs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 21, Chapter I, Subchapter B, Part 150|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=3cad51335d9ff6b300b9b940c80621d4&amp;mc=true&amp;n=pt21.2.150&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML|website=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no specification of the meaning of the term '''Fruit spread'''.  Although some assert it refers to a jam or preserve with no added sugar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rolek|first1=Barbara|title=What is fruit butter? Marmalade?

=== Jam ===
{{Redirect|Jam}}
{{Redirect|Strawberry jam|the album|Strawberry Jam}}
'''Jam''' typically contains both the juice and flesh of a fruit or vegetable,&lt;ref name="usda" /&gt; although one cookbook defines it as a cooked and jelled puree.&lt;ref name="joc"&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The Joy of Cooking]]|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "jam" refers to a product made of whole fruit cut into pieces or crushed, then heated with water and sugar to activate its [[pectin]] before being put into containers:
:"Jams are usually made from pulp and juice  of one fruit, rather than a combination of several fruits. Berries and other small fruits are most frequently used, though larger fruits such as apricots, peaches, or plums cut into small pieces or crushed are also used for jams. Good jam has a soft even consistency without distinct pieces of fruit, a bright color, a good fruit flavor and a semi-jellied texture that is easy to spread but has no free liquid." – Berolzheimer R (ed) et al. (1959)&lt;ref group=notes&gt;'''Berolzheimer''', pp. 831–832&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pectin]] is mainly D-galacturonic acid connected by α (1–4) glycosidic linkages. The side chains of pectin may contain small amounts of other sugars such as L-fructose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-xylose. In jams, pectin is what thickens the final product via cross-linking of the large polymer chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chemistry and Technology of Pectin|last=Walter|first=Reginald|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|year=1991|isbn=9780127338705|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Freezer jam'' is uncooked (or cooked less than 5 minutes), then stored frozen.  It is popular in parts of North America for its very fresh taste.

Recipes without added pectin use the natural pectin in the fruit to set.

Other fruits, such as apricots, blueberries, cherries, peaches, pineapple, raspberries, rhubarb, and strawberries are low in pectin.  In order to set, or gel, they must be combined with one of the higher pectin fruits or used with commercially produced or homemade pectin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pickyourown.org/makeyourownpectin.htm|title=How to Make Your Own Natural Pectin for Use in Making Homemade Jam and Jelly|work=pickyourown.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831031638/http://www.pickyourown.org/makeyourownpectin.htm|archivedate=31 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allotment-garden.org/food/pectin-jam.php Pectin for Jam, Jelly &amp; Marmalade Making'' allotment garden.org (British site)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001080405/http://www.allotment-garden.org/food/pectin-jam.php |date=1 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of added pectin decreases cooking time.

In Canada, fruit jam is categorized into two types: fruit jam and fruit jam with [[pectin]]. Both types contain fruit, [[fruit pulp]] or canned fruit and are boiled with water and a [[sweetening]] ingredient. Both must have 66% water-soluble solids. Fruit jam and fruit jam with pectin may contain a class II [[preservative]], a pH adjusting agent or an [[antifoaming agent]]. Both types cannot contain apple or [[rhubarb]] fruit.&lt;ref name="Branch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-61.html#h-87|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Food and Drug Regulations|last=Branch|first=Legislative Services|website=laws.justice.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713042216/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-61.html#h-87|archivedate=13 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though both types of jam are very similar, there are some differences in fruit percent, added pectin and added [[Acidity or alkalinity|acidity]]. Fruit jam must have at least 45% fruit and may contain added pectin to compensate for the natural pectin level found in the fruit. Fruit jam with pectin need only contain 27% fruit and is allowed to contain added acidity to compensate for the natural acidity of the fruit.&lt;ref name="Branch"/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[redcurrant jelly]] is a condiment often served with lamb, game meat including venison, turkey and goose in a festive or [[Sunday roast]]. It is a clear jam, set with pectin from the fruit, and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining.

Pectin is essential to the formation of jelly because it acts as a [[Thickening agent|gelling agent]], meaning when the pectin chains combine, they create a network that results in a gel. The strength and effectiveness of the side chains and the bonds they form depend on the pH of the pectin, the optimal pH is between 2.8–3.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.herbstreith-fox.de/fileadmin/tmpl/pdf/broschueren/Konfituere_englisch.pdf|title=Jams, Jellies and Marmalades|publisher=Herbstreith &amp; Fox|location=Neuenbürg/Württ|pages=7, 11–13|via=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924110055/http://www.herbstreith-fox.de/fileadmin/tmpl/pdf/broschueren/Konfituere_englisch.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional pectin may be added where the original fruit does not supply enough, for example with grapes.&lt;ref name="usda" /&gt;
Jelly can be made from sweet, savory or hot ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette "jelly bag" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can come in a variety of flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]].

:"Good jelly is clear and sparkling and has a fresh flavor of the fruit from which it is made. It is tender enough to quiver when moved, but holds angles when cut... Pectin is best extracted from the fruit by heat, therefore cook the fruit until soft before straining to obtain the juice&amp;nbsp;... Pour cooked fruit into a jelly bag which has been wrung out of cold water. Hang up and let drain. When dripping has ceased the bag may be squeezed to remove remaining juice, but this may cause cloudy jelly." – &lt;ref&gt;Berolzheimer R (ed) et al. (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;'''Berolzheimer''', pp. 826–829&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marmalade ===
{{Main|Marmalade}}
[[File:Apple marmalade 01.JPG|thumb|Apple [[marmalade]]]][[Marmalade]] is a fruit preserve made from the juice and peel of [[citrus|citrus fruits]] boiled with [[sugar]] and water.  It can be produced from lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, [[bergamot orange|bergamots]] and other citrus fruits, or any combination thereof. Marmalade is generally distinguished from [[Fruit preserves#Jam|jam]] by its fruit peel.

The benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish [[Bitter orange|Seville orange]], ''Citrus aurantium'' var. ''aurantium'', prized for its high [[pectin]] content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the preserve.  In America, marmalade is sweet.

== Production ==
[[File:Bubbling Jam.jpg|right|thumb|Jam being made in a pot]]

In general, jam is produced by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according to the type of fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104&amp;nbsp;°C (219&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref&gt;MookyChick Central. (3 September 2014). [http://www.mookychick.co.uk/how-to/how-to-guides/how-to-make-jam.php "How To Make Jam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612050423/http://www.mookychick.co.uk/how-to/how-to-guides/how-to-make-jam.php |date=12 June 2015 }}. ''MookyChick''. Retrieved 11 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[acid]] and the [[pectin]] in the fruit react with the sugar, and the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by [[trial and error]], bringing the mixture to a "fast rolling [[boiling|boil]]", watching to see if the seething mass changes [[Texture (food)|texture]], and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run or set.&lt;ref&gt;Ball Blue Book of Preserving, Alltrista Consumer Products, June, 2004 {{ISBN|0-9727537-0-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-9727537-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially produced jams are usually produced using one of two methods. The first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process involves the use of a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80&amp;nbsp;°C depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product. However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still needs to be heated briefly to {{convert|95|to|100|C|F}} to kill off any micro-organisms that may be present; the vacuum pan method does not kill them all.

During commercial filling it is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down [[tamper evident|tamper-evident]] safety button when used.

== Packaging ==
Glass or plastic [[jar]]s are an efficient method of storing and preserving jam. Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it in a jar is far more useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves typically are of low [[water activity]] and can be stored at room temperature after opening, if used within a short period of time.

== Legal definitions ==

=== US FDA definitions ===

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) published standards of identity in 21 CFR 150, and treats jam and preserves as synonymous, but distinguishes jelly from jams and preserves. All of these are cooked and pectin-gelled fruit products, but jellies are based entirely on fruit juice or other liquids, while jams and preserves are gelled fruit that may include the seeds and pulp. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] offers grading service based on these standards.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/fv/ppbweb/manuals/jelly.pdf|title=Grading Manual for Fruit Jelly Fruit Preserves|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709211406/http://www.ams.usda.gov/fv/ppbweb/manuals/jelly.pdf|archivedate=9 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadian regulations ===
Under the Processed Products Regulations (C.R.C., c. 291), jams, jellies, citrus marmalade and preserves are defined. Each must contain a minimum percentage of the named fruit and a minimum percentage of water-soluble solids. Jams "shall be the product made by boiling fruit, fruit pulp or canned fruit to a suitable consistency with water and a sweetening ingredient", jellies "shall be the product made by boiling fruit juice or concentrated fruit juice that is free from seeds and pulp with water and a sweetening ingredient until it acquires a gelatinous consistency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._291/page-21.html?term=jams+jam#sched2 |title=Processed Products Regulations |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414043225/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._291/page-21.html?term=jams+jam#sched2 |archivedate=14 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union directives on jam ===
In the [[European Union]], the jam [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] (Council Directive 79/693/EEC, 24 July 1979)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31979L0693:EN:NOT Council Directive 79/693/EEC of 24 July 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut purée.] Not in force, replaced by Directive 2001/113/EC.&lt;/ref&gt; set minimum standards for the amount of "fruit" in jam, but the definition of fruit was expanded to take account of several unusual kinds of jam made in the EU. For this purpose, "fruit" is considered to include fruits that are not usually treated in a culinary sense as fruits, such as tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, and pumpkins; fruits that are not normally made into jams; and vegetables that are sometimes made into jams, such as [[rhubarb]] (the edible part of the stalks), carrots, and [[sweet potato]]es. This definition continues to apply in the new directive, Council Directive 2001/113/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée intended for human consumption.&lt;ref name="eu2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0113:EN:NOT|title=Council Directive 2001/113/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée intended for human consumption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extra jam''' is subject to somewhat stricter rules that set higher standards for the minimum fruit content (45% instead of 35% as a general rule, but lower for some fruits such as redcurrants and blackcurrants), as well specifying as the use of unconcentrated fruit pulp, and forbidding the mixture of certain fruits and vegetables with others.&lt;ref name="eu2001" /&gt;

'''Extra jelly''' similarly specifies that the quantity of fruit juice or aqueous extracts used to make 1,000 grams of finished product must not be less than that laid down for the manufacture of extra jam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/agri-foodindustry/foodlabelling/Labelling%20of%20Jams,%20Jellies%20and%20Marmalades.pdf|title=Labelling of Jams, Jellies and Marmalades.

Greenhouse gas monitoring is the direct [[measurement]] of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and levels.  There are several different methods of measuring carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, including [[Infrared gas analyzer|infrared analyzing]] and [[manometry]]. [[Methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are measured by other instruments. Greenhouse gases are measured by [[satellite monitoring]] such as the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory]] and networks of [[ground station]]s such as the [[Integrated Carbon Observation System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.economist.com/science-technology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15603891 |title=Highs and lows |publisher=The Economist |date=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

=== Carbon dioxide monitoring ===

==== Manometry ====
Manometry is a key measurement tool for atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] by first measuring the volume, temperature, and pressure of a particular amount of dry air. The air sample is dried by passing it through multiple dry ice traps and then collecting it in a five liter vessel. The temperature is taken via a thermometer and pressure is calculated using [[manometry]]. Then, [[liquid nitrogen]] is added, causing the [[carbon dioxide]] to condense and become measurable by volume.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Daniel C.|date=2010|title=Charles David Keeling and the Story of Atmospheric CO2 Measurements|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/ac1001492|journal=Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=82|issue=19|pages=7865–7870|doi=10.1021/ac1001492|issn=0003-2700|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ideal gas law]] is accurate to 0.3% in these pressure conditions.

==== Infrared gas analyzer ====
Infrared analyzers were used at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] and at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] between 1958 and 2006. IR analyzers operate by pumping an unknown sample of dry air through a 40 cm long cell. A reference cell contains dry [[carbon dioxide]]-free air.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A glowing [[nichrome]] filament radiates broadband [[IR radiation]] which splits into two beams and passes through the gas cells. [[Carbon dioxide]] absorbs some of the radiation, allowing more radiation that passes through the reference cell to reach the detector than radiation passing through the sample cell. Data is collected on a strip chart recorder. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the sample is quantified by calibrating with a standard gas of known [[carbon dioxide]] content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Titrimetry ====
[[Titrimetry]] is another method of measuring atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] that was first used by a Scandinavian group at 15 different [[Ground station|ground stations.]] They began passing a 100.0 mL air sample through a solution of [[barium hydroxide]] containing [[cresolphthalein]] indicator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methane gas monitoring ===

==== Differential absorption lidar ====
Range-resolved infrared [[differential absorption lidar]] (DIAL) is a means of measuring [[methane emissions]] from various sources, including active and closed landfill sites.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innocenti|first=Fabrizio|last2=Robinson|first2=Rod|last3=Gardiner|first3=Tom|last4=Finlayson|first4=Andrew|last5=Connor|first5=Andy|date=2017|title=Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) Measurements of Landfill Methane Emissions|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/9/953|journal=Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=953|doi=10.3390/rs9090953|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Differential absorption lidar|DIAL]] takes vertical scans above [[methane]] sources and then spatially separates the scans to accurately measure the [[methane emissions]] from individual sources. Measuring [[methane emissions]] is a crucial aspect of [[climate change research]], as methane is among the most impactful gaseous [[hydrocarbon]] species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Nitrous oxide monitoring ===

====Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS)====
[[Nitrous oxide]] is one of the most prominent [[Anthropogenic climate change|anthropogenic]] [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] gases in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheese|first=Patrick E.|last2=Walker|first2=Kaley A.|last3=Boone|first3=Chris D.|last4=Bernath|first4=Peter F.|last5=Funke|first5=Bernd|date=2016|title=Nitrous oxide in the atmosphere: First measurements of a lower thermospheric source|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067353|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=43|issue=6|pages=2866–2872|doi=10.1002/2015gl067353|issn=0094-8276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released into the atmosphere primarily through natural sources such as soil and rock, as well as [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] process like farming. Atmospheric [[nitrous oxide]] is also created in the atmosphere as a product of a reaction between nitrogen and electronically excited [[ozone]] in the lower [[thermosphere]].

The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer ([[ACE-FTS]]) is a tool used for measuring [[nitrous oxide]] concentrations in the upper to lower [[troposphere]]. This instrument, which is attached to the Canadian satellite [[SCISAT-1|SCISAT]], has shown that [[nitrous oxide]] is present throughout the entire atmosphere during all seasons, primarily due to energetic particle precipitation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Measurements taken by the instrument show that different reactions create [[nitrous oxide]] in the lower thermosphere than in the mid to upper [[mesosphere]].  The [[ACE-FTS]] is a crucial resource in predicting future [[ozone depletion]] in the upper stratosphere by comparing the different ways in which [[nitrous oxide]] is released into the atmosphere. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Satellite monitoring ==

=== Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO, OCO-2, OCO-3) ===
The [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory]] (OCO) was first launched in February of 2009 but was lost due to launch failure.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/oco.htm|title=OCO 1, 2 (ESSP 5)|website=space.skyrocket.de|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|Satellite]] was launched again in 2014, this time called the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2]], with an estimated lifespan of about two years.  The apparatus uses [[Spectrometer|spectrometers]] to take 24 [[carbon dioxide]] concentration measurements per second of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/news/1060/nasas-oco-2-brings-sharp-new-focus-on-global-carbon/|title=NASA's OCO-2 brings sharp new focus on global carbon – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|last=Team|first=By Carol Rasmussen, NASA Earth Science News|work=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurements taken by [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|OCO-2]] can be used for [[Atmospheric models|global atmospheric models]] and will allow scientists to locate [[Carbon source|carbon sources]] when its data is paired with [[Prevailing winds|wind patterns]].

'''HDHomeRun''' is a [[Computer network|network-attached]] digital [[Tuner (radio)|television tuner]] box, produced by the company SiliconDust USA, Inc..

==Overview==
Unlike standard [[set-top box]] (or set-top unit) appliances, '''HDHomeRun''' does not have a video output that connects directly to the user's television. Instead it receives a live TV signal and then streams the decoded video over a [[local area network]] to an existing [[smart phone]], [[tablet computer]], [[smart tv]], [[computer]],  or [[game console]]. This allows it to stream content to multiple viewing locations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engadgethd.com/2006/10/30/engadget-hd-review-hdhomerun/&lt;/ref&gt;

==General details==
There are currently a number of HDHomeRun models on the market: 
*single-tuner [[ATSC]]/[[clear QAM]]
*dual-tuner ATSC/clear QAM 
*dual-tuner commercial (TECH) ATSC/clear QAM
*dual-tuner [[DVB-T]]/unencrypted [[DVB-C]]
*three tuner CableCard/clear QAM
All models are designed to receive unencrypted digital broadcast or cable television and stream it over a network for use by any PC on the network.  HDHomeRun normally receives an IP address via [[DHCP]] but will also work via an auto IP address if no DHCP server is available.

The HDHomeRun [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] driver presents the tuners as standard [[Broadcast Driver Architecture|BDA]] tuners, enabling BDA-compliant applications to work with the HDHomeRun. The HDHomeRun can also be controlled via a command-line application which is available for Windows, [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], and other [[POSIX]]-compliant operating systems. The control library is open source and is available under the [[LGPL]] for use in custom applications.

Select retail packaged HDHomeRun units are distributed with [[Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre]].

==Technical specifications==

===ATSC models===
* [[8VSB]] (ATSC [[terrestial television|over-the-air]] digital TV)
* [[QAM]] 64/256 (unencrypted digital cable TV)
* [[CableCard]] (encrypted digital cable TV)
* 100Mbit [[Ethernet]] RJ45 connection

===QAM model===
* QAM - North American cable with protected content support for USA cable using CableCARD for access control

===ISDB model===
* ISDB-T - South America over the air

===DVB models===
* DVB-T / DVB-T2 over-the-air unencrypted digital TV
* DVB-C - QAM 64/128/256 (annex A/C) unencrypted digital cable TV
* 6/7/8&amp;nbsp;MHz channel bandwidth (Australia, Europe, New Zealand, Taiwan)
* 100Mbit Ethernet RJ45 connection

==Compatibility==
The HDHomeRun can be controlled and viewed from a wide variety of [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]/[[Personal Video Recorder|PVR]] [[software]]. [[Microsoft]] provides [[Windows Media Center]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] XP through 8, but discontinued the product in [[Windows 10]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-media-center-is-not-available |title=Windows Media Center is not available|publisher=Microsoft.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple [[macOS]] 10 runs [[Elgato|EyeTV 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elgato.com/en/eyetv/eyetv-3 |title=EyeTV 3 TV Software for Mac }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Linux]] runs [[Myth TV]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Silicondust_HDHomeRun&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linux.com/articles/61518&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer models of HDHomeRun are [[DLNA]] device compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silicondust.com/product/hdhomerun-connect/|title=HDHomeRun CONNECT - Silicon Dust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HDHomeRun Prime==
{{Advert section|date=January 2017}}

Introduced Fall 2011, the HDHomeRun Prime adds CableCARD support to allow viewers to view and record all the digital cable channels they subscribe to without using a cable supplied set-top-box. This includes premium cable channels like HBO, Showtime, and Starz. It integrates easily with [[Windows Media Center]] (WMC), included with Windows 7 and available with Windows 8, and turns your PC into an HD DVR. With 3 tuners, the Prime lets you record two programs and watch another live all at the same time. Once set up on your local network, other DLNA home video devices like most current HDTV's and Blu-ray players, Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles, and WMC Extenders Version 2 all have access to live TV and recorded cable TV.

* CableCards are available from every US digital cable provider and are always less expensive than renting a set-top-box; usually less than $3 per month.
* The Prime can also be used without a CableCard in cable systems that still have clear QAM channels available. 
* The Prime does not support digital cable on demand, but can receive [[Pay-per-view|PPV]] that is ordered on the phone from your cable provider.
* The Prime is a dedicated cable TV device with no ATSC tuner and thus can not be used with an antenna.
* Windows Media Center is the most widely used software available for use with the Prime, and the only one with Digital Rights Management (DRM) to view and record premium cable channels like HBO. Many other software options are available; please see the list in this Wiki and the Silicondust website for details.  When running WMC, an additional, separate ATSC tuner can be used with the PC and WMC will combine both the Prime and ATSC tuner in the guide for live TV and recording. By default WMC has a 4 tuner limit for each type (ATSC, CableCard) of tuner, but a 3rd party software product called TunerSalad increases the number of tuners to 32 per type; you can use up to 32 cable tuners (11 Primes = 33 cable tuners) and 32 ATSC tuners, for a total of 64 tuners. There is also another 3rd party software called My Channel Logos that adds channel logos to the WMC channel guide. For detailed discussion of WMC, please see TheGreenButton.tv website.

Please note that WMC was included with Windows 7 but is an additional $100 for Windows 8/8.1 and an additional $10 for Windows 8/8.1 Pro. It is not available from Microsoft on Windows 10 but members at The Green Button are developing a way to use a modified version of WMC with Windows 10.

==HDHomeRun DVR==
The HDHomeRun DVR is a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] software designed for installation on a [[network-attached storage]] device. It is intended to be used with a HDHomeRun tuner and is expected to overcome [[digital rights management]] complications.

==HDHomeRun Premium TV==
Launched in 2018, HDHomeRun Premium TV is a [[Multichannel television in the United States|virtual MVPD]] service that works with HDHomeRun Prime and HDHomeRun DVR service. A unique feature of this service over most other MVPDs is the ability to record the channel streams to a local hard drive for time-shifted viewing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9380">The '''ISO 22715 standard''' provides guidelines for manufacturers in the best practices for [[cosmetic packaging|cosmetic packaging and labelling]] of all [[cosmetics|cosmetic products]]. This standard applies to products that fall under the category of cosmetics that are sold or given away as free [[Product sample|samples]]. ISO 22715 was initially published in April 2006.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Cosmetic packaging compliant to ISO 22715|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/cosmetic-packaging-compliant-to-iso-22715|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO22715:2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics -- Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The intent of Standard ISO 22715 is to specify how cosmetic products should be packaged and labeled to maintain a certain level of standards within the [[cosmetic industry]]. This standard applies to cosmetic products whether the product is sold or given away. It is one of 26 published standards that are devoted to the cosmetic industry sector.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

ISO 22715 does not regulate what products are to be considered cosmetic. This determination is left to the national [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]] of those countries that follow the ISO 22715 and use it as a guide to best practices for packaging and labeling cosmetic products. Often, these national regulations are stricter than those provided in the standard are.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the Standard ISO 22715 on Cosmetic Packaging legally binding?|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/is-the-standard-iso-22715-on-cosmetic-packaging-legally-binding|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labeling specifications==

ISO 22715 supports the need for consumers to know what is in the cosmetic products they purchase, how those products should be used and who has manufactured the products. To accomplish this, 22715 specifies that a product’s packaging should show certain information such as the [[ingredient]]s used in the product listed in descending order according to the percentage of each ingredient in the product. A list of coloring agents used in the product then follows the list of ingredients.

For safety purposes, ISO recommends including an explanation of what the product function is on the package, along with instructions for its use. Any precautionary or warning statements should also be printed on the package to caution consumers in the use of said product. Additional information that should appear on the packaging of cosmetic products includes:

* Manufacturer’s name and address
* Date of manufacture or batch number that can be used to identify the product
* Product’s weight or volume at the time it was packaged
* Recommendations for storage of the product
* ISO 22715 provides guidelines to be followed in how that information should appear on the packaging. If applicable, requirements are provided for primary and secondary packaging.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO22715:2006" /&gt;

==Relevance of ISO standards==

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) was formed in 1947. It is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that is based in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The ISO has 162 members and the organization represents the interest of international standards of 196 countries. This represents almost 97 percent of the world’s population.

The ISO’s purpose is to create standards that are used to help form public policies and business objectives that benefit people throughout the world. Since May 2016, there has been over 21,500 ISO standards published. The ISO develops new standards when industry sectors and their stakeholders determine that a need exists. The standards are developed under the oversight of the ISO through cooperative efforts between other NGOs, consumer organizations, representatives from [[government agencies]], academics and testing laboratories.&lt;ref name="IP-watch-on-ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

==Legal relevance of ISO 22715==

ISO 22715 is not legally binding, but it is the common denominator used for developing national regulations that address the labeling and packaging of cosmetic products. Regulators in individual countries often look to ISO standards as the benchmark for best practices for the different industry sectors in which they apply. Many regulators require businesses and manufacturers to comply with applicable ISO standards, in addition to local regulations.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

Currently, there are 26 published ISO standards devoted to the cosmetic sector, including ISO 22715. These standards are overseen by the ISO’s cosmetic product technical committee that was established in 1998.&lt;ref name="ISO-Office-and-Number"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO/TC 217 Cosmetics|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee%3Fcommid%3D54974|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee is composed of standardization bodies from major markets, such as leading ASEAN countries, most European counties and the United States via ANSI. Thirty-nine countries participate in the creation of standards for cosmetic products, with 27 observing countries within the committee.&lt;ref name="ISO-Countries"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO/TC 217 - Cosmetics_ Participating and Observing Countries|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee_participation.htm?commid=54974|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To better distribute and update standards as needed, the ISO maintains the copyright on its standards. Most standards are reviewed and updated every five to seven years to remain relevant to the latest technologies within [[industry sector]]s.&lt;ref name="IP-watch-on-ISO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saez|first1=Catherine|title=International Standards Key To Helping The World With Many Issues, ISO Says|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2012/05/18/international-standards-key-to-helping-the-world-with-many-issues-iso-says/|publisher=Intellectual Property Watch|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO 22715 and local regulations==

Often, local regulations may exceed the requirements specified in ISO 22715. In the [[United States]], the Food &amp; Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) regulates the cosmetic industry&lt;ref name="FDA-Cosmetics&amp;US-Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetics &amp; U.S. Law |url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with standards that are provided by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), in which the FDA is member.&lt;ref name="StandardsConformityBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Research Council (U.S.). International Standards, Conformity Assessment, and U.S. Trade Policy Project Committee|title=Standards, Conformity Assessment, and Trade Into the 21st Century|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|pages=60|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=GkMrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=ansi+and+fda+cooperation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7C7YcA94iX&amp;sig=IufKitcKO3B5-SwEbW4MGbGxpfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYz4eiibnPAhXC0hoKHSVrDdEQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=ansi%20and%20fda%20cooperation&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper_FDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to FDA regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-fda-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], cosmetic manufacturers must abide by Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 Article 19 for the labeling of cosmetic products.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Packaging-in-EU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=What you should know when packaging cosmetics compliant to EU regulations|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/what-you-should-know-when-packaging-cosmetics-compliant-to-eu-regulations|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU-Regulation-On-Cosmetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 1223/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 30 November 2009  on cosmetic products|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009R1223|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24148">'''In-Situ Capping (ISC) of Subaqueous Waste''' is a non-removal [[environmental remediation|remediation]] technique for contaminated [[sediment]] that involves leaving the waste in place and isolating it from the environment by placing a layer of soil and/or material over the contaminated waste as to prevent further spread of the [[contaminant]]. In-situ capping provides a viable way to remediate an area that is contaminated. It is an option when [[Environmental remediation#Pump and treat|pump and treat]] becomes too expensive and the area surrounding the site is a low energy system. The design of the cap and the characterization of the surrounding areas are of equal importance and drive the feasibility of the entire project. Numerous successful cases exist and more will exist in the future as the technology expands and grows more popular.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt; In-situ capping uses techniques developed in [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geotechnical engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[environmental geotechnical engineering]].

==Introduction==
[[Contaminant]]s located in sediments still pose a risk to the environment and human health. Some of the direct effects on aquatic life that can be associated with contaminated sediment include “the development of cancerous tumors in fish exposed to [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s in sediments."&lt;ref name="Palermo"&gt;Palermo, M., Maynord, S., Miller, J., and Reible, D. 1998. "Guidance for [[In-Situ]] Subaqueous Capping of Contaminated Sediments," EPA 905-B96-004, Great Lakes National Program Office, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; These high-risk sediments need to be remediated. There are usually only four options for remediation:

#Nonremoval technologies&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
## Containment in-place (In-Situ Capping)
## Treatment in-place
#Removal technologies&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
## Removal and containment
## Removal and treatment

The cap can be made up of many different things, including but not limited to sand, gravel, [[geotextile]]s, and multiple layers of these options.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;

There are many ways that a contaminant inside sediment can become introduced to the environment. These ways include but are not limited to advection, diffusion, [[Benthos|benthic organisms]] mixing and reworking of the upper layer of the contaminated sediment, and sediment re-suspension by different subaquatic forces.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; In-situ capping (ISC) can fix all of these adverse effects with three primary functions:

# Isolation of the contaminated sediment from the benthic environment; this prevents the contaminant from spreading up the food chain.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt; This isolation of the contaminant is the most important factor in reducing exposure risks.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
# Prevention of resuspension and transport of the contaminant, referred to as stabilization of the sediments.&lt;ref name="Palermo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
# Reduction of the flux of dissolved contaminants into the water column, also known as chemical isolation.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"&gt;Reible, D. 2003. “In Situ Remediation Through Capping: Status and Research Needs,” Department of Civil Engineering, University of Texas. Austin, Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth, although not necessary, function of an in-situ cap should be the "encouragement of habitat values." This should not be made a primary goal except in extreme circumstances. This can be achieved by altering the superficial characteristics of the cap to "encourage desirable species or discourage undesirable species."&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

The obvious advantage of using in-situ capping is that the waste will not be disturbed, and it prevents further contamination of the surrounding area from movement of the contaminant by removal. Sadly, the long-term effects of ISC have not been studied since it is an emerging technology.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

In-situ capping has been effective in numerous locations. For example, in several places in the interior of Japan “in-situ capping of nutrient-laden sediments with sand” has worked very well in preserving water quality by reducing “the release of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)” and oxygen depletion by bottom sediments.&lt;ref name="Zeman"&gt;Zeman, A. J., Sills, S., Graham, J. E., and Klein, K. A. 1992. Subaqueous Capping of Contaminated Sediments: Annotated Bibliography, NWRI Contribution No. 92-65, National Water Research Institute, Burlington, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site evaluation==

===Remedial objectives===
It is very important to evaluate the site and goals of a specific project to determine if ISC is the right technique to use. First, it is important to find out if ISC will satisfy all of the desired remedial objectives. To determine if ISC will satisfy the remedial objectives it is important to look at the three primary functions previously listed for ISC. For the first function it is important to realize that “the ability of an ISC to isolate aquatic organisms from the sediment contaminants is dependent upon” the deposition of new sediment contaminants being deposited on the cap. If contaminated sediment is deposited back on top of the cap then a cap was built to separate to contaminated layers. Thus, “ISC should only be considered if source control has been implemented."  Stabilization of the contaminated sediment could be a design function if the goal of remediation is to prevent negative environmental impacts due to “resuspension, transport and redeposition” of the contaminated sediments to other remote areas. Furthermore, if a remedial objective is desired, then the purpose of the ISC could be to isolate the contaminated soil from the surrounding environment, thus controlling the environment of the contaminated soil and causing possible degradation of the contaminate.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Criteria===
On site evaluation to see if ISC is a good remediation technique is based on several criteria: the surrounding physical environment, current and long-term hydrodynamic conditions, the geotechnical and geological conditions, hydrogeological conditions, on-site sediment characterization, and current and long-term waterway uses.&lt;ref name="Sharma" /&gt;

Many of the physical properties of the surrounding area where the cap would be placed are important. Some things to consider when constructing a cap would be “waterway dimensions, water depths, tidal patterns, ice formations, aquatic vegetation, bridge crossings and proximity of lands or marine structures”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; It is best if the area surrounding the ISC is flat for ease of installation.

===Hydrodynamic conditions===
The hydrodynamic conditions are of equal importance. It is best if in-situ capping projects are performed in low-energy waterways such as harbors, low flow streams, or estuaries.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;Sharma, H., Reddy, K. 2004. ''Geo-Environmental Engineering'', Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies, pp 938–958.&lt;/ref&gt; High energy and high flow environments can affect the long-term stability of the cap and cause plausible erosion over time. Currents are also important. Currents vary along a water column and placement of the ISC can be negatively affected by changing currents. It is important to take into consideration the long-term impacts of episodic events such as tidal flow on bottom current velocities. Modeling must be done to determine if placement of the in-situ cap will alter existing hydrodynamic conditions.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Geotechnical and geological conditions===
A study of the geotechnical and geological conditions must be made before the placement of the in-situ cap because of potential settling underneath the cap. If settling is predicted to be significant, the cap design may have to be designed thicker than originally projected to allow the settling to not alter the integrity of the cap.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

Hydrogeological conditions are important to consider before placement. It is important to locate areas of discharge, which are areas where the groundwater flow path has an upward component.&lt;ref name="Freeze"&gt;Freeze, R.A. and Cherry, J.A. 1979; ''Groundwater''&lt;/ref&gt; This discharge can cause the in-situ cap to become displaced or cause containments to be transported to the surface water, thus causing decreased effectiveness of the in-situ cap.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Sediment characterization===
Typical sediment characterization is needed before construction and design of the ISC can be implemented. These tests on the sediments include: “visual classification, natural water content/solids concentrations, plasticity indices ([[Atterberg limits]]), [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) content, grain size distribution, [[specific gravity]], and Unified Soil Classification System (USCS)”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Waterway uses===
It is important to realize what the current waterway uses are and how they may be affected with the placement of an in-situ cap. Some waterway uses that may be affected by the construction of an in-situ cap include but are not limited to “navigation, flood control, recreation, water supply, storm water or effluent discharge, waterfront development, and utility crossing." Since the construction of an in-situ cap may limit some of these activities due to the importance that the caps integrity be maintained over an extended period of time, any use that may cause displacement of the cap should be limited. Furthermore, the construction of an in-situ cap will cause a drop in water depth thus limiting the size of ships that may cross the area. These limitations on the waterway may also have social and economic impacts that must be considered.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Regulatory standards===
It is important to know all of the regulatory standards in place for the desired location of the ISC. All ISC must comply with the requirements in the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), although the ability of in-situ capping to meet those standards in the long term has not been successfully researched and studied enough due to lack of data.

==Cap design==
Cap design, which includes the composition and dimensions of the components, is probably the most important aspect of in-situ capping. The cap designs “must be compatible with available construction and placement techniques” along with meeting the three previously mentioned criteria above. The cap designs usually are over small areas with small volumes of contaminants. The cap is usually constructed with many layers of granular media, armor stone, and geotextiles. Presently, laboratory tests and models of the various processes involved (advection, diffusion, bioturbation, consolidation, erosion), limited field experience, and monitoring data drive cap design. Since data and field experience is limited a conservative approach is used when designing an in-situ cap. This approach uses the idea that the many different components are additive and no cap component provides a dual function, although a component may provide a dual function in actual practice.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===The six steps of cap design===
The six general steps for in-situ cap design, provided by Palermo et al. are listed below:&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

# Identify candidate capping materials and compatibility with contaminated sediment at the site.
# Assess the bioturbation potential of indigenous benthos and design a cap component to physically isolate sediment contaminants from the benthic environment.
# Evaluate potential erosion at the capping site due to currents, waves, propeller wash, and design a cap component to stabilize the contaminated sediments and other cap components.
# Evaluate the potential flux of sediment contaminants and design a cap component to reduce the flux of dissolved contaminants into the water column.
# Evaluate potential interactions and compatibility among cap components, including consolidation of compressible materials.
# Evaluate operational considerations and determine restrictions or additional protective measure needed to assure cap integrity.

===Selection of materials===
Identifying the materials should be assessed at the beginning of the project because they typically represent the largest cost to the project. Thus, if the materials needed cost too much the project may not be feasible at all.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;
Granular materials are used in most cases. These can include but are not limited to “quarry sand, naturally occurring sediments or soil materials”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Studies have shown that fine-grained materials and sandy materials can be effective in the construction of an in-situ cap.&lt;ref name=Brannon&gt;Brannon, J. M., Hoeppel, R. E., Sturgis, T. C., Smith, I., and Gunnison, D. 1985. “Effectiveness of Capping in Isolating Contaminated Dredged Material from Biota and the Overlying Water, “ Technical Report, D-85-10, US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, fine grain materials have been shown to act as better chemical barriers than sand caps.&lt;ref name="Suszkowski"&gt;Suszkowski, D. J. 1983. “Studies on Capping of Contaminated Dredged Material by the New York District Corps of Engineers.” In Proceedings of the 7th Annual US/Japan Experts Meeting, 134–145. US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station: Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a fine grain material is a better capping component than factory-washed sand.  It is important to have control the amount of organic material within the cap because the benthic organisms have shown interest in burrowing within any unconsolidated fine grained sediments containing organic matter.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Increased levels of organic matter in sands have shown an increase in the retardation of hydrophobic organic contaminants through the cap and encourage degradation of contaminant.&lt;ref name="Reible" /&gt; Thus a careful balance of organics is necessary.

===Geomembranes===
[[Geomembranes]] can serve numerous purposes in a cap design, including “provide a bioturbation barrier; stabilize the cap; reduce contaminant flux; prevent mixing of cap materials with underlying sediments; promote uniform consolidation, and; reduce erosion of capping materials”.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt; Geomembranes have been used for stabilization in two projects along with granular media for the ISC constructed at [[Sheboygan River]] and in Eitrheim Bay, Norway.&lt;ref name="Instanes"&gt;Instanes. D. 1994. “Pollution Control of a Norwegian Fjord by Use of Geotextiles,” Fifth International Conference on Geotextiles, Geomembranes, and Related Products, Singapore, 5–9 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Although geomembranes seem to have great benefits, the problem of uplift and ballooning has arisen and not much research has gone into assessing what causes the lift of the geomembranes off of the surface.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;Cooke et al 1993.'' Restoration and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs'', Second Edition, Lewis Publishers, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is needed to determine the overall effectiveness of [[geosynthetics]] for chemical isolation.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Cap armoring===
[[Armoring stone]], which is any stone that is used to "shield" the rest of the in-situ cap, can be used for resistance to erosion and should be considered in cap design.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt; The long-term ability of the cap to perform depends primarily on its ability to withstand external forces, mostly hydraulic forces.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt; There are three basic approaches that may be used to have long-term cap stability:

#The cap layer needs to be armored sufficiently to hold up under the various hydraulic forces.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#Cap at a deeper layer since hydraulic forces typically decrease with decreasing depth.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#Try to control the hydraulic forces to limit their effect on the cap layer with breakwaters, dams, navigational controls, etc.&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

===Bioturbation===
[[Bioturbation]] is defined as the disturbance and mixing of sediments by benthic organisms. Many aquatic organisms live on or in the bottom sediments and can greatly increase the “migration of sediment contaminants through the direct movement of sediment particles, increasing the surface area of sediments exposed to the water column, and as a food for [[epibenthic]] or [[pelagic]] organism grazing on the benthos." The depth of bioturbation in marine environments is greater than that in fresh water environments. To prevent and reduce the impact of bioturbation on the cap, the cap should be designed with a sacrificial layer, typically only a few centimeters thick (5–10&amp;nbsp;cm). This layer will be assumed to be completely mixed with the environment and should prevent benthic organism from descending further into the in-situ cap. The thickness of the sacrificial layer should be based on a study of the local organisms and their behavior in the surrounding sediment near the area of the cap construction, since some benthic organisms have been known to burrow at depths of 1m or more. The presence of armor stone has been known to limit the colonization by deep burrowing benthic creatures. Another method of preventing benthic organisms from destroying the integrity of the cap design is to pick a granular media that the local benthic organism find unattractive and are not known to readily colonize on that surface, thus limiting the chance a benthic organism will grown on the cap.

The consolidation of the in-situ cap must be considered, provided that the selected material for the cap “is fine-grained granular material." The consolidation of the underlying material should be taken into account due to “advection of pore water upward into the cap during consolidation."&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Erosional effects===
Erosion should be carefully considered. To determine the level of protection against erosion it is important to look at “the potential severity of the environmental impacts associated with cap erosion and potential dispersion of the sediment contaminants in an extreme event” (such as a 100-year event). An under-designed in-situ cap could be compromised by erosion resulting in the release of contaminants. An over-designed cap would result in extremely high costs.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

==Construction==
Since the construction of the cap will directly affect the ability of the in-situ cap to perform it is important to plan carefully. It is important to note that "many contaminated sediment sites exhibit exceedingly soft sediments that can be easily disturbed, may be dislocated or destabilized by uneven placement, and may have insufficient load bearing capacity to support some cap materials." &lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

There are two basic was to construct an in-situ cap:
#Land-based placement: this involves using equipment near the shore or working in narrow channels. The cap in constructed with standard construction equipment such as "backhoes, clamshells, dumped from trucks, and/or spread with bulldozers." The major limitation of this method is the reach of the equipment.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;
#Pipeline or barge placement: this involves placing the in-situ cap with a barge or a pipeline. Using different types of equipment to place the cap components on the ocean bed or lake bed. This is typically the desired method when working in deep areas or offshore.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

==Monitoring==

===Five steps for a monitoring program===
Fredette et al. outlines five steps for the development of a physical/biological monitoring program for ISC projects:&lt;ref name="Fredette"&gt;Fredette, T.J., Nelson, D.A., Clausner, J.E., and Anders, F.J. 1990. “Guidelines for Physical and Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Dredged Material Disposal Sites,” Technical Report D-90-12, US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Miss.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Designating site-specific monitoring objectives
# Identifying elements of the monitoring plan
# Predicting responses and developing testable hypotheses
# Designating sampling design and methods
# Designating management options

Thus it is important a monitoring program be put into place at the onset of construction. A short-term monitoring program should be used to monitor the in-situ cap during construction and immediately following construction. This monitoring program should include frequent testing so real-time data is provided to allow quick adjustments to the overall cap design. A long-term monitoring program should be established to provide data about the overall effectiveness of the cap design and to make sure the cap is meeting all of its required regulations and that the cap is not excessively eroded. This long-term monitoring need only be assessed on a yearly to bi-yearly basis unless a problem is discovered; then more frequent testing will be required.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

During monitoring, it is important to schedule routine maintenance. This may include placement of material equal to the predicted amount of material removed due to erosion.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

==Case studies==
Although ISC is a relatively new remediation procedure several groups have used it with great success.

===General Motors Superfund Site===
In [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]], at the [[General Motors]] [[Superfund site]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-contaminated soils were dredged repeatedly but some areas still had high levels of contaminant (&gt;10ppm). These areas were capped, an approximate area of {{convert|75000|sqft|m2}}, with a three-layer ISC composed of 6&amp;nbsp;inches of sand, 6&amp;nbsp;inches of gravel and 6&amp;nbsp;inches of armor stone.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Manistique River, Michigan===
In [[Manistique River]], [[Michigan]], PCB-contaminated sediments were capped with a 40mm thick plastic liner over an area of {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}} with varying depths of up to 15&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name="Palermo" /&gt;

===Sheboygan River, Wisconsin===
In Sheboygan River, Wisconsin, PCB-contaminated sediments were capped with a sand layer and armor stone layer. This was done in shallow regions were direct placement was possible.&lt;ref name="Eleder"&gt;Eleder, B. 1992. Sheboygan River Capping/armoring Demonstration Project, Presented at a Workshop on Capping Contaminated Sediments, May 27–28, 1992, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marathon Battery Remediation Project===
In [[Cold Spring, New York]], in the [[Hudson River]], sediment was contaminated with cadmium and nickel from a battery manufacturing facility. A Geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and a 12-inch covering of sandy loam was planted on top of the contaminated area.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

===Galaxy/Spectron Superfund Site===
In  [[Elkton, Maryland]], contaminated sediment was discovered with excess amounts of [[Volatile organic compound|volatile organic]] components and [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]]s, resulting is severe discharge. The cap system constructed over the contaminated waste involved a geotextile working mat, a GCL, a scrim-reinforced polypropylene liner, a geotextile cushion, and a gabion mat.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

==Future research==
There are four major areas of research that currently need to be assessed:

#"Research into the fate and transport behavior of specific contaminants that do not behave in the simple manner assumed in current cap evaluation approaches (e.g. mercury)" &lt;ref name ="Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into the fate processes associated with physical, chemical and biological gradients within a cap" &lt;ref name = "Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into the influence of transport processes facilitated by [[nonaqueous phase liquid]] ([[NAPL]]) or gas migration"&lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;
#"Research into cap amendments that may encourage sequestration or degradation fate processes" &lt;ref name="Reible"/&gt;

'''Kayayei''' or '''Kaya Yei''' is a Ghanaian term that refers to a female [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] or bearer. Many of these women have migrated from a rural community to any of [[Ghana]]'s urban cities in search of work.&lt;ref name="viasat1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.viasat1.com.gh/vone/news/features.php?postId=196 | title=A LOOK AT THE PLIGHTS OF GHANAIAN FEMALE PORTERS (KAYAYEI) | publisher=[[Viasat 1]] | accessdate=26 August 2014 | author=Sabutey, Victus K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="joyon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2014/february-5th/parliament-summons-gender-minister-over-kayayei.php | title=Parliament summons Gender Minister over 'Kayayei' | publisher=myjoyonline | accessdate=26 August 2014 | author=Gyasiwaa, Adwoa}}&lt;/ref&gt; They generally [[Head-carrying|carry their burdens on their heads]].

==Etymology==
The term ''kayayei'' (singular, ''kaya yoo'') is a [[compound word|compound]] formed from two [[languages of Ghana|languages spoken in Ghana]]. ''Kaya'' means "load, luggage, goods&lt;ref name="viasat1"/&gt;  or burden"&lt;ref name="gurdian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/22/ghanas-female-porters-get-family-planning-advice | title=Ghana's female porters get family planning advice | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=26 August 2014 | author=Kearney, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Hausa language]], and ''yei'' means "women or females" in the [[Ga language]],&lt;ref name="viasat1"/&gt;. People in [[Kumasi]] refer to the porters as ''paa o paa''.

==Roleh==
''Kaya'' have always been [[manual labour]]ers. They transport goods to and from markets, particularly agricultural goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ghanawebonline.com/world/19-africa/6052-oye-lithur-warns-against-trafficking-of-kayayei.html|title=Oye Lithur Warns Against Trafficking Of 'Kayayei'|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, ''Kaya'' carry their loads in a large pan placed on their heads, using a moistened coil of cloth as a buffer, see [[Head-carrying]].

==Conditions==
''Kaya Yei'' still toil away in markets in Ghana today, often in poor conditions and with minimal income. Occasionally, ''Kaya'' are brought into private homes to perform domestic tasks, where they may earn slightly more.  The ''Kaya'' are often transient, and often without basic sanitation. Basic hygiene &amp; nutrition conditions are also poor. In larger cities such as [[Accra]] &amp; [[Kumasi]], ''Kaya'' are often migrants from remote regions who have come to the cities in search for better employment prospects.&lt;ref name="viasat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joyon"/&gt;

In May 2016, the Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection [[Nana Oye Lithur]] ensured that over 1,000 ''kayayei'' from [[Agbogbloshie market|Agbogbloshie]] and [[Mallam Atta market]]s in Accra were registered onto the [[National Health Insurance Scheme (Ghana)|National Health Insurance Scheme]], to help provide them access to basic healthcare service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Over-2-000-Kayayei-500-Aged-registered-onto-NHIS-in-Ashanti-Region-439904|title=Over 2,000 Kayayei, 500 Aged registered onto NHIS in Ashanti Region|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2017 annual budget, the Minister of Finance [[Ken Ofori-Atta]] exempted ''kayayei'' from paying market tolls to their various assemblies .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessghana.com/site/news/general/142409/Kayayei-tax-abolished-2017-budget|title=Kayayei tax abolished - 2017 budget - BusinessGhana|last=|first=|date=|website=www.businessghana.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Underlinked|date=June 2014}}

The '''Ministry of Energy, Science &amp; Technology, and Public Utilities''' ([[Belize]]) was founded in 2012. The Ministry is currently divided into the Department of Geology and Petroleum, the Energy Unit and the Science and Technology Unit. The Ministry is represented by Senator [[Joy Grant]] and CEO Dr Colin Young, and has an office in [[Belmopan]].

== Geology and Petroleum Department ==

The Geology and Petroleum Department was established in 1984 as part of the Ministry of Natural Resources.  In 2012 the department moved to the new Ministry of Energy, Science  &amp; Technology and Public Utilities.&lt;ref name="estpu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estpu.gov.bz/index.php/geology-petroleum |title=Ministry of Energy, Science &amp; Technology and Public Utilities - Geology &amp; Petroleum Department |publisher=Estpu.gov.bz |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department is responsible for governance of the petroleum industry in Belize. The department's mission statement is to "To accelerate the development of Belize’s petroleum resources through the creation of a vibrant petroleum industry, with the assistance of international investors, cognizant of environmental costs, thereby improving the welfare of Belizeans into the 21st century."&lt;ref name="estpu1"/&gt;

== Energy Unit ==

The Energy Unit was established in 2012 and has responsibility for governance of the energy sector in Belize. The Unit's mission statement is to "To plan, promote and effectively manage the production, delivery and use of energy through Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, and Cleaner Production interventions for the sustainable development of Belize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estpu.gov.bz/index.php/energy |title=Ministry of Energy, Science &amp; Technology and Public Utilities - Energy |publisher=Estpu.gov.bz |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Key activities performed by the Energy Unit include data collection for the purpose of planning Belize's future energy supplies and calculating greenhouse gas emissions, public awareness on topics such as energy efficiency, as well as regulation and market reforms that promote a sustainable future for Belize.

== Science and Technology Unit ==

The Science and Technology Unit is responsible for the promotion of Science and Technology in Belize. The Unit plays a key role in Belize's efforts to achieve [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development|Target 8.f]] in the millennium development goals.  The Unit conducts a number of activities that promote engagement with Science and Technology in Belize, including through the ICT roadshow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrickjonesbelize.com/2014/03/26/caribbean-ict-roadshow-belize-city/ |title=Caribbean ICT Roadshow comes to Belize City &amp;#124; Belize News and Opinion on www.patrickjonesbelize.com |publisher=Patrickjonesbelize.com |date=2014-03-30 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Space Shuttle America.jpg|thumb|The shuttle sitting outside the [[Space Shuttle America]] ride is an example of a mockup]]
[[File:CCC-Google StreetView Attrappe - FSA09.jpg|thumb|[[Google Street View]] mockup in [[Freiheit statt Angst]] demonstration, Berlin, September 11, 2010]]

In [[manufacturing]] and [[design]], a '''mockup''', or '''mock-up''', is a [[scale model|scale]] or full-size model &lt;!-- NOTE: Don't link "model"; it is a disambiguation page, and there is no Wikipedia article with the breadht required for this usage of "model" --&gt; of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup is a ''[[prototype]]'' if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vieru, Tudor |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/KSC-Gets-Orion-Mock-Up-for-Testing-103300.shtml |title=KSC Gets Orion Mock-Up for Testing |publisher=News.softpedia.com|date= 30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mock-ups are used by designers mainly to acquire feedback from users. Mock-ups address the idea captured in a popular engineering one-liner: You can fix it now on the drafting board with an eraser or you can fix it later on the construction site with a sledge hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/mock-ups.html |title=Mock-ups |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Mockups are used as [[design tool]]s virtually everywhere a new product is designed.

[[File:Boeing 2707 mock-up.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing 2707]] mockup at the [[Hiller Aviation Museum]] ]]Mockups are used in the automotive device industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, overall impression, and shapes are tested in a [[wind tunnel]] experiment. They can also be used to test consumer reaction.

== Systems engineering ==
Mockups, [[website wireframe|wireframes]] and prototypes are not so cleanly distinguished in [[Software engineering|software]] and [[systems engineering]], where mockups are a way of designing [[user interface]]s on paper or in computer images. A software mockup will thus look like the real thing, but will not do useful work beyond what the user sees. A software prototype, on the other hand, will look and work just like the real thing. In many cases it is best to design or prototype the user interface before [[source code]] is written or hardware is built, to avoid having to go back and make expensive changes.

Early layouts of a World Wide Web site or pages are often called ''mockups''. A large selection of [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] or [[Open-source software|open-source]] software tools are available for this purpose.

== Military acquisition ==
Mockups are part of the [[military acquisition]] process.  Mockups are often used to test [[human factors]] and [[aerodynamics]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Todd, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA490527&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf "Lessons Learned From Product Manager (PM) Infantry Combat Vehicle (ICV) Using Soldier Evaluation in the Design Phase"], ''ARMY AL&amp;T Magazine'', April–June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, mockups include [[wire-frame model]]s. They can also be used for public display and demonstration purposes prior to the development of a prototype, as with the case of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] mock-up aircraft.

== Consumer goods==
Mockups are used in the consumer goods industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, human factors, overall impression, and [[commercial art]] are tested in [[marketing research]].

== Furniture and cabinetry ==
Mockups are commonly required by designers, architects, and end users for custom furniture and cabinetry.&lt;ref&gt;Jesberger, Lee A., [http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Mock_Ups.html "Mock Ups"], ''Pro Woodworking Tips'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission|United States Consumer Product Safety Commission]], [http://www.cpsc.gov/LIBRARY/FOIA/meetings/mtg08/smoldering7_14.pdf "Log of Meeting: Demonstration of the Proposed Smoldering Test Procedures"], 14 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is often to produce a full-sized replica, using inexpensive materials in order to verify a design. Mockups are often used to determine the proportions of the piece, relating to various dimensions of the piece itself, or to fit the piece into a specific space or room. The ability to see how the design of the piece relates to the rest of the space is also an important factor in determining size and design.

When designing a functional piece of furniture, such as a desk or table, mockups can be used to test whether they suit typical human shapes and sizes. Designs that fail to consider these issues may not be practical to use. Mockups can also be used to test color, finish, and design details which cannot be visualized from the initial drawings and sketches. Mockups used for this purpose can be on a reduced scale.

The cost of making mockups is often more than repaid by the savings made by avoiding going into production with a design which needs improvement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Software engineering ==
The most common use of mockups in software development is to create user interfaces that show the end user what the software will look like without having to build the software or the underlying functionality. Software UI mockups can range from very simple hand drawn screen layouts, through realistic bitmaps, to semi functional user interfaces developed in a software development tool.

Mockups are often used to create [[Unit testing|unit tests]] - there they are usually called [[mock object]]s. The main reasons to create such mockups is to be able to test one part of a software system (a unit) without having to use dependent modules. The function of these dependencies is then "faked" using mock objects.

This is especially important if the functions that are simulated like this are difficult to obtain (for example because it involves complex computation) or if the result is non-deterministic, such as the readout of a sensor.

A common style of software design is [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA), where many components communicate via [[Communications_protocol|protocols]] such as [[HTTP]]. [[Service virtualization]] and [[Comparison of API simulation tools|API mocks and simulators]] are examples of implementations of mockups or so called over-the-wire [[Test_double|test doubles]] in [[Software system|software systems]] that are modelling dependent [[Component-based software engineering|components]] or [[Microservices|microservices]] in SOA environments.

Mockup software can also be used for micro level evaluation, for example to check a single function, and derive results from the tests to enhance the products power and usability on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prototypingtool.com/mockups |title=Mockups |publisher=Prototypingtool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Architectural Mockup.jpg|thumb|Architectural mockup for a new urbanist community in McKinney, Texas, US]]
At the beginning of a project's construction, architects will often direct contractors to provide material mockups for review.  These allow the design team to review material and color selections, and make modifications before product orders are placed. Architectural mockups can also be used for performance testing (such as water penetration at window installations, for example) and help inform the subcontractors how details are to be installed.

The expression is often more generally applied to molecules that simply mimic functions that occur at the macroscopic level. The term is also common in [[nanotechnology]] where a number of highly complex molecular machines have been proposed that are aimed at the goal of constructing a [[molecular assembler]].

For the last several decades, chemists and physicists alike have attempted, with varying degrees of success, to miniaturize machines found in the macroscopic world. Molecular machines research is currently at the forefront with the 2016 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] being awarded to [[Jean-Pierre Sauvage]], [[Fraser Stoddart|Sir J.

== Types ==
Molecular machines can be divided into two broad categories; artificial and biological. In general, artificial molecular machines (AMMs) refer to molecules that are artificially designed and synthesized whereas biological molecular machines can commonly be found in nature.&lt;ref name="Erbas-Cakmak 2015 10081–10206"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erbas-Cakmak|first=Sundus|last2=Leigh|first2=David A.|last3=McTernan|first3=Charlie T.|last4=Nussbaumer|first4=Alina L.|title=Artificial Molecular Machines|url=http://pubs.acs.org.proxy.library.ohio.edu/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00146|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=115|issue=18|pages=10081–10206|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00146|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial===
A wide variety of artificial molecular machines (AMMs) have been synthesized by [[chemists]] which are
rather simple and small compared to biological molecular machines.&lt;ref name="Erbas-Cakmak 2015 10081–10206"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The first AMM, a [[molecular shuttle]], was synthesized by [[Fraser Stoddart|Sir J. Fraser Stoddart]]. &lt;ref name="10.1021/ja00013a096"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anelli |first1=Pier Lucio |last2=Spencer |first2=Neil |last3=Stoddart |first3=J. Fraser |title=A molecular shuttle |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=June 1991 |volume=113 |issue=13 |pages=5131–5133 |doi=10.1021/ja00013a096}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[molecular shuttle]] is a [[rotaxane]] molecule where a ring is mechanically interlocked onto an axle with two bulky stoppers. The ring can move between two binding sites with various stimuli such as light, pH, solvents, and ions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bruns |first1=Carson J. |last2=Stoddart |first2=J. Fraser |title=Rotaxane-Based Molecular Muscles |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |date=30 May 2014 |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=2186–2199 |doi=10.1021/ar500138u}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the authors of this 1991 [[Journal of the American Chemical Society|JACS]] paper noted: “Insofar as it becomes possible to control the movement of one molecular component with respect to the other in a [2]rotaxane, the technology for building molecular machines will emerge.”, [[mechanically interlocked molecular architectures]] spearheaded AMM design and synthesis as they provide directed molecular motion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kay |first1=Euan R. |last2=Leigh |first2=David A. |title=Rise of the Molecular Machines |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=24 August 2015 |volume=54 |issue=35 |pages=10080–10088 |doi=10.1002/anie.201503375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today a wide variety of AMMs exists as listed below.

In 2018, an international team of researchers, led by researchers from the [[University of Osaka]], Japan, created a molecular machine in which elements of a mechanical ratchet were used. The main advantage of this machine is that it provides movement in only one direction. In addition, some features of the structure of the molecular machine provide the best balance between the produced motion and chemical reactivity of the molecules that make up it, that is a problem in itself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecnmag.com/news/2018/06/ratchet-pressure-molecular-machine-exploits-motion-single-direction "Ratchet Up The Pressure: Molecular Machine Exploits Motion In A Single Direction"] ECN Magazine, June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Moodle was originally developed by [[Martin Dougiamas]] to help educators create online courses with a focus on interaction and collaborative construction of content, and it is in continual evolution. The first version of Moodle was released on 20 August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases#Moodle_1.0|title=Releases - MoodleDocs|website=docs.moodle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the Moodle Project is led and coordinated by Moodle HQ, an Australian company of 50 developers which is financially supported by a network of eighty-four Moodle Partner service companies worldwide. Moodle's development has also been assisted by the work of open-source programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.com/life/15/4/how-moodle-manages-community-feedback|title=How Moodle is driven by user and community feedback|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moodle as a learning platform can enhance existing learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Technology that puts the classroom in students' laptops|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/technology-that-puts-the-classroom-in-students-laptops/article21627186/|publisher= Adam Stanley, The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[E-learning]] tool, Moodle has a wide range of standard and innovative features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.heacademy.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.11120/ndir.2013.00009|title=E-assessment: Past, present and future|first=Sally|last=Jordan|publisher=|volume=9|issue=1|pages=87–106|doi=10.11120/ndir.2013.00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a calendar and a Gradebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elearningindustry.com/online-grading-make-teaching-life-easier|title=Online Grading to Make Teaching Life Easier with Moodle|date=19 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moodle is a leading [[virtual learning environment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Open Universities VLE / LMS |url= https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ByI9ksKa5dYWqR-_T6vmu9hjcuyuV7ywTOIW_mPNK0Y/edit#gid=0l}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 2014 Survey of Technology Enhanced Learning for higher education in the UK |url= http://www.ucisa.ac.uk/~/media/groups/dsdg/Tel%202014%20Final%2018%20August.ashx |publisher= UCISA Richard Walker, Julie Voce, Joe Nicholls, Elaine Swift,  Jebar Ahmed, Sarah Horrigan and Phil Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elearningindustry.com/top-open-source-learning-management-systems|title=The Top 8 Open Source Learning Management Systems - eLearning Industry|date=31 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used in many types of environments such as education, training and development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Plugins ===
Plugins are a flexible tool set, allowing Moodle users to extend the features of the site. There are hundreds of plugins for Moodle, extending the features of Moodle's core functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Moodle Plugins Directory|url= https://moodle.org/plugins/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each plugin is maintained in the Moodle plugins directory. As of June 2017, there are 1,342 plugins available for Moodle with over 405,200 recent downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moodle.org/plugins/|title=Moodle plugins directory|website=moodle.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Themes ===
Graphical themes for Moodle can be installed to change the look and functionality of a Moodle site or of an individual course.

=== Mobile ===
Many Moodle themes, based on [[responsive web design]], allow Moodle to be used on [[mobile device]]s. Also, a Moodle [[mobile app]] is available in [[Google Play]], [[App Store (iOS)]], and the [[Windows Phone Store]].

== E-learning standards support ==

Moodle has adopted the following e-learning standards:
* [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model|Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)]] is a collection of E-learning standards and specifications that define communications between client side content and a server side learning management system, as well as how externally authored content should be packaged in order to integrate with the LMS effectively. There are two versions: SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004. Moodle is SCORM 1.2 compliant, and passes all the tests in the ADL Conformance test suite 1.2.7 for SCORM 1.2. SCORM 2004 is not supported in Moodle, however Rustici Software have a Moodle plugin which can turn any Moodle site into a fully compliant SCORM 2004 LMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCORM Cloud Moodle Integration | url=http://scorm.com/scorm-solved/scorm-cloud-features/app-integrations/moodle-integration/ |publisher=scorm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The AICC HACP standard for CMI was developed by the [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee (AICC)]] and is used to call externally authored content and assessment packages. AICC content packages are supported in Moodle 2.1 and later versions.
* [[IMS Global|IMS]] Common Cartridge packages can also be imported into Moodle. In addition, Moodle Book activities can be exported as IMS Content Packages.
* [[Learning Tools Interoperability]] (LTI) is a standard way of integrating rich learning applications (often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services) with educational platforms. Moodle uses the External Tool activity to act as an 'LTI consumer' as standard, and will act as an 'LTI provider' using a plugin.

== Deployment ==

Users can download and install Moodle on a [[Web server]], such as [[Apache HTTP Server]], and a number of database management systems, such as [[PostgreSQL]], are supported. Pre-built combinations of Moodle with a Web server and database are available for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Macintosh]]. Other automated installation approaches exist, such as installing  a [[Debian]] package, deploying a ready-to-use [[TurnKey Linux Virtual Appliance Library|TurnKey]] Moodle appliance, using the [[Bitnami]] installer, or using a "one-click install" service such as [[Installatron]].

Certified Moodle Partners provide other Moodle services, including hosting, training, customization and content development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moodle.com/partners/|title=List of Moodle Partners|publisher=Moodle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This network of providers support development of the Moodle project through royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moodle.com/partners/about/|title=How do the Moodle Partners work?|publisher=Moodle}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date = April 2015|reason = Needs reliable, third-party published sources (not from Moodle, press releases, blogs, etc.) in order to keep this claim in the article.}}

==Interoperability==

Moodle runs without modification on [[Unix]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]], [[NetWare]] and any other systems that support [[PHP]] and a database, including webhost providers.

Moodle also has import features for use with other specific systems, such as importing quizzes or entire courses from [[Blackboard Learning System|Blackboard]] or WebCT. {{As of|2010|February}}, Moodle will not import Blackboard courses, apparently due to changes in php code-releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackboard migration | url=http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Blackboard_migration |publisher=moodle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 Blackboard acquired two companies based on Moodle's software including Baltimore-based Moodlerooms Inc. and NetSpot of Adelaide, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackboard makes Moodle acquisitions | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2012/03/26/blackboard-makes-moodle-acquisitions.html |publisher=bizjournals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Blackboard acquired Colombia-based Nivel7, possibly the largest Moodle services provider in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackboard.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2015/blackboard-acquires-nivel-siete.aspx |title=Blackboard acquires Nivel7 |date=August 13, 2015 |publisher=Blackboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Hat]] site, Opensource.com, reports that Moodle will always be an [[open-source software|open-source]] project, with clear delineation between Blackboard and Moodle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moodle will always be an open source project | url=https://opensource.com/education/14/10/open-access-learning-moodle |publisher=opensource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many schools, colleges and universities, SIMS integration is key to ensure a seamless data flow from the [[Management information system|Management Information System]] through to the Learning Platform and back again. Many [[Learning platform|Learning Platforms]] do not enable [[write-back]] functionality, however this is often a key requirement from schools needing to write data onto their MIS and back again.

== Background ==

=== Origins ===
[[Martin Dougiamas]], who has graduate degrees in [[computer science]] and [[education]], wrote the first version of Moodle. Dougiamas started a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] to examine "the use of [[open source software]] to support a [[social constructionist]] [[epistemology]] of teaching and learning within Internet-based communities of reflective inquiry." Although how exactly social constructionism makes Moodle different from other eLearning platforms is difficult to show, it has been cited as an important factor by Moodle adopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weller | first=M. | title=VLE 2.0 and future directions in learning environments | publisher=Proceedings of the first LAMS Conference, Sydney|year=2006|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMulli &amp; Munroe | title=VMoodle at DCU | url=http://odtl.dcu.ie/wp/2004/odtl-2004-01.html|year=2004|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Moodle adopters, such as the [[Open University]] in the UK, have pointed out that Learning Management Systems can equally be seen as "relatively pedagogy-neutral".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sclater| first=Neil | title=A Large-scale Open Source eLearning Systems at the Open University|publisher=Educase |url=http://connect.educause.edu/Library/Abstract/LargeScaleOpenSourceELear/46878 |year=2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pedagogical approach ===
The stated philosophy of Moodle includes a [[Constructivism (pedagogical)|constructivist]] and [[Social constructionism|social constructionist]] approach to education, emphasizing that learners (and not just teachers) can contribute to the educational experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.moodle.org/en/Philosophy|title=Philosophy - MoodleDocs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using these [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] principles, Moodle provides an environment for learning communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open-Source Learning Management System|url=http://www.moodlerooms.com/resources/moodle-resources/|publisher=Moodlerooms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of name ===
The acronym ''Moodle'' stands for ''modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment.'' (In the early years the "m" stood for "Martin's", named after Martin Dougiamas, the original developer). As well as being an acronym, the name was chosen because of the dictionary definition of Moodle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-moodle.html|title=Moodle definition|publisher=All Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to correspond to an available domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=27533#129848|title=The chicken or the egg|publisher=Moodle.org Lounge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Moodle has continued to evolve since 1999 (since 2001 with the current architecture). It has been translated into over 100 different languages and is accessible in many countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.moodle.org/en/Language_packs|title=Language packs - MoodleDocs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions can add as many Moodle servers as needed without having to pay license fees. The [[Open University]] of the UK currently uses a Moodle installation for their 200,000 users&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/News/Simply-the-Best-Case-Study-for-Moodle-at-Open-University|title=Simply the Best: Case Study for Moodle at Open... » Linux Magazine|first=Anika|last=Kehrer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the UK government uses a Moodle installation for their Civil Service Learning platform serving half a million employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leolearning.com/client-story/civil-service-learning/|title=Civil Service Learning - LEO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moodle conferences ==
A MoodleMoot is a conference for Moodle community members, held to learn about Moodle, share experiences of the learning platform, discuss research in related educational technologies and contribute ideas to future Moodle development.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015|reason = Needs reliable, third-party published sources (not from Moodle, press releases, blogs, etc.) in order to keep this claim in the article.}} Held around the world, MoodleMoots are organised by universities or other large organisations using Moodle, Moodle Partners, Moodle associations or Moodle HQ.

==Adoption==
In the higher education market in the United States, Moodle was for a time the second largest provider with 23% [[market share]] in 2013 (following [[Blackboard Learning System|Blackboard]] (41%), [[Desire2Learn]] (11%), and [[Instructure]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.campuscomputing.net/sites/www.campuscomputing.net/files/CampusComputing2013_1.pdf | year = 2013 | title = A Profile of the LMS Market (page 23) | publisher = CampusComputing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2017 Moodle had dropped to the third largest provider, due in part to increased adoption of Instructure's Canvas platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LMS Data--Spring 2017 Updates|url=https://edutechnica.com/2017/03/12/lms-data-spring-2017-updates/|website=Edutechnica|publisher=Client Stat|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 Blackboard became an official Moodle partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moodlenews.com/2016/blackboard-is-now-an-official-moodle-partner/|title=Blackboard Is Now An Official Moodle Partner|date=2016-03-14|work=Moodle News|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009, accessed 26 Jan 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; was an English nuclear physicist.  Feather and [[Egon Bretscher]] were working at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in 1940, when they proposed that the 239 isotope of element 94 ([[plutonium]]) would be better able to sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction]].  This research, a breakthrough, was part of the [[Tube Alloys]] project, the secret British project during [[World War II]] to develop [[nuclear weapon]]s.

Feather was the author of a series of noted introductory texts on the history, fundamental concepts, and meaning of physics.

==Early life and education==
He was born the son of Samson Feather, headmaster of [[Pecket Well]], where he was born. The family moved during his infancy when his father became headmaster of Holme Primary School in [[Yorkshire]], and his wife Lucy Clayton.&lt;ref name="RoySoc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Bridlington Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating BA in 1925 before taking a year in the [[University of London]] gaining a BSc in 1926. He was a Fellow of Trinity College from 1929 to 1933 then Fellow and Lecturer in Natural Sciences there from 1936 to 1945.  Feather received his doctorate (PhD) at Cambridge in 1931 under [[James Chadwick]] and [[Ernest Rutherford]].&lt;ref name="sessI"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Oral History interview transcript with Norman Feather, Session I | date= 25 February 1971 | publisher=American Institute of Physics, Niels Bohr Library and Archives | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4559-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His research employed a [[Cloud chamber|Wilson cloud chamber]] and focused on the problem of the long-range [[alpha particle]]s.

In 1932 Feather married Kathleen Grace Burke (d.1975).

==Career==

===Discovery of the Neutron===
Feather conducted some of the earliest investigations of the [[neutron]] following its discovery by [[James Chadwick]] at Cambridge in 1932.&lt;ref name="Neu"&gt;{{Cite journal | title= The Existence of a Neutron | author=J. Chadwick | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume=136 | pages= 692–708  | date = 1 June 1932 | url = http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/136/830/692.full.pdf+html | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1932.0112|bibcode = 1932RSPSA.136..692C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Feather assisted Chadwick with his initial investigations leading to the discovery.  The radioactive [[polonium]] source Chadwick used to discover the neutron was derived from old [[radon]] tubes that had been acquired by Feather from [[Howard Atwood Kelly|Kelly Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]] during a year-long visit to [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1929.   Feather obtained the first evidence that neutrons can produce nuclear disintegrations.&lt;ref name="Col"&gt;{{Cite journal | title= The Collisions of Neutrons with Nitrogen Nuclei | author=N.

"[[annus mirabilis]]" for nuclear physics in the Cavendish Laboratory.&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aip.org/history/exhibits/rutherford/sections/atop-physics-wave.html |title=Atop the Physics Wave:  Rutherford Back in Cambridge, 1919–1937 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |date=2011–2014 |website=Rutherford's Nuclear World |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plutonium and Tube Alloys===
In 1940 Feather and [[Egon Bretscher]] at the Cavendish Laboratory, made a breakthrough in nuclear research for the [[Tube Alloys]] project.  They proposed that the 239 isotope of element 94 could be produced from the common isotope of [[uranium-238]] by [[neutron capture]].  Like [[Uranium-235|U-235]], this new element should be able to sustain a nuclear chain reaction.  A slow neutron reactor fueled with uranium would, in theory, produce substantial amounts of [[Plutonium|plutonium-239]] as a by-product, since U-238 absorbs [[slow neutron]]s to form the new isotope U-239. This nuclide rapidly emits an electron, decaying into an element with a mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This nuclide then emits another electron to become a new element still of mass 239, but with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life.

Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be readily 'fissionable' by both slow and fast neutrons, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium and therefore could easily be separated from it. This was confirmed independently in 1940 by [[Edwin M. McMillan]] and [[Philip Abelson]] at the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]]. [[Nicholas Kemmer]] of the Cambridge team proposed the names [[Neptunium]] for the new element 93 and [[Plutonium]] for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans fortuitously suggested the same names. The production and identification of the first sample of plutonium in 1941 is generally credited to [[Glenn Seaborg]], who used a [[cyclotron]] rather than a reactor.

===Professor in Edinburgh===
Feather was Professor of Natural Philosophy at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1945 to 1975, then Emeritus Professor.  He was active in nuclear physics research throughout his career, preferring small-scale, modest experiments, rather than the large experiments that became common after the war.&lt;ref name="sessII"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Oral History interview transcript with Norman Feather, Session II | date= 5 November 1971 | publisher=American Institute of Physics, Niels Bohr Library and Archives | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4599_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feather was noted for his active service to the University of Edinburgh and the city of Edinburgh.

Feather was appointed a [[Royal Society#Fellows|Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS) in 1945.  From 1946 he was also a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (his proposers including [[C. T. R. Wilson]]) and was President of that Society from 1967 to 1970.  Feather won the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh#Makdougall Brisbane Prize|Makdougall Brisbane Prize]] of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1968-70.&lt;ref name="RoySoc"/&gt;

{{Confuse|ohm metre}}
[[Image:Ohmmeter.jpg|thumb|An analog ohmmeter.]]
An '''ohmmeter''' is an [[electricity|electrical]] [[measuring instrument|instrument]] that measures [[electrical resistance]], the opposition to an [[electric current]]. Micro-ohmmeters (microhmmeter or microohmmeter) make low resistance measurements. Megohmmeters (also a trademarked device [[Megger]]) measure large values of resistance. The unit of measurement for resistance is ohms ([[Ω]]).

==Design evolution==
The first ohmmeters were based on a type of meter movement known as a 'ratiometer'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g1jbg.co.uk/pdf/MeggerBK.pdf A pocket book on the use of Megger insulation and continuity testers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prolexdesign.com/images/evohmmeter.jpg{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Illustration of type. Note the absence of any zero adjustment and the changed scale direction between ranges. {{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These were similar to the [[galvanometer]] type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of hairsprings to supply a restoring force they used conducting 'ligaments'.  These provided no net rotational force to the movement.  Also, the movement was wound with two coils.  One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply.  The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test.  The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils.  This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test.  The advantages of this arrangement were twofold.  First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no zero adjustment was required.  Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the full deflection range.  By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided.  This scale was reversed compared to the first.  A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement).  Ohmmeters of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a [[multimeter]] design.  Insulation testers that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle.  This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.

Subsequent designs of ohmmeter provided a small battery to apply a [[voltage]] to a resistance via a galvanometer to measure the current through the resistance (battery, galvanometer and resistance all connected in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]]). The scale of the galvanometer was marked in ohms, because the fixed voltage from the battery assured that as resistance is increased, the current through the meter (and hence deflection) would decrease. Ohmmeters form circuits by themselves, therefore they cannot be used within an assembled circuit.  This design is much simpler and cheaper than the former design, and was simple to integrate into a [[multimeter]] design and consequently was by far the most common form of analogue ohmmeter.  This type of ohmmeter suffers from two inherent disadvantages.  First, the meter needs to be zeroed by shorting the measurement points together and performing an adjustment for zero ohms indication prior to each measurement.  This is because as the battery voltage decreases with age, the series resistance in the meter needs to be reduced to maintain the zero indication at full deflection.  Second, and consequent on the first, the actual deflection for any given resistor under test changes as the internal resistance is altered.  It remains correct at the centre of the scale only, which is why such ohmmeter designs always quote the accuracy "at centre scale only".

A more accurate type of ohmmeter has an electronic circuit that passes a constant current (I) through the resistance, and another circuit that measures the voltage (V) across the resistance. These measurements are then digitized with an [[Analog-to-digital_converter|analog digital converter (adc)]] after which a [[microcontroller]] or [[microprocessor]] make the division of the current and voltage according to [[Ohm's Law]] and then decode these to a display to offer the user a reading of the resistance value they're measuring at that instant. Since these type of meters already measure current,voltage and resistance all at once, these type of circuits are often used in [[digital_multimeter|digital multimeters]].

==Precision ohmmeters==
For high-precision measurements of very small resistances, the above types of meter are inadequate. This is partly because the change in deflection itself is small when the resistance measured is too small in proportion to the intrinsic resistance of the ohmmeter (which can be dealt with through [[current divider|current division]]), but mostly because the meter's reading is the sum of the resistance of the measuring leads, the contact resistances and the resistance being measured. To reduce this effect, a precision ohmmeter has four terminals, called Kelvin contacts. Two terminals carry the current from and to the meter, while the other two allow the meter to measure the voltage across the resistor. In this arrangement, the power source is connected in series with the resistance to be measured through the external pair of terminals, while the second pair connects in parallel with the galvanometer which measures the voltage drop. With this type of meter, any voltage drop due to the resistance of the first pair of leads and their contact resistances is ignored by the meter. This [[Four-terminal sensing|four terminal measurement]] technique is called Kelvin sensing, after [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]], who invented the [[Kelvin bridge]] in 1861 to measure very low resistances. The Four-terminal sensing method can also be utilized to conduct accurate measurements of low resistances.

'''Oxygen plants''' are industrial systems designed to generate oxygen. They typically use air as a [[feedstock]] and separate it from other components of air using [[pressure swing adsorption]] or [[gas separation|membrane separation]] techniques. Such plants are distinct from cryogenic separation plants which separate and capture all the components of air.

== Application ==

Oxygen finds broad application in various technological processes and in almost all industry branches. The primary oxygen application is associated with its capability of sustaining burning process, and the powerful oxidant properties.

Due to that, oxygen has become widely used in the metal processing, welding, cutting and brazing processes. In the chemical and petrochemical industries, as well as in the oil and gas sector oxygen is used in commercial volumes as an oxidizer in [[chemical reaction]]s.

*Metal [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|gas welding]], cutting and brazing
The use of oxygen in gas-flame operations, such as metal welding, cutting and brazing is one of the most significant and common applications of this gas. Oxygen allows generating high-temperature flame in welding torches thus ensuring high quality and speed of work performance.

*Metal industry
Oxygen is heavily used in the metal industry where it helps to increase burning temperature by the production of [[ferrous and non-ferrous metals]] and significantly improve the overall process efficiency. Another important oxygen application in the metal industry is connected with its use for [[carbon fixation]] with the yield of carbon dioxide.

*Chemical and petrochemical industries
In the chemical and petrochemical industries, oxygen is widely used for oxidation of raw chemicals for recovery of [[nitric acid]], [[ethylene oxide]], [[propylene oxide]], [[vinyl chloride]] and other important [[chemical compound]]s.

*Oil and gas industry
In the oil and gas industry, oxygen finds application as a means for viscosity improvement and enhancement of oil-and-gas [[Fluid dynamics|flow properties]]. Oxygen is also used for boosting production capacity of oil cracking plants, efficiency of high-octane components processing, as well as for the reduction of sulfuric deposits in refineries.

*Fish farming
The use of oxygen in the [[fish farming]] helps increase the survival and fertility ratios and reduce the [[incubation period]]. Along with fish culture, oxygen is applied for shrimps, crabs and mussels rearing.

*Glass industry
In glass furnaces oxygen is effectively used for burning temperature increase and burning processes improvement.

*Waste management
The use of oxygen in incinerators allows significantly increased flame temperatures and eventually ensures enhanced [[Cost Efficiency|cost efficiency]] and incinerator production capacity.

== Adsorption technology ==
[[File:Mobile oxygen station.jpg|thumb|Type of performance on semitrailer]]

=== Adsorption principle ===
Gas separation by adsorption systems is based on the fixation of various gas mixture components by a solid substance called adsorbent. Physically, this phenomenon is brought about by the forces of gas and adsorbent molecules interaction.
[[File:Flow chart of adsobtion nitrogen generator.jpg|thumb|Functional diagram of work of oxygen plant]]

=== Temperature and pressure influence ===
The current methods of gaseous oxygen production from air with the use of adsorption technology are nearly brought to perfection. The operation of a modern oxygen adsorption plant is based on the dependence of gas intake by adsorbent on the temperature and [[partial pressure]] of a gas component.

The gas adsorption and adsorbent regeneration processes may therefore be regulated by varying of the pressure and temperature parameters.

=== Pressure swing adsorption  ===
The oxygen plant flow process is arranged in such a way that highly absorbable gas mixture components are taken in by adsorbent, while low absorbable and non-absorbable components go through the plant. Today, there exist three methods of arranging the adsorption-based air [[separation process]] with the use of swing technologies: pressure (PSA), vacuum (VSA) and mixed (VPSA) ones. In the pressure swing adsorption flow processes, oxygen is recovered under above-atmospheric pressure and regeneration is achieved under [[atmospheric pressure]]. In vacuum swing adsorption flow processes, oxygen is recovered under atmospheric pressure, and regeneration is achieved under [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]]. The mixed systems operation combines pressure variations from positive to negative.

== Adsorption oxygen plants ==

The adsorption oxygen plants produce 5 to 5,000 [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h]] of oxygen with a purity of 93-95%. These systems, designated for indoor operation, are set to effectively produce gaseous oxygen from atmospheric air.

An unquestionable advantage of adsorption-based oxygen plants is the low cost of oxygen produced in the cases where there are no rigid requirements to the product oxygen purity.

Structurally, the adsorption oxygen plant consists of several adsorbers, the compressor unit, pre-purifier unit, valve system and the plant [[control system]].

A simple adsorber is a column filled with layers of specially selected adsorbents – granular substances preferentially adsorbing highly adsorbable components of a gas mixture.

Where gaseous oxygen purity is required at the level of 90-95% with the capacity of up to 5,000 Nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per hour, adsorption oxygen plants are the optimal choice. This oxygen purity may also be obtained through the use of systems based on the cryogenic technology; however, cryogenic plants are more cumbersome and complex in operation.

== Membrane technology ==
[[File:Membrane oxygen plant.jpg|thumb|Membrane oxygen equipment]]

=== Innovation technology available today ===
Some companies produce high-efficiency systems for oxygen production from atmospheric air with the help of [[membrane technology]].

=== Membrane operation principle ===
The basis of gas media separation with the use of membrane systems is the difference in velocity with which various gas mixture components permeate membrane substance. The driving force behind the gas separation process is the difference in partial pressures on different membrane sides.

=== Membrane cartridge ===
A modern gas separation membrane used by GRASYS is no longer a flat plate, but is formed by hollow fibers. Membrane consists of a porous polymer fiber with the [[gas separation]] layer applied to its external surface. Structurally, a hollow fiber [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] is configured as a cylindrical cartridge representing a spool with specifically reeled polymer fiber.
[[File:Flux distribution inside the fiber.jpg|thumb|Membrane cartridge]]

=== Compressor and vacuum technologies ===
Due to the membrane material high permeability for oxygen in contrast to nitrogen, the design of membrane oxygen complexes requires a special approach. Basically, there are two membrane-based oxygen production technologies: compressor and vacuum ones.

In the case of compressor technology, air is supplied into the fiber space under excess pressure, oxygen exits the membrane under slight excess pressure, and where necessary, is pressurized by booster compressor to the required [[Geopotential height|pressure level]]. By the use of [[Vacuum pump|vacuum technology]], a vacuum pump is used for the achievement of partial pressures difference.

== Membrane oxygen plants ==
{{further|Membrane gas separation}}
Designed for indoor operation, membrane oxygen plants allow efficient air enrichment with oxygen up to the concentration of 30-45%. The complexes are rated to 5 to 5,000 nm3/hr of oxygenated air.&lt;ref name='grasys'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grasys.com/products/gas/oxygen/membrane/ | title = Membrane oxygen plants - Technical Characteristics | accessdate = 2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the membrane oxygen plant, gas separation is achieved in the gas separation module composed of hollow-fiber membranes and representing the plant critical and [[High tech|high-technology]] unit. Apart from the gas separation unit, other important technical components are the booster compressor or vacuum pump, pre-purifier unit, and the plant control system.

The adoption of membrane systems for air enrichment purposes promises multiple oxygen savings where the oxygen concentration of 30-45% is sufficient to cover process needs. In addition to customer saving on the product oxygen cost, there is a collateral economic effect based on extremely low operating costs.

With the incorporation of the membrane technology, oxygen plants have outstanding technical characteristics. Membrane oxygen plants are highly reliable due to the absence of [[moving parts]] in the gas separation module.

The systems are very simple in operation – control of all operating parameters is carried out automatically. Because of the plants high automation degree, no constant manned attendance is required during its operation.

Membrane oxygen plants are finding increasingly broad application in various industries all over the world. With moderate requirements to oxygen purity in product - up to 30-45%, membrane systems generally prove more economically sound than adsorption and cryogenic systems. Besides, membrane plants are much simpler in operation and more reliable.

== Advantages of adsorption and membrane oxygen plants ==

*Complete automation and simplicity of operation;
*No manned attendance required during operation;
*Enhanced failure safety and reliability;
*Quick start and stop ;
*Moderate dimensions and light weight ;
*Low [[noise level]];
*Extended operational life;
*Low operating costs;
*No special workshop requirements;
*Easy installation and integration into an existing air system.

=== Disadvantages ===

* Relativity low oxygen purity - 93-95% for adsorption and 30-45% for membrane plants;
* Limited capacity.

[[File:Igreja de Campanha Azulejo 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tile|Tilings]], such as these from [[:pt:Igreja de Campanhã|Igreja de Campanhã]], Porto, [[Portugal]], are visual patterns used for decoration.]]

A '''pattern''' is a regularity in the world, man-made design, or abstract ideas. As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner. A '''geometric pattern''' is a kind of pattern formed of [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]]s and typically repeated like a [[wallpaper]] design.

Any of the [[sense]]s may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in [[science]], [[mathematics]], or [[language]] may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual [[patterns in nature]] are often [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], never exactly repeating, and often involve [[fractals]]. Natural patterns include [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]], and those created by [[Symmetry|symmetries]] of [[rotation symmetry|rotation]] and [[reflection symmetry|reflection]]. Patterns have an underlying [[Mathematics|mathematical]] structure;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, 2001. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.

In art and architecture, decorations or [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]] may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a [[software design pattern]] is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a [[Die (manufacturing)|template]] used to create any number of similar garments.

== Nature ==
{{main|Patterns in nature}}

Nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern, including [[symmetry|symmetries]], trees and other structures with a [[fractal]] dimension, [[spirals]], [[meander]]s, [[wave]]s, [[foam]]s, [[tessellation|tilings]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. ''Patterns in Nature'', 1974. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symmetry ===

[[File:Schnee1.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Snowflake]] [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]]]

Symmetry is widespread in living things. Animals that move usually have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]] as this favours movement.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers, as well as animals which are largely static as adults, such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], including [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]: each flake is unique, its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal]]s have a highly specific set of possible [[crystal habit|crystal symmetries]]; they can be cubic or octahedral, but cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian. 2001. Pages 82-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirals ===

[[File:Aloe polyphylla spiral.jpg|thumb|75px|''[[Aloe polyphylla]]'' [[phyllotaxis]]]]

Spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including [[molluscs]] such as the [[nautilus]], and in the [[phyllotaxis]] of many plants, both of leaves spiralling around stems, and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the [[sunflower]] and fruit structures like the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | year=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===
[[File:Vortex-street-1-90deg.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Vortex street]] turbulence]]

[[Chaos theory]] predicts that while the laws of [[physics]] are [[deterministic]], events and patterns in nature never exactly repeat because extremely small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chaos |author1=Crutchfield, James P |author2=Farmer, J Doyne, |author3=Packard, Norman H |author4=Shaw, Robert S | journal=Scientific American |date=December 1986 | volume=254 | issue=12 | pages=46–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many natural patterns are shaped by this apparent randomness, including [[vortex street]]s&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore.

=== Waves, dunes ===
[[File:Sand dune ripples.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Dune]] [[Capillary wave|ripple]]]]

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are [[surface wave]]s that create the chaotic patterns of the sea. As they pass over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of [[dune]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | year=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bubbles, foam ===

[[File:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Foam]] of [[soap bubble]]s]]

[[Foam]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]]. Foam and bubble patterns occur widely in nature, for example in [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, and the skeletons of [[silicoflagellate]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball.

=== Cracks ===
[[File:Cracked earth in the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|75px|Shrinkage [[Fracture|Cracks]]]]

[[Fracture|Crack]]s form in materials to relieve stress: with 120 degree joints in elastic materials, but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. Cracking patterns are widespread in nature, for example in rocks, mud, tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Peter. 1974. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tilings ===
{{further|Tessellation|Tile}}

In visual art, pattern consists in regularity which in some way "organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent, regular manner." At its simplest, a pattern in art may be a geometric or other repeating shape in a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[tapestry]], ceramic [[Tile|tiling]] or [[carpet]], but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing "skeleton" in the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/pattern/pattern.htm | title=Art, Design, and Visual Thinking | publisher=Cornell University | work=Pattern | year=1995 | accessdate=12 December 2012 | author=Jirousek, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematics, a [[tessellation]] is the tiling of a plane using one or more geometric shapes (which mathematicians call tiles), with no overlaps and no gaps.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Grünbaum|first=Branko|title=Tilings and Patterns|year=1987|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York|author2=Shephard, G. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In architecture===
[[Image:Hampi1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Patterns in architecture: the Virupaksha temple at Hampi has a [[fractal]]-like structure where the parts resemble the whole.]]
{{main|Pattern (architecture)|Mathematics and architecture}}

In architecture, [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are repeated in various ways to form patterns. Most simply, structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically (see leading picture). Architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as [[column]]s, [[pediment]]s, and [[lintel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Western Art | publisher=McGraw Hill | author=Adams, Laurie | year=2001 | page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitions need not be identical; for example, temples in South India have a roughly pyramidal form, where elements of the pattern repeat in a [[fractal]]-like way at different sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Heaven's Fractal Net: Retrieving Lost Visions in the Humanities | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Jackson, William Joseph | year=2004 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science and mathematics ==
[[File:Fractal fern explained.png|thumb|upright|Fractal model of a fern illustrating [[self-similar]]ity]]

[[Mathematics]] is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2214851?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101539380483 | title=Mathematics as a Science of Patterns: Ontology and Reference | author=Resnik, Michael D. | journal=Noûs |date=November 1981 | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages=529–550 | doi=10.2307/2214851}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, any [[sequence]] of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern. Mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coas.howard.edu/mathematics/faculty/bayne/patterns.html | title=MATH 012 Patterns in Mathematics - spring 2012 | year=2012 | accessdate=16 January 2013 | author=Bayne, Richard E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fractals ===

Some mathematical rule-patterns can be visualised, and among these are those that explain [[patterns in nature]] including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. [[Fractal]]s are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it. [[Self-similarity]] is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their [[pattern formation|formation]] can be simple (e.g. [[Lindenmayer system]]s describing [[tree]] shapes).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |authorlink=Benoît Mandelbrot |title=The fractal geometry of nature

|isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pattern theory]], devised by [[Ulf Grenander]], mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns. The goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally friendly manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Grenander, Ulf |author2=Miller, Michael | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broadest sense, any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern. As in mathematics, science can be taught as a set of patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/smg/Website/UCP/ | title=Causal Patterns in Science | publisher=Harvard Graduate School of Education | year=2008 | accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer science ==

In computer science, a [[software design pattern]], in the sense of a [[Template method pattern|template]], is a general solution to a problem in programming. A design pattern provides a reusable architectural outline that may speed the development of many computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;Gamma et al, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Desalination}}
'''Reverse osmosis''' ('''RO''') is a [[water purification]] technology that uses a [[semipermeable membrane]] to remove [[ions]],  [[molecules]] and larger particles from drinking water.  In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome [[osmotic pressure]], a [[colligative property]], that is driven by [[chemical potential]] differences of the solvent, a [[thermodynamic]] parameter.  Reverse osmosis can remove many types of dissolved and suspended species from water, including bacteria, and is used in both industrial processes and the production of [[potable water]].  The result is that the [[solution|solute]] is retained on the pressurized side of the membrane and the pure [[solvent]] is allowed to pass to the other side. To be "selective", this membrane should not allow large molecules or ions through the [[wiktionary:pore|pores]] (holes), but should allow smaller components of the solution (such as solvent molecules) to pass freely.&lt;ref name=WarsingerBatch&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Tow|first2= Emily W.|last3=Nayar|first3=Kishor G.|last4=Maswadeh|first4=Laith A.|last5=Lienhard V|first5=John H.|title=Energy efficiency of batch and semi-batch (CCRO) reverse osmosis desalination|journal=Water Research|volume=106|pages=272–282|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.09.029|pmid=27728821|date=2016|hdl=1721.1/105441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the normal [[osmosis]] process, the solvent naturally moves from an area of low solute concentration (high [[water potential]]), through a membrane, to an area of high solute concentration (low water potential). The driving force for the movement of the solvent is the reduction in the free energy of the system when the difference in solvent concentration on either side of a membrane is reduced, generating osmotic pressure due to the solvent moving into the more concentrated solution. Applying an external pressure to reverse the natural flow of pure solvent, thus, is reverse osmosis. The process is similar to other membrane technology applications. However, key differences are found between reverse osmosis and filtration. The predominant removal mechanism in membrane filtration is straining, or size exclusion, so the process can theoretically achieve perfect efficiency regardless of parameters such as the solution's pressure and concentration. Reverse osmosis also involves diffusion, making the process dependent on pressure, flow rate, and other conditions.&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Crittenden, John; Trussell, Rhodes; Hand, David; Howe, Kerry and Tchobanoglous, George (2005). ''Water Treatment Principles and Design'', 2nd ed. John Wiley and Sons. New Jersey. {{ISBN|0-471-11018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse osmosis is most commonly known for its use in drinking water purification from [[seawater]], removing the [[salt]] and other [[effluent]] materials from the water molecules.

== History ==
A process of osmosis through semipermeable membranes was first observed in 1748 by [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]]. For the following 200 years, osmosis was only a phenomenon observed in the laboratory. In 1950, the [[University of California at Los Angeles]]  first investigated [[desalination]] of seawater using semipermeable membranes. Researchers from both University of California at Los Angeles and the [[University of Florida]] successfully produced fresh water from seawater in the mid-1950s, but the [[flux]] was too low to be commercially viable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The early history of reverse osmosis membrane development|doi=10.1016/S0011-9164(98)00122-2 |author=Glater, J. |year=1998 |journal=Desalination |volume=117 |pages=297–309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the discovery at University of California at Los Angeles by [[Sidney Loeb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weintraub, Bob|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpgY6dd0Qtb4M6xnNXhutP4pMxidq_jqG962VzWt_W7-hssGnSxSzjTY8RvW/edit?usp=sharing |title=Sidney Loeb, Co-Inventor of Practical Reverse Osmosis|journal=Bulletin of the Israel Chemical Society|date=December 2001| issue =8|pages= 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Srinivasa Sourirajan at the [[National Research Council of Canada]], Ottawa,  of techniques for making asymmetric membranes characterized by an effectively thin "skin" layer supported atop a highly porous and much thicker substrate region of the membrane. John Cadotte, of [[Filmtec corporation|FilmTec Corporation]], discovered that membranes with particularly high flux and low salt passage could be made by [[interfacial polymerization]] of ''m''-phenylene diamine and trimesoyl chloride.  Cadotte's patent on this process&lt;ref&gt;Cadotte, John E. (1981) "Interfacially synthesized reverse osmosis membrane" {{US Patent|4277344}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the subject of litigation and has since expired.  Almost all commercial reverse osmosis membrane is now made by this method.  By the end of 2001, about 15,200 desalination plants were in operation or in the planning stages, worldwide.&lt;ref name="water" /&gt;

[[File:Northcapecoral-RO.jpg|thumb|Reverse osmosis production train, North Cape Coral Reverse Osmosis Plant]]In 1977 [[Cape Coral]], Florida became the first municipality in the United States to use the RO process on a large scale with an initial operating capacity of 11.35 million liters (3 million US gal) per day. By 1985, due to the rapid growth in population of Cape Coral, the city had the largest low pressure reverse osmosis plant in the world, capable of producing 56.8 million liters (15 million US gal) per day (MGD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capecoral.net/department/utilities_department/docs/2012_Citywide_CCR.pdf 2012 Annual Consumer Report on the Quality of Tap Water].

and reverse osmosis is used in water purification
Formally, reverse osmosis is the process of forcing a solvent from a region of high solute concentration through a semipermeable membrane to a region of low solute concentration by applying a pressure in excess of the osmotic pressure. The largest and most important application of reverse osmosis is the separation of pure water from seawater and [[brackish]] waters; seawater or brackish water is pressurized against one surface of the membrane, causing transport of salt-depleted water across the membrane and emergence of potable drinking water from the low-pressure side.

The membranes used for reverse osmosis have a dense layer in the polymer matrix—either the skin of an asymmetric membrane or an interfacially polymerized layer within a thin-film-composite membrane—where the separation occurs. In most cases, the membrane is designed to allow only water to pass through this dense layer while preventing the passage of solutes (such as salt ions). This process requires that a high pressure be exerted on the high concentration side of the membrane, usually 2–17 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (30–250 [[Pound-force per square inch|psi]]) for fresh and brackish water, and 40–82 bar (600–1200 psi) for seawater, which has around 27 bar (390 psi)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lachish|first=Uri|title=Optimizing the Efficiency of Reverse Osmosis Seawater Desalination|url=http://urila.tripod.com/Seawater.htm|publisher=guma science}}&lt;/ref&gt; natural osmotic pressure that must be overcome. This process is best known for its use in [[desalination]] (removing the salt and other minerals from [[sea water]] to produce [[fresh water]]), but since the early 1970s, it has also been used to purify fresh water for medical, industrial, and domestic applications.

== Fresh water applications ==

=== Drinking water purification ===

Around the world, household [[drinking water]] [[water purification|purification]] systems, including a reverse osmosis step, are commonly used for improving water for drinking and cooking.

Such systems typically include a number of steps:
* a sediment filter to trap particles, including rust and calcium carbonate
* optionally, a second sediment filter with smaller pores
* an [[activated carbon]] filter to trap organic chemicals and [[chlorine]], which will attack and degrade [[thin film composite membrane]] reverse osmosis membranes
* a reverse osmosis filter, which is a thin film composite membrane 
* optionally, a second carbon filter to capture those chemicals not removed by the reverse osmosis membrane
* optionally an [[ultraviolet]] lamp for sterilizing any microbes that may escape filtering by the reverse osmosis membrane
The latest developments in the sphere include nano materials and membranes.

In some systems, the carbon prefilter is omitted, and a [[cellulose triacetate]] membrane is used. CTA (cellulose triacetate) is a paper by-product membrane bonded to a synthetic layer and is made to allow contact with chlorine in the water. These require a small amount of chlorine in the water source to prevent bacteria from forming on it. The typical rejection rate for CTA membranes is 85–95%.

The cellulose triacetate membrane is prone to rotting unless protected by chlorinated water, while the thin film composite membrane is prone to breaking down under the influence of chlorine.  A thin film composite (TFC) membrane is made of synthetic material, and requires chlorine to be removed before the water enters the membrane. To protect the TFC membrane elements from chlorine damage, carbon filters are used as pre-treatment in all residential reverse osmosis systems. TFC membranes have a higher rejection rate of 95–98% and a longer life than CTA membranes.

'''Portable reverse osmosis water processors''' are sold for personal water purification in various locations. To work effectively, the water feeding to these units should be under some pressure (280 kPa (40 psi) or greater is the norm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knorr|first1=Erik Voigt, Henry Jaeger, Dietrich|title=Securing Safe Water Supplies : comparison of applicable technologies|date=2012|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=978-0124058866|page=33|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fWGZLmhpxvgC&amp;pg=PA33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portable reverse osmosis water processors can be used by people who live in rural areas without clean water, far away from the city's water pipes. Rural people filter river or ocean water themselves, as the device is easy to use (saline water may need special membranes). Some travelers on long boating, fishing, or island camping trips, or in countries where the local water supply is polluted or substandard, use reverse osmosis water processors coupled with one or more ultraviolet sterilizers.

In the '''production of bottled mineral water''', the water passes through a reverse osmosis water processor to remove pollutants and microorganisms. In European countries, though, such processing of natural mineral water (as defined by a European directive&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1980L0777:19961213:EN:PDF Council Directive of 15 July 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters]. eur-lex.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;) is not allowed under European law. In practice, a fraction of the living bacteria can and do pass through reverse osmosis membranes through minor imperfections, or bypass the membrane entirely through tiny leaks in surrounding seals. Thus, complete reverse osmosis systems may include additional water treatment stages that use ultraviolet light or [[ozone]] to prevent microbiological contamination.

Membrane pore sizes can vary from 0.1 to 5,000&amp;nbsp;nm depending on filter type. Particle filtration removes particles of 1 [[micrometre|µm]]  or larger. [[Microfiltration]] removes particles of 50&amp;nbsp;nm or larger. [[Ultrafiltration]] removes particles of roughly 3&amp;nbsp;nm or larger. Nanofiltration removes particles of 1&amp;nbsp;nm or larger. Reverse osmosis is in the final category of membrane filtration, hyperfiltration, and removes particles larger than 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=56b22df55e9d97048e8b45da&amp;assetKey=AS%3A325085152989184%401454517748678 Purification of Contaminated Water with Reverse Osmosis]" ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 12, December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Military use: the reverse osmosis water purification unit ====
A reverse osmosis water purification unit (ROWPU) is a portable, self-contained [[water purification|water treatment]] plant. Designed for military use, it can provide [[drinking water|potable]] water from nearly any water source. There are many models in use by the [[United States armed forces]] and the [[Canadian Forces]]. Some models are [[Containerization|containerized]], some are trailers, and some are vehicles unto themselves.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Each branch of the United States armed forces has their own series of reverse osmosis water purification unit models, but they are all similar. The water is pumped from its raw source into the reverse osmosis water purification unit module, where it is treated with a [[polymer]] to initiate [[coagulation]]. Next, it is run through a multi-media filter where it undergoes primary treatment by removing turbidity. It is then pumped through a cartridge filter which is usually spiral-wound cotton.  This process clarifies the water of any particles larger than 5 [[micrometre|µm]] and eliminates almost all [[turbidity]].

The clarified water is then fed through a high-pressure piston pump into a series of vessels where it is subject to reverse osmosis. The product water is free of 90.00–99.98% of the raw water's [[total dissolved solids]] and by military standards, should have no more than 1000–1500 [[parts per million]] by measure of [[electrical conductivity]]. It is then disinfected with [[chlorine]] and stored for later use.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Within the [[United States Marine Corps]], the reverse osmosis water purification unit has been replaced by both the Lightweight Water Purification System and Tactical Water Purification Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/11/marine-afghanistan-water-purification-110410w/|title=Corps' plan for clean water downrange|last=Fuentes|first=Gidget|date=Nov 5, 2010|publisher=[[Marine Corps Times]]|accessdate=8 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322204455/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/11/marine-afghanistan-water-purification-110410w/|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lightweight Water Purification Systems can be transported by [[Humvee]] and filter {{convert|470|l|gal}} per hour.  The Tactical Water Purification Systems can be carried on a [[Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement]] truck, and can filter {{convert|4500|to|5700|l|gal}} per hour.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Water and wastewater purification ===
Rain water collected from storm drains is purified with reverse osmosis water processors&lt;ref&gt;[https://iscsales.com/liquid-filtration/reverse-osmosis-systems/ "Reverse Osmosis Systems Product Reference"], ''[[ISC Sales]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and used for landscape irrigation and industrial cooling in Los Angeles and other cities, as a solution to the problem of water shortages.

In industry, reverse osmosis removes minerals from [[boiler water]] at [[power plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=edited by Vishal|title=Emerging Environmental Technologies|date=2008|publisher=[[Springer Science]]|location=[[Dordrecht]]|isbn=978-1402087868|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ldeJ713eKPAC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water is [[distilled]] multiple times. It must be as pure as possible so it does not leave deposits on the machinery or cause corrosion. The deposits inside or outside the boiler tubes may result in underperformance of the boiler, bringing down its efficiency and resulting in poor steam production, hence poor power production at the turbine.

It is also used to clean effluent and [[Brackish water|brackish groundwater]]. The effluent in larger volumes (more than 500 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day) should be treated in an effluent treatment plant first, and then the clear effluent is subjected to reverse osmosis system. Treatment cost is reduced significantly and membrane life of the reverse osmosis system is increased.

The process of reverse osmosis can be used for the production of [[deionized water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grabowski|first1=Andrej|title=Electromembrane desalination processes for production of low conductivity water|date=2010|publisher=Logos-Verl.|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3832527143|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ORVFoMq6HroC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse osmosis process for water purification does not require thermal energy. Flow-through reverse osmosis systems can be regulated by high-pressure pumps. The recovery of purified water depends upon various factors, including membrane sizes, membrane pore size, temperature, operating pressure, and membrane surface area.

In 2002, [[Singapore]] announced that a process named [[NEWater]] would be a significant part of its future water plans. It involves using reverse osmosis to treat domestic wastewater before discharging the NEWater back into the reservoirs.

=== Food industry ===
In addition to desalination, reverse osmosis is a more economical operation for concentrating food liquids (such as fruit juices) than conventional heat-treatment processes. Research has been done on concentration of orange juice and tomato juice. Its advantages include a lower operating cost and the ability to avoid heat-treatment processes, which makes it suitable for heat-sensitive substances such as the [[protein]] and [[enzyme]]s found in most food products.

Reverse osmosis is extensively used in the dairy industry for the production of whey protein powders and for the concentration of milk to reduce shipping costs. In whey applications, the whey (liquid remaining after cheese manufacture) is concentrated with reverse osmosis from 6% total solids to 10–20% total solids before [[ultrafiltration]] processing. The ultrafiltration retentate can then be used to make various whey powders, including [[whey protein isolate]]. Additionally, the ultrafiltration permeate, which contains [[lactose]], is concentrated by reverse osmosis from 5% total solids to 18–22% total solids to reduce crystallization and drying costs of the lactose powder.

Although use of the process was once avoided in the wine industry, it is now widely understood and used. An estimated 60 reverse osmosis machines were in use in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]], in 2002. Known users include many of the elite classed growths (Kramer) such as [[Château Léoville-Las Cases]] in Bordeaux.

=== Maple syrup production ===
In 1946, some [[maple syrup]] producers started using reverse osmosis to remove water from [[plant sap|sap]] before the sap is boiled down to [[syrup]]. The use of reverse osmosis allows about 75–90% of the water to be removed from the sap, reducing energy consumption and exposure of the syrup to high temperatures. Microbial contamination and degradation of the membranes must be monitored.

=== Hydrogen production ===
For small-scale [[hydrogen production]], reverse osmosis is sometimes used to prevent formation of minerals on the surface of [[electrode]]s.

=== Reef aquariums ===
Many [[reef aquarium]] keepers use reverse osmosis systems for their artificial mixture of seawater. Ordinary tap water can contain excessive chlorine, chloramines, copper, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, silicates, or many other chemicals detrimental to the sensitive organisms in a reef environment. Contaminants such as nitrogen compounds and phosphates can lead to excessive and unwanted algae growth. An effective combination of both reverse osmosis and [[deionization]] is the most popular among reef aquarium keepers, and is preferred above other water purification processes due to the low cost of ownership and minimal operating costs. Where [[chlorine]] and [[chloramine]]s are found in the water, carbon filtration is needed before the membrane, as the common residential membrane used by reef keepers does not cope with these compounds.

===Window cleaning===
An increasingly popular method of cleaning windows is the so-called "water-fed pole" system. Instead of washing the windows with detergent in the conventional way, they are scrubbed with highly purified water, typically containing less than 10 ppm dissolved solids, using a brush on the end of a long pole which is wielded from ground level. Reverse osmosis is commonly used to purify the water.

== Landfill leachate purification ==
Treatment with reverse osmosis is limited, resulting in low recoveries on high concentration (measured with [[electrical conductivity]]) and fouling of the RO membranes. Reverse osmosis applicability is limited by conductivity, organics, and scaling inorganic elements such as CaSO4, Si, Fe and Ba. Low organic scaling can use two different technologies, one is using spiral wound membrane type of module, and for high organic scaling, high conductivity and higher pressure (up to 90 bars) disc tube modules with reverse osmosis membranes can be used. Disc tube modules were redesigned for landfill leachate purification, that is usually contaminated with high levels of organic material. Due to the cross-flow with high velocity it is given a flow booster pump, that is recirculating the flow over the same membrane surface between 1,5 and 3 times before it is released as a concentrate. High velocity is also good against membrane scaling and allows successful membrane cleaning.

=== Power consumption for a disc tube module system===

== Desalination ==
Areas that have either no or limited surface water or groundwater may choose to [[desalination|desalinate]]. Reverse osmosis is an increasingly common method of desalination, because of its relatively low energy consumption.&lt;ref name=WarsingerEntropy&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Mistry|first2= Karan H.|last3=Nayar|first3=Kishor G.|last4=Chung|first4=Hyung Won|last5=Lienhard V|first5=John H.|title=Entropy Generation of Desalination Powered by Variable Temperature Waste Heat|journal=Entropy|volume=17|issue=11|pages=7530–7566|doi=10.3390/e17117530|date=2015|bibcode=2015Entrp..17.7530W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, energy consumption has dropped to around 3 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with the development of more efficient [[energy recovery]] devices and improved membrane materials. According to the International Desalination Association, for 2011, reverse osmosis was used in 66% of installed desalination capacity (0.0445 of 0.0674&amp;nbsp;km³/day), and nearly all new plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalwaterintel.com/advertise/ida-desalination-yearbook/ International Desalination Association]  Yearbook 2012–13&lt;/ref&gt; Other plants mainly use thermal distillation methods: [[multiple-effect distillation]] and [[Multi-Stage Flash|multi-stage flash]].

Sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination, a membrane process, has been commercially used since the early 1970s. Its first practical use was demonstrated by [[Sidney Loeb]] from University of California at Los Angeles in [[Coalinga, California]], and Srinivasa Sourirajan of National Research council, Canada. Because no heating or phase changes are needed, energy requirements are low, around 3 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, in comparison to other processes of desalination, but are still much higher than those required for other forms of water supply, including reverse osmosis treatment of wastewater, at 0.1 to 1 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Up to 50% of the seawater input can be recovered as fresh water, though lower recoveries may reduce membrane fouling and energy consumption.

Brackish water reverse osmosis refers to desalination of water with a lower salt content than sea water, usually from river estuaries or saline wells. The process is substantially the same as sea water reverse osmosis, but requires lower pressures and therefore less energy.&lt;ref name=WarsingerBatch /&gt; Up to 80% of the feed water input can be recovered as fresh water, depending on feed salinity.

The [[Ashkelon]] sea water reverse osmosis desalination plant in Israel is the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/israel-is-no-5-on-top-10-cleantech-list Israel is No. 5 on Top 10 Cleantech List] in [http://www.israel21c.org/technology/archive Israel 21c A Focus Beyond] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016013525/http://www.israel21c.org/technology/archive |date=2010-10-16 }} Retrieved 2009-12-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water-technology.net/projects/israel/ Desalination Plant Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) Plant]. Water-technology.net&lt;/ref&gt; The project was developed as a [[build-operate-transfer]] by a consortium of three international companies: [[Veolia]] water, [[IDE Technologies]], and Elran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2006.03.525|title=Ashkelon desalination plant&amp;nbsp;— A successful challenge|year=2007|last1=Sauvetgoichon|first1=B|journal=Desalination|volume=203|pages=75–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical single-pass sea water reverse osmosis system consists of:
* Intake
* Pretreatment
* High pressure pump (if not combined with energy recovery)
* Membrane assembly
* Energy recovery (if used)
* [[Remineralisation]] and pH adjustment
* Disinfection
* Alarm/control panel

=== Pretreatment ===
Pretreatment is important when working with reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes due to the nature of their spiral-wound design. The material is engineered in such a fashion as to allow only one-way flow through the system. As such, the spiral-wound design does not allow for backpulsing with water or air agitation to scour its surface and remove solids. Since accumulated material cannot be removed from the membrane surface systems, they are highly susceptible to fouling (loss of production capacity). Therefore, pretreatment is a necessity for any reverse osmosis or nanofiltration system. Pretreatment in sea water reverse osmosis systems has four major components:
*Screening of solids: Solids within the water must be removed and the water treated to prevent fouling of the membranes by fine particle or biological growth, and reduce the risk of damage to high-pressure pump components.
*Cartridge filtration: Generally, string-wound polypropylene filters are used to remove particles of 1–5&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] diameter.
*Dosing: Oxidizing biocides, such as chlorine, are added to kill bacteria, followed by bisulfite dosing to deactivate the chlorine, which can destroy a thin-film composite membrane. There are also [[biofouling]] inhibitors, which do not kill bacteria, but simply prevent them from growing slime on the membrane surface and plant walls.
*Prefiltration pH adjustment: If the pH, hardness and the alkalinity in the feedwater result in a scaling tendency when they are concentrated in the reject stream, acid is dosed to maintain carbonates in their soluble carbonic acid form.
:CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
*Carbonic acid cannot combine with calcium to form [[calcium carbonate]] scale. Calcium carbonate scaling tendency is estimated using the Langelier saturation index. Adding too much sulfuric acid to control carbonate scales may result in calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, or strontium sulfate scale formation on the reverse osmosis membrane.
*Prefiltration antiscalants: Scale inhibitors (also known as antiscalants) prevent formation of all scales compared to acid, which can only prevent formation of calcium carbonate and [[calcium phosphate]] scales. In addition to inhibiting carbonate and phosphate scales, antiscalants inhibit sulfate and fluoride scales and disperse colloids and metal oxides. Despite claims that antiscalants can inhibit silica formation, no concrete evidence proves that silica polymerization can be inhibited by antiscalants. Antiscalants can control acid-soluble scales at a fraction of the dosage required to control the same scale using sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Malki, M.|title=Optimizing scale inhibition costs in reverse osmosis desalination plants|journal=International Desalination and Water Reuse Quarterly|year=2008|volume=17|issue=4|pages=28–29 |url=http://www.membranechemicals.com/english/Optimizing%20Operational%20Costs%20in%20Reverse%20Osmosis%20Desalination%20Plants%20-%202008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some small scale desalination units use 'beach wells'; they are usually drilled on the seashore in close vicinity to the ocean. These intake facilities are relatively simple to build and the seawater they collect is pretreated via slow filtration through the subsurface sand/seabed formations in the area of source water extraction. Raw seawater collected using beach wells is often of better quality in terms of solids, silt, oil and grease, natural organic contamination and aquatic microorganisms, compared to open seawater intakes. Sometimes, beach intakes may also yield source water of lower salinity.

=== High pressure pump ===
The high pressure [[pump]] supplies the pressure needed to push water through the membrane, even as the membrane rejects the passage of salt through it. Typical pressures for [[brackish water]] range from 1.6 to 2.6 MPa (225 to 376 psi). In the case of seawater, they range from 5.5 to 8 MPa (800 to 1,180 psi). This requires a large amount of energy. Where energy recovery is used, part of the high pressure pump's work is done by the energy recovery device, reducing the system energy inputs.

=== Membrane assembly ===
[[File:Reverse osmosis membrane element layers.jpg|thumb|The layers of a membrane]]
The membrane assembly consists of a pressure vessel with a membrane that allows feedwater to be pressed against it. The membrane must be strong enough to withstand whatever pressure is applied against it. Reverse osmosis membranes are made in a variety of configurations, with the two most common configurations being spiral-wound and hollow-fiber.

Only a part of the saline feed water pumped into the membrane assembly passes through the membrane with the salt removed. The remaining "concentrate" flow passes along the saline side of the membrane to flush away the concentrated salt solution. The percentage of desalinated water produced versus the saline water feed flow is known as the "recovery ratio". This varies with the salinity of the feed water and the system design parameters: typically 20% for small seawater systems, 40% – 50% for larger seawater systems, and 80% – 85% for brackish water. The concentrate flow is at typically only 3 bar / 50 psi less than the feed pressure, and thus still carries much of the high pressure pump input energy.

The desalinated water purity is a function of the feed water salinity, membrane selection and recovery ratio. To achieve higher purity a second pass can be added which generally requires re-pumping. Purity expressed as [[total dissolved solids]] typically varies from 100 to 400 parts per million (ppm or mg/litre)on a seawater feed. A level of 500 ppm is generally accepted as the upper limit for drinking water, while the US Food and Drug Administration classifies [[mineral water]] as water containing at least 250 ppm.

===Energy recovery===
Energy recovery can reduce energy consumption by 50% or more. Much of the high pressure pump input energy can be recovered from the concentrate flow, and the increasing efficiency of energy recovery devices has greatly reduced the energy needs of reverse osmosis desalination. Devices used, in order of invention, are:
* [[Water turbine|Turbine]] or [[Pelton wheel]]: a water turbine driven by the concentrate flow, connected to the high pressure pump drive shaft to provide part of its input power. Positive displacement axial piston motors have also been used in place of turbines on smaller systems.
* Turbocharger: a water turbine driven by the concentrate flow, directly connected to a [[centrifugal pump]] which boosts the high pressure pump output pressure, reducing the pressure needed from the high pressure pump and thereby its energy input, similar in construction principle to car engine [[turbocharger]]s.

* [[Pressure exchanger]]: using the pressurized concentrate flow, in direct contact or via a piston, to pressurize part of the membrane feed flow to near concentrate flow pressure. A boost pump then raises this pressure by typically 3 bar / 50 psi to the membrane feed pressure. This reduces flow needed from the high-pressure pump by an amount equal to the concentrate flow, typically 60%, and thereby its energy input. These are widely used on larger low-energy systems. They are capable of 3 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less energy consumption. 
[[File:Reverse Osmosis with Pressure Recovery Pump.jpg|thumb|300px|Schematic of a reverse osmosis desalination system using an energy recovery pump.&lt;br&gt;''1'': Sea water inflow (100%, 1 bar),&lt;br&gt;''2'': Sea water flow (100%, 50 bar),&lt;br&gt;''3'': Concentrate flow (60%, 48 bar),&lt;br&gt;''4'': Fresh water flow (40%, 1 bar),&lt;br&gt;''5'': Concentrate to drain (60%,1 bar),&lt;br&gt;''A: Pressure recovery pump,&lt;br&gt;''B'': Osmosis unit with membrane]]
* Energy recovery pump: a reciprocating piston pump having the pressurized concentrate flow applied to one side of each piston to help drive the membrane feed flow from the opposite side. These are the simplest energy recovery devices to apply, combining the high pressure pump and energy recovery in a single self-regulating unit. These are widely used on smaller low-energy systems. They are capable of 3 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less energy consumption.
* Batch operation: Reverse osmosis systems run with a fixed volume of fluid (thermodynamically a [[closed system]]) do not suffer from wasted energy in the brine stream, as the energy to pressurize a virtually incompressible fluid (water) is negligible. Such systems have the potential to reach second law efficiencies of 60%.&lt;ref name=WarsingerBatch /&gt;

=== Remineralisation and pH adjustment ===
The desalinated water is "stabilized" to protect downstream pipelines and storage, usually by adding lime or [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] to prevent corrosion of concrete-lined surfaces. Liming material is used to adjust pH between 6.8 and 8.1 to meet the potable water specifications, primarily for effective disinfection and for corrosion control. Remineralisation may be needed to replace minerals removed from the water by desalination. Although this process has proved to be costly and not very convenient if it is intended to meet mineral demand by humans and plants. The very same mineral demand that freshwater sources provided previously. For instance water from Israel's national water carrier typically contains dissolved magnesium levels of 20 to 25&amp;nbsp;mg/liter, while water from the Ashkelon plant has no magnesium. After farmers used this water, magnesium deficiency symptoms appeared in crops, including tomatoes, basil, and flowers, and had to be remedied by fertilization. Current Israeli drinking water standards set a minimum calcium level of 20&amp;nbsp;mg/liter. The postdesalination treatment in the Ashkelon plant uses sulfuric acid to dissolve calcite (limestone), resulting in calcium
concentration of 40 to 46&amp;nbsp;mg/liter. This is still lower than the 45 to 60&amp;nbsp;mg/liter found in typical Israeli freshwaters.

=== Disinfection ===
Post-treatment consists of preparing the water for distribution after filtration. Reverse osmosis is an effective barrier to pathogens, but post-treatment provides secondary protection against compromised membranes and downstream problems. Disinfection by means of [[Ultraviolet radiation|ultra violet]] (UV) lamps (sometimes called germicidal or bactericidal) may be employed to sterilize pathogens which bypassed the reverse osmosis process. [[Water chlorination|Chlorination]] or [[chloramination]] (chlorine and ammonia) protects against pathogens which may have lodged in the distribution system downstream, such as from new construction, backwash, compromised pipes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sekar|first1=Chandru|title=IEEE R10 HTA Portable Autonomous Water Purification System|journal=[[IEEE]]|url=https://www.academia.edu/4350783|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Household reverse osmosis units use a lot of water because they have low back pressure. As a result, they recover only 5 to 15% of the water entering the system. The remainder is discharged as waste water. Because waste water carries with it the rejected contaminants, methods to recover this water are not practical for household systems. Wastewater is typically connected to the house drains and will add to the load on the household septic system. A reverse osmosis unit delivering 19 L of treated water per day may discharge between 75–340 L of waste water per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/h2oqual/watsys/wq1047.pdf Treatment Systems for Household Water Supplies]. Ag.ndsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt; This is having disastrous consequence for mega cities like [[Delhi]] where large-scale use of household R.O. devices has increased the total water demand of the already water parched National Capital Territory of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Govind|date=2017|title=Implication of Household Use of R.O. Devices for Delhi's Urban Water Scenario|url=http://jiid.in/2017/02/implication-household-use-r-o-devices-delhis-urban-water-scenario/|journal=Journal of Innovation for Inclusive Development|volume=2|issue=1|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale industrial/municipal systems recover typically 75% to 80% of the feed water, or as high as 90%, because they can generate the high pressure needed for higher recovery reverse osmosis filtration.  On the other hand, as recovery of wastewater increases in commercial operations, effective contaminant removal rates tend to become reduced, as evidenced by product water [[total dissolved solids]] levels.

Due to its fine membrane construction, reverse osmosis not only removes harmful contaminants present in the water, but it also may remove many of the desirable minerals from the water. A number of peer-reviewed studies have looked at the long-term health effects of drinking [[Purified water|demineralized]] water.&lt;ref&gt;Kozisek, Frantisek. [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf Health risks from drinking demineralised water]. National Institute of Public Health, Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waste stream considerations ===
Depending upon the desired product, either the solvent or solute stream of reverse osmosis will be waste. For food concentration applications, the concentrated solute stream is the product and the solvent stream is waste. For water treatment applications, the solvent stream is purified water and the solute stream is concentrated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weber |first=Walter J. |authorlink = |title =Physicochemical Processes for Water Quality Control |publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons |volume = |edition = |date =1972 |location =New York |isbn =978-0-471-92435-7|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solvent waste stream from food processing may be used as [[reclaimed water]], but there may be fewer options for disposal of a concentrated waste solute stream. Ships may use [[marine dumping]] and coastal desalination plants typically use [[marine outfall]]s. Landlocked reverse osmosis plants may require [[evaporation pond]]s or [[injection well]]s to avoid polluting [[groundwater]] or [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hammer |first=Mark J. |authorlink = |title =Water and Waste-Water Technology |publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons |date =1975 |location =New York |isbn =978-0-471-34726-2|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New developments ==
Since the 1970s, prefiltration of high-fouling waters with another larger-pore membrane, with less hydraulic energy requirement, has been evaluated and sometimes used. However, this means that the water passes through two membranes and is often repressurized, which requires more energy to be put into the system, and thus increases the cost.

Other recent developmental work has focused on integrating reverse osmosis with [[electrodialysis]] to improve recovery of valuable deionized products, or to minimize the volume of concentrate requiring discharge or disposal.

In the production of drinking water, the latest developments include [[nanoscale]] and [[graphene]] membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep03163|arxiv=1307.0208|title=Quantized Water Transport: Ideal Desalination through Graphyne-4 Membrane|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|pages=3163|year=2013|last1=Zhu|first1=Chongqin|last2=Li|first2=Hui|last3=Zeng|first3=Xiao Cheng|last4=Wang|first4=E.

The world's largest RO desalination plant was built in Sorek, Israel, in 2013. It has an output of 624,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2015/02/isreal-scales-up-reverse-osmosis.html|title=Next Big Future: Israel scales up Reverse Osmosis Desalination to slash costs with a fourth of the piping|publisher=nextbigfuture.com|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the cheapest and will sell water to the authorities for US$0.58/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/534996/megascale-desalination/|title=Megascale Desalination|publisher=technologyreview.com|author=Talbot, David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mba, School of Engineering, [[Cranfield University]]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary treatment process means protection by removal of [[Gritstone|grit]] and sand and coarse material through a screening process, followed by a removal process of sediment by settling. The RBC process involves allowing the wastewater to come in contact with a biological medium in order to remove [[pollutant]]s in the wastewater  before discharge of the treated wastewater to the [[Natural environment|environment]], usually a body of water (river, lake or ocean). A rotating biological contactor is a type of secondary (Biological) treatment process. It  consists of a series of closely spaced, parallel discs mounted on a rotating shaft which is supported just above the surface of the waste water. Microorganisms grow on the surface of the discs where [[biological degradation]] of the wastewater pollutants takes place.

==Operation==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
[[Image:RBC Media Cross-section.png|thumb|right|250px|A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a rotating biological contactor (RBC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] | edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1967 | pages= 262| id= [[LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The rotating packs of disks (known as the media) are contained in a tank or trough and rotate at between 2 and 5 revolutions per minute. Commonly used plastics for the media are [[polyethylene]], [[PVC]] and expanded [[polystyrene]]. The shaft is aligned with the flow of wastewater so that the discs rotate at right angles to the flow, with several packs usually combined to make up a treatment train. About 40% of the disc area is immersed in the wastewater.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Fixed Biological Surfaces - Wastewater Treatment: The Rotating Biological Contactor | author= Ronald L. Antonie | publisher = CRC Press | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nLtHDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rotating+biological+contactor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU442JxsbZAhVGtlkKHUgUAO4Q6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Rotating%20biological%20contactor&amp;f=false | date = 2018 | page =   | isbn = 9781351088947  | accessdate = 27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch 2}}

Biological growth is attached to the surface of the disc and forms a slime layer. The discs contact the wastewater with the atmospheric air for oxidation as it rotates. The rotation helps to slough off excess solids. The disc system can be staged in series to obtain nearly any detention time or degree of removal required. Since the systems are staged, the culture of the later stages can be acclimated to the slowly degraded materials.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|Ch 2}}

The discs consist of plastic sheets ranging from 2 to 4 m in diameter and are up to 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Several modules may be arranged in parallel and/or in series to meet the flow and treatment requirements. The discs are submerged in waste water to about 40% of their diameter. Approximately 95% of the surface area is thus alternately submerged in waste water and then exposed to the atmosphere above the liquid. Carbonaceous substrate is removed in the initial stage of RBC. Carbon conversion may be completed in the first stage of a series of modules, with nitrification being completed after the 5th stage. Most design of RBC systems will include a minimum of 4 or 5 modules in series to obtain nitrification of waste water.

[[Biofilms]], which are biological growths that become attached to the discs, assimilate the organic materials in the wastewater. [[Aeration]] is provided by the rotating action, which exposes the media to the air after contacting them with the wastewater, facilitating the degradation of the pollutants being removed. The degree of wastewater treatment is related to the amount of media surface area and the quality and volume of the inflowing wastewater.

==History==
{{cleanup|reason=Requires citations, lacks flow and perhaps better in another section?|date=May 2016}}
The first RBC was installed in West Germany in 1959, later it was introduced in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name = "Antonie"/&gt;{{rp|Ch 2:History}} In the United States, rotating biological contactors are used for industries producing wastewaters high in [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) (e.g., petroleum industry and dairy industry).

A properly designed RBC produced a very high quality final effluent. However both the organic and hydraulic loading had to be addressed. 

In the 1980's problems were encountered in the USA prompting the Environmental Agency to commission a number of reports.

These reports identified a number of issues and criticized the RBC process. One author suggested that since manufacturers were aware of the problem, the problems would be resolved and suggested that design engineers should specify a long life.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

However, this was only possible when the manufacturers became aware of the design problems and the stress to ensure a long life and since failures still occurred it was unlikely any design stresses were known.

Severn Trent Water Ltd, a large UK Water Company based in the Midlands, employed RBCs as the preferred process for their small works which amount to over 700 sites  Consequently, long life was essential to compliance.

This issue was successfully addressed by Eric Findlay C Eng when he was employed by Severn Trent Water Ltd in the UK following a period of failure of a number of plants. As a result, the issue of short life failure became fully understood in the early 1990s when the correct process and hydraulic issues had been identified to produce a high quality nitrified effluent. 


There are several other papers which address the whole issue of RBCs.
Findlay also developed a system for repairing defective RBCs enabling shaft and frame life to be extended up to 30 years based on the Cranfield designed frame. Where additional capacity was required intermediate  frames are used maximising minimising the need for duplication

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary clarification== 
Secondary clarifiers following RBCs are identical in design to conventional humus tanks, as used downstream of [[trickling filter]]s. Sludge is generally removed daily, or pumped automatically to the primary settlement tank for co-settlement. Regular sludge removal reduces the risk of  anaerobic conditions from developing within the sludge, with subsequent sludge flotation due to the release of gases.

A '''small appliance''', '''small domestic appliance''', or '''small electrics'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biglots.com/c/electronics-office/small-electrics/_/N-3326474532 Small Electrics | Big Lots]&lt;/ref&gt; are portable or semi-portable machines, generally used on [[Table (furniture)|table]]-tops, [[Countertop|counter-tops]], or other platforms, to accomplish a [[household]] task. Examples include [[microwave oven]]s, [[toaster]]s, [[humidifier]]s, and [[coffeemaker]]s. They contrast with [[major appliance|major appliances (British "white goods")]], such as the [[refrigerator]] and [[washing machine]], which cannot be easily moved and are generally placed on the floor.  Small appliances also contrast with [[consumer electronics|consumer electronics (British "brown goods")]] which are for leisure and [[entertainment]] rather than purely practical tasks.&lt;ref name="Baumann1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumann|first=Ted|title=An industrial strategy for the household electrical durables industry|year=1995|publisher=UCT Press|isbn=9780799215786|page=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Some small appliances perform the same or similar function as their larger counterparts. For example, a [[toaster oven]] is a small appliance that performs a similar function as an [[oven]]. Small appliances often have a home version and a commercial version, for example [[waffle iron]]s, [[food processor]]s, and [[blender]]s. The commercial, or industrial, version is designed to be used nearly continuously in a restaurant or other similar setting. Commercial appliances are typically connected to a more powerful electrical outlet, are larger and stronger, have more user-serviceable parts, and cost significantly more.

==Prices==
Small appliances can be very inexpensive, such as an electric [[can opener]], [[kettle|hot pot]], [[toaster]], or coffee maker which may cost only a few U.S. dollars, or very expensive, such as an elaborate [[Espresso machine|espresso maker]], which may cost several thousand U.S. dollars. Most homes in [[developed economies]] contain several cheaper home appliances, with perhaps a few more expensive appliances, such as a high-end microwave oven or [[Mixer (cooking)|mixer]].

==Powering==
Many small appliances are powered by [[electricity]]. The appliance may use a permanently attached cord which is plugged into a [[wall outlet]] or a detachable cord. The appliance may have a cord storage feature. A few hand-held appliances use [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], which may be disposable or rechargeable. Some appliances consist of an [[electrical motor]] upon which is mounted various attachments so as to constitute several individual appliances, such as a blender, a food processor, or a [[juicer]]. Many [[stand mixer]]s, while functioning primarily as a mixer, have attachments which can perform additional functions.

A few [[gasoline]] and [[Propane|gas]]-powered appliances exist for use in situations where electricity is not expected to be available, but these are typically larger and not as portable as most small appliances. Items that perform the same function as small appliances but are hand powered are generally referred to as [[tools]] or [[gadgets]], for example a [[Mixer_(cooking)#History|hand cranked egg beater]], a [[grater]], a [[mandoline]], or a hand-powered [[meat grinder]].

==Safety==
Small appliances which are defective or improperly used or maintained may cause [[house fires]] and other property damage, or may harbor [[bacteria]] if not properly [[Cleanliness|cleaned]]. It is important that users read the instructions carefully and that appliances that use a [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] cord be attached to a grounded [[Electrical outlet|outlet]]. Because of the risk of fire, some appliances have a short detachable cord that is connected to the appliance [[magnetically]]. If the appliance is moved further than the cord length from the wall, the cord will detach from the appliance.

==Definitions and regulations==
{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}
Designations and regulations of "small appliances" vary by country and are not simply determined by physical sizes. For instance, [[United States]] [[Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations mandate that small appliances must meet two standards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paluca|first1=Kleia|title=Understanding Small Appliance Standards and Regulations|url=http://applianceauthority.org/general/understanding-small-appliance-standards-and-regulations/|publisher=Appliance Authority|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1783">A '''spinet desk''' is an antique [[desk]] with an exterior shape similar to a [[writing table]], But slightly higher and is fitted with a single drawer under the whole length of the flat top surface. The spinet desk is so named because when closed it resembles a [[spinet]], a [[musical instrument]] of the [[harpsichord]] family.

This single drawer, however, is a dummy.  It is a hinged panel which is meant to be folded in, at the same time as half of the hinged top surface is folded back on to the top of the other half, revealing an inner desktop surface of normal height, with small drawers and pigeonholes in the back. In certain spinet desks the inner desktop surface can be drawn out a few inches, adding working space.  

[[Image:Spinetdeskfrontinjpeg20040131B.png|thumbnail|right|700px|Front of spinet desk, closed]]
[[Image:Spinetdesksideinjpeg20040131B.png|thumbnail|right|700px|Side of spinet desk, partly open]]

The image of the front of the spinet desk shows it in a closed position while the image of the side shows it in a partly open position, just before the hinged mobile part of the top is placed on the fixed part of the top.

By this capacity of hiding or revealing the main working area the spinet desk could be said to be a smaller, less obtrusive cousin of the [[rolltop desk]] and the [[cylinder desk]].  Like them, and unlike the [[secretary desk]] or the [[fall front desk]], it can be closed up without disturbing too much the paperwork and various documents and implements left on the main desktop surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3227">'''Thermalite''' a specific type of [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] used in [[pyrotechnic]] applications. The product was designed to be used in cross matching safety fuses of the Bickford type. As safety fuse is designed to neither give nor take fire through the heavy fuse jacket, ignition may be achieved by punching a hole perpendicular to and through a safety fuse powder core, threading a piece of Thermalite or similar igniter cord through the hole, then gently squeezing the safety fuse with pliers or similar to bring the powder core into contact with the igniter cord. The Thermalite could be ignited by a match, or more certainly by a purpose made igniter, similar to a wire sparkler.

An expedient formerly used to ignite bickford style safety fuses was to split the end of a safety fuse, place a match head into the split and tie the split back together, holding the match head against the powder core. This technique was slower, cumbersome and more failure prone than piercing and cross matching. Also, a single length of igniter cord could pass through and serially ignite multiple pieces of safety fuse attached to various charges in more complex, multiple charge blasting schemes. This technique and the several burn rate types of igniter cord manufactured by ICI could be used to implement quite complex ignition sequences.

This fuse is used in high-power [[model rocket]]ry as a means of simultaneously igniting multiple "clustered" rocket motors. A single [[flash-lamp|flashbulb]] or flash pan is used to ignite pieces of Thermalite leading to each motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |publisher=Stason.org 
  |accessdate=2010-06-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermalite comes in three burn rates identifiable by the colour of the fuse wrapping: 
*Pink: slow (20 sec/foot)  
*Green: medium (10 sec/foot) 
*White: fast (5 sec/foot) 

Thermalite igniter cords and connectors were manufactured in [[Quebec]] by ICA Canada Inc., however in November 1995 they ceased manufacturing igniter cord.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slv2000.qc.ec.gc.ca/bibliotheque/centre_docum/protection/54_98_a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sources for thermalite are increasingly hard to come by and purchasing it by mail will usually require permits and licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''threshing machine''' or '''thresher''' is a piece of [[agricultural machinery|farm equipment]] that threshes [[grain]], that is, it removes the [[seed]]s from the [[plant stem|stalks]] and [[husk]]s. It does so by beating the plant to make the seeds fall out. 

Before such machines were developed, [[threshing]] was done by hand with [[flail]]s: such hand threshing was very laborious and time-consuming, taking about one-quarter of agricultural labour by the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mechanization]] of this process removed a substantial amount of drudgery from farm labour. The first threshing machine was invented circa 1786 by the Scottish engineer [[Andrew Meikle]], and the subsequent adoption of such machines was one of the earlier examples of the [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]]. During the 19th century, threshers and mechanical [[reaper]]s and [[reaper-binder]]s gradually became widespread and made grain production much less laborious.

Separate reaper-binders and threshers have largely been replaced by machines that combine all of their functions, that is [[combine harvester]]s or combines. However, the simpler machines remain important as [[appropriate technology]] in low-[[financial capital|capital]] farming contexts, both in [[developing country|developing countries]] and in developed countries on small farms that strive for especially high levels of [[self-sufficiency]]. For example, [[threshers, pedal powered|pedal-powered threshers]] are a low-cost option, and some [[Amish]] sects use horse-drawn binders and old-style threshers.

As the verb ''[[wikt:thresh#Verb|thresh]]'' is [[cognate]] with the verb ''[[wikt:thrash#Verb|thrash]]'' (and [[synonym]]ous in the grain-beating [[word sense|sense]]), the names '''thrashing machine''' and '''thrasher''' are (less common) [[free variation|alternate forms]].

== Early social impacts ==
[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|2|thumb|Threshing machine from 1881]]
The [[Swing Riots]] in the UK were partly a result of the threshing machine. Following years of war, high taxes and low wages, farm labourers finally [[revolt]]ed in 1830. These farm labourers had faced unemployment for a number of years due to the widespread introduction of the threshing machine and the policy of [[enclosure|enclosing]] fields. No longer were thousands of men needed to tend the crops, a few would suffice. With fewer jobs, lower wages and no prospects of things improving for these workers the threshing machine was the final straw, the machine was to place them on the brink of starvation. The Swing Rioters smashed threshing machines and threatened farmers who had them.

The riots were dealt with very harshly. Nine of the rioters were hanged and a further 450 were [[Penal transportation|transported]] to [[Australia]].

== Later adoption ==

[[Image:Rhof-windfege.ogg|200px|thumb|Irreler Bauerntradition shows a [[winnowing machine]] at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]]]]
Early threshing machines were hand-fed and horse-powered. They were small by today's standards and were about the size of an upright [[piano]].  Later machines were [[steam engine|steam-powered]], driven by a [[portable engine]] or [[traction engine]]. Isaiah Jennings, a skilled inventor, created a small thresher that doesn't harm the straw in the process. In 1834, John Avery and Hiram Abial Pitts devised significant improvements to a machine that automatically threshes and separates grain from chaff, freeing farmers from a slow and laborious process. Avery and Pitts were granted United States patent #542 on December 29, 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=0000542.PN.&amp;OS=PN/0000542&amp;RS=PN/0000542 |title=United States Patent: 0000542 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When threshing machines were harvest kings|publisher=Small Business Advances|url=http://www.ledgersentinel.com/article.asp?a=6393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ridley (inventor)|John Ridley]], an Australian inventor, also developed a threshing machine in [[South Australia]] in 1843.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020334b.htm |title=Ridley, John (1806 - 1887) |accessdate=2007-08-19 |author=H. J. Finnis |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 2 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1967 |pages=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Household Cyclopedia|1881 ''Household Cyclopedia'']] said of Meikle's machine:

:"Since the invention of this machine, Mr. Meikle and others have progressively introduced a variety of improvements, all tending to simplify the labour, and to augment the quantity of the work performed. When first erected, though the grain was equally well separated from the straw, yet as the whole of the straw, chaff, and grain, was indiscriminately thrown into a confused heap, the work could only with propriety be considered as half executed. By the addition of rakes, or shakers, and two pairs of fanners, all driven by the same machinery, the different processes of thrashing, shaking, and [[winnowing]] are now all at once performed, and the grain immediately prepared for the public market. When it is added, that the quantity of grain gained from the superior powers of the machine is fully equal to a twentieth part of the crop, and that, in some cases, the expense of thrashing and cleaning the grain is considerably less than what was formerly paid for cleaning it alone, the immense saving arising from the invention will at once be seen.

:"The expense of horse labour, from the increased value of the animal and the charge of his keeping, being an object of great importance, it is recommended that, upon all sizable farms, that is to say, where two hundred acres [800,000 m²], or upwards, of grain are sown, the machine should be worked by wind, unless where local circumstances afford the conveniency of water.  Where coals are plenty and cheap, steam may be advantageously used for working the machine."

Steam-powered machines used belts connected to a [[traction engine]]; often both engine and thresher belonged to a contractor who toured the farms of a district. Steam remained a viable commercial option until the early post-WWII years.

[[File:Batteuse - St-Michel 1.JPG|thumb|right|Open-air museum in [[Saint-Hubert, Belgium]].]]

==Farming process==

Threshing is just one step of the process in getting cereals to the grinding mill and customer.
The wheat needs to be grown, cut, [[stook]]ed (shocked, bundled), hauled, threshed, [[winnowing|de-chaffed]], [[straw bale]]d, and then the grain hauled to a [[grain elevator]]. For many years each of these steps was an individual process, requiring teams of workers and many machines. In the steep hill wheat country of [[Palouse]] in the Northwest of the United States, steep ground meant moving machinery around was problematic and prone to rolling. To reduce the amount of work on the sidehills, the idea arose of combining the wheat binder and thresher into one machine, known as a [[combine harvester]].  About 1910, horse pulled combines appeared and became a success.  Later, gas and diesel engines appeared with other refinements and specifications.

== Modern developments ==

===In Europe and Americas===
[[File:Agriculture of Bangladesh 10.jpg|thumb|Threshing of paddy by machine, Bangladesh.]]
Modern day combine harvesters (or simply [[combine harvester|combines]]) operate on the same principles and use the same components as the original threshing machines built in the 19th century.  Combines also perform the reaping operation at the same time.  The name ''combine'' is derived from the fact that the two steps are combined in a single machine.  Also, most modern combines are self-powered (usually by a diesel engine) and self-propelled, although tractor powered, pull type combines models were offered by John Deere and Case International into the 1990s.

Today, as in the 19th century, the threshing begins with a cylinder and concave.  The cylinder has sharp serrated bars, and rotates at high speed (about 500 RPM), so that the bars beat against the grain.  The concave is curved to match the curve of the cylinder, and serves to hold the grain as it is beaten.  The beating releases the grain from the straw and chaff.

Whilst the majority of the grain falls through the concave, the straw is carried by a set of "walkers" to the rear of the machine, allowing any grain and chaff still in the straw to fall below.  Below the straw walkers, a fan blows a stream of air across the grain, removing dust and fines and blowing them away.

The grain, either coming through the concave or the walkers, meets a set of sieves mounted on an assembly called a shoe, which is shaken mechanically.  The top sieve has larger openings, and serves to remove large pieces of chaff from the grain.  The lower sieve separates clean grain, which falls through, from incompletely threshed pieces.  The incompletely threshed grain is returned to the cylinder by means of a system of conveyors, where the process repeats.

Some threshing machines were equipped with a bagger, which invariably held two bags, one being filled, and the other being replaced with an empty.  A worker called a ''sewer'' removed and replaced the bags, and sewed full bags shut with a needle and thread.  Other threshing machines would discharge grain from a conveyor, for bagging by hand.  Combines are equipped with a grain tank, which accumulates grain for deposit in a truck or wagon.

A large amount of chaff and straw would accumulate around a threshing machine, and several innovations, such as the air chaffer, were developed to deal with this.  Combines generally chop and disperse straw as they move through the field, though the chopping is disabled when the straw is to be baled, and chaff collectors are sometimes used to prevent the dispersal of weed seed throughout a field.

The [[corn sheller]] was almost identical in design, with slight modifications to deal with the larger kernel size and presence of cobs.  Modern-day combines can be adjusted to work with any grain crop, and many unusual seed crops.

Both the older and modern machines require a good deal of effort to operate. The concave clearance, cylinder speed, fan velocity, sieve sizes, and feeding rate must be adjusted for crop conditions.

===Another development in Asia===
[[File:Petrol powered threshing machine in Hainan - 01.ogv|thumbnail|Video of a petrol-powered machine threshing rice in [[Hainan]], China]]
From the early 20th century, petrol or diesel-powered threshing machines, designed especially to thresh [[rice]], the most important crop in Asia, have been developed along different lines to the modern combine.

Even after the combine was invented and became popular, a new compact-size thresher called a ''harvester'', with wheels, still remains in use and at present it is available from a Japanese agricultural manufacturer. The compact-size machine is very convenient to handle in small terrace fields in mountain areas where a large machine, such as combine, is not usable.

People there use this harvester with a modern compact [[Reaper-binder|binder]].

==Preservation==
A number of older threshing machines have survived into preservation. They are often to be seen in operation at [[live steam]] festivals and [[traction engine]] rallies such as the [[Great Dorset Steam Fair]] in England, and the [[WMSTR|Western Minnesota Steam Threshers Reunion]] in northwest [[Minnesota]].

===Musical references===
Irish songwriter John Duggan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bardis.ie/composers.htm#duggan&lt;/ref&gt; immortalised the threshing machine in a song ''The Old Thrashing Mill''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyrics.ms/lyrics/foster-allen/the-old-threshing-mill/157788.htm Song lyrics: ''The Old Threshing Mill'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The song has been recorded by [[Foster and Allen]] and [[Brendan Shine]].

On the Alan Lomax collection Songs of Seduction (Rounder Select, 2000), there's a bawdy Irish folk song called "The Thrashing Machine" sung by tinker Annie O'Neil, as recorded in the early 20th Century.

In his film score for ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939) and consequently in his collection "Music for the Movies" (1942), American composer [[Aaron Copland]] titled a section of the score "Threshing Machines," to suit a scene in the Lewis Milestone film where Curley is threatening Slim over giving May a puppy, when many of the itinerant worker men are standing around or working on threshers.

In the song [[Thrasher]] from the album [[Rust Never Sleeps]], [[Neil Young]] compares the modern threshing machine's technique of separating wheat from wheat stalks to the natural forces of time that separate close friends from one another.

Threshing machines appear in [[Twenty One Pilots]]' music video for the song [[House of Gold (Twenty One Pilots song)|House of Gold]].

== Mechanism ==
In a pure time-slot interchange switch, there is only one physical input, and one physical output.  Each physical connection is an opportunity for a switching fabric to fail.  The limited number of connections of this switch is therefore valuable in a large switching fabric, because it makes this type of switching very reliable.  The disadvantage of this type of switch is that it introduces delay into the signals.  

When a packet (or byte, on [[telephone switch]]es) comes to the input, the switch stores the data in RAM in one sequence, and reads it out in a different sequence. Switch designs vary, but typically, a repeating counter is incremented with an [[Clock signal|internal clock]].  It typically wraps-around to zero.  The RAM location chosen for the incoming data is taken from a small memory indexed by the counter. It is usually a location for the desired output time-slot. The current value of the counter also selects the RAM data to forward in the current output time slot. Then the counter is incremented to the next value. The switch repeats the [[algorithm]], eventually sending data from any input time-slot to any output time-slot.

To minimize connections, and therefore improve reliability, the data to reprogram the switch is usually programmed via a single wire that threads through the entire group of integrated circuits in a printed circuit board.  The software typically compares the data shifted-in with the data shifted-out, to verify that the ICs remain correctly connected.  The switching data entered into the ICs is double-buffered.  That is, a new switch set-up is shifted-in, and then a single pulse applies the new configuration instantly to all the connected ICs.

== Limitation ==
In a time-slot interchange (TSI) switch, two memory accesses are required for each connection (one to read and one to store). Let T be the time to access the memory. Therefore, for a connection, 2T time will be taken to access the memory. If there are n connections and t is the operation time for n lines, then&lt;br /&gt;
t=2nT&lt;br/&gt; which gives&lt;br/&gt;n=t/2T

t and n normally come from a higher-level system design of the switching fabric. Hence the technology yielding T determines n for a given t. T also limits t for a given n. Real switching fabrics have real requirements for n and t, and therefore since T must be an actual number set by a possible technology, real switches cannot be arbitrarily large n or small t.

In higher-speed switches, the limit from T can be halved by using a more expensive, less reliable two-port RAM.  In these designs, the read and write usually occur at the same time.  The switch must still arbitrate when there is an attempt to read and write a RAM slot at the same time.  This is normally done by avoiding the case in the control software, by rearranging the connections in the switching fabric. (E.g. see [[Nonblocking minimal spanning switch]])

== Customary Applications ==
In packet-switching networks, a time-slot interchange switch is often combined with two space-division switches to implement small network switches.

In telephone switches, time-slot interchange switches usually form the outer layer of the switching fabric at a central office's switch.  They take data from time-multiplexed T-1 or E-1 lines that serve neighborhoods. The T-1 or E-1 lines serve the subscriber line interface cards (SLICs) in local neighborhoods.  The SLICs serve as the outer space-division switches of a modern wired telephone system.

==Timeline==
*'''3rd millennium BCE [[Sexagesimal#Babylonian mathematics|Sexagesimal system]] of the [[Sumer]]ians''':
*'''2nd millennium BCE [[Plimpton 322|Babylonian Pythagorean triples]]'''.  According to mathematician [[S. G. Dani]], the Babylonian cuneiform tablet [[Plimpton 322]] written ca. 1850 BCE&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics Department, University of British Columbia, [http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/courses/m446-03/pl322/pl322.html ''The Babylonian tablet Plimpton 322''].&lt;/ref&gt; "contains fifteen Pythagorean triples with quite large entries, including (13500, 12709, 18541) which is a primitive triple,&lt;ref&gt;Three positive integers &lt;math&gt;(a, b, c) &lt;/math&gt; form a ''primitive'' Pythagorean triple if &lt;math&gt; c^2=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt; and if the highest common factor of &lt;math&gt; a, b, c &lt;/math&gt; is 1. In the particular Plimpton322 example, this means that &lt;math&gt; 13500^2+ 12709^2= 18541^2 &lt;/math&gt; and that the three numbers do not have any common factors. However some scholars have disputed the Pythagorean interpretation of this tablet; see Plimpton 322 for details.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating, in particular, that there was sophisticated understanding on the topic" in Mesopotamia.
*'''1st millennium BCE [[Baudhayana]] [[Indian mathematics#.C5.9Aulba S.C5.ABtras|Śulba Sūtras]] Earliest statement of Pythagorean Theorem''': According to {{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=363}}, the ''Śulba Sūtras'' contain  "the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonians]]." &lt;blockquote&gt;The diagonal rope (''{{IAST|akṣṇayā-rajju}}'') of an oblong (rectangle) produces both which the flank (''pārśvamāni'') and the horizontal (''{{IAST|tiryaṇmānī}}'') &lt;ropes&gt; produce separately."&lt;ref name=hayashi2005-p363&gt;{{Harv|Hayashi|2005|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Since the statement is a ''sūtra'', it is necessarily compressed and what the ropes ''produce'' is not elaborated on, but the context clearly implies the square areas constructed on their lengths, and would have been explained so by the teacher to the student.&lt;ref name=hayashi2005-p363/&gt;

'''Workmanship''' is a human attribute relating to knowledge and skill at performing a task. The type of work may include the creation of [[handcrafts]], [[art]], [[writing]], [[machinery]] and other products.  Workmanship is also a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] imparted to a product.

==Workmanship in society==
Workmanship is considered to have been a valued human attribute even in prehistoric times.  In the opinion of the economist and sociologist [[Thorstein Veblen]], the sense of workmanship is probably the single most important attribute governing the material well being of a people, with only the parental instinct coming a close second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Veblen|1914|loc= Chpt 1: Introduction |quote = "Chief among those instinctive dispositions that conduce directly to the material well-being of the race, and therefore to its biological success, is perhaps the instinctive bias here spoken of as the sense of workmanship." }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have however been periods in history where workmanship was looked down on; for example in [[Classical Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], where it had become associated with slavery. This was not always the case - back in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], Greeks had valued workmanship, celebrating it in [[Homeric hymns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sennett|209|loc= pp. 22-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the western world, a return to a more positive attitude towards work emerged with the rise of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2008 loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rasmussen|2008|loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Veblen considers that the social value of workmanship reached its peak with the "Era of handicraft". The era began as workmanship flourished with the relative peace and security of property rights that Europe had achieved by the [[Late middle ages]]. The era ended as machine driven processes began to displace the need for workmanship after the [[Industrial revolution]].  Workmanship was such a central concept during the handicraft era, that according to Veblen, even key theological questions about God's intentions for humanity were re-framed from "What has God ordained?"  to "What has God wrought?".&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"&gt;{{Harvnb|Veblen|1914|loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft }}&lt;/ref&gt;    The high value placed on workmanship could sometimes be an oppressive force for certain individuals - for example, one explanation for the origin of the English phrase [[sent to Coventry]] is that it was born from the practice where London [[guild]] members expelled due to poor workmanship were forced to move to Coventry, which used to be a guild free town.  But workmanship was still widely appreciated by the [[common people]] themselves.&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"/&gt; For example,  when workers accustomed to practicing high standards of workmanship were first recruited to work on production lines in factories, it would be common for them to walk out, as the new roles were relatively monotonous, giving them little scope to use their skills.  After [[Henry Ford]] introduced the first [[Assembly line]] in 1913, he could need to recruit about ten men to find one willing to stay in the job. Over time, and with Ford offering high rates of pay,  the aversion of labor to the new ways of working was reduced.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Workmanship began to receive considerable attention from scholars once its place in society came under threat by the rise of industrialization. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] arose in the late 19th and early 20th century, as workmanship began to be displaced by developments like greater emphases on process, machine work, and the separation of design and planning skills from the actual execution of work.  Scholars involved in founding the movement, like [[William Morris]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], argued that the opportunity to engage in workmanship used to be a great source of fulfillment for the working class.&lt;ref name="Veblen 1914 loc= Chpt 6: The era of handicraft"/&gt;   From a historical perspective however, the arts and crafts movement has been seen as a palliative, which unintentionally reduced resistance to the displacement of workmanship.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson Lear 1994 loc= Chpt 2: The figure of the artisan: arts and crafts ideology"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson Lear|1994|loc= Chpt 2: The figure of the artisan: arts and crafts ideology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book written on the nature of workmanship, [[David Pye (furniture)|David Pye]] writes that the displacement of workmanship has continued into the late 20th century. He writes that since World War II especially, there has been "an enormous intensification of interest in design", at the expense of workmanship. The trend started in the 19th century has continued, with Industrial processes increasingly designed to minimize the skill needed for workers to produce quality products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pye|1968|loc= Chpt 1: Design proposes: Workmanship disposes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 21st century scholars such as [[Matthew Crawford]] have argued that office and other white collar work is now being displaced by similar technological developments to  the ones that caused large numbers of manual workers to be made redundant from the late 19th to early 20th century. Even when the jobs remain, the cognitive aspects of the jobs taken away from the workers, due to knowledge being centralized.  He calls for a revaluing of workmanship, saying that certain manual roles like mechanics, plumbers and carpenters have been resistant to further automation, and are among the most likely to continue offering the worker the chance for independent thought.&lt;ref name = "soulCraft"/&gt; Writers like [[Alain de Botton]] and [[Jane McGonigal]] have argued that the world of work needs to be reformed to make it more fulfilling and less stressful. In particular, workers need to be able to make a deeply felt imaginative connection between their own efforts and the end product.  McGonigal argues that computer games can be a source of ideas for doing this; she says the primary reason for [[World of Warcraft]] being so popular is the sense of "blissful productivity" that its players enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Botton|2010| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McGonigal|2011|loc= Chpt 3: More satisfying work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workmanship and craftsmanship===
[[File:Rubens - Vulcano forjando los rayos de Júpiter.jpg|thumb| [[Peter Paul Rubens|Ruben's]] 1536  rendition of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the  Roman counterpart of [[Hephaestus]], the Greek God of Craftsmen.]]    
Workmanship and Craftsmanship are sometimes considered synonyms, but many draw a distinction between the two terms, or at least consider craftsmanship to mean "workmanship of the better sort".&lt;ref name="Pye 1968 loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pye|1968|loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who do consider  workmanship and craftsmanship to be different, the word "workmanlike" is sometimes even used as a pejorative, to suggest for example that while an author might understand the basics of their craft, they lack flair. David Pye has written that no one can definitively state where workmanship ends and craftsmanship begins.&lt;ref name="Pye 1968 loc= Chpt 2: The workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty"/&gt;

{{cquote|Sing clear-voiced Muse, of Hephaestus famed for skill. With bright-eyed Athena he taught me glorious crafts throughout the world - men who before used to dwell in caves in the mountains like wild beasts. But now that they have learned craftsmanship through Hephaestus famous for his art they live a peaceful life in own houses the whole year round.}}
- an extract from a Homeric hymn celebrating craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Sennett (2009) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, smiths and especially armor smiths developed unique symbols of workmanship&lt;ref&gt;Ffoulkes, John. The Armourer and His Craft: From the XIth to the XVIth Century. Dover, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the quality of their work. These became some of the most unusual signs of workmanship, comparable to the ''mon'' family crests of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuya Piece-Goods Store. Japanese Design Motifs: 4,260 Illustrations of Japanese Crests. Dover, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workmanship and aversion to labor===
It has often been held in older economic writings that people are always adverse to labor and can only be motivated to work by threats or tangible rewards such as money. While Christianity has generally been positive about workmanship, certain Bible passages such as Genesis 3:17 ("...Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.") have contributed to the view that labor is a necessary evil, part of the punishment for [[original sin]],&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2008 loc= Chpt 2: Work Curse or Blessing"/&gt; but work existed before original sin and the [[fall of man]] in Genesis 2:15 ("Yahweh God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.") The view that work is a punishment takes Genesis 3:17 out of context. God's curse wasn't work, but that work would inherently be harder. Veblen and others agree with this view, saying that work can be inherently joyful and satisfying in its own right. Veblen acknowledges that humans have an innate tendency towards idleness, but asserts that they also have a countervailing tendency to value work for its own sake, as is demonstrated by the vast amount of work that is undertaken without obvious external pressure. As evidence for the widely shared instinct towards workmanship, Veblen also notes the near universal tendency for humans to approve of others' good work. Psychologist Pernille Rasmussen has written that the tendency to value work can become so strong that it stops being a positive source of motivation, contributing instead to some people losing balance and becoming workaholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Electronics manufacturing==
The reliability of electronic devices is greatly affected by the quality of the workmanship. Therefore, the [[electronics manufacturing]] industry has developed several [[voluntary consensus standards]] to provide guidance on how products should be designed, built, inspected, and tested.&lt;ref&gt;L-3 Communications, [http://www.l-3com.com/csw/docs/wsm/ws-000.doc WS-000: Workmanship Standards Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29699">'''Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks''' (ZIFs) are a class of [[metal-organic framework]]s that are topologically isomorphic with [[zeolite]]s. ZIFs are composed of [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally-coordinated]] [[transition metal]] ions (e.g. [[iron|Fe]], [[cobalt|Co]], [[copper|Cu]], [[zinc|Zn]]) connected by [[imidazolate]] linkers. Since the metal-imidazole-metal angle is similar to the 145° Si-O-Si angle in zeolites, ZIFs have zeolite-like topologies.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=KS|title=Exceptional chemical and thermal stability of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks|journal=PNAS|year=2006|pages=10186–10191|doi=10.1073/pnas.0602439103|url=http://yaghi.chem.ucla.edu/pdfPublications/Park_Yaghi.pdf|volume=103|issue=27|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10310186P |display-authors=etal|pmc=1502432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 105 ZIF topologies have been reported in the literature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Phan, A.; Doonan, C.

==Applications of ZIFs==

=== Applications to carbon capture ===
{{Main|carbon capture and storage}}

ZIF’s exhibit some properties relevant to carbon capture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venna|first=Surendar R.|last2=Carreon|first2=Moises A.|date=2010-01-13|title=Highly Permeable Zeolite Imidazolate Framework-8 Membranes for CO2/CH4 Separation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja909263x|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=132|issue=1|pages=76–78|doi=10.1021/ja909263x|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; but commercial technology is based on amine solvents.&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smit|first1=Bernard|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|date=2014|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=Hackensack, NJ|isbn=978-1-78326-328-8|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method to separate carbon dioxide exploits differences in its permeability. Because of the tunability of the pores, zeolites have been used to separate carbon dioxide. The pore size ranges from 3-12 Angstroms. Because the size of a carbon dioxide molecule is approximately 5.4 Angstroms, zeolites with a pore size of 4-5 Angstroms can be a great fit for carbon capture. However, there are factors other than just pore size that need to be considered when determining how effective zeolites will be at carbon capture. The first is basicity, which can be created by doing an alkali metal cation exchange. The second is the Si/Al ratio which impacts the cation exchange capacity. To get a higher adsorption capacity, there must be a lower Si/Al ratio in order to increase the cation exchange capacity.

Zif’s 68, 69, 70, 78, 81, 82, 95, and 100 have been found to have very high uptake capacity, meaning that they can store a lot of carbon dioxide even if they don’t have extremely high affinities. Of those, 68, 69, and 70 show high affinities for carbon dioxide, evidenced by their adsorption isotherms, which show steep uptakes at low pressures. One liter of ZIF can hold 83 liters of {{co2}}. This could also be useful for [[Pressure swing adsorption|pressure-swing adsorption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phan|first=Anh|last2=Doonan|first2=Christian J.|last3=Uribe-Romo|first3=Fernando J.|last4=Knobler|first4=Carolyn B.|last5=O'Keeffe|first5=Michael|last6=Yaghi|first6=Omar M.|display-authors=3|date=2010-01-19|title=Synthesis, structure, and carbon dioxide capture properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=43|issue=1|pages=58–67|doi=10.1021/ar900116g|issn=1520-4898|pmid=19877580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other separation applications ===
Much ZIF research focuses on the separation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide because a well-studied ZIF, ZIF-8, has a very high separation factor for hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixtures. It is also very good for the separation of hydrocarbon mixtures, like the following: 
* Ethane-propane = 80
* Ethylene- propylene = 10
* Ethylene- propane = 167
In addition to gas separations, ZIF’s have the potential to separate components of biofuels, specifically, water and ethanol. Of all of the ZIF’s that have been tested, ZIF-8 shows high selectivity. ZIF’s have also shown potential in separating other alcohols, like propanol and butanol, from water. Typically, water and ethanol (or other alcohols) are separated using distillation, however ZIF’s offer a potential lower-energy separation option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Kang|last2=Nalaparaju|first2=Anjaiah|last3=Chen|first3=Yifei|last4=Jiang|first4=Jianwen|date=2014-04-23|title=Biofuel purification in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks: the significant role of functional groups|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2014/CP/c4cp00739e#!divAbstract|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=16|issue=20|doi=10.1039/C4CP00739E|issn=1463-9084|bibcode=2014PCCP...16.9643Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalysis ===
ZIF’s also have great potential as heterogeneous catalysts; ZIF-8 has been shown to act as good catalysts for the transesterification of vegetable oils, the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction between benzoyl chloride and anisole, and for the formation of carbonates. ZIF-8 nanoparticles can also be used to enhance the performance in the [[Knoevenagel condensation]] reaction between benzaldehyde and malononitrile.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guan|first=Yebin|last2=Shi|first2=Juanjuan|last3=Xia|first3=Ming|last4=Zhanga|first4=Jun|last5=Pang|first5=Zhenfeng|last6=Marchetti|first6=Alessandro|last7=Wang|first7=Xiaohong|last8=Cai|first8=Jingsong|last9=Kong|first9=Xueqian|display-authors=3|date=2017-11-30|title= Monodispersed ZIF-8 particles with enhanced performance for CO2 adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis |journal=Applied Surface Science|language=en|volume=423|issue=|pages= 349-353 |doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.06.183|issn=|bibcode=2017ApSS..423..349G}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZIF’s have also been shown to work well in oxidation and epoxidation reactions; ZIF-9 has been shown to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of tetralin and the oxidation of many other small molecules. It can also catalyze reactions to produce hydrogen at room temperature, specifically the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane and [[sodium|Na]][[borohydride|BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] hydrolysis.

=== Sensing and Electronic Devices ===
ZIF’s are also good candidates for chemical sensors because of their tunable adsorbance properties. ZIF-8 exhibits sensitivity when exposed to the vapor of ethanol and water mixtures, and this response is dependent on the concentration of ethanol in the mixture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Binling|last2=Yang|first2=Zhuxian|last3=Zhu|first3=Yanqiu|last4=Xia|first4=Yongde|date=2014-09-23|title=Zeolitic imidazolate framework materials: recent progress in synthesis and applications|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/ta/c4ta02984d#!divAbstract|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry A|language=en|volume=2|issue=40|doi=10.1039/C4TA02984D|issn=2050-7496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ZIF’s are attractive materials for matrices for biosensors, like electrochemical biosensors, for in-vivo electrochemical measurements. They also have potential applications as luminescent probes for the detection of metal ions and small molecules. ZIF-8 luminescence is highly sensitive to Cu2+, and Cd2+ ions as well as acetone. ZIF nanoparticles can also sense fluorescently tagged single stranded pieces of DNA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Drug Delivery ===
Because ZIF’s are porous, chemically stable, thermally stable, and tunable, they are potentially a platform for drug delivery and controlled drug release. ZIF-8 is very stable in water and aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions but decompose quickly in acidic solutions, indicating a pH sensitivity that could aid in the development of ZIF-based drug-release platforms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Comparing ZIFs with Other Compounds ==
{{Original research inline|date=May 2017}}

=== ZIFS vs MOFs ===

While ZIFs are a subset of the MOF hybrids that combine organic and metal frameworks to create hybrid microporous and crystalline structures, they are much more restricted in their structure. Similar to MOFs, most ZIF properties are largely dependent on the properties of the metal clusters, ligands, and synthesis conditions in which they were created.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basnayake|first=Sajani A.|last2=Su|first2=Jie|last3=Zou|first3=Xiadong|last4=Balkus|first4=Kenneth J.|date=2015-02-04|title=Carbonate-Based Zeolitic Imidazolate Frame for Highly Selective CO2 Capture|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic5027174|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|doi=10.1021/ic5027174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ZIF alterations up to this point have involved changing the linkers - bridging O2- anions and imizazolate-based ligands&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"/&gt; - or combining two types of linkers to change bond angles or pore size due to limitations in synthesizing methods and production.&lt;ref name=methane&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Nhung T. T.|last2=Lo|first2=Tien N. H.|last3=Kim|first3=Jaheon|date=2016-04-04|title=Mixed-Metal Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks and their Selective Capture of Wet Carbon Dioxide over Methane|url=http://globalscience.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/mm-zif-2016.pdf|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|language=en|volume=55|doi=10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00814}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of changing linkers included adding functional groups with various polarities and symmetries to the imidazolate ligands to alter the ZIFs carbon dioxide adsorption ability without changing the transitional-metal cations.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Sibo|last2=Wang|first2=Xinchen|title=Imidazolium Ionic Liquids, Imidazolylidene Heterocyclic Carbenes, and Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Photochemical Reduction|journal=Angewandte Chemie|date=2015-12-08|volume=55|issue=7|doi=10.1002/anie.201507145|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201507145/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this to MOFs, which have a much larger degree of variety in the types of their building units.

Despite these similarities with MOFs, ZIFs have significant properties that distinguish these structures as uniquely to be applied to carbon capture processes. Because ZIFs tend to resemble the crystalline framework of zeolites, their thermal and chemical stability are higher than those of other MOFs, allowing them to work at a wider range in temperatures, making them suitable to chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt;

Perhaps the most important difference is the ZIFs hydrophobic properties and water stability. A main issue with zeolites and MOFs, to a certain extent, was their adsorption of water along with CO2.[7] Water vapor is often found in carbon-rich exhaust gases, and MOFs would absorb the water, lowering the amount of CO2 required to reach saturation.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt; MOFs are also less stable in moist and oxygen rich environments due to metal-oxygen bonds performing hydrolysis. ZIFs, however, have nearly identical performances in dry and humid conditions, showing much higher CO2 selectivity over water, allowing the adsorbent to store more carbon before saturation is reached.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt;

=== ZIFs vs commercially available products ===

Even in comparison with other materials, the ZIFs most attractive quality is still its hydrophobic properties. When compared to ZIFs in dry conditions, activated carbon was nearly identical with its uptake capacity.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt; However, once the conditions were changed to wet, the activated carbon’s uptake was halved. When this saturation and regeneration tests were run at these conditions, ZIFs also showed minimal to no structural degradation, a good indication of the adsorbent’s re-usability.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt;

However, ZIFs tend to be expensive to synthesize. MOFs require synthesis methods with long reaction periods, high pressures, and high temperatures, which aren’t methods that are easy to scale-up.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt; ZIFs do tend to be more affordable than commercially available non-ZIF MOFs.

When combined with polymer-sorbent materials, research determined that hybrid polymer-ZIF sorbent membranes no longer following the upper bound of the Robeson plot, which is a plot of selectivity as a function of permeation for [[membrane gas separation]].&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"/&gt;
