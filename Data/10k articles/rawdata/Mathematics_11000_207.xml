The method is to calculate the NPV of the project as if it is all-equity financed (so called base case). Then the base-case NPV is adjusted for the benefits of financing. Usually, the main benefit is a [[tax shield]] resulted from tax deductibility of interest payments. Another benefit can be a subsidized borrowing at sub-market rates. The APV method is especially effective when a [[leveraged buyout]] case is considered since the company is loaded with an extreme amount of debt, so the tax shield is substantial.

Technically, an APV valuation model looks similar to a standard [[Discounted cash flow|DCF]] model. However, instead of [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]], cash flows would be discounted at the unlevered cost of equity, and [[tax shield]]s at either the [[cost of debt]] (Myers) or following later academics also with the unlevered cost of equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first=Fernández |last=Pablo |title=Levered and Unlevered Beta |url=http://www.iese.edu/research/pdfs/DI-0488-E.pdf |number=488 |institution=University of Navarra |date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; APV and the standard DCF approaches should give the identical result if the [[capital structure]] remains stable.

==APV formula==
APV = Unlevered NPV of Free Cash Flows and assumed Terminal Value + NPV of Interest Tax Shield and assumed Terminal Value

The discount rate used in the first part is the return on assets or return on equity if unlevered.
The discount rate used in the second part is the cost of debt financing by period.

In detail:

EBIT

- Taxes on EBIT

'''=Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)'''

+ Non cash items in EBIT

- Working Capital changes

- Capital Expenditures and Other Operating Investments

'''=Free Cash Flows'''

Take Present Value (PV) of FCFs discounted by Return on Assets % (also Return on Unlevered Equity %)

+ PV of terminal value

'''=Value of Unlevered Assets'''

+ Excess cash and other assets

'''=Value of Unlevered Firm (i.e., firm value without financing effects or benefit of interest tax shield)'''

+ Present Value of Debt's Periodic Interest Tax Shield discounted by Cost of Debt Financing %

'''=Value of Levered Firm'''

- Value of Debt

'''=Value of Levered Equity or APV'''

The value from the interest tax shield assumes the company is profitable enough to deduct the interest expense.  If not, adjust this part for when the interest can be deducted for tax purposes.

{{about|a particular kind of [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra over a commutative ring]]|other uses of the term "algebra"|Algebra (disambiguation)}}
In [[mathematics]], an '''associative algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with compatible operations of addition, multiplication (assumed to be [[associative property|associative]]), and a [[scalar multiplication]] by elements in some [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. The addition and multiplication operations together give ''A'' the structure of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]; the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give ''A'' the structure of a [[vector space]] over ''K''. In this article we will also use the term [[algebra over a field|''K''-algebra''']] to mean an associative algebra over the field ''K''. A standard first example of a ''K''-algebra is a ring of [[Square matrix|square matrices]] over a field ''K'', with the usual [[matrix multiplication]]. 

In this article associative algebras are assumed to have a multiplicative unit, denoted 1; they are sometimes called '''unital associative algebras''' for clarification. In some areas of mathematics this assumption is not made, and we will call such structures [[unital algebra|non-unital]] associative algebras. We will also assume that all rings are unital, and all ring homomorphisms are unital.

Many authors consider the more general concept of an associative algebra over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', instead of a field: An '''''R''-algebra''' is an [[Module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] with an associative ''R''-bilinear binary operation, which also contains a multiplicative identity. For examples of this concept, if ''S'' is any ring with [[center (ring theory)|center]] ''C'', then ''S'' is an associative ''C''-algebra.

{{Algebraic structures |Algebra}}

== Definition ==

Let ''R'' be a fixed [[commutative ring]] (so ''R'' could be a field). An '''associative ''R''-algebra''' (or more simply, an '''''R''-algebra''') is an additive [[abelian group]] ''A'' which has the structure of both a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and an [[module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] in such a way that the [[scalar multiplication]] satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;r\cdot(xy) = (r\cdot x)y = x(r\cdot y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''r'' ∈ ''R'' and ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''A''. Furthermore, ''A'' is assumed to be unital, which is to say it contains an element 1 such that
:&lt;math&gt;1 x = x = x 1 &lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' ∈ ''A''. Note that such an element 1 must be unique.

In other words, ''A'' is an ''R''-module together with (1) an [[bilinear map|''R''-bilinear map]] ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' → ''A'', called the multiplication, and (2) the multiplicative identity, such that the multiplication is associative:
:&lt;math&gt;x(yz) = (xy)z\,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''A''. (Technical note: the multiplicative identity is a datum,&lt;ref&gt;Put in another way, there is the forgetful functor from the category of unital associative algebras to the category of possibly non-unital associative algebras.&lt;/ref&gt; while associativity is a property. By the uniqueness of the multiplicative identity, "unitarity" is often treated like a property.) If one drops the requirement for the associativity, then one obtains a [[non-associative algebra]].

If ''A'' itself is commutative (as a ring) then it is called a '''commutative ''R''-algebra'''.

=== As a monoid object in the category of modules ===
The definition is equivalent to saying that a unital associative ''R''-algebra is a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid object]] in [[category of modules|'''''R''-Mod''']] (the [[monoidal category]] of ''R''-modules). By definition, a ring is a monoid object in the [[category of abelian groups]]; thus, the notion of an associative algebra is obtained by replacing the category of abelian groups with the [[category of modules]].

Pushing this idea further, some authors have introduced a "generalized ring" as a monoid object in some other category that behaves like the category of modules. Indeed, this reinterpretation allows one to avoid making an explicit reference to elements of an algebra ''A''. For example, the associativity can be expressed as follows. By the universal property of a [[tensor product of modules]], the multiplication (the ''R''-bilinear map) corresponds to a unique ''R''-linear map
:&lt;math&gt;m: A \otimes_R A \to A&lt;/math&gt;.
The associativity then refers to the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;m \circ (\operatorname {id} \otimes m) = m \circ (m \otimes \operatorname {id}).&lt;/math&gt;

===From ring homomorphisms===
An associative algebra amounts to a [[ring homomorphism]] whose image lies in the [[center of a ring|center]]. Indeed, starting with a ring ''A'' and a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\eta\colon R \to A&lt;/math&gt; whose image lies in the [[center (ring theory)|center]] of ''A'', we can make ''A'' an ''R''-algebra by defining
:&lt;math&gt;r\cdot x = \eta(r)x&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''r'' ∈ ''R'' and ''x'' ∈ ''A''. If ''A'' is an ''R''-algebra, taking ''x'' = 1, the same formula in turn defines a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\eta\colon R \to A&lt;/math&gt; whose image lies in the center.

If ''A'' is commutative then the center of ''A'' is equal to ''A'', so that a commutative ''R''-algebra can be defined simply as a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\eta\colon R \to A&lt;/math&gt; of commutative rings.

The ring homomorphism η appearing in the above is often called a [[structure map]]. In the commutative case, one can consider the category whose objects are ring homomorphisms ''R'' → ''A''; i.e., commutative ''R''-algebras and whose morphisms are ring homomorphisms ''A'' → ''A{{'}}'' that are under ''R''; i.e., ''R'' → ''A'' → ''A{{'}}'' is ''R'' → ''A{{'}}'' (i.e., the [[coslice category]] of the category of commutative rings under ''R''.)  The [[prime spectrum]] functor Spec then determines an anti-equivalence of this category to the category of [[affine scheme]]s over Spec ''R''.

How to weaken the commutativity assumption is a subject matter of [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] and, more recently, of [[derived algebraic geometry]]. See also: [[generic matrix ring]].

==Algebra homomorphisms==
{{main|algebra homomorphism}}
A [[homomorphism]] between two ''R''-algebras is an [[module homomorphism|''R''-linear]] [[ring homomorphism]]. Explicitly, &lt;math&gt;\varphi : A_1 \to A_2&lt;/math&gt; is an '''associative algebra homomorphism''' if
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(r\cdot x) = r\cdot \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x+y) = \varphi(x)+\varphi(y)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(1) = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

The class of all ''R''-algebras together with algebra homomorphisms between them form a [[category (mathematics)|category]], sometimes denoted '''''R''-Alg'''.

The [[subcategory]] of commutative ''R''-algebras can be characterized as the [[coslice category]] ''R''/'''CRing''' where '''CRing''' is the [[category of commutative rings]].

==Examples==
The most basic example is a ring itself; it is an algebra over its center or any subring lying in the center. In particular, any commutative ring is an algebra over any of its subrings. Other examples abound both from algebra and other fields of mathematics.

'''Algebra'''
*Any ring ''A'' can be considered as a '''Z'''-algebra. The unique ring homomorphism from '''Z''' to ''A'' is determined by the fact that it must send 1 to the identity in A. Therefore, rings and '''Z'''-algebras are equivalent concepts, in the same way that [[abelian group]]s and '''Z'''-modules are equivalent. 
*Any ring of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''n'' is a ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')-algebra in the same way.
*Given an ''R''-module ''M'', the [[endomorphism ring]] of ''M'', denoted End&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is an ''R''-algebra by defining (''r''·φ)(''x'') = ''r''·φ(''x'').
*Any ring of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with coefficients in a commutative ring ''R'' forms an ''R''-algebra under matrix addition and multiplication. This coincides with the previous example when ''M'' is a finitely-generated, [[free module|free]] ''R''-module.
* The square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from the field ''K'' form an associative algebra over ''K''. In particular, the [[2 &amp;times; 2 real matrices]] form an associative algebra useful in plane mapping.
* The [[complex number]]s form a 2-dimensional associative algebra over the [[real number]]s.
* The [[quaternion]]s form a 4-dimensional associative algebra over the reals (but not an algebra over the complex numbers, since the complex numbers are not in the center of the quaternions).
* The [[polynomial]]s with real coefficients form an associative algebra over the reals.
* Every [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] is a commutative ''R''-algebra. In fact, this is the free commutative ''R''-algebra on the set {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}.
* The [[free algebra|free ''R''-algebra]] on a set ''E'' is an algebra of polynomials with coefficients in ''R'' and noncommuting indeterminates taken from the set ''E''.
* The [[tensor algebra]] of an ''R''-module is naturally an ''R''-algebra. The same is true for quotients such as the [[exterior algebra|exterior]] and [[symmetric algebra]]s. Categorically speaking, the [[functor]] which maps an ''R''-module to its tensor algebra is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ''R''-module (forgetting the ring structure).
*The following ring is used in the theory of [[λ-ring]]s. Given a commutative ring ''A'', let &lt;math&gt;G(A) = 1 + tA[\![t]\!]&lt;/math&gt;, the set of formal power series with constant term 1. It is an abelian group with the group operation that is the multiplication of power series. It is then a ring with the mutliplication, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;(1 + at) \circ (1 + bt) = 1 + abt&lt;/math&gt;, determined by this condition and the ring axioms. The additive identity is 1 and the multiplicative identity is &lt;math&gt;1 + t&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a canonical structure of a &lt;math&gt;G(A)&lt;/math&gt;-algebra given by the ring homomorphism
*:&lt;math&gt;G(A) \to A, \, 1 + \sum_{i &gt; 0} a_i t^i \mapsto a_1&lt;/math&gt;.
:On the other hand, if ''A'' is a λ-ring, then there is a ring homomorphism
::&lt;math&gt;A \to G(A), \, a \mapsto 1 + \sum_{i &gt; 0} \lambda^i(a)t^i&lt;/math&gt;,
:giving &lt;math&gt;G(A)&lt;/math&gt; a structure of an ''A''-algebra.

'''Representation theory'''
* The [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra is an associative algebra that can be used to study the given Lie algebra.
* If ''G'' is a group and ''R'' is a commutative ring, the set of all functions from ''G'' to ''R'' with finite support form an ''R''-algebra with the convolution as multiplication. It is called the [[group algebra]] of ''G''. The construction is the starting point for the application to the study of (discrete) groups.
* If ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] (e.g., semisimple [[complex Lie group]]), then the [[coordinate ring]] of ''G'' is the [[Hopf algebra]] ''A'' corresponding to ''G''. Many structures of ''G'' translate to those of ''A''.

'''Analysis'''
* Given any [[Banach space]] ''X'', the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[linear operator]]s ''A'' : ''X'' → ''X'' form an associative algebra (using composition of operators as multiplication); this is a [[Banach algebra]].
* Given any [[topology|topological space]] ''X'', the continuous real- or complex-valued functions on ''X'' form a real or complex associative algebra; here the functions are added and multiplied pointwise.
* The set of [[semimartingale]]s defined on the [[filtration (mathematics)#Measure theory|filtered probability space]] (&amp;Omega;,''F'',(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0&lt;/sub&gt;,P) forms a ring under [[stochastic calculus|stochastic integration]].
* The [[Weyl algebra]]
* An [[Azumaya algebra]]

'''Geometry and combinatorics'''
* The [[Clifford algebra]]s, which are useful in [[geometry]] and [[physics]].
* [[Incidence algebra]]s of locally finite [[partially ordered set]]s are associative algebras considered in [[combinatorics]].

==Constructions==
;Subalgebras: A subalgebra of an ''R''-algebra ''A'' is a subset of ''A'' which is both a [[subring]] and a [[submodule]] of ''A''. That is, it must be closed under addition, ring multiplication, scalar multiplication, and it must contain the identity element of ''A''.
;Quotient algebras: Let ''A'' be an ''R''-algebra. Any ring-theoretic [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I'' in ''A'' is automatically an ''R''-module since ''r''·''x'' = (''r''1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)''x''. This gives the [[quotient ring]] ''A''/''I'' the structure of an ''R''-module and, in fact, an ''R''-algebra. It follows that any ring homomorphic image of ''A'' is also an ''R''-algebra.
;Direct products: The direct product of a family of ''R''-algebras is the ring-theoretic direct product. This becomes an ''R''-algebra with the obvious scalar multiplication.
;Free products: One can form a [[free product of associative algebras|free product]] of ''R''-algebras in a manner similar to the free product of groups. The free product is the [[coproduct]] in the category of ''R''-algebras.
;Tensor products: The tensor product of two ''R''-algebras is also an ''R''-algebra in a natural way. See [[tensor product of algebras]] for more details. Given a commutative ring ''R'' and any ring ''A'' the [[tensor product of rings|tensor product]] ''R''⊗&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' can be given the structure of an ''R''-algebra by defining ''r''·(''s''⊗''a'') = (''rs''⊗''a''). The functor which sends ''A'' to ''R''⊗&lt;sub&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' is [[left adjoint]] to the functor which sends an ''R''-algebra to its underlying ring (forgetting the module structure). See also: [[change of rings]].

==Coalgebras==
{{Main|Coalgebra}}
An associative algebra over ''K'' is given by a ''K''-vector space ''A'' endowed with a bilinear map ''A''&amp;times;''A''→''A'' having 2 inputs (multiplicator and multiplicand) and one output (product), as well as a morphism ''K''→''A'' identifying the scalar multiples of the multiplicative identity. If the bilinear map ''A''&amp;times;''A''→''A'' is reinterpreted as a linear map (i. e., [[morphism]] in the category of ''K''-vector spaces) ''A''&amp;otimes;''A''→''A'' (by the [[Tensor product#Characterization by a universal property|universal property of the tensor product]]), then we can view an associative algebra over ''K'' as a ''K''-vector space ''A'' endowed with two morphisms (one of the form ''A''&amp;otimes;''A''→''A'' and one of the form ''K''→''A'') satisfying certain conditions which boil down to the algebra axioms. These two morphisms can be dualized using [[categorial duality]] by reversing all arrows in the [[commutative diagram]]s which describe the algebra [[axiom]]s; this defines the structure of a [[coalgebra]].

There is also an abstract notion of [[F-coalgebra]], where ''F'' is a [[functor]]. This is vaguely related to the notion of coalgebra discussed above.

==Representations==
{{main|Algebra representation}}
A [[representation theory|representation]] of an algebra ''A'' is an algebra homomorphism ρ: ''A'' → End(''V'') from ''A'' to the endomorphism algebra of some vector space (or module) ''V''. The property of ρ being an algebra homomorphism means that ρ preserves the multiplicative operation (that is, ρ(''xy'')=ρ(''x'')ρ(''y'') for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''), and that ρ sends the unity of ''A'' to the unity of End(''V'') (that is, to the identity endomorphism of ''V'').

If ''A'' and ''B'' are two algebras, and ρ: ''A'' → End(''V'') and &amp;tau;: ''B'' → End(''W'') are two representations, then there is a (canonical) representation ''A &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; B'' → End(''V &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; W'') of the tensor product algebra ''A &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; B'' on the vector space ''V &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; W''. However, there is no natural way of defining a [[tensor product]] of two representations of a single associative algebra in such a way that the result is still a representation of that same algebra (not of its tensor product with itself), without somehow imposing additional conditions. Here, by ''[[tensor product of representations]]'',  the usual meaning is intended: the result should be a linear representation of the same algebra on the product vector space. Imposing such additional structure typically leads to the idea of a [[Hopf algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]], as demonstrated below.

===Motivation for a Hopf algebra===
Consider, for example, two representations &lt;math&gt;\sigma:A\rightarrow \mathrm{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau:A\rightarrow \mathrm{End}(W)&lt;/math&gt;.  One might try to form a tensor product representation &lt;math&gt;\rho: x \mapsto \sigma(x) \otimes \tau(x)&lt;/math&gt; according to how it acts on the product vector space, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x)(v \otimes w) = (\sigma(x)(v)) \otimes (\tau(x)(w)).&lt;/math&gt;

However, such a map would not be linear, since one would have

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(kx) = \sigma(kx) \otimes \tau(kx) = k\sigma(x) \otimes k\tau(x) = k^2 (\sigma(x) \otimes \tau(x)) = k^2 \rho(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' ∈ ''K''. One can rescue this attempt and restore linearity by imposing additional structure, by defining an algebra homomorphism Δ: ''A'' → ''A'' &amp;otimes; ''A'', and defining the tensor product representation as

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = (\sigma\otimes \tau) \circ \Delta.&lt;/math&gt;

Such a homomorphism Δ is called a [[comultiplication]] if it satisfies certain axioms.  The resulting structure is called a [[bialgebra]].  To be consistent with the definitions of the associative algebra, the coalgebra must be co-associative, and, if the algebra is unital, then the co-algebra must be co-unital as well. A [[Hopf algebra]] is a bialgebra with an additional piece of structure (the so-called antipode), which allows not only to define the tensor product of two representations, but also the Hom module of two representations (again, similarly to how it is done in the representation theory of groups).

===Motivation for a Lie algebra===
{{See also|Lie algebra representation}}
One can try to be more clever in defining a tensor product. Consider, for example,

:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \rho (x) = \sigma(x) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x)&lt;/math&gt;

so that the action on the tensor product space is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x) (v \otimes w) = (\sigma(x) v)\otimes w + v \otimes (\tau(x) w) &lt;/math&gt;.

This map is clearly linear in ''x'', and so it does not have the problem of the earlier definition.  However, it fails to preserve multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(xy) = \sigma(x) \sigma(y) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x) \tau(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

But, in general, this does not equal

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x)\rho(y) = \sigma(x) \sigma(y) \otimes \mbox{Id}_W + \sigma(x) \otimes \tau(y) + \sigma(y) \otimes \tau(x) + \mbox{Id}_V \otimes \tau(x) \tau(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

This shows that this definition of a tensor product is too naive; the obvious fix is to define it such that it is antisymmetric, so that the middle two terms cancel. This leads to the concept of a [[Lie algebra]].

==Non-unital algebras==

Some authors use the term "associative algebra" to refer to structures which do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity, and hence consider homomorphisms which are not necessarily unital. 

An example of a non-unital associative algebra is given by the set of all functions ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' whose [[limit of a function|limit]] as ''x'' nears infinity is zero.

In [[computer science]], a '''bridging model''' is an abstract model of a [[computer]] which provides a [[conceptual bridge]] between the physical implementation of the machine and the abstraction available to a [[programmer]] of that machine; in other words, it is intended to provide a common level of understanding between [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] engineers.

A successful bridging model is one which can be efficiently implemented in reality and efficiently targeted by programmers; in particular, it should be possible for a [[compiler]] to produce good code from a typical high-level language. The term was introduced by [[Leslie Valiant]]'s 1990 paper ''A Bridging Model for Parallel Computation'', which argued that the strength of the [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann model]] was largely responsible for the success of computing as a whole.&lt;ref name="CACM_Valiant"&gt;Leslie G. Valiant, A bridging model for parallel computation, Communications of the ACM, Volume 33 Issue 8, Aug. 1990 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=79173.79181]&lt;/ref&gt; The paper goes on to develop the [[bulk synchronous parallel]] model as an analogous model for [[parallel computing]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''coincidence point''' (or simply '''coincidence''') of two [[function (mathematics)|mappings]] is a point in their common [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] having the same image.

Formally, given two mappings
:&lt;math&gt;f,g \colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
we say that a point ''x'' in ''X'' is a ''coincidence point'' of ''f'' and ''g'' if ''f''(''x'') = ''g''(''x'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Coincidence theory (the study of coincidence points) is, in most settings, a generalization of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] theory, the study of points ''x'' with ''f''(''x'') = ''x''. Fixed point theory is the special case obtained from the above by letting ''X = Y'' and taking ''g'' to be the [[identity mapping]].

Just as fixed point theory has its [[fixed-point theorem]]s, there are [[theorem]]s that guarantee the existence of coincidence points for pairs of mappings. Notable among them, in the setting of [[manifold]]s, is the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem|Lefschetz coincidence theorem]], which is typically known only in its special case formulation for fixed points.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[topology]], a mathematical discipline, '''combining dimensions''' into a [[manifold]] consists of taking ''n'' dimensions and visualizing them in a smaller ''m'' dimension. Similar concepts apply when studying [[spacetime]] and [[Calabi–Yau manifolds]]. For example, in [[string theory]], six dimensions are combined into a two dimensional manifold for simple visualization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5595">In the mathematical area of [[order theory]], a '''completely distributive lattice''' is a [[complete lattice]] in which arbitrary [[join (lattice theory)|join]]s [[distributivity (order theory)|distribute]] over arbitrary [[meet (lattice theory)|meet]]s.

Formally, a complete lattice ''L'' is said to be '''completely distributive''' if, for any doubly indexed family 
{''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''j'' in ''J'', ''k'' in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;} of ''L'', we have
: &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge_{j\in J}\bigvee_{k\in K_j} x_{j,k} = 
         \bigvee_{f\in F}\bigwedge_{j\in J} x_{j,f(j)}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F'' is the set of [[choice function]]s ''f'' choosing for each index ''j'' of ''J'' some index ''f''(''j'') in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="DaveyPriestley"&gt;B. A. Davey and H. A. Priestey, ''Introduction to Lattices and Order'' 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-78451-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete distributivity is a self-dual property, i.e. [[Duality (order theory)|dualizing]] the above statement yields the same class of complete lattices.&lt;ref name="DaveyPriestley"/&gt;

Without the axiom of choice, no complete lattice with more than one element can ever satisfy the above property, as one can just let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; equal the top element of ''L'' for all indices ''j'' and ''k'' with all of the sets ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; being nonempty but having no choice function.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Alternative characterizations==

Various different characterizations exist. For example, the following is an equivalent law that avoids the use of choice functions{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. For any set ''S'' of sets, we define the set ''S''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; to be the set of all subsets ''X'' of the complete lattice that have non-empty intersection with all members of ''S''. We then can define complete distributivity via the statement

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\bigwedge \{ \bigvee Y \mid Y\in S\} = \bigvee\{ \bigwedge Z \mid Z\in S^\# \}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The operator ( )&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; might be called the '''crosscut operator'''. This version of complete distributivity only implies the original notion when admitting the [[Axiom of Choice]].

&lt;!-- This isn't valid. See talk.
However, the latter version is always equivalent to the statement:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\bigwedge \{ \bigvee Y \mid Y\in S\} = \bigvee\bigcap S\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for all sets ''S'' of subsets of a complete lattice.
--&gt;

==Properties==
In addition, it is known that the following statements are equivalent for any complete lattice ''L'':&lt;ref name="Raney53"&gt;G. N. Raney, ''A subdirect-union representation for completely distributive complete lattices'', Proceedings of the [[American Mathematical Society]], 4: 518 - 522, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''L'' is completely distributive.
* ''L'' can be embedded into a direct product of chains [0,1] by an [[order embedding]] that preserves arbitrary meets and joins.
* Both ''L'' and its dual order ''L''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; are [[continuous poset]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Direct products of [0,1], i.e. sets of all functions from some set ''X'' to [0,1] ordered [[pointwise order|pointwise]], are also called ''cubes''.

==Free completely distributive lattices==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Completely distributive lattice]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
Every [[partially ordered set|poset]] ''C'' can be [[Complete lattice#Completion|completed]] in a completely distributive lattice.

A completely distributive lattice ''L'' is called the '''free completely distributive lattice over a poset ''C''''' if and only if there is an [[order embedding]] &lt;math&gt;\phi:C\rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; such that for every completely distributive lattice ''M'' and [[monotonic function]] &lt;math&gt;f:C\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique [[Complete lattice#Morphisms of complete lattices|complete homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f^*_\phi:L\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;f=f^*_\phi\circ\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For every poset ''C'', the free completely distributive lattice over a poset ''C'' exists and is unique up to isomorphism.&lt;ref name="Morris04"&gt;Joseph M. Morris, ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/nfqh0l29f3unrlwh Augmenting Types with Unbounded Demonic and Angelic Nondeterminacy]'', Mathematics of Program Construction, LNCS 3125, 274-288, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an instance of the concept of [[free object]]. Since a set ''X'' can be considered as a poset with the discrete order, the above result guarantees the existence of the free completely distributive lattice over the set ''X''.

==Examples==
* The [[unit interval]] [0,1], ordered in the natural way, is a completely distributive lattice.&lt;ref name="Raney52"&gt;G. N. Raney, ''Completely distributive complete lattices'', Proceedings of the [[American Mathematical Society]], 3: 677 - 680, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;
**More generally, any [[Total order#Completeness|complete chain]] is a completely distributive lattice.&lt;ref name="hopenwasser90"&gt;Alan Hopenwasser, ''Complete Distributivity'', Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics, 51(1), 285 - 305, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[power set]] lattice &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{P}(X),\subseteq)&lt;/math&gt; for any set ''X'' is a completely distributive lattice.&lt;ref name="DaveyPriestley"/&gt;
* For every poset ''C'', there is a ''free completely distributive lattice over C''.&lt;ref name="Morris04"/&gt; See the section on [[Completely distributive lattice#Free completely distributive lattices|Free completely distributive lattices]] above.

In [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical optimization]], the '''convex conjugate''' of a function is a generalization of the [[Legendre transformation]] which applies to non-convex functions. It is also known as '''Legendre–Fenchel transformation''' or '''Fenchel transformation''' (after [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] and [[Werner Fenchel]]).  It is used to transform an optimization problem into its corresponding [[Duality (optimization)|dual problem]], which can often be simpler to solve.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[real number|real]] [[topological vector space]], and let &lt;math&gt;X^{*}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[dual space]] to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Denote the [[dual pair]]ing by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle : X^{*} \times X \to \mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a function

:&lt;math&gt;f : X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{ - \infty, + \infty \}&lt;/math&gt;

taking values on the [[extended real number line]], the '''convex conjugate'''

:&lt;math&gt;f^{*} : X^{*} \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{ - \infty, + \infty \}&lt;/math&gt;

is defined in terms of the [[supremum]] by

:&lt;math&gt;f^{{*}} \left( x^{*} \right) := \sup \left \{ \left. \left\langle x^{*} , x \right\rangle - f \left( x \right) \right| x \in X \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, in terms of the [[infimum]] by

:&lt;math&gt;f^{{*}} \left( x^{*} \right) := - \inf \left \{ \left. f \left( x \right) - \left\langle x^{*} , x \right\rangle \right| x \in X \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This definition can be interpreted as an encoding of the [[convex hull]] of the function's [[Epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] in terms of its [[supporting hyperplane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maze5.net/?page_id=733 |title=Legendre Transform |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The convex conjugate of an [[affine function]]
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \left\langle a,x \right\rangle - b,\,
a \in \mathbb{R}^n, b \in \mathbb{R}
&lt;/math&gt;
is
:&lt;math&gt;
f^{*}\left(x^{*} \right)
= \begin{cases} b,      &amp; x^{*}   =  a
             \\ +\infty, &amp; x^{*}  \ne a.
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The convex conjugate of a [[power function]]
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \frac{1}{p}|x|^p,\,1&lt;p&lt;\infty
&lt;/math&gt;
is
:&lt;math&gt;
f^{*}\left(x^{*} \right)
= \frac{1}{q}|x^{*}|^q,\,1&lt;q&lt;\infty
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{p} + \tfrac{1}{q} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The convex conjugate of the [[absolute value]] function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left| x \right|&lt;/math&gt;
is
:&lt;math&gt;
f^{*}\left(x^{*} \right)
= \begin{cases} 0,      &amp; \left|x^{*} \right| \le 1
             \\ \infty, &amp; \left|x^{*} \right|  &gt;  1.
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The convex conjugate of the [[exponential function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\,\! e^x&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
f^{*}\left(x^{*} \right)
= \begin{cases} x^{*} \ln x^{*} - x^{*}      , &amp; x^{*}  &gt; 0
             \\ 0                            , &amp; x^{*}  = 0
             \\ \infty                       , &amp; x^{*}  &lt; 0.
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
Convex conjugate and Legendre transform of the exponential function agree except that the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the convex conjugate is strictly larger as the Legendre transform is only defined for positive real numbers.

===Connection with expected shortfall (average value at risk)===
Let ''F'' denote a [[cumulative distribution function]] of a [[random variable]]&amp;nbsp;''X''. Then (integrating by parts),

:&lt;math&gt;f(x):= \int_{-\infty}^x F(u)\,du = \operatorname{E}\left[\max(0,x-X)\right] = x-\operatorname{E} \left[\min(x,X)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
has the convex conjugate

:&lt;math&gt;
f^{*}(p)=\int_0^p F^{-1}(q) \, dq = (p-1)F^{-1}(p)+\operatorname{E}\left[\min(F^{-1}(p),X)\right] 
 = p F^{-1}(p)-\operatorname{E}\left[\max(0,F^{-1}(p)-X)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

=== Ordering ===
A particular interpretation has the transform

:&lt;math&gt;f^\text{inc}(x):= \arg \sup_t \,t\cdot x-\int_0^1 \max\{t-f(u),0\} \, \mathrm d u,&lt;/math&gt;

as this is a nondecreasing rearrangement of the initial function f; in particular, &lt;math&gt;f^\text{inc}= f&lt;/math&gt; for ''&amp;fnof;'' nondecreasing.

== Properties ==
The convex conjugate of a [[closed convex function]] is again a closed convex function. The convex conjugate of a [[polyhedral convex function]] (a convex function with [[Polyhedron|polyhedral]] [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]]) is again a polyhedral convex function.

=== Order reversing===

Convex-conjugation is [[Order theory|order-reversing]]: if &lt;math&gt;f \le g&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f^* \ge g^*&lt;/math&gt;. Here
: &lt;math&gt; (f \le g ) :\iff (\forall x, f(x) \le g(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

For a family of functions &lt;math&gt;\left(f_\alpha\right)_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; it follows from the fact that supremums may be interchanged that
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\inf_\alpha f_\alpha\right)^*(x^*)= \sup_\alpha f_\alpha^*(x^*),&lt;/math&gt;

and from the [[max–min inequality]] that 
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\sup_\alpha f_\alpha\right)^*(x^*)\le \inf_\alpha f_\alpha^*(x^*).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Biconjugate ===
The convex conjugate of a function is always [[lower semi-continuous]]. The '''biconjugate''' &lt;math&gt;f^{**}&lt;/math&gt; (the convex conjugate of the convex conjugate) is also the [[closed convex hull]], i.e. the largest [[lower semi-continuous]] convex function with &lt;math&gt;f^{**}\le f&lt;/math&gt;. 
For [[Proper convex function|proper functions]] ''f'', 
:&lt;math&gt; f = f^{**} &lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] ''f'' is convex and lower semi-continuous by [[Fenchel–Moreau theorem]].

=== Fenchel's inequality ===
For any function {{mvar|f}}  and its convex conjugate {{math|''f'' *}}, '''Fenchel's inequality''' (also known as the '''Fenchel–Young inequality''') holds for every {{math|''x'' ∈  ''X''}}  and {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X'' *}} :

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle p,x \right\rangle \le f(x) + f^*(p).
&lt;/math&gt;
The proof follows immediately from the definition of convex conjugate: &lt;math&gt;f^*(p) = \sup_{\tilde x} \{ \langle p,\tilde x \rangle - f(\tilde x) \} \ge \langle p,x \rangle - f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- The following lines were taken from [[Legendre transformation]].

===Scaling properties===
Convex conjugation has the following scaling properties:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = a \cdot g(x)
\Rightarrow
f^*(p) = a \cdot g^*\left(\frac{p}{a}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = g(a \cdot x)
\Rightarrow
f^*(p) = g^*\left(\frac{p}{a}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that if a function is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree ''r'']] then its image under the Legendre transformation is a homogeneous function of degree ''s'', where 1/''r'' + 1/''s'' = 1.

===Behavior under translation===

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = g(x) + b
\Rightarrow
f^*(p) = g^*(p) - b
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = g(x + y)
\Rightarrow
f^*(p) = g^*(p) - p \cdot y
&lt;/math&gt;

===Behavior under inversion===
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = g^{-1}(x)
\Rightarrow
f^*(p) = - p \cdot g^*\left(\frac{1}{p}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

===Convexity===
For two functions &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt; and a number &lt;math&gt;0\le \lambda\le 1&lt;/math&gt; the convexity relation 
:&lt;math&gt;\left((1-\lambda)f_0+\lambda f_1\right)^{*}\le (1-\lambda)f_0^{*}+ \lambda f_1^{*}&lt;/math&gt;
holds. The &lt;math&gt;{*}&lt;/math&gt; operation is a convex mapping itself.

===Infimal convolution===
The '''infimal convolution''' (or epi-sum) of two functions ''f'' and ''g'' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \left(f \Box  g\right)(x) = \inf \left \{ f(x-y) + g(y) \, | \, y \in \mathbb{R}^n \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; be proper, convex and [[Semi-continuity|lsc]] functions on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the infimal convolution is convex and lsc (but not necessarily proper),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Phelps |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert R. Phelps |title=Convex Functions, Monotone Operators and Differentiability| edition=2 |year=1991|publisher=Springer |isbn= 0-387-56715-1|page= 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \left( f_1 \Box \cdots \Box f_m \right)^{*} = f_1^{*} + \cdots + f_m^{*}. &lt;/math&gt;

The infimal convolution of two functions has a geometric interpretation:  The (strict) [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] of the infimal convolution of two functions is the [[Minkowski sum]] of the (strict) epigraphs of those functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1137/070687542 |title=The Proximal Average: Basic Theory |year=2008 |last1=Bauschke |first1=Heinz H. |last2=Goebel |first2=Rafal |last3=Lucet |first3=Yves |last4=Wang |first4=Xianfu |journal=SIAM Journal on Optimization |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=766|citeseerx=10.1.1.546.4270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximizing argument===
If the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable, then its derivative is the maximizing argument in the computation of the convex conjugate:
:&lt;math&gt;f^\prime(x) = x^*(x):= \arg\sup_{x^{*}} {\langle x, x^{*}\rangle} -f^{*}(x^{*})&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;f^{{*}\prime}(x^{*}) = x(x^{*}):= \arg\sup_x {\langle x, x^{*}\rangle}-f(x);&lt;/math&gt;

whence
:&lt;math&gt;x= \nabla f^{{*}}(\nabla f(x)),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^{*}= \nabla f(\nabla f^{{*}}(x^{*})),&lt;/math&gt;

and moreover
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(x) \cdot f^{{*}\prime\prime} (x^{*}(x))=1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^{{*}\prime\prime}(x^{*})\cdot f^{\prime\prime}(x(x^{*}))=1.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scaling properties===
If, for some &lt;math&gt;\gamma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\,g(x)=\alpha+ \beta x +\gamma \cdot f(\lambda x+\delta)&lt;/math&gt;, then 
:&lt;math&gt;g^{*}(x^{*})= -\alpha- \delta\frac{x^{*}-\beta}\lambda +\gamma \cdot f^{*} \left(\frac {x^{*}-\beta}{\lambda \gamma}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
In case of an additional parameter (α, say) moreover{{Clarify|date=June 2017}}
:&lt;math&gt;f_\alpha(x)=-f_\alpha(\tilde x),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tilde x&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the maximizing argument.

===Behavior under linear transformations===
Let ''A'' be a [[bounded linear operator]] from ''X'' to ''Y''. For any convex function ''f'' on ''X'', one has

:&lt;math&gt; \left(A f\right)^{*} = f^{*} A^{*} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; (A f)(y) = \inf\{ f(x) : x \in X , A x = y \} &lt;/math&gt;

is the preimage of ''f'' w.r.t. ''A'' and ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[adjoint operator]] of ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;Ioffe, A.D. and Tichomirov, V.M. (1979), ''Theorie der Extremalaufgaben''. [[Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften]]. Satz 3.4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

A closed convex function ''f'' is symmetric with respect to a given set ''G'' of [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal linear transformation]]s,

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(A x\right) = f(x), \; \forall x, \; \forall A \in G &lt;/math&gt;

if and only if its convex conjugate ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is symmetric with respect to ''G''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">In [[psychometrics]], '''criterion''' or '''concrete validity''' is the extent to which a measure is related to an outcome. Criterion validity is often divided into concurrent and predictive validity. [[Concurrent validity]] refers to a comparison between the measure in question and an outcome assessed at the same time. In ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing|Standards for Educational &amp; Psychological Tests]]'', it states, "concurrent validity reflects only the status quo at a particular time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Predictive validity]], on the other hand, compares the measure in question with an outcome assessed at a later time. Although concurrent and predictive validity are similar, it is cautioned to keep the terms and findings separated. "Concurrent validity should not be used as a substitute for predictive validity without an appropriate supporting rationale."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;American Psychological Association, Inc. (1974). "Standards for educational &amp; psychological tests" Washington D. C.: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of concurrent validity is a comparison of the scores of the [[CLEP]] College Algebra exam with course grades in college algebra to determine the degree to which scores on the CLEP are related to performance in a college algebra class.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Validity Evidence – Research – The College Board|url = http://research.collegeboard.org/services/aces/validity/handbook/evidence|website = research.collegeboard.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of predictive validity is a comparison of scores on the [[SAT]] with first semester [[grade point average]] (GPA) in college; this assesses the degree to which SAT scores are predictive of college performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">[[File:CrossCapTwoViews.PNG|thumb|360px|Two views of P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a cross-cap]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''cross-cap''' is a two-dimensional surface in 3-space that is one-sided and the continuous image of a [[Möbius strip]] that intersects itself in an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]. In the domain, the inverse image of this interval is a longer interval that the mapping into 3-space "folds in half". At the point where the longer interval is folded in half in the image, the nearby configuration is that of the [[Whitney umbrella]].  

The interval of self intersection precludes the cross-cap from being [[homeomorphic]] to the [[Möbius strip]], but there are only two points in the image (the endpoints of the interval of self-intersection) where the image cannot be that of an immersion. The bounding edge of a cross-cap is a simple closed loop. Like certain versions of the Möbius strip, it may take the form of a symmetrical [[circle]].

A cross-cap that has been closed up by gluing a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] to its boundary is a model of the [[real projective plane]] P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (again with an interval of self-intersection, and two points where this model is not an immersion of P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Two cross-caps glued together at their boundaries form a model of the [[Klein bottle]], this time with two intervals of self-intersection and four points where this model is not an immersion.

An important theorem of [[topology]], the [[classification theorem for surfaces]], states that each [[two-dimensional]] compact [[manifold]] without boundary is homeomorphic to a sphere with some number (possibly 0) of "handles" and 0, 1, or 2 cross-caps.

&lt;/ref&gt; but has since fallen into disuse.

==Beginnings==

In 1958, Forrester unwittingly instigated DYNAMO's development when he asked an MIT staff programmer to compute needed solutions to some equations, for a [[Harvard Business Review]] paper he was writing about industrial dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | author = Forrester, J.W.
  | title = Industrial Dynamics
  | publisher = [[MIT Press]]
  | location = Cambridge MA
  | year = 1961
  | isbn = 1-883823-36-6 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/papers/D-4165-1.pdf "The Beginning of System Dynamics," Jay W. Forrester]&lt;/ref&gt;
The programmer, Richard Bennett, chose to implement a system (SIMPLE - "Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations") that took coded equations as symbolic input and computed solutions. SIMPLE became the proof-of-concept for DYNAMO: rather than have a specialist programmer "hard-code" a special-purpose solver in a general purpose programming language, users could specify a system's equations in a special simulation language and get simulation output from one program execution.

==Design goals==

DYNAMO was designed to emphasize the following:

* ease-of-use for the industrial dynamics modeling community (who were not assumed to be expert programmers);
* immediate execution of the compiled model, without producing an intermediate object file; and
* providing graphical output, with [[line printer]] and [[pen plotter]] graphics.

Among the ways in which DYNAMO was above the standard of the time, it featured [[Dimensional analysis|units checking]] of numerical types and relatively clear error messages.

==Implementation==

The earliest versions were written in [[assembly language]] for the [[IBM 704]], then for the [[IBM 709]] and [[IBM 7090]].  DYNAMO II was written in [[ALGOL Extended for Design|AED-0]], an extended version of [[Algol 60]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Impact and issues==

Apart from its (indirectly felt) public impact in environmental issues raised by the controversy over ''Limits to Growth'', DYNAMO was influential in the history of discrete-event simulation even though it was essentially a package for continuous simulation specified through [[difference equations]].&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Discrete Event Simulation Programming Languages", Richard E. Nance, TR 93-21, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (cross-listed as Systems Research Center report SRC 93-003), June 11, 1993 [http://eprints.cs.vt.edu/archive/00000363/01/TR-93-21.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been said by some to have opened opportunities for computer modelling even for users of relatively low mathematical sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''The electronic oracle: computer models and social decisions'' (1985), [[Donella Meadows|Donella H. Meadows]], Jenny M. Robinson, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, {{ISBN|0-471-90558-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, it has also been criticized as weak precisely where mathematical sophistication should be required&lt;ref name=picardi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"An interview with

Fox", SIAM website oral history, p.26 [http://history.siam.org/pdfs2/Fox_final.pdf]: "Besides the servo-mechanism approach, [Forrester] used extrapolation, which is notoriously problematic, and unstable. You know yourself that you can’t extrapolate forever. It doesn’t work."&lt;/ref&gt; and for relying only on [[Euler integration]].&lt;ref name=karayanakis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1248">In mathematics, a '''digital manifold''' is a special kind of [[combinatorial manifold]] which is defined in digital space i.e. grid cell space. A combinatorial manifold is a kind of manifold which is a discretization of a manifold. It usually means a [[piecewise linear manifold]] made by [[simplicial complexes]].

== Concepts ==

Parallel-move is used to extend an i-cell to (i+1)-cell. In other words, if A and B are two i-cells 
and A is a parallel-move of B, then {A,B} is an (i+1)-cell.
Therefore, k-cells can be defined recursively.

Basically, a connected set of grid points M can be viewed as a digital k-manifold if: 
(1) any two k-cells are (k-1)-connected, (2) every (k-1)-cell has
only one or two parallel-moves, and (3) M does not contain any (k+1)-cells.

'''Edmund Schuster''' (7 September 1851 – 5 July 1932) was a German engineer and mathematician who contributed to the field of special functions and [[complex analysis]] being a pioneer in the field of [[harmonic analysis]].

Schuster was born in [[Munich]] in 1851. He studied in [[Bonn]] and [[Leipzig]], and in 1875 he moved with his family to [[Chile]]. After a short period in [[Santiago de Chile]] he moved to [[Valdivia]], in the south of the country, where he lived until his death, in 1932. In Valdivia, Schuster initiated a school of mathematics and founded the Acta Philosophica Valdiviana, in 1876.

Schuster is known in the field of harmonic analysis for the function that receives his name, whose analytic structure exhibits interesting properties. In particular, its roots, usually denoted &lt;math&gt; \Theta_\nu &lt;/math&gt;, are given by

::&lt;math&gt;
\Theta_\nu = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{\nu}} + \sqrt{\nu}\right) \sin \left( \frac{2}{3} \arctan \sqrt{\nu} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt; represents a real number that labels the order of the Schuster function. The zeros of the Schuster function can also be written in terms of a complex variable &lt;math&gt; z=1 + i \sqrt{\nu } &lt;/math&gt;, namely

::&lt;math&gt;
\Theta_\nu = 2 (z\bar{z})^{2/3} \frac{z^{2/3} - \bar{z}^{2/3}}{z - \bar{z} }
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}=1 - i \sqrt{\nu }&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complex conjugate]] of &lt;math&gt;{z}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schuster, ''On a family of special functions defined on the complex line'', Acta Phil. Vald. 19 (1), 1877 pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This function is used also in [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Henneaux, C. Martinez, R. Troncoso, J. Zanelli, ''Black holes and asymptotics of''&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;''gravity coupled to a scalar field'', Phys. Rev. D 65, 2002 pp. 104007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuster has also made contributions to civil engineering.

A [[cryptography|cryptographic]] [[key (cryptography)|key]] is called '''ephemeral''' if it is generated for each execution of a key establishment process. In some cases ephemeral keys are used more than once, within a single session (e.g., in broadcast applications) where the sender generates only one ephemeral key pair per message and the [[private key]] is combined separately with each recipient's [[public key]]. Contrast with a [[static key]].

==Private / public ephemeral key agreement key==

Private (resp. public) ephemeral key agreement keys are the private (resp. public) keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used a single key establishment transaction to establish one or more keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or [[message authentication code|MAC]] keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., [[initialization vector]]s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6866">In [[computer science]], a '''function type''' (or '''arrow type''' or '''exponential''') is the type of a [[variable (computer science)|variable]] or [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]] to which a [[function (computer science)|function]] has or can be assigned, or an argument or result type of a [[higher-order function]] taking or returning a function.

A function type depends on the type of the parameters and the result type of the function (it, or more accurately the unapplied [[type constructor]] &lt;code&gt;{{nowrap|· → ·}}&lt;/code&gt;, is a [[higher-kinded type]]). In theoretical settings and [[programming language]]s where functions are defined in [[curried form]], such as the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], a function type depends on exactly two types, the [[domain of a function|domain]] ''A'' and the [[range of a function|range]] ''B''. Here a function type is often denoted {{math|''A'' → ''B''}}, following mathematical convention, or {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, based on there existing exactly {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (exponentially many) [[function space|set-theoretic functions]] mappings ''A'' to ''B'' in the [[category of sets]]. The class of such maps or functions is called the [[exponential object]]. The act of [[currying]] makes the function type [[adjoint functor|adjoint]] to the [[product type]]; this is explored in detail in the article on currying.

The function type can be considered to be a special case of the [[Dependent type#Formal definition|dependent product type]], which among other properties, encompasses the idea of a [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic function]].

== Programming languages ==
The syntax used for function types in several programming languages can be summarized, including an example type signature for the higher-order [[function composition (computer science)|function composition]] function:
{| class=wikitable
|-
! colspan=2 | Language !! Notation !! Example [[type signature]]

|-
| [[OCaml]]
| &lt;code&gt;''α'' -&gt; ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=ocaml|compose : ('b -&gt; 'c) -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'c}}
|-
| [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]
| &lt;code&gt;(''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) =&gt; ''ρ''&lt;/code&gt;

|-

| {{code|2=swift|func compose&lt;A,B,C&gt;(f: B -&gt; C, g: A -&gt; B) -&gt; A -&gt; C}}

| {{code|2=go|var compose func(func(int)int, func(int)int) func(int)int}}
|-
| [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Objective-C]], with [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]]
| &lt;code&gt;''ρ'' (^)(''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=objc|int (^compose(int (^f)(int), int (^g)(int)))(int);}}
|-
| rowspan=2 | Without [[first-class function]]s,&lt;br&gt; [[parametric polymorphism]]
| [[C (programming language)|C]]
| &lt;code&gt;''ρ'' (*)(''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;
| {{code|2=c|int (*compose(int (*f)(int), int (*g)(int)))(int);}}
|-
| [[C++11]]
| Not unique.
&lt;code&gt;std::function&lt;''ρ'' (''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''α''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the more general type (see below).
| {{code|2=cpp|function&lt;function&lt;int(int)&gt;(function&lt;int(int)&gt;, function&lt;int(int)&gt;)&gt; compose;}}

|}

When looking at the example type signature of, for example C#, the type of the function {{code|compose}} is actually &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;Func&lt;A,B&gt;,Func&amp;lt;B,C&gt;,Func&lt;A,C&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Due to [[type erasure]] in C++11's &lt;code&gt;std::function&lt;/code&gt;, it is more common to use [[Template (C++)|templates]] for higher order function parameters and type inference (&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;) for closures.

== Denotational semantics ==
The function type in programming languages does not correspond to the space of all set-theoretic functions. Given the [[countably infinite]] type of [[natural number]]s as the domain and the booleans as range, then there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number (2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = [[Cardinality of the continuum|c]]) of set-theoretic functions between them. Clearly this space of functions is larger than the number of functions that can be defined in any programming language, as there exist only countably many programs (a program being a finite sequence of a finite number of symbols) and one of the set-theoretic functions effectively solves the [[halting problem]].

[[Denotational semantics]] concerns itself with finding more appropriate models (called [[domain theory|domains]]) to model programming language concepts such as function types. It turns out that restricting expression to the set of [[computable function]]s is not sufficient either if the programming language allows writing [[non-terminating computation]]s (which is the case if the programming language is [[Turing complete]]). Expression must be restricted to the so-called ''[[Continuous functions#Continuous functions between partially ordered sets|continuous functions]]'' (corresponding to continuity in the [[Scott topology]], not continuity in the real analytical sense). Even then, the set of continuous function contains the ''parallel-or'' function, which cannot be correctly defined in all programming languages.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[representation theory]], '''group representations''' describe abstract [[group (mathematics)|groups]] in terms of [[linear transformation]]s of [[vector space]]s; in particular, they can be used to represent group elements as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] so that the group operation can be represented by [[matrix multiplication]]. Representations of groups are important because they allow many [[group theory|group-theoretic]] problems to be [[reduction (mathematics)|reduced]] to problems in [[linear algebra]], which is well understood. They are also important in [[physics]] because, for example, they describe how the [[symmetry group]] of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system.

The term ''representation of a group'' is also used in a more general sense to mean any "description" of a group as a group of transformations of some mathematical object. More formally, a "representation" means a [[homomorphism]] from the group to the [[automorphism group]] of an object. If the object is a vector space we have a ''linear representation''. Some people use ''realization'' for the general notion and reserve the term ''representation'' for the special case of linear representations. The bulk of this article describes linear representation theory; see the last section for generalizations.

==Branches of group representation theory==
The representation theory of groups divides into subtheories depending on the kind of group being represented. The various theories are quite different in detail, though some basic definitions and concepts are similar. The most important divisions are:

*''[[Finite group]]s'' &amp;mdash; Group representations are a very important tool in the study of finite groups. They also arise in the applications of finite group theory to [[crystallography]] and to geometry. If the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of scalars of the vector space has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', and if ''p'' divides the order of the group, then this is called ''[[modular representation theory]]''; this special case has very different properties. See [[Representation theory of finite groups]].
*''[[Compact group]]s or [[locally compact group]]s'' &amp;mdash; Many of the results of finite group representation theory are proved by averaging over the group. These proofs can be carried over to infinite groups by replacement of the average with an integral, provided that an acceptable notion of integral can be defined. This can be done for locally compact groups, using [[Haar measure]]. The resulting theory is a central part of [[harmonic analysis]]. The [[Pontryagin duality]] describes the theory for commutative groups, as a generalised [[Fourier transform]]. See also: [[Peter–Weyl theorem]].
*''[[Lie groups]]'' &amp;mdash; Many important Lie groups are compact, so the results of compact representation theory apply to them. Other techniques specific to Lie groups are used as well. Most of the groups important in physics and chemistry are Lie groups, and their representation theory is crucial to the application of group theory in those fields. See [[Representations of Lie groups]] and [[Representations of Lie algebras]].
*''[[Linear algebraic group]]s'' (or more generally  ''affine [[group scheme]]s'') &amp;mdash; These are the analogues of Lie groups, but over more general fields than just '''R''' or '''C'''. Although  linear algebraic groups have a classification that is very similar to that of Lie groups, and give rise to the same families of Lie algebras, their representations are rather different (and much less well understood). The analytic techniques used for studying Lie groups must be replaced by techniques from [[algebraic geometry]], where the relatively weak [[Zariski topology]] causes many technical complications.
*''Non-compact topological groups'' &amp;mdash; The class of non-compact groups is too broad to construct any general representation theory, but specific special cases have been studied, sometimes using ad hoc techniques. The ''semisimple Lie groups'' have a deep theory, building on the compact case. The complementary ''solvable'' Lie groups cannot be classified in the same way. The general theory for Lie groups deals with [[semidirect product]]s of the two types, by means of general results called ''[[Mackey theory]]'', which is a generalization of [[Wigner's classification]] methods.

Representation theory also depends heavily on the type of [[vector space]] on which the group acts. One distinguishes between finite-dimensional representations and infinite-dimensional ones. In the infinite-dimensional case, additional structures are important (e.g. whether or not the space is a [[Hilbert space]], [[Banach space]], etc.).

One must also consider the type of [[field (mathematics)|field]] over which the vector space is defined. The most important case is the field of [[complex number]]s. The other important cases are the field of [[real numbers]], [[finite field]]s, and fields of [[p-adic number]]s. In general, [[algebraically closed]] fields are easier to handle than non-algebraically closed ones. The [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field is also significant; many theorems for finite groups depend on the characteristic of the field not dividing the [[Order (group theory)|order of the group]].

==Definitions==
A '''representation''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' to GL(''V''), the [[general linear group#General linear group of a vector space|general linear group]] on ''V''.  That is, a representation is a map 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \colon G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; 
such that
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(g_1 g_2) = \rho(g_1) \rho(g_2) , \qquad \text{for all }g_1,g_2 \in G.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''V'' is called the '''representation space''' and the dimension of ''V'' is called the '''dimension''' of the representation. It is common practice to refer to ''V'' itself as the representation when the homomorphism is clear from the context.

In the case where ''V'' is of finite dimension ''n'' it is common to choose a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'' and identify GL(''V'') with {{nowrap|GL(''n'', ''K'')}}, the group of ''n''-by-''n'' [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] on the field ''K''.

* If ''G'' is a topological group and ''V'' is a [[topological vector space]], a '''continuous representation''' of ''G'' on ''V'' is a representation ''ρ'' such that the application {{nowrap|Φ : ''G'' × ''V'' → ''V''}} defined by {{nowrap|1=Φ(''g'', ''v'') = ''ρ''(''g'')(''v'')}} is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].
* The '''kernel''' of a representation ''ρ'' of a group ''G'' is defined as the normal subgroup of ''G'' whose image under ''ρ'' is the identity transformation:
::&lt;math&gt;\ker \rho = \left\{g \in G \mid \rho(g) = \mathrm{id}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

: A [[faithful representation]] is one in which the homomorphism {{nowrap|''G'' → GL(''V'')}} is [[injective]]; in other words, one whose kernel is the trivial subgroup {''e''} consisting only of the group's identity element.

* Given two ''K'' vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'', two representations {{nowrap|''ρ'' : ''G'' → GL(''V'')}} and {{nowrap|''π'' : ''G'' → GL(''W'')}} are said to be '''equivalent''' or '''isomorphic''' if there exists a vector space [[isomorphism]] {{nowrap|''α'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} so that for all ''g'' in ''G'',
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha \circ \rho(g) \circ \alpha^{-1} = \pi(g).&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
Consider the complex number ''u'' = e&lt;sup&gt;2πi / 3&lt;/sup&gt; which has the property ''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. The [[cyclic group]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, ''u'', ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} has a representation ρ on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho \left( 1 \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\rho \left( u \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; u \\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\rho \left( u^2 \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; u^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This representation is faithful because ρ is a [[injective|one-to-one map]].

Another representation for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, isomorphic to the previous one, is σ given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma \left( 1 \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\sigma \left( u \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
u &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\sigma \left( u^2 \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
u^2 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; may also be faithfully represented on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by τ given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau \left( 1 \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\tau \left( u \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; -b \\
b &amp; a \\
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\tau \left( u^2 \right) =
\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; b \\
-b &amp; a \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a=\text{Re}(u)=-\tfrac{1}{2}, \qquad b=\text{Im}(u)=\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Reducibility ==

{{main|Irreducible representation}}

A subspace ''W'' of ''V'' that is invariant under the [[group action]] is called a ''[[subrepresentation]]''. If ''V'' has exactly two subrepresentations, namely the zero-dimensional subspace and ''V'' itself, then the representation is said to be ''irreducible''; if it has a proper subrepresentation of nonzero dimension, the representation is said to be ''reducible''. The representation of dimension zero is considered to be neither reducible nor irreducible, just like the number 1 is considered to be neither composite nor [[prime number|prime]].{{dubious|date=December 2017}}

Under the assumption that the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field ''K'' does not divide the size of the group, representations of [[finite group]]s can be decomposed into a [[direct sum of groups|direct sum]] of irreducible subrepresentations (see [[Maschke's theorem]]). This holds in particular for any representation of a finite group over the [[complex numbers]], since the characteristic of the complex numbers is zero, which never divides the size of a group.

In the example above, the first two representations given (ρ and σ) are both decomposable into two 1-dimensional subrepresentations (given by span{(1,0)} and span{(0,1)}), while the third representation (τ) is irreducible.

==Generalizations==

===Set-theoretical representations===
A ''set-theoretic representation'' (also known as a [[group action]] or ''permutation representation'') of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is given by a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ρ : ''G'' → ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;, the set of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from ''X'' to ''X'', such that for all ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'':

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(1)[x] = x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(g_1 g_2)[x]=\rho(g_1)[\rho(g_2)[x]].&lt;/math&gt;

This condition and the axioms for a group imply that ρ(''g'') is a [[bijection]] (or [[permutation]]) for all ''g'' in ''G''. Thus we may equivalently define a permutation representation to be a [[group homomorphism]] from G to the [[symmetric group]] S&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X''.

For more information on this topic see the article on [[group action]].

===Representations in other categories===
Every group ''G'' can be viewed as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with a single object; [[morphism]]s in this category are just the elements of ''G''. Given an arbitrary category ''C'', a ''representation'' of ''G'' in ''C'' is a [[functor]] from ''G'' to ''C''. Such a functor selects an object ''X'' in ''C'' and a group homomorphism from ''G'' to Aut(''X''), the [[automorphism group]] of ''X''.

In the case where ''C'' is '''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[category of vector spaces]] over a field ''K'', this definition is equivalent to a linear representation. Likewise, a set-theoretic representation is just a representation of ''G'' in the [[category of sets]].

When ''C'' is '''Ab''', the [[category of abelian groups]], the objects obtained are called [[G-module|''G''-modules]].

For another example consider the [[category of topological spaces]], '''Top'''. Representations in '''Top''' are homomorphisms from ''G'' to the [[homeomorphism]] group of a topological space ''X''.

Two types of representations closely related to linear representations are:
*[[projective representation]]s: in the category of [[projective space]]s. These can be described as "linear representations [[up to]] scalar transformations". 
*[[affine representation]]s: in the category of [[affine space]]s. For example, the [[Euclidean group]] acts affinely upon [[Euclidean space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40039">In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[computer algebra]], computational [[algebraic geometry]], and computational [[commutative algebra]], a '''Gröbner basis''' is a particular kind of [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal generated by a set|generating set of an ideal]] in a [[polynomial ring]] {{nowrap|''K''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{nowrap|''K''}}. A Gröbner basis allows many important properties of the ideal and the associated [[algebraic variety]] to be deduced easily, such as the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] and the number of zeros when it is finite. Gröbner basis computation is one of the main practical tools for solving [[system of polynomial equations|systems of polynomial equations]] and computing the images of [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] under [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s or [[rational map]]s.

Gröbner basis computation can be seen as a multivariate, non-linear generalization of both [[polynomial greatest common divisor#Euclid's algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]] for computing [[polynomial greatest common divisor]]s, and
[[Gaussian elimination]] for linear systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lazard | first = Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Lazard | chapter = Gröbner bases, Gaussian elimination and resolution of systems of algebraic equations | doi = 10.1007/3-540-12868-9_99 | title = Computer Algebra | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 162 | pages = 146–156 | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-3-540-12868-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gröbner bases were introduced in 1965, together with an algorithm to compute them ([[Buchberger's algorithm]]), by [[Bruno Buchberger]] in his Ph.D. thesis. He named them after his advisor [[Wolfgang Gröbner]]. In 2007, Buchberger received the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s [[Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award]] for this work.
However, the Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Günther]] had introduced a similar notion in 1913, published in various Russian mathematical journals. These papers were largely ignored by the mathematical community until their rediscovery in 1987 by Bodo Renschuch ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Bodo Renschuch, Hartmut Roloff, Georgij G. Rasputin et. al. (2003). [http://www.risc.jku.at/Groebner-Bases-Bibliography/gbbib_files/publication_776.pdf ''Contributions to Constructive Polynomial Ideal Theory XXIII: Forgotten Works of Leningrad Mathematician N. M. Gjunter on Polynomial Ideal Theory'']. ACM SIGSAM Bulletin, Vol 37, No 2, (2003): 35–48. English translation by Michael Abramson.&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous concept for multivariate [[power series]] was developed independently by [[Heisuke Hironaka]] in 1964, who named them '''standard bases'''. This term has been used by some authors to also denote Gröbner bases.

The theory of Gröbner bases has been extended by many authors in various directions. It has been generalized to other structures such as polynomials over [[principal ideal ring]]s or [[polynomial ring]]s, and also some classes of non-commutative rings and algebras, like [[Ore algebra]]s.

== Background ==

=== Polynomial ring ===
{{main|Polynomial ring}}
Gröbner bases are primarily defined for [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in a [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]&lt;/math&gt; over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|K}}. Although the theory works for any field, most Gröbner basis computations are done either when {{mvar|K}} is the [[field of rationals]] or the integers modulo a prime number.

A [[polynomial]] is a sum &lt;math&gt; c_1M_1 +\cdots + c_mM_m&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; are nonzero elements of {{mvar|K}} and the &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[monomial]]s or "power products" of the variables. This means that a monomial {{mvar|M}} is a product &lt;math&gt;M=x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n}, &lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative integers. The vector &lt;math&gt;A=[a_1, \ldots ,a_n]&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''exponent vector''' of {{mvar|M}}. The notation is often abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n}=X^A&lt;/math&gt;. Monomials are uniquely defined by their exponent vectors so computers can represent monomials efficiently as exponent vectors, and polynomials as lists of exponent vectors and their coefficients.

If &lt;math&gt; F=\{f_1,\ldots, f_k\}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of polynomials in a polynomial ring {{mvar|R}}, the [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal generated by a set|ideal generated by]] {{mvar|F}} is the set of linear combinations of elements from {{mvar|F}} with coefficients in all of {{mvar|R}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \langle f_1,\ldots, f_k\rangle = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^k g_i f_i\;|\; g_1,\ldots, g_k\in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Monomial ordering ===
{{main|Monomial order}}
All operations related to Gröbner bases require the choice of a [[total order]] on the monomials, with the following properties of compatibility with multiplication. For all monomials {{mvar|M}}, {{mvar|N}}, {{mvar|P}},
# &lt;math&gt;M \leq N \Longleftrightarrow MP \leq NP &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;M \leq MP &lt;/math&gt;.
A total order satisfying these condition is sometimes called an ''admissible ordering''.

These conditions imply [[Noetherian ring|Noetherianity]], which means that every strictly decreasing sequence of monomials is finite.

Although Gröbner basis theory does not depend on a particular choice of an admissible monomial ordering, three monomial orderings are specially important for the applications:
* ''Lexicographical ordering'', commonly called ''lex'' or ''plex'' (for pure lexical ordering).
* ''Total degree reverse lexicographical ordering'', commonly called ''degrevlex''.
* ''Elimination ordering'', ''lexdeg''.

Gröbner basis theory was initially introduced for the lexicographical ordering. It was soon realised that the Gröbner basis for degrevlex is almost always much easier to compute, and that it is almost always easier to compute a lex Gröbner basis by first computing the degrevlex basis and then using a "change of ordering algorithm". When [[#Elimination|elimination]] is needed, degrevlex is not convenient; both lex and lexdeg may be used but, again, many computations are relatively easy with lexdeg and almost impossible with lex.

Once a monomial ordering is fixed, the ''terms'' of a polynomial (product of a monomial with its nonzero coefficient) are naturally ordered by decreasing monomials (for this order). This makes the representation of a polynomial as an ordered list of pairs coefficient–exponent vector a [[Canonical form|canonical representation]] of the polynomials. The first (greatest) term of a polynomial {{mvar|p}} for this ordering and the corresponding monomial and coefficient are respectively called the ''leading term'', ''leading monomial'' and ''leading coefficient'' and denoted, in this article, lt({{mvar|p}}), lm({{mvar|p}}) and lc({{mvar|p}}).

=== Reduction ===
The concept of '''reduction''', also called '''multivariate division''' or '''normal form''' computation, is central to Gröbner basis theory. It is a multivariate generalization of the [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division of univariate polynomials]].

In this section we suppose a fixed monomial ordering, which will not be defined explicitly.

Given two polynomials ''f'' and ''g'', one says that ''f'' is ''reducible'' by ''g'' if some monomial ''m'' in ''f'' is a multiple of the leading monomial lm(''g'') of ''g''. If ''m'' happens to be the leading monomial of ''f'' then one says that ''f'' is ''lead-reducible'' by ''g''. If ''c'' is the coefficient of ''m'' in ''f'' and ''m'' = ''q'' lm(''g''), the ''one-step reduction'' of ''f'' by ''g'' is the operation that associates to ''f'' the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red}_1(f,g)=f-\frac{c}{\operatorname{lc}(g)}\,q\, g.&lt;/math&gt;
The main properties of this operation are that the resulting polynomial does not contain the monomial ''m'' and that the monomials greater than ''m'' (for the monomial ordering) remain unchanged. This operation is not, in general, uniquely defined; if several monomials in ''f'' are multiples of lm(''g''), then one may choose arbitrarily which one to reduce. In practice, it is better to choose the greatest one for the monomial ordering, because otherwise subsequent reductions could reintroduce the monomial that has just been removed.

Given a finite set ''G'' of polynomials, one says that ''f'' is ''reducible'' or ''lead-reducible'' by ''G'' if it is reducible or lead-reducible, respectively, by an element g of ''G''. If it is the case, then one defines &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red}_1(f,G)=\operatorname{red}_1(f,g)&lt;/math&gt;. The (complete) reduction of ''f'' by ''G'' consists in applying iteratively this operator &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red}_1&lt;/math&gt; until getting a polynomial &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red}(f,G)&lt;/math&gt;, which is irreducible by ''G''. It is called a ''normal form'' of ''f'' by ''G''. In general this form is not uniquely defined (this is not a [[canonical form]]); this non-uniqueness is the starting point of Gröbner basis theory.

For Gröbner basis computations, except at the end, it is not necessary to do a complete reduction: a ''lead-reduction'' is sufficient, which saves a large amount of computation.

The definition of the reduction shows immediately that, if ''h'' is a normal form of ''f'' by ''G'', then we have
:&lt;math&gt;f=h+\sum_{g\in G} q_g\,g,&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;q_g&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials. In the case of univariate polynomials, if ''G'' consists of a single element ''g'', then ''h'' is the remainder of the Euclidean division of ''f'' by ''g'', ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is the quotient and the division algorithm is exactly the process of lead-reduction. For this reason, some authors use the term ''multivariate division'' instead of reduction.

== Formal definition ==

A Gröbner basis '''G''' of an ideal '''I''' in a polynomial ring '''R''' over a field is a [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal generated by a set|generating set]] of '''I''' characterized by any one of the following properties, stated relatively to some [[monomial order]]:

* the ideal generated by the leading terms of polynomials in '''I''' equals the ideal generated by the leading terms of '''G''';
* the leading term of any polynomial in '''I''' is divisible by the leading term of some polynomial in '''G''';
* the [[#Reduction|multivariate division]] of any polynomial in the polynomial ring '''R''' by '''G''' gives a unique remainder;
* the multivariate division by '''G''' of any polynomial in the ideal '''I''' gives the remainder '''0'''.

All these properties are equivalent; different authors use different definitions depending on the topic they choose. The last two properties allow calculations in the [[factor ring]] '''R/I''' with the same facility as modular arithmetic. It is a significant fact of [[commutative algebra]] that Gröbner bases always exist, and can be effectively computed for any ideal given by a finite generating subset.

Multivariate division requires a monomial ordering, the basis depends on the monomial ordering chosen, and different orderings can give rise to radically different Gröbner bases. Two of the most commonly used orderings are [[lexicographical order|lexicographic ordering]], and ''degree reverse lexicographic order'' (also called ''graded reverse lexicographic order'' or simply ''total degree order''). Lexicographic order eliminates variables, however the resulting Gröbner bases are often very large and expensive to compute. Degree reverse lexicographic order typically provides for the fastest Gröbner basis computations. In this order monomials are compared first by total degree, with ties broken by taking the smallest monomial with respect to lexicographic ordering with the variables reversed.

In most cases (polynomials in finitely many variables with complex coefficients or, more generally, coefficients over any field, for example), Gröbner bases exist for any monomial ordering. [[Buchberger's algorithm]] is the oldest and most well-known method for computing them. Other methods are the [[Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms]], based on the same mathematics as the Buchberger algorithm, and involutive approaches, based on ideas from [[differential algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir P. Gerdt, Yuri A. Blinkov (1998). ''Involutive Bases of Polynomial Ideals'', Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 45:519ff&lt;/ref&gt; There are also three algorithms for converting a Gröbner basis with respect to one monomial order to a Gröbner basis with respect to a different monomial order: the [[FGLM algorithm]], the [[Hilbert Driven Algorithm]] and the [[Gröbner walk algorithm]]. These algorithms are often employed to compute (difficult) lexicographic Gröbner bases from (easier) total degree Gröbner bases.

A Gröbner basis is termed ''reduced'' if the leading coefficient of each element of the basis is 1 and no monomial in any element of the basis is in the ideal generated by the leading terms of the other elements of the basis. In the worst case, computation of a Gröbner basis may require time that is exponential or even [[Double exponential function|doubly exponential]] in the number of solutions of the polynomial system (for degree reverse lexicographic order and lexicographic order, respectively). Despite these complexity bounds, both standard and reduced Gröbner bases are often computable in practice, and most [[computer algebra systems]] contain routines to do so.

The concept and algorithms of Gröbner bases have been generalized to [[submodule]]s of [[free module]]s over a polynomial ring. In fact, if ''L'' is a free module over a ring ''R'', then one may consider ''R''⊕''L'' as a ring by defining the product of two elements of ''L'' to be 0. This ring may be identified with &lt;math&gt;R[e_1, \ldots, e_l]/\left\langle \{e_ie_j|1\le i\le j\le l\}\right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e_1, \ldots, e_l&lt;/math&gt; is a basis of ''L''. This allows to identify a submodule of ''L'' generated by &lt;math&gt;g_1, \ldots, g_k&lt;/math&gt; with the ideal of &lt;math&gt;R[e_1, \ldots, e_l]&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;g_1, \ldots, g_k&lt;/math&gt; and the products &lt;math&gt;e_ie_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1\le i\le j\le l&lt;/math&gt;. If ''R'' is a polynomial ring, this reduces the theory and the algorithms of Gröbner bases of modules to the theory and the algorithms of Gröbner bases of ideals.

The concept and algorithms of Gröbner bases have also been generalized to ideals over various rings, commutative or not, like polynomial rings over a [[principal ideal ring]] or [[Weyl algebra]]s.

== Example and counterexample ==
[[File:Parabola and three vertical lines.svg|right|thumb|The zeroes of f(x,y) form the red parabola; the zeroes of g(x,y) form the three blue vertical lines. Their intersection consists of three points.]]

Let ''R'' = '''Q'''[''x'',''y''] be the ring of bivariate polynomials with rational coefficients and consider the ideal ''I'' = &lt;''f'',''g''&gt; generated by the polynomials

:''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''y''

:''g''(''x'',''y'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - ''x''

Two other elements of ''I'' are the polynomials

:''k''(''x'',''y'') = -''xf''(''x'',''y'') + ''g''(''x'',''y'') = ''xy'' - ''x''
:''h''(''x'',''y'') =  ''xk''(''x'',''y'') − (''y'' - 1)''f''(''x'',''y'')  =  ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''y''

Under lexicographic ordering with ''x'' &gt; ''y'' we have

:lt(''f'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

:lt(''g'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

:lt(''h'') = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

The ideal generated by {lt(''f''),lt(''g'')} only contains polynomials that are divisible by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which
excludes lt(''h'') = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; it follows that {''f'', ''g''} is not a Gröbner basis for ''I.''

On the other hand, we can show that {''f'', ''k'', ''h''} is indeed a Gröbner basis for ''I.''

First note that ''f'' and ''g,'' and therefore also ''h, k'' and all the other polynomials in the ideal ''I''
have the following three zeroes in the (''x'',''y'') plane in common, as indicated in the figure: {(1,1),(-1,1),(0,0)}.
Those three points are not collinear, so ''I'' does not contain any polynomial of the first degree.
Neither can ''I'' contain any polynomials of the special form

:''m''(''x'',''y'') = ''cx'' + ''p''(''y'')

with ''c'' a nonzero rational number and ''p'' a polynomial in the variable ''y'' only; the reason being that
such an ''m'' can never have two distinct zeroes with the same value for ''y'' (in this case,
the points (1,1) and (-1,1)).

From the above it follows that ''I,'' apart from the zero polynomial, only contains polynomials whose leading term has degree greater than or equal to 2; therefore their leading terms are divisible by at least one of the three monomials
:{''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''xy'', ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} = {lt(''f''),lt(''k''),lt(''h'')}.
This means that {''f'', ''k'', ''h''} is a Gröbner basis for ''I'' with respect to lexicographic ordering with ''x'' &gt; ''y.''

== Properties and applications of Gröbner bases ==
Unless explicitly stated, all the results that follow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cox|first1=David A.|authorlink1=David A. Cox |last2=Little|first2=John |last3=O'Shea|first3=Donal|authorlink3=Donal O'Shea |year=1997 |title=Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms: An Introduction to Computational Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-94680-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are true for any [[monomial ordering]] (see that article for the definitions of the different orders that are mentioned below).

It is a common misconception that the lexicographical order is needed for some of these results. On the contrary, the lexicographical order is, almost always, the most difficult to compute, and using it makes impractical many computations that are relatively easy with graded reverse lexicographic order (grevlex), or, when elimination is needed, the elimination order (lexdeg) which restricts to grevlex on each block of variables.

=== Equality of ideals ===

Reduced Gröbner bases are ''unique'' for any given ideal and any monomial ordering. Thus two ideals are equal if and only if they have the same (reduced) Gröbner basis (usually a Gröbner basis software always produces reduced Gröbner bases).

=== Membership and inclusion of ideals ===

The [[#Reduction|reduction]] of a polynomial ''f'' by the Gröbner basis ''G'' of an ideal ''I'' yields 0 ''if and only if'' ''f'' is in ''I''. This allows to test the membership of an element in an ideal. Another method consists in verifying that the Gröbner basis of ''G''∪{''f''} is equal to ''G''.

To test if the ideal ''I'' generated by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is contained in the ideal ''J'', it suffices to test that every ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is in ''J''. One may also test the equality of the reduced Gröbner bases of ''J'' and ''J''∪{''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

=== Solutions of a system of algebraic equations ===
{{main|System of polynomial equations}}
Any set of polynomials may be viewed as a [[system of polynomial equations]] by equating the polynomials to zero. The set of the solutions of such a system depends only on the generated ideal, and, therefore does not change when the given generating set is replaced by the Gröbner basis, for any ordering, of the generated ideal. Such a solution, with coordinates in an [[algebraically closed field]] containing the coefficients of the polynomials, is called a ''zero of the ideal''. In the usual case of [[rational number|rational]] coefficients, this algebraically closed field is chosen as the [[complex field]].

An ideal does not have any zero (the system of equations is [[inconsistent equations|inconsistent]]) if and only if 1 belongs to the ideal (this is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]), or, equivalently, if its Gröbner basis (for any monomial ordering) contains 1, or, also, if the corresponding reduced Gröbner basis is [1].

Given the Gröbner basis ''G'' of an ideal ''I'', it has only a finite number of zeros, if and only if, for each variable ''x'', ''G'' contains a polynomial with a leading monomial that is a power of ''x'' (without any other variable appearing in the leading term). If it is the case the number of zeros, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the number of monomials that are not multiple of any leading monomial of ''G''. This number is called the ''degree'' of the ideal.

When the number of zeros is finite, the Gröbner basis for a lexicographical monomial ordering provides, theoretically, a solution: the first coordinates of a solution is a root of the [[polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] of polynomials of the basis that depends only of the first variable. After substituting this root in the basis, the second coordinates of this solution is a root of the greatest common divisor of the resulting polynomials that depends only on this second variable, and so on. This solving process is only theoretical, because it implies GCD computation and root-finding of polynomials with approximate coefficients, which are not practicable because of numeric instability. Therefore, other methods have been developed to solve polynomial systems through Gröbner bases (see [[System of polynomial equations]] for more details).

=== Dimension, degree and Hilbert series ===
The '''dimension''' of an ideal ''I'' in a polynomial ring ''R'' is the [[Krull dimension]] of the ring ''R''/''I'' and is equal to the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension of the algebraic set]] of the zeros of ''I''. It is also equal to number of [[hyperplane]]s in [[general position]] which are needed to have an intersection with the algebraic set, which is a finite number of points. The '''degree''' of the ideal and of its associated algebraic set is the number of points of this finite intersection, counted with multiplicity. In particular, the degree of a [[hypersurface]] is equal to the degree of its definition polynomial.

Both degree and dimension depends only on the set of the leading monomials of the Gröbner basis of the ideal for any monomial ordering.

The dimension is the maximal size of a subset ''S'' of the variables such that there is no leading monomial depending only on the variables in ''S''. Thus, if the ideal has dimension 0, then for each variable ''x'' there is a leading monomial in the Gröbner basis that is a power of ''x''.

Both dimension and degree may be deduced from the [[Hilbert series]] of the ideal, which is the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty d_it^i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of monomials of degree ''i'' that are not multiple of any leading monomial in the Gröbner basis. The Hilbert series may be summed into a rational fraction
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty d_it^i=\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)^d},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' is the dimension of the ideal and &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial such that &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of the ideal.

Although the dimension and the degree do not depend on the choice of the monomial ordering, the Hilbert series and the polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; change when one changes of monomial ordering.

Most [[computer algebra system]]s that provide functions to compute Gröbner bases provide also functions for computing the Hilbert series, and thus also the dimension and the degree.

=== Elimination ===

The computation of Gröbner bases for an ''elimination'' monomial ordering allows computational [[elimination theory]]. This is based on the following theorem.

Let us consider a polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]=K[X,Y],&lt;/math&gt; in which the variables are split into two subsets ''X'' and ''Y''. Let us also choose an elimination monomial ordering "eliminating" ''X'', that is a monomial ordering for which two monomials are compared by comparing first the ''X''-parts, and, in case of equality only, considering the ''Y''-parts. This implies that a monomial containing an ''X''-variable is greater than every monomial independent of ''X''.
If ''G'' is a Gröbner basis of an ideal ''I'' for this monomial ordering, then &lt;math&gt;G\cap K[Y]&lt;/math&gt; is a Gröbner basis of &lt;math&gt;I\cap K[Y]&lt;/math&gt; (this ideal is often called the ''elimination ideal''). Moreover, &lt;math&gt;G\cap K[Y]&lt;/math&gt; consists exactly of the polynomials of {{math|''G''}} whose leading terms belong to {{math|''K''[''Y'']}} (this makes very easy the computation of &lt;math&gt;G\cap K[Y]&lt;/math&gt;, as only the leading monomials need to be checked).

This ''elimination property'' has many applications, some of them are reported in the next sections.

Another application, in [[algebraic geometry]], is that ''elimination'' realizes the geometric operation of [[projection (mathematics)|projection]] of an [[affine algebraic set]] into a subspace of the ambient space: with above notation, the ([[Zariski closure]] of) the projection of the algebraic set defined by the ideal ''I'' into the ''Y''-subspace is defined by the ideal &lt;math&gt;I\cap K[Y].&lt;/math&gt;

The lexicographical ordering such that &lt;math&gt;x_1&gt;\cdots &gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is an elimination ordering for every partition &lt;math&gt;\{x_1, \ldots, x_k\},\{x_{k+1},\ldots,x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt; Thus a Gröbner basis for this ordering carries much more information than usually necessary. This may explain why Gröbner bases for the lexicographical ordering are usually the most difficult to compute.

=== Intersecting ideals ===

If ''I'' and ''J'' are two ideals generated respectively by {''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}
and {''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}, then a single Gröbner basis computation produces a Gröbner basis of their intersection ''I''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''J''. For this, one introduces a new indeterminate ''t'', and one uses an elimination ordering such that the first block contains only ''t'' and the other block contains all the other variables (this means that a monomial containing ''t'' is greater than every monomial that do not contain ''t''. With this monomial ordering, a Gröbner basis of ''I''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''J'' consists in the polynomials that do not contain ''t'', in the Gröbner basis of the ideal
:&lt;math&gt;K=\langle tf_1,\ldots, tf_m, (1-t)g_1, \ldots, (1-t)g_k\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, ''I''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''J'' is obtained by ''eliminating'' ''t'' in ''K''.
This may be proven by remarking that the ideal ''K'' consists in the polynomials &lt;math&gt;(a-b)t+b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\in I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\in J&lt;/math&gt;. Such a polynomial is independent of ''t'' if and only ''a''=''b'', which means that &lt;math&gt;b\in I\cap J.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Implicitization of a rational curve ===

A [[rational curve]] is an [[algebraic curve]] that has a [[parametric equation]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x_1&amp;=\frac{f_1(t)}{g_1(t)}\\
\vdots\\
x_n&amp;=\frac{f_n(t)}{g_n(t)},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; are univariate polynomials for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''. One may (and will) suppose that &lt;math&gt;f_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; are [[coprime]] (they have no non-constant common factors).

[[Implicitization]] consists in computing the [[implicit function|implicit equation]]s of such a curve. In case of ''n'' = 2, that is for plane curves, this may be computed with the [[resultant]]. The implicit equation is the following resultant:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Res}_t(g_1x_1-f_1,g_2x_2-f_2).&lt;/math&gt;

Elimination with Gröbner bases allow to implicitize for any value of ''n'', simply by eliminating ''t'' in the ideal
&lt;math&gt;\langle g_1x_1-f_1,\ldots, g_nx_2-f_n\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''n'' = 2, the result is the same as with the resultant, if the map &lt;math&gt;t \mapsto (x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is injective for almost every ''t''. In the other case, the resultant is a power of the result of the elimination.

=== Saturation ===
When modeling a problem by polynomial equations, it is highly frequent that some quantities are supposed to be non-zero, because, if they are zero, the problem becomes very different. For example, when dealing with [[triangle]]s, many properties become false if the triangle is degenerated, that is if the length of one side is equal to the sum of the lengths of the other sides. In such situations, there is no hope of deducing relevant information from the polynomial system if the degenerate solutions are not dropped out. More precisely, the system of equations defines an [[algebraic set]] which may have several [[irreducible component]]s, and one has to remove the components on which the degeneracy conditions are everywhere zero.

This is done by ''saturating'' the equations by the degeneracy conditions, which may be done by using the elimination property of Gröbner bases.

==== Definition of the saturation ====
The [[localization of a ring]] consists in adjoining to it the formal inverses of some elements. This section concerns only the case of a single element, or equivalently a finite number of elements (adjoining the inverses of several elements is equivalent to adjoin the inverse of their product. The ''localization'' of a ring ''R'' by an element ''f'' is the ring &lt;math&gt;R_f=R[t]/(1-ft),&lt;/math&gt; where ''t'' is a new indeterminate representing the inverse of ''f''. The ''localization'' of an ideal ''I'' of ''R'' is the ideal &lt;math&gt;R_fI&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R_f.&lt;/math&gt; When ''R'' is a polynomial ring, computing in &lt;math&gt;R_f&lt;/math&gt; is not efficient, because of the need to manage the denominators. Therefore, the operation of ''localization'' is usually replaced by the operation of ''saturation''.

The '''saturation''' with respect to ''f'' of an ideal ''I'' in ''R'' is the inverse image of &lt;math&gt;R_fI&lt;/math&gt; under the canonical map from ''R'' to &lt;math&gt;R_f.&lt;/math&gt; It is the ideal &lt;math&gt;I:f^\infty= \{g\in R| (\exists k\in \mathbb N) f^k g\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; consisting in all elements of ''R'' whose products by some power of ''f'' belongs to ''I''.

If ''J'' is the ideal generated by ''I'' and 1-''ft'' in ''R''[''t''], then &lt;math&gt;I:f^\infty=J\cap R.&lt;/math&gt; It follows that, if ''R'' is a polynomial ring, a Gröbner basis computation eliminating ''t'' allows to compute a Gröbner basis of the saturation of an ideal by a polynomial.

The important property of the saturation, which ensures that it removes from the algebraic set defined by the ideal ''I'' the [[irreducible component]]s on which the polynomial ''f'' is zero is the following: ''The [[primary decomposition]] of'' &lt;math&gt;I:f^\infty&lt;/math&gt; ''consists in the components of the primary decomposition of I that do not contain any power of f''.

==== Computation of the saturation ====
A Gröbner basis of the saturation by ''f'' of a polynomial ideal generated by a finite set of polynomials ''F'', may be obtained by eliminating ''t'' in &lt;math&gt;F\cup\{1-tf\},&lt;/math&gt; that is by keeping the polynomials independent of ''t'' in the Gröbner basis of &lt;math&gt;F\cup\{1-tf\}&lt;/math&gt; for an elimination ordering eliminating ''t''.

Instead of using ''F'', one may also start from a Gröbner basis of ''F''. Which method is most efficient depends on the problem. However, if the saturation does not remove any component, that is if the ideal is equal to its saturated ideal, computing first the Gröbner basis of ''F'' is usually faster. On the other hand, if the saturation removes some components, the direct computation may be dramatically faster.

If one wants to saturate with respect to several polynomials &lt;math&gt;f_1,\ldots, f_k&lt;/math&gt; or with respect to a single polynomial which is a product &lt;math&gt;f=f_1\ldots f_k, &lt;/math&gt; there are three ways to proceed which give the same result but may have very different computation times (it depends on the problem which is the most efficient).
* Saturating by &lt;math&gt;f=f_1\ldots f_k &lt;/math&gt; in a single Gröbner basis computation.
* Saturating by &lt;math&gt;f_1,&lt;/math&gt; then saturating the result by &lt;math&gt;f_2,&lt;/math&gt; and so on.
* Adding to ''F'' or to its Gröbner basis the polynomials &lt;math&gt;1-t_1f_1, \ldots, 1-t_kf_k,&lt;/math&gt; and eliminating the &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; in a single Gröbner basis computation.

=== Effective Nullstellensatz ===

[[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] has two versions. The first one asserts that a set of polynomials has an empty set of common zeros in an [[algebraic closure]] of the field of the coefficients if and only if 1 belongs to the generated ideal. This is easily tested with a Gröbner basis computation, because 1 belongs to an ideal if and only if 1 belongs to the Gröbner basis of the ideal, for any monomial ordering.

The second version asserts that the set of common zeros (in an algebraic closure of the field of the coefficients) of an ideal is contained in the [[hypersurface]] of the zeros of a polynomial ''f'', if and only if a power of ''f'' belongs to the ideal. This may be tested by a saturating the ideal by ''f''; in fact, a power of ''f'' belongs to the ideal if and only if the saturation by ''f'' provides a Gröbner basis containing 1.

=== Implicitization in higher dimension ===
By definition, an affine [[rational variety]] of dimension ''k'' may be described by [[parametric equation]]s of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x_1&amp;=\frac{p_1}{p_0}\\
\vdots\\
x_n&amp;=\frac{p_n}{p_0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p_0,\ldots,p_n&lt;/math&gt; are ''n''+1 polynomials in the ''k'' variables (parameters of the parameterization) &lt;math&gt;t_1,\ldots,t_k.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the parameters &lt;math&gt;t_1,\ldots,t_k&lt;/math&gt; and the coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; of the points of the variety are zeros of the ideal
:&lt;math&gt;I=\left\langle p_0x_1-p_1, \ldots, p_0x_n-p_n\right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

One could guess that it suffices to eliminate the parameters to obtain the implicit equations of the variety, as it has been done in the case of curves. Unfortunately this is not always the case. If the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; have a common zero (sometimes called ''base point''), every [[irreducible component]] of the non-empty algebraic set defined by the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible component of the algebraic set defined by ''I''. It follows that, in this case, the direct elimination of the &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; provides an empty set of polynomials.

Therefore, if ''k''&gt;1, two Gröbner basis computations are needed to implicitize:
# Saturate &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; to get a Gröbner basis &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
# Eliminate the &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to get a Gröbner basis of the ideal (of the implicit equations) of the variety.

It concerns the expression of [[Positive-definite function|positive definite]] [[rational function]]s as [[summation|sums]] of [[quotient]]s of [[Square (algebra)|square]]s.  The original question may be reformulated as:

* Given a multivariate polynomial that takes only non-negative values over the reals, can it be represented as a sum of squares of rational functions?

== Motivation ==
{{Main|Polynomial SOS}}

The formulation of the question takes into account that there are [[positive polynomial|non-negative polynomials]], for example&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Françoise Roy]]. The role of Hilbert's problems in real algebraic geometry.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)=z^6+x^4y^2+x^2y^4-3x^2y^2z^2, &lt;/math&gt;

which cannot be represented as a [[Polynomial SOS|sum of squares of other polynomials]]. In 1888, Hilbert showed that every homogeneous polynomial in ''n'' variables and degree 2''d'' can be represented as sum of squares of other polynomials if and only if either (a)
''n'' = 2 or (b)  2''d'' = 2 or (c) ''n'' = 3 and 2''d'' = 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilbert|first1=David|title=Ueber die Darstellung definiter Formen als Summe von Formenquadraten|journal=Mathematische Annalen|date=September 1888|volume=32|issue=3|pages=342–350|doi=10.1007/bf01443605}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hilbert's proof did not exhibit an explicit example: only in 1967 the first explicit example was constructed by Motzkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motzkin|first1=T.

== Solution and generalizations ==

The particular case of ''n'' = 2 was already solved by Hilbert in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilbert|first1=David|title=Über ternäre definite Formen|journal=Acta Mathematica|date=December 1893|volume=17|issue=1|pages=169–197|doi=10.1007/bf02391990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The general problem was solved in the affirmative, in 1927, by [[Emil Artin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Artin|first1=Emil|title=Über die Zerlegung definiter Funktionen in Quadrate|journal=Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg|date=1927|volume=5|issue=1|pages=100–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; for positive semidefinite functions over the reals or more generally [[real-closed field]]s.  An algorithmic solution was found by [[Charles Neal Delzell|Charles Delzell]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0547.12017 | last=Delzell | first=C.N. | title=A continuous, constructive solution to Hilbert's 17th problem | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | volume=76 | pages=365–384 | year=1984 | doi=10.1007/BF01388465 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m18152477392j1t2/ | bibcode=1984InMat..76..365D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A result of [[Albrecht Pfister (mathematician)|Albrecht Pfister]]&lt;ref name=Pf1967&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pfister | first=Albrecht | authorlink=Albrecht Pfister (mathematician) | title=Zur Darstellung definiter Funktionen als Summe von Quadraten | language=German | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | volume=4 | pages=229–237 | year=1967 | zbl=0222.10022 | doi=10.1007/bf01425382| bibcode=1967InMat...4..229P }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that a positive semidefinite form in ''n'' variables can be expressed as a sum of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; squares.&lt;ref name=Lam391&gt;Lam (2005) p.391&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubois showed in 1967 that the answer is negative in general for [[ordered field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0164.04502 | last=Dubois | first=D.W. | title=Note on Artin's solution of Hilbert's 17th problem | journal=Bull.

A generalization to the matrix case (matrices with polynomial function entries that are always positive semidefinite can be expressed as sum of squares of symmetric matrices with rational function entries) was given by Gondard, [[Paulo Ribenboim|Ribenboim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0298.12104 | mr=432613 | last1=Gondard | first1=Danielle | last2=Ribenboim | first2=Paulo | author2-link=Paulo Ribenboim | title=Le 17e problème de Hilbert pour les matrices | journal=Bull.

== Minimum number of square rational terms ==

It is an open question what is the smallest number

:&lt;math&gt;v(n,d), &lt;/math&gt;

such that any ''n''-variate, non-negative polynomial of degree ''d'' can be written as sum of at most &lt;math&gt;v(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; square rational functions over the reals.

The best known result ({{As of|2008|lc=on}}) is

:&lt;math&gt;v(n,d)\leq2^n, &lt;/math&gt;

due to Pfister in 1967.&lt;ref name=Pf1967/&gt;

In complex analysis the Hermitian analogue, requiring the squares to be squared norms of holomorphic mappings, is somewhat more complicated, but true for positive polynomials by a result of Quillen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=0198.35205 | last1=Quillen | first1=Daniel G. | title=On the representation of hermitian forms as sums of squares | journal=Invent.

In [[inversive geometry]], an '''inverse curve''' of a given curve {{mvar|C}} is the result of applying an [[inversive geometry|inverse]] operation to {{mvar|C}}. Specifically, with respect to a fixed circle with center {{mvar|O}} and radius {{mvar|k}} the inverse of a point {{mvar|Q}} is the point {{mvar|P}} for which {{mvar|P}} lies on the ray {{mvar|OQ}} and {{math|''OP''·''OQ'' {{=}} ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The inverse of the curve {{mvar|C}} is then the locus of {{mvar|P}} as {{mvar|Q}} runs over {{mvar|C}}. The point {{mvar|O}} in this construction is called the '''center of inversion''', the circle the '''circle of inversion''', and {{mvar|k}} the '''radius of inversion'''.

An inversion applied twice is the identity transformation, so the inverse of an inverse curve with respect to the same circle is the original curve. Points on the circle of inversion are fixed by the inversion, so its inverse is itself.

==Equations==
The inverse of the point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} with respect to the [[unit circle]] is {{math|(''X'', ''Y'')}} where

:&lt;math&gt;X = \frac{x}{x^2+y^2},\qquad Y=\frac{y}{x^2+y^2},&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{X}{X^2+Y^2},\qquad y=\frac{Y}{X^2+Y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

So the inverse of the curve determined by {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}} with respect to the unit circle is

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(\frac{X}{X^2+Y^2}, \frac{Y}{X^2+Y^2}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear from this that inverting an algebraic curve of degree {{mvar|n}} with respect to a circle produces an algebraic curve of degree at most {{math|2''n''}}.

Similarly, the inverse of the curve defined [[Parametric equation|parametrically]] by the equations

:&lt;math&gt;x = x(t),\qquad y = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

with respect to the unit circle is given parametrically as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X=X(t)&amp;=\frac{x(t)}{x(t)^2 + y(t)^2}, \\
Y=Y(t)&amp;=\frac{y(t)}{x(t)^2 + y(t)^2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that the circular inverse of a [[rational curve]] is also rational.

More generally, the inverse of the curve determined by {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}} with respect to the circle with center {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} and radius {{mvar|k}} is

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(a+\frac{k^2(X-a)}{(X-a)^2+(Y-b)^2}, b+\frac{k^2(Y-b)}{(X-a)^2+(Y-b)^2}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of the curve defined parametrically by

:&lt;math&gt;x = x(t),\qquad y = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

with respect to the same circle is given parametrically as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X=X(t)&amp;=a+\frac{k^2\bigl(x(t)-a\bigr)}{\bigl(x(t)-a\bigr)^2 + \bigl(y(t)-b\bigr)^2}, \\
Y=Y(t)&amp;=b+\frac{k^2\bigl(y(t)-b\bigr)}{\bigl(x(t)-a\bigr)^2 + \bigl(y(t)-b\bigr)^2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[polar coordinates]], the equations are simpler when the circle of inversion is the unit circle. The inverse of the point {{math|(''r'', ''θ'')}} with respect to the [[unit circle]] is {{math|(''R'', ''Θ'')}} where

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{r},\qquad \Theta=\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

So the inverse of the curve {{math|''f''(''r'', ''θ'') {{=}} 0}} is determined by {{math|''f''({{sfrac|1|''R''}}, ''Θ'') {{=}} 0}} and the inverse of the curve {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''g''(''θ'')}} is {{math|''r'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''g''(''θ'')}}}}.

==Degrees==
As noted above, the inverse with respect to a circle of a curve of degree {{mvar|n}} has degree at most {{math|2''n''}}. The degree is exactly {{math|2''n''}} unless the original curve passes through the point of inversion or it is [[Circular algebraic curve|circular]], meaning that it contains the circular points, {{math|(1, ±''i'', 0)}}, when considered as a curve in the complex projective plane. In general, inversion with respect to an arbitrary curve may produce an algebraic curve with proportionally larger degree.

Specifically, if {{mvar|C}} is {{mvar|p}}-circular of degree {{mvar|n}}, and if the center of inversion is a singularity of order {{mvar|q}} on {{mvar|C}}, then the inverse curve will be an {{math|(''n'' − ''p'' − ''q'')}}-circular curve of degree {{math|2''n'' − 2''p'' − ''q''}} and the center of inversion is a singularity of order {{math|''n'' − 2''p''}} on the inverse curve. Here {{math|''q'' {{=}} 0}} if the curve does not contain the center of inversion and {{math|''q'' {{=}} 1}} if the center of inversion is a nonsingular point on it; similarly the circular points, {{math|(1, ±''i'', 0)}}, are singularities of order {{mvar|p}} on {{mvar|C}}. The value {{mvar|k}} can be eliminated from these relations to show that the set of {{mvar|p}}-circular curves of degree {{math|''p'' + ''k''}}, where {{mvar|p}} may vary but {{mvar|k}} is a fixed positive integer, is invariant under inversion.

==Examples==
Applying the above transformation to the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^2 + y^2\right)^2 = a^2 \left(x^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

gives us

:&lt;math&gt;a^2\left(u^2-v^2\right) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

the equation of a hyperbola; since inversion is a birational transformation and the hyperbola is a rational curve, this shows the lemniscate is also a rational curve, which is to say a curve of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] zero.

If we apply the transformation to the [[Fermat curve]] {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''y&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} 1}}, where {{mvar|n}} is odd, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\left(u^2+v^2\right)^n = u^n+v^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Any [[rational point]] on the Fermat curve has a corresponding rational point on this curve, giving an equivalent formulation of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].

==Particular cases==
For simplicity, the circle of inversion in the following cases will be the unit circle. Results for other circles of inversion can be found by translation and magnification of the original curve.

===Lines===
For a line passing through the origin, the polar equation is {{math|''θ'' {{=}} ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} where {{math|''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is fixed. This remains unchanged under the inversion.

The polar equation for a line not passing through the origin is

:&lt;math&gt;r\cos\left(\theta-\theta_0\right) = a&lt;/math&gt;

and the equation of the inverse curve is

:&lt;math&gt;r = a\cos\left(\theta-\theta_0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which defines a circle passing through the origin. Applying the inversion again shows that the inverse of a circle passing through the origin is a line.

===Circles===
In polar coordinates, the general equation for a circle that does not pass through the origin (the other cases having been covered) is

:&lt;math&gt;r^2 - 2r_0 r\cos\left(\theta-\theta_0\right) + r_0^2 - a^2 = 0,\qquad(a&gt;0,\ r&gt;0,\ a \ne r_0)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|a}} is the radius and {{math|(''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are the polar coordinates of the center. The equation of the inverse curve is then

:&lt;math&gt;1 - 2r_0 r\cos\left(\theta-\theta_0\right) + \left(r_0^2 - a^2\right)r^2 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;r^2 - \frac{2r_0}{r_0^2 - a^2} r\cos\left(\theta-\theta_0\right) + \frac{1}{r_0^2 - a^2} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the equation of a circle with radius

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{a}{\left|r_0^2 - a^2\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

and center whose polar coordinates are

:&lt;math&gt;\left(R_0, \Theta_0\right) = \left(\frac{r_0}{r_0^2 - a^2}, \theta_0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be negative.

If the original circle intersects with the unit circle, then the centers of the two circles and a point of intersection form a triangle with sides {{math|1, ''a'', ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} this is a right triangle, i.e. the radii are at right angles, exactly when

:&lt;math&gt;r_0^2 = a^2 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

But from the equations above, the original circle is the same as the inverse circle exactly when

:&lt;math&gt;r_0^2 - a^2 = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

So the inverse of a circle is the same circle if and only if it intersects the unit circle at right angles.

To summarize and generalize this and the previous section:
# The inverse of a line or a circle is a line or a circle.
# If the original curve is a line then the inverse curve will pass through the center of inversion. If the original curve passes through the center of inversion then the inverted curve will be a line.
# The inverted curve will be the same as the original exactly when the curve intersects the circle of inversion at right angles.

===Parabolas with center of inversion at the vertex===
The equation of a parabola is, up to similarity, translating so that the vertex is at the origin and rotating so that the axis is horizontal, {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In polar coordinates this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^2\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse curve then has equation

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos\theta} = \sin\theta \tan\theta&lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[cissoid of Diocles]].

===Conic sections with center of inversion at a focus===
The polar equation of a [[conic section]] with one focus at the origin is, up to similarity

: &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{1 + e \cos \theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where e is the eccentricity. The inverse of this curve will then be

: &lt;math&gt;r = 1 + e \cos \theta,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation of a [[Limaçon|limaçon of Pascal]]. When {{math|''e'' {{=}} 0}} this is the circle of inversion. When {{math|0 &lt; ''e'' &lt; 1}} the original curve is an ellipse and the inverse is a simple closed curve with an [[acnode]] at the origin. When {{math|''e'' {{=}} 1}} the original curve is a parabola and the inverse is the [[cardioid]] which has a cusp at the origin. When {{math|''e'' &gt; 1}} the original curve is a hyperbola and the inverse forms two loops with a [[crunode]] at the origin.

===Ellipses and hyperbolas with center of inversion at a vertex===
The general equation of an ellipse or hyperbola is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}\pm\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1.&lt;/math&gt;
Translating this so that the origin is one of the vertices gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x-a)^2}{a^2}\pm\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;
and rearranging gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{2a}\pm\frac{ay^2}{2b^2}=x&lt;/math&gt;
or, changing constants,
:&lt;math&gt;cx^2+dy^2=x. &lt;/math&gt;
Note that parabola above now fits into this scheme by putting {{math|''c'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''d'' {{=}} 1}}.
The equation of the inverse is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{cx^2}{\left(x^2+y^2\right)^2}+\frac{dy^2}{\left(x^2+y^2\right)^2}=\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;x\left(x^2+y^2\right) = cx^2+dy^2. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation describes a family of curves called the [[Conchoid of de Sluze|conchoids of de Sluze]]. This family includes, in addition to the cissoid of Diocles listed above, the [[trisectrix of Maclaurin]] ({{math|''d'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|''c''|3}}}}) and the [[right strophoid]] ({{math|''d'' {{=}} −''c''}}).

===Ellipses and hyperbolas with center of inversion at the center===
Inverting the equation of an ellipse or hyperbola

:&lt;math&gt;cx^2+dy^2=1 &lt;/math&gt;

gives

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^2+y^2\right)^2=cx^2+dy^2 &lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[hippopede]]. When {{math|''d'' {{=}} −''c''}} this is the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]].

===Conics with arbitrary center of inversion===
Applying the degree formula above, the inverse of a conic (other than a circle) is a circular cubic if the center of inversion is on the curve, and a bicircular quartic otherwise. Conics are rational so the inverse curves are rational as well. Conversely, any rational circular cubic or rational bicircular quartic is the inverse of a conic. In fact, any such curve must have a real singularity and taking this point as a center of inversion, the inverse curve will be a conic by the degree formula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathcurve.com/courbes2d/cubiccirculairerationnelle/cubiccirculairerationnelle.shtml "Cubique Circulaire Rationnelle" at Encyclopédie des Formes Mathématiques Remarquables]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathcurve.com/courbes2d/quarticbicirculairerationnelle/quarticbicirculairerationnelle.shtml "Quartique Bicirculaire Rationnelle" at Encyclopédie des Formes Mathématiques Remarquables]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anallagmatic curves==
An '''anallagmatic curve''' is one which inverts into itself.  Examples include the [[circle]], [[cardioid]], [[oval of Cassini]], [[strophoid]], and [[trisectrix of Maclaurin]].

{{Intelligent Design}}

'''Irreducible complexity''' ('''IC''') is the idea that certain [[biological system]]s cannot [[evolution|evolve]] by successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems through [[natural selection]]. Irreducible complexity is central to the [[creationism|creationist]] concept of [[intelligent design]], but it is rejected by the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref name="dover_behe_ruling"&gt;"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."

The theological [[teleological argument|argument from design]] was presented in [[creation science]] with assertions that evolution could not explain complex molecular mechanisms, and in 1993 [[Michael Behe]], a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, presented these arguments in a revised version of ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''.&lt;ref name="bio design classrooms" /&gt; In his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' he called this ''irreducible complexity'' and said it made evolution through natural selection of random mutations impossible.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last= Behe |first= Michael |title= Darwin's Black Box |publisher= Free Press |location= New York |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-0-684-82754-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the mistaken assumption that evolution relies on improvement of existing functions, ignoring how complex adaptations originate from changes in function, and disregarding published research.&lt;ref name="bio design classrooms" /&gt; [[evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] have published rebuttals showing how systems discussed by Behe can evolve,&lt;ref name="thornton2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redundant Complexity"/&gt; and examples documented through [[comparative genomics]] show that complex molecular systems are formed by the addition of components as revealed by different temporal origins of their proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10724.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602072257/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10724.html |archivedate=2014-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-341|title=Evolution of xyloglucan-related genes in green plants|first1=Luiz Eduardo V.|last1=Del Bem|first2=Michel GA|last2=Vincentz|date=5 November 2010|publisher=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=10|pages=341|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=BioMed Central|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe gave testimony on the subject of irreducible complexity. The court found that "Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."&lt;ref name="dover_behe_ruling"/&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Michael Behe]] defined irreducible complexity in natural selection in his book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;... a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Black Box'' page 39 in the 2006 edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second definition given by Behe (his "evolutionary definition") is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An irreducibly complex evolutionary pathway is one that contains one or more unselected steps (that is, one or more necessary-but-unselected mutations). The degree of irreducible complexity is the number of unselected steps in the pathway.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade: Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison'', July 31, 2000, [http://www.discovery.org/a/442 Discovery Institute article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906193225/http://www.discovery.org/a/442 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Intelligent design advocate [[William A. Dembski]] gives this definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A system performing a given basic function is irreducibly complex if it includes a set of well-matched, mutually interacting, nonarbitrarily individuated parts such that each part in the set is indispensable to maintaining the system's basic, and therefore original, function. The set of these indispensable parts is known as the irreducible core of the system.&lt;ref&gt;''No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence.'' by William Dembski pp. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Forerunners===
The argument from irreducible complexity is a descendant of the [[teleological argument]] for God (the argument from design or from complexity). This states that because certain things in nature appear very complicated, they must have been designed. [[William Paley]] famously argued, in his 1802 [[watchmaker analogy]], that complexity in nature implies a God for the same reason that the existence of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker.&lt;ref name="paley"/&gt; This argument has a long history, and one can trace it back at least as far as [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' ii.34,&lt;ref&gt;''On the Nature of the Gods'', translated by Francis Brooks, London: Methuen, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Henry Hallam]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpDzTASTVwsC&amp;pg=PA385 ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Centuries'' Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1854] volume 2 page 385 part iii chapter iii section i paragraph 26 footnote ''u''&lt;/ref&gt; written in 45 BC.

====Up to the 18th century====

[[Galen]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) wrote about the large number of parts of the body and their relationships, which observation was cited as evidence for creation.&lt;ref&gt;''De Formatione Foetus''=''The Construction of the Embryo'', chapter 11 in ''Galen: Selected Works'', translated by P. N. Singer, ''The World's Classics'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-19-282450-9}}. One 18th-century reference to Galen is [http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm#A13 [[David Hume]] ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', 1779, Part 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122134556/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm |date=2005-11-22 }}, &amp;sect; 3, page 215. Also see Galen's ''De Usu Partium''=''On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body'', translated and edited by Margaret Tallmadge May, Ithaca, New York, Cornell University Press, 1968, especially book XVII. For a relevant discussion of Galen and other ancients see pages 121-122, {{cite book |author= Goodman, Lenn Evan |title= Creation and evolution |location= Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon and New York |publisher= Routledge |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-415-91380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the interdependence between parts would have implications for the origins of living things was raised by writers starting with [[Pierre Gassendi]] in the mid-17th century&lt;ref&gt;''De Generatione Animalium'', chapter III. Partial translation in: Howard B. Adelmann, ''Marcello Malpighi and the Evolution of Embryology'' Ithaca, New York, Cornell University Press, 1966, volume 2, pages 811-812.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John Wilkins]] (1614-1672), who wrote (citing Galen), "Now to imagine, that all these things, according to their several kinds, could be brought into this regular frame and order, to which such an infinite number of Intentions are required, without the contrivance of some wise Agent, must needs be irrational in the highest degree."&lt;ref&gt;John Wilkins,''Of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion'', London, 1675, book I, chapter 6, page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th-century, [[Thomas Burnet]] referred to "a multitude of pieces aptly joyn'd" to argue against the [[eternity]] of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/ste/ste07.htm ''The Sacred Theory of the Earth''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020060523/http://sacred-texts.com/earth/ste/ste07.htm |date=2007-10-20 }}, 2nd edition, London: Walter Kettilby, 1691.

====19th century====
Chapter XV of Paley's ''Natural Theology'' discusses at length what he called "relations" of parts of living things as an indication of their design.&lt;ref name="paley"&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 William Paley:''Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity. Collected from the Appearances of Nature'' 12th edition, 1809] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430030715/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 |date=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Cuvier]] applied his principle of the ''correlation of parts'' to describe an animal from fragmentary remains. For Cuvier, this  related to another principle of his, the ''conditions of existence'', which excluded the possibility of [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;See especially chapters VI and VII of {{cite book|author= William Coleman |title= Georges Cuvier, Zoologist: A Study in the History of Evolution Theory |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1964}} See also the discussion of these principles in the Wikipedia article on [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While he did not originate the term, [[Charles Darwin]] identified the argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction of the theory of evolution at the outset. In ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), he wrote, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[The Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=207 page 189, Chapter VI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930011159/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=207 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's theory of evolution challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, evolution by natural selection. By showing how simple unintelligent forces can ratchet up designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, Darwin showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, {{cite book|author= Alan R.

In the late 19th century, in a dispute between supporters of the adequacy of [[natural selection]] and those who held for [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], one of the arguments made repeatedly by [[Herbert Spencer]], and followed by others, depended on what Spencer referred to as ''co-adaptation'' of ''co-operative'' parts, as in: &lt;blockquote&gt;"We come now to Professor [[August Weismann|Weismann]]'s endeavour to disprove my second thesis — that it is impossible to explain by natural selection alone the co-adaptation of co-operative parts. It is thirty years since this was set forth in "The Principles of Biology." In §166, I instanced the enormous horns of the extinct [[Irish elk]], and contended that in this and in kindred cases, where for the efficient use of some one enlarged part many other parts have to be simultaneously enlarged, it is out of the question to suppose that they can have all spontaneously varied in the required proportions."&lt;ref&gt;Page 594 in: {{cite journal|author= Herbert Spencer|title= Weismannism Once More|journal= [[The Contemporary Review]]|date= October 1894|volume= 66 |pages= 592–608}} Another essay of Spencer's treating this concept is: {{cite journal|author= Herbert Spencer |title= The Inadequacy of "Natural Selection" |journal= The Contemporary Review |volume= 63 |year= 1893 |pages= 153–166}} (Part I: February) and pages 439-456 (Part II: March).

====20th century====
[[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]], in the early 20th century, discussed a concept similar to irreducible complexity. However, far from seeing this as a problem for evolution, he described the "interlocking" of biological features as a consequence to be expected of evolution, which would lead to irreversibility of some evolutionary changes.&lt;ref name="Muller_1918"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Muller HJ |title= Genetic variability, twin hybrids and constant hybrids, in a case of balanced lethal factors |journal= Genetics |volume= 3 |issue= 5 |pages= 422–99 |year= 1918 |url= http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/3/5/422 |pmid= 17245914 |pmc= 1200446 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070518220445/http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/3/5/422 |archivedate= 2007-05-18 |df=  }}, especially pages 463–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "Being thus finally woven, as it were, into the most intimate fabric of the organism, the once novel character can no longer be withdrawn with impunity, and may have become vitally necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Muller HJ |title= Reversibility in evolution considered from the standpoint of genetics |journal= Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= 14 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–80, quotation from 272 |year= 1939 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1939.tb00934.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] [[Henry M. Morris]] introduced a similar concept in his book ''Scientific Creationism'', in which he wrote; "This issue can actually be attacked quantitatively, using simple principles of mathematical probability. The problem is simply whether a complex system, in which many components function unitedly together, and in which each component is uniquely necessary to the efficient functioning of the whole, could ever arise by random processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Henry M. Morris|Morris, Henry]] |title= Scientific creationism |publisher= Creation-Life Publishers |location= San Diego, Calif |year= 1974 |page= 59 |isbn= 0-89051-003-2 |edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 [[Thomas H. Frazzetta]] published a book-length study of a concept similar to irreducible complexity, explained by gradual, step-wise, non-teleological evolution. Frazzetta wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"A complex adaptation is one constructed of ''several'' components that must blend together operationally to make the adaptation "work". It is analogous to a machine whose performance depends upon careful cooperation among its parts. In the case of the machine, no single part can greatly be altered without changing the performance of the entire machine."&lt;/blockquote&gt; The machine that he chose as an analog is the [[Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage]], and one biological system given extended description was the jaw apparatus of a python. The conclusion of this investigation, rather than that evolution of a complex adaptation was impossible, "awed by the adaptations of living things, to be stunned by their complexity and suitability", was "to accept the inescapable but not humiliating fact that much of mankind can be seen in a tree or a lizard."&lt;ref&gt;T.

In 1981, Ariel Roth, in defense of the [[creation science|creation-science]] position in the trial ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'', said of "complex integrated structures": "This system would not be functional until all the parts were there ... How did these parts survive during evolution ...?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Keough, Mark J. |author2= Geisler, Norman L. |title= The Creator in the courtroom "Scopes II": the 1981 Arkansas creation-evolution trial |publisher= Mott Media |location= Milford, Mich |year= 1982 |page= 146 |isbn= 0-88062-020-X |url= http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/docs/geislerbook.htm#Chapter%20Seven |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070623192424/http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/docs/geislerbook.htm#Chapter%20Seven |archivedate= 2007-06-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Cairns-Smith]] wrote of "interlocking": "How can a complex collaboration between components evolve in small steps?" and used the analogy of the scaffolding called [[centring|centering]] - used to [[arch#Construction|build an arch]] then removed afterwards: "Surely there was 'scaffolding'.

An essay in support of [[creationism]] published in 1994 referred to bacterial [[flagella]] as showing "multiple, integrated components", where "nothing about them works unless every one of their complexly fashioned and integrated components are in place".

An early concept of irreducibly complex systems comes from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (1901-1972), an Austrian biologist.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1952). ''Problems of Life: An Evaluation of Modern Biological and Scientific Thought, pg 148'' {{ISBN|1-131-79242-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that complex systems must be examined as complete, [[irreducibility|irreducible]] systems in order to fully understand how they work. He extended his work on biological complexity into a general theory of systems in a book titled ''[[systems theory|General Systems Theory]]''.

After [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] published the structure of [[DNA]] in the early 1950s, General Systems Theory lost many of its adherents in the physical and biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Monod, Jacques 
|title= Chance and necessity: an essay on the natural philosophy of modern biology |publisher= Vintage Books |location= New York |year= 1972 |isbn= 0-394-71825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Systems theory remained popular in the social sciences long after its demise in the physical and biological sciences.

===Origins===
[[File:Darwinsblackbox.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Michael Behe]]'s controversial book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'' popularized the concept of irreducible complexity.]]

[[Michael Behe]] developed his ideas on the concept around 1992, in the early days of the '[[wedge strategy|wedge movement]]', and first presented his ideas about "irreducible complexity" in June 1993 when the "Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars" met at Pajaro Dunes in California.&lt;ref name=bfwedge&gt;[[Barbara Forrest]], [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm#I The Wedge at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905230611/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Wedge.cfm |date=2014-09-05 }}.

Sonleitner (1994)&lt;br/&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/critique-pandas-people Introduction: Of Pandas and People, the foundational work of the 'Intelligent Design' movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229222228/http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/critique-pandas-people |date=2008-12-29 }} by Nick Matzke 2004,&lt;br/&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/rncse/26/1-2/design-trial Design on Trial in Dover, Pennsylvania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229192206/http://ncseweb.org/rncse/26/1-2/design-trial |date=2008-12-29 }} by Nicholas J Matzke, NCSE Public Information Project Specialist&lt;/ref&gt;

He first used the term "irreducible complexity" in his 1996 book ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', to refer to certain complex biochemical [[cell (biology)|cellular]] systems. He posits that evolutionary mechanisms cannot explain the development of such "irreducibly complex" systems. Notably, Behe credits philosopher [[William Paley]] for the original concept (alone among the predecessors) and suggests that his application of the concept to biological systems is entirely original.

Intelligent design advocates argue that irreducibly complex systems must have been deliberately engineered by some form of [[intelligent designer|intelligence]].

In 2001, [[Michael Behe]] wrote: "[T]here is an asymmetry between my current definition of irreducible complexity and the task facing natural selection. I hope to repair this defect in future work." Behe specifically explained that the "current definition puts the focus on removing a part from an already functioning system", but the "difficult task facing Darwinian evolution, however, would not be to remove parts from sophisticated pre-existing systems; it would be to bring together components to make a new system in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Behe MJ |title=Reply to My Critics: A Response to Reviews of Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=685–709 |date=November 2001 |url=http://friends-of-wisdom.com/readings/Behe2001.pdf |doi=10.1023/A:1012268700496 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040554/http://friends-of-wisdom.com/readings/Behe2001.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe testified under oath that he "did not judge [the asymmetry] serious enough to [have revised the book] yet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12am2.html Behe's testimony in ''Kitzmiller v. Dover''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629222457/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day12am2.html |date=2006-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behe additionally testified that the presence of irreducible complexity in organisms would not rule out the involvement of evolutionary mechanisms in the development of organic life. He further testified that he knew of no earlier "peer reviewed articles in scientific journals discussing the intelligent design of the blood clotting cascade," but that there were "probably a large number of peer reviewed articles in science journals that demonstrate that the blood clotting system is indeed a purposeful arrangement of parts of great complexity and sophistication."&lt;ref&gt;Behe, Michael 2005 [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 88 of 139|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 4: whether ID is science (p. 88)]]&lt;/ref&gt; (The judge ruled that "intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature".)&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District 6: Conclusion, section H]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory of evolution, genetic variations occur without specific design or intent. The environment "selects" the variants that have the highest fitness, which are then passed on to the next generation of organisms. Change occurs by the gradual operation of natural forces over time, perhaps slowly, perhaps more quickly (see [[punctuated equilibrium]]). This process is able to [[adaptation|adapt]] complex structures from simpler beginnings, or convert complex structures from one function to another (see [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]). Most intelligent design advocates accept that evolution occurs through mutation and natural selection at the "[[microevolution|micro level]]", such as changing the relative frequency of various beak lengths in finches, but assert that it cannot account for irreducible complexity, because none of the parts of an irreducible system would be functional or advantageous until the entire system is in place.

===The mousetrap example===
[[File:Mausefalle 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Michael Behe]] believes that many aspects of life show evidence of design, using the [[mousetrap]] in an analogy disputed by others.&lt;ref name=trap&gt;[http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html A reducibly complex mousetrap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041104/http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html |date=2014-02-22 }} (graphics-intensive, requires [[JavaScript]])&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Behe uses the mousetrap as an illustrative example of this concept. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. All of these must be in place for the mousetrap to work, as the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Likewise, he asserts that biological systems require multiple parts working together in order to function. Intelligent design advocates claim that natural selection could not create from scratch those systems for which science is currently unable to find a viable evolutionary pathway of successive, slight modifications, because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled.

In his 2008 book ''[[Only A Theory]]'', biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] challenges Behe's claim that the mousetrap is irreducibly complex.&lt;ref name=Only /&gt; Miller observes that various subsets of the five components can be devised to form cooperative units, ones that have different functions from the mousetrap and so, in biological terms, could form functional [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]] before being adapted to the new function of catching mice. In an example taken from his high school experience, Miller recalls that one of his classmates&lt;blockquote&gt;...struck upon the brilliant idea of using an old, broken mousetrap as a spitball catapult, and it worked brilliantly.... It had worked perfectly as something other than a mousetrap.... my rowdy friend had pulled a couple of parts --probably the hold-down bar and catch-- off the trap to make it easier to conceal and more effective as a catapult... [leaving] the base, the spring, and the hammer. Not much of a mousetrap, but a helluva spitball launcher.... I realized why [Behe's] mousetrap analogy had bothered me. It was wrong. The mousetrap is not irreducibly complex after all.&lt;ref name=Only&gt;{{cite book |title= Only A Theory |first= Kenneth R. |last= Miller |location= New York |year= 2008 |publisher= Viking Penguin |pages= 54–55 |isbn= 978-0-670-01883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other systems identified by Miller that include mousetrap components include the following:&lt;ref name= Only/&gt;
*use the spitball launcher as a tie clip (same three-part system with different function)
*remove the spring from the spitball launcher/tie clip to create a two-part key chain (base + hammer)
*glue the spitball launcher/tie clip to a sheet of wood to create a clipboard (launcher + glue + wood)
*remove the hold-down bar for use as a toothpick (single element system)

The point of the reduction is that - in biology - most or all of the components were already at hand, by the time it became necessary to build a mousetrap. As such, it required far fewer steps to develop a mousetrap than to design all the components from scratch.

Thus, the development of the mousetrap, said to consist of five different parts which had no function on their own, has been reduced to one step: the assembly from parts that are already present, performing other functions.

The Intelligent Design argument focuses on the functionality to catch mice. It skips over the case that many, if not all, parts are already available in their own right, at the time that the need for a mousetrap arises.

===Consequences===

Supporters of intelligent design argue that anything less than the complete form of such a system or organ would not work at all, or would in fact be a ''detriment'' to the organism, and would therefore never survive the process of natural selection. Although they accept that some complex systems and organs ''can'' be explained by evolution, they claim that organs and biological features which are ''irreducibly complex'' cannot be explained by current models, and that an intelligent designer must have created life or guided its evolution. Accordingly, the debate on irreducible complexity concerns two questions: whether irreducible complexity can be found in nature, and what significance it would have if it did exist in nature.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Behe's original examples of irreducibly complex mechanisms included the bacterial [[flagellum]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[coagulation|the blood clotting cascade]], [[cilia]], and the [[adaptive immune system]].

Behe argues that organs and biological features which are irreducibly complex cannot be wholly explained by current models of [[evolution]]. In explicating his definition of "irreducible complexity" he notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irreducible complexity is not an argument that evolution does not occur, but rather an argument that it is "incomplete". In the last chapter of ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', Behe goes on to explain his view that irreducible complexity is evidence for [[intelligent design]]. Mainstream critics, however, argue that irreducible complexity, as defined by Behe, can be generated by known evolutionary mechanisms. Behe's claim that no scientific literature adequately modeled the origins of biochemical systems through evolutionary mechanisms has been challenged by [[TalkOrigins Archive|TalkOrigins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html Claim CA350: Professional literature is silent on the subject of the evolution of biochemical systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304172657/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA350.html |date=2007-03-04 }} TalkOrigins Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Behe |first= Michael J. |authorlink= Michael Behe |title= Darwin's black box: the biochemical challenge to evolution |isbn= 0-684-82754-9 |page= 72 |chapter= |quote= "Yet here again the evolutionary literature is totally missing.

Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 74 of 139|Ruling]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], December 2005. Page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stated examples==
Behe and others have suggested a number of biological features that they believe may be irreducibly complex.

===Blood clotting cascade===
The process of blood clotting or [[coagulation]] cascade in vertebrates is a complex biological pathway which is given as an example of apparent irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Action, George [http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb97.html "Behe and the Blood Clotting Cascade"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050605075004/http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb97.html |date=2005-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary, and therefore could not have been added sequentially. However, in evolution, something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boudry |first=Maarten |authorlink=Maarten Boudry |last2=Blancke |first2=Stefaan |last3=Braeckman |first3=Johan |authorlink3=Johan Braeckman |title=Irreducible Incoherence and Intelligent Design: A Look into the Conceptual Toolbox of a Pseudoscience |journal=[[Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=473–82 |publisher= |date=September 2010 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/maartenboudry/irreducible-incoherence |issn= |doi=10.1086/656904 |accessdate= |pmid=21243965 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095300/http://sites.google.com/site/maartenboudry/irreducible-incoherence |archivedate=2010-11-30 |df= |hdl=1854/LU-952482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural selection]] can lead to complex biochemical systems being built up from simpler systems, or to existing functional systems being recombined as a new system with a different function.&lt;ref name=kitz74/&gt; For example, one of the clotting factors that Behe listed as a part of the clotting cascade ([[Factor XII]], also called Hageman factor) was later found to be absent in whales, demonstrating that it is not essential for a clotting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Semba U, Shibuya Y, Okabe H, Yamamoto T |title=Whale Hageman factor (factor XII): prevented production due to pseudogene conversion |journal=Thromb Res |year=1998 |pages=31–7 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pmid=9678675 |doi= 10.1016/S0049-3848(97)00307-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many purportedly irreducible structures can be found in other organisms as much simpler systems that utilize fewer parts. These systems, in turn, may have had even simpler precursors that are now extinct. Behe has responded to critics of his clotting cascade arguments by suggesting that [[homology (biology)|homology]] is evidence for evolution, but not for natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Behe, Michael [http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_indefenseofbloodclottingcascade.htm "In Defense of the Irreducibility of the Blood Clotting Cascade: Response to Russell Doolittle, Ken Miller and Keith Robison"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917181325/http://arn.org/docs/behe/mb_indefenseofbloodclottingcascade.htm |date=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "improbability argument" also misrepresents natural selection. It is correct to say that a set of simultaneous mutations that form a complex protein structure is so unlikely as to be unfeasible, but that is not what Darwin advocated. His explanation is based on small accumulated changes that take place without a final goal. Each step must be advantageous in its own right, although biologists may not yet understand the reason behind all of them—for example, [[jawless fish]] accomplish blood clotting with just six proteins instead of the full ten.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18725073.800 Creationism special: A sceptic's guide to intelligent design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506100626/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18725073.800 |date=2015-05-06 }}, New Scientist, 9 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye===

The [[eye]] is an example of a supposedly irreducibly complex structure, due to its many elaborate and interlocking parts, seemingly all dependent upon one another. It is frequently cited by intelligent design and creationism advocates as an example of irreducible complexity. Behe used the "development of the eye problem" as evidence for intelligent design in ''Darwin's Black Box''. Although Behe acknowledged that the evolution of the larger anatomical features of the eye have been well-explained, he pointed out that the complexity of the minute biochemical reactions required at a molecular level for light sensitivity still defies explanation. Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] has described the eye as evolutionary biologists' "greatest challenge as an example of superb 'irreducible complexity' in God's creation", specifically pointing to the supposed "vast complexity" required for transparency.&lt;ref name="aig"&gt;[[Jonathan Sarfati|Sarfati, Jonathan]] (2000).

However, the quote in context shows that Darwin actually had a very good understanding of the evolution of the eye (see [[fallacy of quoting out of context]]). He notes that "to suppose that the eye ... could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree". Yet this observation was merely a [[procatalepsis|rhetorical device]] for Darwin. He goes on to explain that if gradual evolution of the eye could be shown to be possible, "the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection ... can hardly be considered real". He then proceeded to roughly map out a likely course for evolution using examples of gradually more complex eyes of various species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859).

Since Darwin's day, the eye's ancestry has become much better understood. Although learning about the construction of ancient eyes through fossil evidence is problematic due to the soft tissues leaving no imprint or remains, genetic and comparative anatomical evidence has increasingly supported the idea of a common ancestry for all eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halder G, Callaerts P, Gehring WJ |title=New perspectives on eye evolution |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=602–9 |date=October 1995 |pmid=8664548 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |doi=10.1016/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507170439/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0959-437X(95)80029-8 |archivedate=2018-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halder G, Callaerts P, Gehring WJ |title=Induction of ectopic eyes by targeted expression of the eyeless gene in Drosophila |journal=Science |volume=267 |issue=5205 |pages=1788–92 |date=March 1995 |pmid=7892602 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7892602 |doi=10.1126/science.7892602 |bibcode=1995Sci...267.1788H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomarev SI, Callaerts P, Kos L, etal |title=Squid Pax-6 and eye development |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=2421–6 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9122210 |pmc=20103 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9122210 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.6.2421 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.2421T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current evidence does suggest possible evolutionary lineages for the origins of the anatomical features of the eye. One likely chain of development is that the eyes originated as simple patches of [[photoreceptor cell]]s that could detect the presence or absence of light, but not its direction. When, via random mutation across the population, the photosensitive cells happened to have developed on a small depression, it endowed the organism with a better sense of the light's source. This small change gave the organism an advantage over those without the mutation. This genetic trait would then be "selected for" as those with the trait would have an increased chance of survival, and therefore progeny, over those without the trait. Individuals with deeper depressions would be able to discern changes in light over a wider field than those individuals with shallower depressions. As ever deeper depressions were advantageous to the organism, gradually, this depression would become a pit into which light would strike certain cells depending on its angle. The organism slowly gained increasingly precise visual information. And again, this gradual process continued as individuals having a slightly shrunken [[aperture]] of the eye had an advantage over those without the mutation as an aperture increases how [[collimated]] the light is at any one specific group of photoreceptors. As this trait developed, the eye became effectively a [[pinhole camera]] which allowed the organism to dimly make out shapes—the [[nautilus]] is a modern example of an animal with such an eye. Finally, via this same selection process, a protective layer of transparent cells over the aperture was differentiated into a crude [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and the interior of the eye was filled with humours to assist in focusing images.&lt;ref&gt;Fernald, Russell D. (2001).

Behe maintains that the complexity of light sensitivity at the molecular level and the minute biochemical reactions required for those first "simple patches of photoreceptor[s]" still defies explanation, and that the proposed series of infinitesimal steps to get from patches of photoreceptors to a fully functional eye would actually be considered great, complex leaps in evolution if viewed on the molecular scale. Other intelligent design proponents claim that the evolution of the entire visual system would be difficult rather than the eye alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Meaningful World|year=2006|author1=Benjamin Wiker |author2=Jonathan Witt |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flagella===
{{Main article|Evolution of flagella}}

The [[flagella]] of certain bacteria constitute a [[molecular motor]] requiring the interaction of about 40 different protein parts. Behe presents this as a prime example of an irreducibly complex structure defined as "a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning", and argues that since "an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional", it could not have evolved gradually through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Flagellum Unspun"/&gt;

'''Reducible complexity'''. In contrast to Behe's claims, many proteins can be deleted or mutated and the flagellum still works, even though sometimes at reduced efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rajagopala SV, Titz B, Goll J, Parrish JR, Wohlbold K, McKevitt MT, Palzkill T, Mori H, ((Finley RL Jr)), Uetz P |year= 2007 |title= The protein network of bacterial motility |url= |journal= Mol Syst Biol |volume= 3 |issue= |page= 128 |doi= 10.1038/msb4100166 |pmid= 17667950 |pmc=1943423}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the composition of flagella is surprisingly diverse across bacteria with many proteins only found in some species but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Titz B, Rajagopala SV, Ester C, Häuser R, Uetz P |date= Nov 2006 |title= Novel conserved assembly factor of the bacterial flagellum |journal= J Bacteriol |volume= 188 |issue= 21 |pages= 7700–6 |doi= 10.1128/JB.00820-06 |pmid= 16936039 |pmc=1636259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the flagellar apparatus is clearly very flexible in evolutionary terms and perfectly able to lose or gain protein components.

===Cilium motion===

The [[cilium]] construction of [[axoneme]] microtubules movement by the sliding of [[dynein]] protein was cited by Behe as an example of irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;page 90: "Just as a mousetrap does not work unless all of its constituent parts are present, ciliary motion simply does not exist in the absence of microtubules, connectors, and motors.  Therefore we can conclude that the cilium is irreducibly complex - an enormous monkey wrench thrown into its presumed gradual, Darwinian evolution."{{cite book | title = Signs of Intelligence, article Darwin's Breakdown: Irreducible Complexity and Design at the Foundation of Life | author = [[Michael Behe|Behe, Michael]]| year = 1999

They claim that Behe overestimated the significance of irreducible complexity because of his simple, linear view of biochemical reactions, resulting in his taking snapshots of selective features of biological systems, structures, and processes, while ignoring the redundant complexity of the context in which those features are naturally embedded. They also criticized his over-reliance of overly simplistic metaphors, such as his mousetrap.

A computer model of the co-evolution of proteins binding to DNA in the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Nucleic Acids Research]]'' consisted of several parts (DNA binders and DNA binding sites) which contribute to the basic function; removal of either one leads immediately to the death of the organism. This model fits the definition of irreducible complexity exactly, yet it evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Thomas D. Schneider|Schneider TD]] |title=Evolution of Biological Information |journal= Nucleic Acids Research |year=2000 |pages=2794–2799 |volume=28 |issue=14 |pmid=10908337 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.14.2794 |pmc=102656}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The program can be run from [http://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/papers/ev/ Ev program].)

In addition, research published in the peer-reviewed journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] has shown that computer simulations of evolution demonstrate that it is possible for complex features to evolve naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Richard Lenski|Lenski RE]], Ofria C, Pennock RT, Adami C |title= The evolutionary origin of complex features |journal= Nature |year= 2003 |pages= 139–44 |volume= 423 |issue= 6936 |pmid= 12736677 |doi= 10.1038/nature01568|bibcode= 2003Natur.423..139L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can compare a mousetrap with a cat in this context. Both normally function so as to control the mouse population. The cat has many parts that can be removed leaving it still functional; for example, its tail can be bobbed, or it can lose an ear in a fight. Comparing the cat and the mousetrap, then, one sees that the mousetrap (which is not alive) offers better evidence, in terms of irreducible complexity, for intelligent design than the cat. Even looking at the mousetrap analogy, several critics have described ways in which the parts of the mousetrap could have independent uses or could develop in stages, demonstrating that it is not irreducibly complex.&lt;ref name=trap/&gt;&lt;ref name=Only/&gt;

Moreover, even cases where removing a certain component in an organic system will cause the system to fail do not demonstrate that the system could not have been formed in a step-by-step, evolutionary process. By analogy, stone arches are irreducibly complex&amp;mdash;if you remove any stone the arch will collapse—yet humans [[arch#Construction|build them]] easily enough, one stone at a time, by building over [[centring|centering]] that is removed afterward. Similarly, [[natural arch|naturally occurring arches]] of stone form by the weathering away of bits of stone from a large concretion that has formed previously.

Evolution can act to simplify as well as to complicate. This raises the possibility that seemingly irreducibly complex biological features may have been achieved with a period of increasing complexity, followed by a period of simplification.

A team led by [[Joseph Thornton (biologist)|Joseph Thornton]], assistant professor of biology at the [[University of Oregon]]'s Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, using techniques for resurrecting ancient genes, reconstructed the evolution of an apparently irreducibly complex molecular system. The April 7, 2006 issue of ''Science'' published this research.&lt;ref name="thornton2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bridgham JT, Carroll SM, Thornton JW |title=Evolution of hormone-receptor complexity by molecular exploitation |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5770 |pages=97–101 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16601189 |doi=10.1126/science.1123348 |bibcode= 2006Sci...312...97B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=746 Press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033744/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=746 |date=2007-09-30 }} University of Oregon, April 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreducible complexity may not actually exist in nature, and the examples given by Behe and others may not in fact represent irreducible complexity, but can be explained in terms of simpler precursors. The theory of [[facilitated variation]] challenges irreducible complexity. [[Marc W. Kirschner]], a professor and chair of Department of Systems Biology at [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[John C. Gerhart]], a professor in Molecular and Cell Biology, [[University of California, Berkeley]], presented this theory in 2005. They describe how certain mutation and changes can cause apparent irreducible complexity. Thus, seemingly irreducibly complex structures are merely "very complex", or they are simply misunderstood or misrepresented.

===Gradual adaptation to new functions===
{{Main article|Exaptation}}
The precursors of complex systems, when they are not useful in themselves, may be useful to perform other, unrelated functions. Evolutionary biologists argue that evolution often works in this kind of blind, haphazard manner in which the function of an early form is not necessarily the same as the function of the later form. The term used for this process is [[exaptation]]. The [[evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles|mammalian middle ear]] (derived from a jawbone) and the [[giant panda|panda]]'s thumb (derived from a wrist bone spur) provide classic examples. A 2006 article in ''Nature'' demonstrates intermediate states leading toward the development of the ear in a [[Devonian]] fish (about 360 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nature |volume= 439 |pages= 318–21 |date= January 19, 2006 |author1=M. Brazeau |author2=P. Ahlberg |doi= 10.1038/nature04196 |issue= 7074 |title= Tetrapod-like middle ear architecture in a Devonian fish |pmid= 16421569|bibcode= 2006Natur.439..318B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, recent research shows that viruses play a heretofore unexpected role in evolution by mixing and matching genes from various hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boto|first=Luis|date=October 28, 2009|title=Horizontal gene transfer in evolution: facts and challenges|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1683/819|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=|pages=|via=The Royal Society Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments for irreducibility often assume that things started out the same way they ended up&amp;mdash;as we see them now. However, that may not necessarily be the case. In the ''Dover'' trial an expert witness for the plaintiffs, Ken Miller, demonstrated this possibility using Behe's mousetrap analogy. By removing several parts, Miller made the object unusable as a mousetrap, but he pointed out that it was now a perfectly functional, if unstylish, [[tie clip]].&lt;ref name=Only/&gt;&lt;ref name=NOVAChapter8&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3416_id_08.html |title= NOVA: Transcripts: Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial Chapter 8 |date= November 13, 2007 |publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate= 2008-12-17 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081123085214/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3416_id_08.html |archivedate= November 23, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods by which irreducible complexity may evolve===
{{further|Evolvability}}

Irreducible complexity can be seen as equivalent to an "uncrossable valley" in a [[fitness landscape]]. A number of mathematical models of evolution have explored the circumstances under which such valleys can, nevertheless, be crossed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weissman|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Desai|first2=Michael M.|last3=Fisher|first3=Daniel S. |last4=Feldman |first4=Marcus W.|title=The rate at which asexual populations cross fitness valleys|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=June 2009 |volume=75 |issue=4|pages=286–300|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2009.02.006|pmid=19285994|pmc=2992471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weissman|first1=D.

===Falsifiability and experimental evidence===
Some critics, such as [[Jerry Coyne]] (professor of [[evolutionary biology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]) and [[Eugenie Scott]] (a [[physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]] and former executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]]) have argued that the concept of irreducible complexity and, more generally, [[intelligent design]] is not [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] and, therefore, not [[scientific]].

Behe argues that the theory that irreducibly complex systems could not have evolved can be falsified by an experiment where such systems are evolved. For example, he posits taking bacteria with no [[flagella|flagellum]] and imposing a selective pressure for mobility. If, after a few thousand generations, the bacteria evolved the bacterial flagellum, then Behe believes that this would refute his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evolutionnews.org/2016/10/philosophical_o/|title=Philosophical Objections to Intelligent Design: A Response to Critics|last=Behe|first=Michael|date=October 27, 2016|website=Evolution News &amp; Science Today|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=August 2018}}

Other critics take a different approach, pointing to experimental evidence that they believe falsifies the argument for Intelligent Design from irreducible complexity. For example, [[Kenneth R. Miller|Kenneth Miller]] cites the lab work of Barry G. Hall on [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], which he asserts is evidence that "Behe is wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Miller K |title= Finding Darwin's God: a scientist's search for common ground between God and evolution |publisher= Cliff Street Books |location= New York |year= 1999 |isbn= 0-06-093049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other evidence that irreducible complexity is not a problem for evolution comes from the field of [[computer science]], which routinely uses computer analogues of the processes of evolution in order to automatically design complex solutions to problems. The results of such [[genetic algorithm]]s are frequently irreducibly complex since the process, like evolution, both removes non-essential components over time as well as adding new components. The removal of unused components with no essential function, like the natural process where rock underneath a [[natural arch]] is removed, can produce irreducibly complex structures without requiring the intervention of a designer. Researchers applying these algorithms automatically produce human-competitive designs—but no human designer is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genetic-programming.com/humancompetitive.html|title=Human Competitive|author=|date=|website=www.genetic-programming.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708052427/http://www.genetic-programming.com/humancompetitive.html|archivedate=8 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from ignorance===
Intelligent design proponents attribute to an intelligent designer those biological structures they believe are irreducibly complex and therefore they say a natural explanation is insufficient to account for them.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Behe. [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=51 Evidence for Intelligent Design from Biochemistry.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903185728/http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=51 |date=2006-09-03 }} 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics view irreducible complexity as a special case of the "complexity indicates design" claim, and thus see it as an [[argument from ignorance]] and as a [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] argument.&lt;ref name="isaak_ci101"&gt;Index to Creationist Claims. Mark Isaak. The Talk.Origins Archive. "Irreducible complexity and complex specified information are special cases of the "complexity indicates design" claim; they are also arguments from incredulity." {{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI101.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004031017/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc//CI/CI101.html |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }} "The argument from incredulity creates a god of the gaps." {{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020072309/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA100.html |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugenie Scott]], along with [[Glenn Branch]] and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent-design proponents are arguments from ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenie C. Scott]] and Glenn Branch, [http://ncseweb.org/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists "Intelligent Design" Not Accepted by Most Scientists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330203658/http://ncseweb.org/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists |date=2009-03-30 }}, National Center for Science Education website, September 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Behe has been accused by critics &lt;ref&gt;Patheos.com essay: An argument premised on the author's lack of imagination.{{cite web |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/essays/darwins-black-box/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715212827/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/essays/darwins-black-box/ |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amerikanbeat.net: A Critique of Behe, Dembski on "Irreducible Complexity"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100910063051/http://amerikanbeat.net/contact-amerikanbeat/a-critique-of-behe-dembski-on-%E2%80%9Cirreducible-complexity%E2%80%9D/]&lt;/ref&gt; of using an "argument by lack of imagination".

===False dilemma===
Irreducible complexity is at its core an argument against evolution. If truly irreducible systems are found, the argument goes, then [[intelligent design]] must be the correct explanation for their existence. However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that current [[evolution]]ary theory and intelligent design are the only two valid models to explain life, a [[false dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html IC and Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813171254/http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/icdmyst/ICDmyst.html |date=2004-08-13 }} makes the point that: if "irreducible complexity" is tautologically redefined to allow a valid argument that [[intelligent design]] is the correct explanation for life then there is no such thing as "irreducible complexity" in the mechanisms of life; while, if we use the unmodified original definition then "irreducible complexity" has nothing whatever to do with evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Dover]]'' noted that this implicit assumption of the defendant school board created a "flawed and illogical contrived dualism" (Opinion p. 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Dover trial==
While testifying during the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed papers supporting his claims that complex [[molecular]] systems, like the bacterial flagellum, the blood-clotting cascade, and the immune system, were intelligently designed nor are there any peer-reviewed articles supporting his argument that certain complex molecular structures are "irreducibly complex."&lt;ref name="Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science"/&gt;

In the final ruling of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', Judge Jones specifically singled out Behe and irreducible complexity:&lt;ref name=Kitzmiller_ruling_ID_science&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science|Memorandum Opinion, Judge John E. Jones III, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Professor Behe admitted in "Reply to My Critics" that there was a defect in his view of irreducible complexity because, while it purports to be a challenge to natural selection, it does not actually address "the task facing natural selection." and that "Professor Behe wrote that he hoped to "repair this defect in future work..." (Page 73)
*"As expert testimony revealed, the qualification on what is meant by "irreducible complexity" renders it meaningless as a criticism of evolution. (3:40 (Miller)). In fact, the theory of evolution proffers exaptation as a well-recognized, well-documented explanation for how systems with multiple parts could have evolved through natural means." (Page 74)
*"By defining irreducible complexity in the way that he has, Professor Behe attempts to exclude the phenomenon of exaptation by definitional fiat, ignoring as he does so abundant evidence which refutes his argument. Notably, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS]] has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity..." (Page 75)
*"As irreducible complexity is only a negative argument against evolution, it is refutable and accordingly testable, unlike ID [Intelligent Design], by showing that there are intermediate structures with selectable functions that could have evolved into the allegedly irreducibly complex systems. (2:15-16 (Miller)). Importantly, however, the fact that the negative argument of irreducible complexity is testable does not make testable the argument for ID. (2:15 (Miller); 5:39 (Pennock)). Professor Behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems: (1) the bacterial flagellum; (2) the blood-clotting cascade; and (3) the immune system. Contrary to Professor Behe's assertions with respect to these few biochemical systems among the myriad existing in nature, however, Dr. Miller presented evidence, based upon peer-reviewed studies, that they are not in fact irreducibly complex." (Page 76)
*"...on cross-examination, Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system. He was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not "good enough." (23:19 (Behe))." (Page 78)
*"We therefore find that Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large. (17:45-46 (Padian); 3:99 (Miller)). Additionally, even if irreducible complexity had not been rejected, it still does not support ID as it is merely a test for evolution, not design. (2:15, 2:35-40 (Miller); 28:63-66 (Fuller)). We will now consider the purportedly "positive argument" for design encompassed in the phrase used numerous times by Professors Behe and Minnich throughout their expert testimony, which is the "purposeful arrangement of parts." Professor Behe summarized the argument as follows: We infer design when we see parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose. The strength of the inference is quantitative; the more parts that are arranged, the more intricately they interact, the stronger is our confidence in design. The appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming. Since nothing other than an intelligent cause has been demonstrated to be able to yield such a strong appearance of design, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, the conclusion that the design seen in life is real design is rationally justified. (18:90-91, 18:109-10 (Behe); 37:50 (Minnich)). As previously indicated, this argument is merely a restatement of the [[William Paley|Reverend William Paley]]'s argument applied at the cell level. Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God. (1:6- 7 (Miller); 38:44, 57 (Minnich)). Expert testimony revealed that this inductive argument is not scientific and as admitted by Professor Behe, can never be ruled out. (2:40 (Miller); 22:101 (Behe); 3:99 (Miller))." (Pages 79–80)

In [[probability theory]], '''Isserlis’ theorem''' or '''Wick’s theorem''' is a formula that allows one to compute higher-order moments of the [[multivariate normal distribution]] in terms of its covariance matrix.  It is named after [[Leon Isserlis]].

This theorem is particularly important in [[particle physics]], where it is known as [[Wick's theorem]] after the work of {{harvtxt|Wick|1950}}. Other applications include the analysis of portfolio returns,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Repetowicz|Richmond|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; quantum field theory&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Perez-Martin|Robledo|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generation of colored noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartosch|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorem statement==
===The Isserlis theorem===
If &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots X_{2n})&lt;/math&gt; is a zero-mean [[multivariate normal]] random vector, then
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    &amp; \operatorname{E} [\,X_1 X_2\cdots X_{2n}\,] = \sum\prod \operatorname{E}[\,X_i X_j\,] = \sum\prod \operatorname{Cov}(\,X_i, X_j\,), \\
    &amp; \operatorname{E}[\,X_1 X_2\cdots X_{2n-1}\,] = 0,
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the notation ∑&amp;thinsp;∏ means summing over all distinct ways of partitioning ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; into pairs ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and each summand is the product of the ''n'' pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Michalowicz|Nichols|Bucholtz|Olson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This yields &lt;math&gt;(2n)!/(2^{n}n!) = (2n-1)!!&lt;/math&gt; terms in the sum (see [[double factorial]]). For example, for fourth order moments (four variables) there are three terms. For sixth-order moments there are 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5 = 15 terms, and for eighth-order moments there are 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;7 = 105 terms (as you can check in the examples below). 

In his original paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Isserlis|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Isserlis]] proves this theorem by mathematical induction, generalizing the formula for the fourth-order moments,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Isserlis|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; which takes the appearance
: &lt;math&gt;
    \operatorname{E}[\,X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4\,] =
        \operatorname{E}[X_1X_2]\,\operatorname{E}[X_3X_4] +
        \operatorname{E}[X_1X_3]\,\operatorname{E}[X_2X_4] +
        \operatorname{E}[X_1X_4]\,\operatorname{E}[X_2X_3].
  &lt;/math&gt;
For sixth-order moments, Isserlis' theorem is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4 X_5 X_6] \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_2 ]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_4 ]\operatorname{E}[X_5 X_6 ] + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_2 ]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_5 ]\operatorname{E}[X_4 X_6] + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_2 ]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_6 ]\operatorname{E}[X_4 X_5] \\[5pt]
&amp; {} + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_3 ]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_4 ]\operatorname{E}[X_5 X_6 ] + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_3 ]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_5 ]\operatorname{E}[X_4 X_6 ] + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_3]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_6]\operatorname{E}[X_4 X_5] \\[5pt]
&amp; {} + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_4]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_3]\operatorname{E}[X_5 X_6]+\operatorname{E}[X_1 X_4]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_5]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_6]+\operatorname{E}[X_1 X_4]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_6]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_5] \\[5pt]
&amp; {} + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_5]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_3]\operatorname{E}[X_4 X_6]+\operatorname{E}[X_1 X_5]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_4]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_6]+\operatorname{E}[X_1 X_5]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_6]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_4] \\[5pt]
&amp; {} + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_6]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_3]\operatorname{E}[X_4 X_5 ] + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_6]\operatorname{E}[X_2 X_4 ]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_5] + \operatorname{E}[X_1 X_6] \operatorname{E}[X_2 X_5]\operatorname{E}[X_3 X_4].

'''John Hamal Hubbard''' (born October 6 or 7, 1945; the actual date is unknown) is an American [[mathematician]] and professor at [[Cornell University]] and the [[Université de Provence]]. He is well known for the mathematical contributions he made with [[Adrien Douady]] in the field of [[complex dynamics]], including a study of the [[Mandelbrot set]].  One of their most important results is that the [[Mandelbrot set]] is [[connected space|connected]].

== Background ==
Hubbard graduated with a [[Doctorat d'État]] from [[Universite de Paris|Université de Paris-Sud]] in 1973 under the direction of [[Adrien Douady]]; his thesis was entitled ''Sur Les Sections Analytiques de La Courbe Universelle de Teichmüller'' and was published by the [[American Mathematical Society]]. Hubbard has a variety of mathematical interests ranging from [[complex analysis]] to [[differential geometry]]. He has written many influential papers on [[complex dynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Douady|first = Adrien|author2 = Hubbard, John Hamal|title = On the dynamics of polynomial-like mappings|journal = Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure|volume = 18|issue = 2|year = 1985|pages = 287–343|url = http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/search?h=nc&amp;ma=67319&amp;id=ASENS_1985_4_18_2_287_0&amp;format=complete|accessdate = 2007-03-11|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070524200514/http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/search?h=nc&amp;ma=67319&amp;id=ASENS_1985_4_18_2_287_0&amp;format=complete|archivedate = 2007-05-24|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Hubbard|first = John H|author2=Oberste-Vorth, Ralph W.|title = Hénon mappings in the complex domain I : the global topology of dynamical space|journal = Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS|volume = 79|pages = 5–46|year = 1994|url = http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?h=nc&amp;id=PMIHES_1994__79__5_0|accessdate = 2007-03-11|doi=10.1007/bf02698886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John H. Hubbard and Ralph W. Oberste-Vorth (1994) [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.DS/9401224 Henon mappings in the complex domain II: projective and inductive limits of polynomials]&lt;/ref&gt; and he has written several books.

== Legacy ==
In 2006, he completed another book: the first volume of a series devoted to [[Teichmüller space|Teichmüller theory]] and applications to four revolutionary theorems of  [[William Thurston]]. Hubbard is a former student of [[Harvard University]]'s infamous [[Math 55]], where he famously struggled initially because he "just didn't know proofs." He later returned to [[Harvard]] to teach that same class. However, Hubbard developed a profound distaste for Math 55's method of teaching proofs largely centered on [[algebra]]ic [[mathematical induction|induction]]. In response, he and his wife Barbara wrote the book ''Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach''.

== Personal life ==
He is married to Barbara Burke Hubbard, the science writer. Together they have a son, Alexander, and three younger daughters, Eleanor, Judith and Diana. The children sometimes help them with their books, in illustration, writing answer keys and pointing out the minor errors.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, John; Hubbard, Barbara. ''Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach''&lt;/ref&gt;

They are counted by the Kostka number ''K''&lt;sub&gt;λμ&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Kostka number''' ''K''&lt;sub&gt;λμ&lt;/sub&gt; (depending on two [[Partition (number theory)|integer partitions]] λ and μ) is a [[non-negative integer]] that is equal to the number of [[semistandard Young tableaux]] of shape λ and weight μ.  They were introduced by the mathematician [[Carl Kostka]] in his study of symmetric functions ({{harvtxt|Kostka|1882}}).&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Enumerative combinatorics, volume 2, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if λ = (3, 2) and μ = (1, 1, 2, 1), the Kostka number ''K''&lt;sub&gt;λμ&lt;/sub&gt; counts the number of ways to fill a left-aligned collection of boxes with 3 in the first row and 2 in the second row with 1 copy of the number 1, 1 copy of the number 2, 2 copies of the number 3 and 1 copy of the number 4 such that the entries increase along columns and do not decrease along rows.  The three such tableaux are shown at right, and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(3, 2) (1, 1, 2, 1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.

==Examples and special cases==
For any partition λ, the Kostka number ''K''&lt;sub&gt;λλ&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to 1: the unique way to fill the [[Young diagram]] of shape λ = (λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) with λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; copies of 1, λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; copies of 2, and so on, so that the resulting tableau is weakly increasing along rows and strictly increasing along columns is if all the 1s are placed in the first row, all the 2s are placed in the second row, and so on.  (This tableau is sometimes called the [[Yamanouchi tableau]] of shape λ.)

The Kostka number ''K''&lt;sub&gt;λμ&lt;/sub&gt; is positive (i.e., there exist semistandard Young tableaux of shape λ and weight μ) if and only if λ and μ are both partitions of the same integer ''n'' and λ is larger than μ in [[dominance order]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Enumerative combinatorics, volume 2, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, there are no nice formulas known for the Kostka numbers.  However, some special cases are known.  For example, if μ = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1) is the partition whose parts are all 1 then a semistandard Young tableau of weight μ is a standard Young tableau; the number of standard Young tableaux of a given shape λ is given by the [[hook-length formula]].

==Properties==
An important simple property of Kostka numbers is that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;λμ&lt;/sub&gt; does not depend on the order of entries of μ. For example, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(3, 2) (1, 1, 2, 1)&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(3, 2) (1, 1, 1, 2)&lt;/sub&gt;. This is not immediately obvious from the definition but can be shown by establishing a bijection between the sets of semistandard Young tableaux of shape λ and weights μ and μ', where μ and μ' differ only by swapping two entries.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Enumerative combinatorics, volume 2, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kostka numbers, symmetric functions and representation theory==
In addition to the purely [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] definition above, they can also be defined as the coefficients that arise when one expresses the [[Schur polynomial]] ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; as a [[linear combination]] of [[Ring of symmetric functions#Defining individual symmetric functions|monomial symmetric functions]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;s_\lambda= \sum_\mu K_{\lambda\mu}m_\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

where λ and μ are both partitions of ''n''. Alternatively, Schur polynomials can also be expressed&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Enumerative combinatorics, volume 2, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;s_\lambda= \sum_\alpha K_{\lambda\alpha} x^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over all [[Composition_(combinatorics)|weak compositions]] α of ''n'' and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the monomial ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#x22EF;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

Because of the connections between symmetric function theory and [[representation theory]], Kostka numbers also express the decomposition of the [[permutation module]] ''M''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the representations ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the character ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt;M_\mu = \bigoplus_{\lambda} K_{\lambda \mu} V_\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

On the level of representations of the [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;, the Kostka number ''K''&lt;sub&gt;λμ&lt;/sub&gt; counts the dimension of the [[weight space]] corresponding to μ in the [[irreducible representation]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; (where we require μ and λ to have at most ''n'' parts).

==Examples==
The Kostka numbers for partitions of size at most 3 are as follows:
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(0) (0)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 (here (0) represents the empty partition)
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(1) (1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(2) (2)&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(2) (1,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(1,1) (1,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(1,1) (2)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(3) (3)&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(3) (2,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(3) (1,1,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(2,1) (3)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(2,1) (2,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(2,1) (1,1,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2
: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(1,1,1) (3)&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(1,1,1) (2,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;(1,1,1) (1,1,1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1

These values are exactly the coefficients in the expansions of Schur functions in terms of monomial symmetric functions:
:''s'' = ''m'' = 1 (indexed by the empty partition)
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;111&lt;/sub&gt;
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''m''&lt;sub&gt;111&lt;/sub&gt;
:''s''&lt;sub&gt;111&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;111.&lt;/sub&gt;

{{harvtxt|Kostka|1882|loc=pages 118-120}} gave tables of these numbers for partitions of numbers up to 8.

==Generalizations==
Kostka numbers are special values of the 1 or 2 variable [[Kostka polynomial]]s: 
: &lt;math&gt;K_{\lambda\mu}= K_{\lambda\mu}(1)=K_{\lambda\mu}(0,1). &lt;/math&gt;

In [[probability theory]] and [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[statistics]], the '''law of total cumulance''' is a generalization to [[cumulant]]s of the [[law of total probability]], the [[law of total expectation]], and the [[law of total variance]].  It has applications in the analysis of [[time series]].  It was introduced by David Brillinger.&lt;ref&gt;David Brillinger, "The calculation of cumulants via conditioning", ''Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics'', Vol. 21 (1969), pp. 215&amp;ndash;218.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is most transparent when stated in its most general form, for ''joint'' cumulants, rather than for cumulants of a specified order for just one [[random variable]].  In general, we have

: &lt;math&gt; \kappa(X_1,\dots,X_n)=\sum_\pi \kappa(\kappa(X_i : i\in B \mid Y) : B \in \pi),&lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''κ''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the joint cumulant of ''n'' random variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and
* the sum is over all [[partition of a set|partitions]] &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; of the set {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;} of indices, and
* "''B'' &amp;isin; {{pi}};" means ''B'' runs through the whole list of "blocks" of the partition {{pi}}, and
* ''κ''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is a conditional cumulant given the value of the random variable&amp;nbsp;''Y''.  It is therefore a random variable in its own right&amp;mdash;a function of the random variable&amp;nbsp;''Y''.

==Examples==

===The special case of just one random variable and ''n'' = 2 or 3===

Only in case ''n'' = either 2 or 3 is the ''n''th cumulant the same as the ''n''th [[central moment]].  The case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 is well-known (see [[law of total variance]]).  Below is the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.  The notation ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; means the third central moment.

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_3(X)= \operatorname{E}(\mu_3(X\mid Y))+\mu_3(\operatorname{E}(X\mid Y))
+3\operatorname{cov}(\operatorname{E}(X\mid Y),\operatorname{var}(X\mid Y)).&lt;/math&gt;

===General 4th-order joint cumulants===

For general 4th-order cumulants, the rule gives a sum of 15 terms, as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \kappa(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; \left.\begin{matrix}
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_2,X_3\mid Y),\kappa(X_4\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_2,X_4\mid Y),\kappa(X_3\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_3,X_4\mid Y),\kappa(X_2\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_2,X_3,X_4\mid Y),\kappa(X_1\mid Y))
\end{matrix}\right\}(\text{partitions of the 3+1 form}) \\[5pt]
&amp; \left.\begin{matrix}
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_2\mid Y),\kappa(X_3,X_4\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_3\mid Y),\kappa(X_2,X_4\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_4\mid Y),\kappa(X_2,X_3\mid Y))\end{matrix}\right\}(\text{partitions of the 2+2 form}) \\[5pt]
&amp; \left.\begin{matrix}
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_2\mid Y),\kappa(X_3\mid Y),\kappa(X_4\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_3\mid Y),\kappa(X_2\mid Y),\kappa(X_4\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1,X_4\mid Y),\kappa(X_2\mid Y),\kappa(X_3\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_2,X_3\mid Y),\kappa(X_1\mid Y),\kappa(X_4\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_2,X_4\mid Y),\kappa(X_1\mid Y),\kappa(X_3\mid Y)) \\[5pt]
&amp; {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_3,X_4\mid Y),\kappa(X_1\mid Y),\kappa(X_2\mid Y))
\end{matrix}\right\}(\text{partitions of the 2+1+1 form}) \\[5pt]
&amp; \begin{matrix} {}+\kappa(\kappa(X_1\mid Y),\kappa(X_2\mid Y),\kappa(X_3\mid Y),\kappa(X_4\mid Y)). \end{matrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Cumulants of compound Poisson random variables===

Suppose ''Y'' has a [[Poisson distribution]] with [[expected value]] 1, and ''X'' is the sum of ''Y'' copies of ''W'' that are [[statistical independence|independent]] of each other and of&amp;nbsp;''Y''.

:&lt;math&gt;X=\sum_{y=1}^Y W_y.&lt;/math&gt;

All of the cumulants of the Poisson distribution are equal to each other, and so in this case are equal to 1.  Also recall that if random variables ''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[statistical independence|independent]], then the ''n''th cumulant is additive:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_n(W_1+\cdots+W_m)=\kappa_n(W_1)+\cdots+\kappa_n(W_m).&lt;/math&gt;

We will find the 4th cumulant of ''X''.  We have:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\kappa_4(X) = {} &amp; \kappa(X,X,X,X) \\[8pt]
= {} &amp;\kappa_1(\kappa_4(X\mid Y))+4\kappa(\kappa_3(X\mid Y),\kappa_1(X\mid Y))+3\kappa_2(\kappa_2(X\mid Y)) \\
&amp; {}+6\kappa(\kappa_2(X\mid Y),\kappa_1(X\mid Y),\kappa_1(X\mid Y))+\kappa_4(\kappa_1(X\mid Y)) \\[8pt]
= {} &amp; \kappa_1(Y\kappa_4(W))+4\kappa(Y\kappa_3(W),Y\kappa_1(W))
+3\kappa_2(Y\kappa_2(W)) \\
&amp; {}+6\kappa(Y\kappa_2(W),Y\kappa_1(W),Y\kappa_1(W))
+\kappa_4(Y\kappa_1(W)) \\[8pt]
= {} &amp; \kappa_4(W)\kappa_1(Y)+4\kappa_3(W)\kappa_1(W)\kappa_2(Y)
+3\kappa_2(W)^2 \kappa_2(Y) \\
&amp; {}+6\kappa_2(W) \kappa_1(W)^2 \kappa_3(Y)+\kappa_1(W)^4 \kappa_4(Y) \\[8pt]
= {} &amp; \kappa_4(W)+4\kappa_3(W)\kappa_1(W)+3\kappa_2(W)^2+6\kappa_2(W) \kappa_1(W)^2+\kappa_1(W)^4. \\[8pt]
= {} &amp; E(W^4) \qquad\text{(the punch line -- see the explanation below).}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

We recognize this last sum as the sum over all partitions of the set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, of the product over all blocks of the partition, of cumulants of ''W'' of order equal to the size of the block.  That is precisely the 4th raw [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of ''W'' (see [[cumulant]] for a more leisurely discussion of this fact).  Hence the moments of ''W'' are the cumulants of ''X''.

In this way we see that every moment sequence is also a cumulant sequence (the converse cannot be true, since cumulants of even order ≥&amp;nbsp;4 are in some cases negative, and also because the cumulant sequence of the [[normal distribution]] is not a moment sequence of any probability distribution).

===Conditioning on a Bernoulli random variable===

Suppose ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 with probability&amp;nbsp;''p'' and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 with probability&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''.  Suppose the conditional probability distribution of ''X'' given ''Y'' is ''F'' if ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''G'' if ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_n(X)=p\kappa_n(F)+q\kappa_n(G)+\sum_{\pi&lt;\widehat{1}} \kappa_{\left|\pi\right|}(Y)\prod_{B\in\pi}
(\kappa_{\left|B\right|}(F)-\kappa_{\left|B\right|}(G))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;\widehat{1}&lt;/math&gt; means {{pi}} is a partition of the set {&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;} that is finer than the coarsest partition &amp;ndash; the sum is over all partitions except that one.  For example, if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_3(X)=p\kappa_3(F)+q\kappa_3(G)+3pq(\kappa_2(F)-\kappa_2(G))(\kappa_1(F)-\kappa_1(G))+pq(q-p)(\kappa_1(F)-\kappa_1(G))^3.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Marcel-Paul "Marco" Schützenberger''' (October 24, 1920 – July 29, 1996) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and Doctor of Medicine.  He worked in the fields of [[formal language]], [[combinatorics]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref name="WilfEtAl1996"&gt;Herbert Wilf, Dominique Foata, ''et al.'', "[http://combinatorics.math.upenn.edu/Volume_3/Html/v3i1f1.html In Memoriam: Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, 1920-1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095810/http://combinatorics.math.upenn.edu/Volume_3/Html/v3i1f1.html |date=2011-07-20 }}," ''Electronic Journal of Combinatorics'', served from University of Pennsylvania Dept. of Mathematics Server, article dated 12 October 1996, retrieved from WWW on 4 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his formal results in [[mathematics]], he was "deeply involved in [a] struggle against the [[Votary|votaries]] of [[Neo-Darwinism|[neo-]Darwinism]]",&lt;ref name="Foata1996"&gt;Foata, Dominique, "In Memoriam," ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; a stance which has resulted in some mixed reactions from his peers and from critics of his stance on [[evolution]]. Several notable theorems and objects in mathematics as well as computer science bear his name (for example [[Schutzenberger group]] or the [[Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy]]). [[Paul Schützenberger]] was his great-grandfather.

In the late 1940s, he was briefly married to the psychologist [[Anne Ancelin Schützenberger]].&lt;ref name="orange"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a.ancelin.schutzenberger.pagesperso-orange.fr/|title=Anne Ancelin Schützenberger|language=fr|website=orange.fr|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to medicine and biology==
Schützenberger's first doctorate, in medicine, was awarded in 1948 from the ''Faculté de Médecine de Paris''.&lt;ref name="SchutzenBerger1948"&gt;Schützenberger, Marcel-Paul, ''[http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1948-12TheseMedecine.pdf Contribution à l'étude statistique du sexe à la naissance]'', Doctoral thesis, ''Faculté de Médecine de Paris'', 2 July 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis, on the statistical study of gender at birth, was distinguished by the [[Dominique Jean Larrey|Baron Larrey]] Prize from the [[French Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="Besson2001"&gt;Besson, Jaques, "''[http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Souvenirs/Contributions/JacquesBesson/MPSParBesson.pdf La quête de M.

Biologist Jaques Besson, a co-author with Schützenberger on a biological topic,&lt;ref&gt;Besson, Jaques, Gavaudan, Pierre, &amp; Schützenberger, Marcel-Paul, "''[http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1969-1AcidesAminesCras.pdf Sur l'existence d'une certaine corrélation entre le poids moléculaire des acides aminés et le nombre de triplets intervenant dans leurs codages]''," ''C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris'', No. 268, pp. 1342–1344, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; while noting that Schützenberger is perhaps most remembered for work in pure mathematical fields, credits him&lt;ref name="Besson2001"/&gt; for likely being responsible for the introduction of statistical sequential analysis in French hospital practice.&lt;ref name="Schutzenberger1949"&gt;Schützenberger, Marcel-Parul, "''[http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1949-5AnalyseSeqSHP.pdf Une application de l'analyse séquentielle]''," ''Semaine des Hôpitaux de Paris'', Vol. 25 No. 60, pp. 2562–2564, 14 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician [[David Berlinski]] provided this dedication in his 2000 book ''The Advent of The Algorithm: The Idea that Rules the World'':  À la mémoire de mon ami . . M. P. Schützenberger, 1921-1996.

==Trivia==
* The character "Dr. Schütz" in [[Boris Vian]]'s 1948 novel, ''Et on tuera tous les affreux'', is said to have been inspired by  Schützenberger.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.astroline.ro/P_Marcel-Paul_Schutzenberger__145.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929101351/http://www.astroline.ro/P_Marcel-Paul_Schutzenberger__145.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Together with many of his students, Schützenberger is one of the contributors of the pseudonymous collective [[M. Lothaire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1499">The '''Maximum Degree-and-Diameter-Bounded Subgraph problem (MaxDDBS)''' is a problem in [[graph theory]]. 

Given a connected ''host graph G'', an upper bound for the degree ''d'', and an upper bound for the diameter ''k'', we look for the largest subgraph ''S'' of ''G'' with maximum degree at most ''d'' and diameter at most ''k''. This problem is also referred to as the Degree-Diameter Subgraph Problem, as it contains the [[degree diameter problem]] as a special case (namely, by taking a sufficiently large complete graph as a host graph). Despite being a natural generalization of the Degree-Diameter Problem, MaxDDBS only began to be investigated in 2011, while research in the Degree-Diameter Problem has been active since the 1960s. Regarding its computational complexity, the problem is NP-hard, and not in APX (i.e. it cannot be approximated to within a constant factor in polynomial time).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5211">A '''metacharacter''' is a character that has a special meaning to a computer program, such as a [[Shell (computing)|shell interpreter]] or a [[regular expression]] (regex) engine.

In [[regular expression|POSIX extended regular expression]]s,&lt;ref name="susre"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6: Ch. 9{{Snd}} Regular Expressions |url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html |website=pubs.opengroup.org |publisher=[[The Open Group]] |accessdate=2018-11-19 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 14 metacharacters that must be ''escaped'' (preceded by a backslash ("\")) in order to drop their special meaning and be treated literally inside an expression: opening and closing [[bracket#Square brackets|square brackets]] ("[" and "]"); [[backslash]] ("\"); [[caret]] ("^"); [[dollar sign]] ("$"); period/[[full stop]]/dot ("."); [[vertical bar]]/pipe symbol ("|"); [[question mark]] ("?"); [[asterisk]] ("*"); [[plus and minus signs#Plus sign|plus sign]] ("+"); opening and closing [[bracket#Curly brackets|curly brackets]]/braces ("{" and "}"); and opening and closing [[bracket#Parentheses|parentheses]] ("(" and ")").&lt;ref name="REinfo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goyvaerts |first1=Jan |title=Regular Expressions Quick Start |url=http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html |website=www.regular-expressions.info |accessdate=2018-11-19 |date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ORA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nield |first1=Thomas |title=An introduction to regular expressions |url=https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/an-introduction-to-regular-expressions |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |accessdate=2018-11-19 |language=en |date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, to match the arithmetic expression "(1+1)*3=6" with a regex, the correct regex is "\(1\+1\)\*3=6"; otherwise, the parentheses, plus sign, and asterisk will have special meanings.

==Other examples==
{{Anchor|Examples}}
Some other characters may have special meaning in some environments.
* In some [[Unix shell]]s the [[semicolon]] (";") is a [[Comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Statements|statement separator]].
* In [[XML]] and [[HTML]], the [[ampersand]] ("&amp;") introduces an [[Character encodings in HTML|HTML entity]].&lt;ref name="W3Ccer"&gt;{{cite web |title=Character entity references in HTML 4 |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities |website=www.w3.org |publisher=[[W3C]] |accessdate=2018-11-19 |language=en |date=December 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has special meaning in [[MS-DOS]]/[[cmd.exe|Windows Command Prompt]].&lt;ref name="MSFTcso"&gt;{{cite web |title=Command shell overview |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490954(v=technet.10) |website=docs.microsoft.com |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2018-11-19 |language=en-us |date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some Unix shells and MS-DOS/Windows Command Prompt, the [[less-than sign]] and [[greater-than sign]] ("&lt;" and "&gt;") are used for [[redirection (computing)|redirection]] and the [[grave accent]]/backquote ("`") is used for [[command substitution]].&lt;ref name="MSFTcso" /&gt;
* In many [[programming language]]s, [[String (computer science)|string]]s are [[Delimiter|delimited]] using [[Quotation mark|quotes]] (" or '). In some cases, [[escape character]]s (and other methods) are used to avoid [[delimiter collision]], e.g. "He said, \"Hello\"".
* In [[printf format string]]s, the [[percent sign]] ("%") is used to introduce format specifiers and must be escaped as "%%" to be interpreted literally.&lt;ref name="TOGfprintf"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7: fprintf |url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html |website=pubs.opengroup.org |publisher=[[The Open Group]] |accessdate=2018-11-19 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[SQL]], the percent is used as a [[wildcard character]].&lt;ref name="TSQL-LIKE" /&gt;
* In SQL, the [[underscore]] ("_") is used to match any single character.&lt;ref name="TSQL-LIKE"&gt;{{cite web |title=LIKE (Transact-SQL) |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/like-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017 |website=docs.microsoft.com |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2018-11-19 |language=en-us |date=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escaping==
{{Main article|Escape character}}
The term "to escape a metacharacter" means to make the metacharacter ineffective (to strip it of its special meaning), causing it to have its literal meaning. For example, in [[PCRE]], a dot (".") stands for any single character. The regular expression "A.C" will match "ABC", "A3C", or even "A C". However, if the "." is escaped, it will lose its meaning as a metacharacter and will be interpreted literally as ".", causing the regular expression "A\.C" to only match the string "A.C".

The usual way to escape a character in a regex and elsewhere is by prefixing it with a backslash ("\"). Other environments may employ different methods, like MS-DOS/Windows Command Prompt, where a caret ("^") is used instead.&lt;ref name="MSFTcso" /&gt;

In its classical form, one is given two [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and asked to find an [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which most closely maps &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hurley | first1=J.R. | last2=Cattell | first2=R.B. | year=1962 | title=Producing direct rotation to test a hypothesized factor structure | journal = Behavioral Science | volume = 7 | pages=258&amp;ndash;262 | doi=10.1002/bs.3830070216 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically,

:&lt;math&gt;R = \arg\min_\Omega\|\Omega A-B\|_F \quad\mathrm{subject\ to}\quad \Omega^T
\Omega=I,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_F&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Frobenius norm]].  This is a special case of [[Wahba's problem]] (with identical weights; instead of considering two matrices, in Wahba's problem the columns of the matrices are considered as individual vectors).

The name [[Procrustes]] refers to a bandit from Greek mythology who made his victims fit his bed by either stretching their limbs or cutting them off.

== Solution ==
This problem was originally solved by [[Peter Schönemann]] in a 1964 thesis, and shortly after appeared in the journal Psychometrika. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Schönemann | first=P.H. | authorlink = Peter Schönemann | year=1966 | title=A generalized solution of the orthogonal Procrustes problem | journal=Psychometrika | volume=31 | pages=1–10 | url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs273/refs/procrustes.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF02289451 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proof appeared in 1998. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Zhang | first = Z. |title = A Flexible New Technique for Camera Calibration | series = Microsoft Research Technical Report | volume=71 | url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/zhang/Papers/TR98-71.pdf  | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is equivalent to finding the nearest orthogonal matrix to a given matrix &lt;math&gt;M=BA^{T}&lt;/math&gt;.  To find this orthogonal matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, one uses the [[singular value decomposition]]
:&lt;math&gt;M=U\Sigma V^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
to write
:&lt;math&gt;R=UV^T.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==

One proof depends on basic properties of the [[Frobenius inner product|matrix inner product]] that induces the [[Frobenius norm]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
R &amp;= \arg\min_\Omega ||\Omega A-B\|_F^2 \\
&amp;= \arg\min_\Omega  \langle \Omega A-B, \Omega A-B \rangle  \\
&amp;= \arg\min_\Omega  \|A\|_F^2 + \|B\|_F^2 - 2 \langle \Omega A , B \rangle  \\
&amp;= \arg\max_\Omega  \langle \Omega , B A^T \rangle  \\
&amp;= \arg\max_\Omega  \langle \Omega, U\Sigma V^T \rangle  \\
&amp;= \arg\max_\Omega  \langle U^T \Omega V , \Sigma \rangle  \\
&amp;= \arg\max_\Omega  \langle S , \Sigma \rangle  \quad \text{where } S = U^T \Omega V \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
:This quantity &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an orthonormal matrix (as it is a product of orthonormal matrices) and thus the expression is maximised when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;equals the identity matrix &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I &amp;= U^T R V  \\
R &amp;= U V^T \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalized/constrained Procrustes problems ==
There are a number of related problems to the classical orthogonal Procrustes problem.  One might generalize it by seeking the closest matrix in which the columns are [[orthogonal]], but not necessarily [[orthonormal]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Everson| first=R| year=1997| title=Orthogonal, but not Orthonormal, Procrustes Problems| url=http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/reverson/uploads/Site/procrustes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Alternately, one might constrain it by only allowing [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] (i.e. orthogonal matrices with [[determinant]] 1, also known as [[Orthogonal matrix|special orthogonal matrices]]).  In this case, one can write (using the above decomposition &lt;math&gt;M=U\Sigma V^T&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;R=U\Sigma'V^T,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma'\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a modified &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, with the smallest singular value replaced by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sign}(\det(UV^T))&lt;/math&gt; (+1 or -1), and the other singular values replaced by 1, so that the determinant of R is guaranteed to be positive. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Eggert|first1=DW| last2=Lorusso|first2=A| last3=Fisher|first3=RB| title=Estimating 3-D rigid body transformations: a comparison of four major algorithms| journal=Machine Vision and Applications| volume=9| issue=5| pages=272&amp;ndash;290| year=1997|doi=10.1007/s001380050048}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see the [[Kabsch algorithm]].

In cryptography, a pseudorandom ensemble is a family of variables meeting the following criteria:

Let &lt;math&gt;U = \{U_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[uniform ensemble]]
and &lt;math&gt;X = \{X_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[distribution ensemble|ensemble]]. The ensemble &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called '''pseudorandom''' if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;
are [[Computationally indistinguishable|indistinguishable in polynomial time]].

In numerical analysis, '''the quasi-Newton least squares method''' is a [[quasi-Newton method]] for [[root-finding algorithm|finding roots]] in {{math|''n''}} variables. It was originally described by Rob Haelterman et al. in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1137/070710469|author1=R. Haelterman |author2=J. Degroote |author3=D. Van Heule |author4=J. Vierendeels | title= The quasi-Newton Least Squares method: a new and fast secant method analyzed for linear systems | journal=SIAM J. Numer. Anal.| volume=47 | issue=3 | year=2009 | pages=2347–2368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newton's method]] for solving {{math|'''f'''('''x''') {{=}} '''0'''}} uses the [[Jacobian matrix]], {{math|'''J'''}}, at every iteration. However, computing this Jacobian is a difficult (sometimes even impossible) and expensive operation. The idea behind the quasi-Newton least squares method is to build up an approximate Jacobian based on known input–output pairs of the function {{math|'''f'''}}.

Haelterman et al. also showed that when the quasi-Newton least squares method is applied to a linear system of size {{math|''n'' × ''n''}}, it converges in at most {{math|''n'' + 1}} steps, although like all quasi-Newton methods, it may not converge for nonlinear systems.

The method is closely related to the [[quasi-Newton inverse least squares method]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8007">In [[mathematics]], the '''Rogers–Ramanujan identities''' are two identities related to [[basic hypergeometric series]], first discovered and proved  by {{harvs|txt|first=Leonard James|last= Rogers|authorlink=Leonard James Rogers|year=1894}}. They were subsequently rediscovered (without a proof) by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] some time before 1913. Ramanujan had no proof, but rediscovered Rogers's paper in 1917, and they then published a joint new proof {{harv|Rogers|Ramanujan|1919}}. {{harvs|txt|first=Issai |last=Schur|authorlink=Issai Schur|year=1917}} independently rediscovered and proved the identities.

==Definition==
The Rogers–Ramanujan identities are

:&lt;math&gt;G(q) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {q^{n^2}} {(q;q)_n} = 
\frac {1}{(q;q^5)_\infty (q^4; q^5)_\infty}
	=1+ q +q^2 +q^3 +2q^4+2q^5 +3q^6+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|A003114}}
and

:&lt;math&gt;H(q) =\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {q^{n^2+n}} {(q;q)_n} = 
\frac {1}{(q^2;q^5)_\infty (q^3; q^5)_\infty}
=1+q^2 +q^3 +q^4+q^5 +2q^6+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|A003106}}.

Here, &lt;math&gt;(\cdot;\cdot)_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the  [[q-Pochhammer symbol]].

==Integer Partitions==
Consider the following:
* &lt;math&gt;\frac {q^{n^2}} {(q;q)_n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[generating function]] for partitions with exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; parts such that adjacent parts have difference at least 2.
* &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{(q;q^5)_\infty (q^4; q^5)_\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[generating function]] for partitions such that each part is [[congruence relation|congruent]] to either 1 or 4 [[modulo operation|modulo]] 5.
* &lt;math&gt;\frac {q^{n^2+n}} {(q;q)_n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[generating function]] for partitions with exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; parts such that adjacent parts have difference at least 2 and such that the smallest part is at least 2.
* &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{(q^2;q^5)_\infty (q^3; q^5)_\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[generating function]] for partitions such that each part is [[congruence relation|congruent]] to either 2 or 3 [[modulo operation|modulo]] 5.

The Rogers–Ramanujan identities could be now interpreted in the following way. Let &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; be a non-negative integer.
# The number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the adjacent parts differ by at least 2 is the same as the number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that each part is congruent to either 1 or 4 modulo 5.
# The number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the adjacent parts differ by at least 2 and such that the smallest part is at least 2 is the same as the number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that each part is congruent to either 2 or 3 modulo 5.

Alternatively,
# The number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; parts the smallest part is at least &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that each part is congruent to either 1 or 4 modulo 5.
# The number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; parts the smallest part is at least &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the number of partitions of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that each part is congruent to either 2 or 3 modulo 5.

==Modular functions==
If ''q'' = e&lt;sup&gt;2πiτ&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1/60&lt;/sup&gt;''G''(''q'') and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;11/60&lt;/sup&gt;''H''(''q'') are [[modular function]]s of τ.

==Applications==
The Rogers–Ramanujan identities appeared in Baxter's solution of the [[hard hexagon model]] in statistical mechanics.

[[Ramanujan's continued fraction]] is 
:&lt;math&gt;1+\frac{q}{1+\frac{q^2}{1+\frac{q^3}{1+\cdots}}}  = \frac{G(q)}{H(q)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Relations to Affine Lie algebras and Vertex Operator Algebras==
[[James Lepowsky]] and [[Robert Lee Wilson (mathematician)|Robert Lee Wilson]] were the first to prove Rogers–Ramanujan identities using completely [[representation theory|representation-theoretic]] techniques. They proved these identities using level 3 modules for the affine Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}&lt;/math&gt;. In the course of this proof they invented and used what they called &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;-algebras. 
Lepowsky and Wilson's approach is universal, in that it is able to treat all [[affine Lie algebra]]s at all levels.
It can be used to find (and prove) new partition identities. 
First such example is that of Capparelli's identities discovered by [[Stefano Capparelli]] using level 3 modules for 
the affine Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;A_2^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5349">In [[mathematics]], '''additivity''' and '''sigma additivity''' (also called '''countable additivity''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] defined on [[subset]]s of a given [[Set (mathematics)|set]] are abstractions of the intuitive properties of size ([[length]], [[area]], [[volume]]) of a set.

== Additive (or finitely additive) set functions ==
Let ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' be a function defined on an [[field of sets|algebra of sets]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; with values in [&amp;minus;&amp;infin;, +&amp;infin;] (see the [[extended real number line]]). The function &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is called '''additive''', or '''finitely additive''', if, whenever ''A'' and ''B'' are [[disjoint set]]s in  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, one has

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(A \cup B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B). \, &lt;/math&gt;

(A consequence of this is that an additive function cannot take both &amp;minus;&amp;infin; and +&amp;infin; as values, for the expression &amp;infin;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; is undefined.)

One can prove by [[mathematical induction]] that an additive function satisfies

: &lt;math&gt;\mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^N A_n\right)=\sum_{n=1}^N \mu(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N&lt;/math&gt; disjoint sets in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

==&amp;sigma;-additive set functions==
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[sigma algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]]. If for any [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n,\dots &lt;/math&gt; of pairwise disjoint sets in  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, one has
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;{{math|,}}
we say that &amp;mu; is '''countably additive''' or '''&amp;sigma;-additive'''. &lt;br /&gt;
Any &amp;sigma;-additive function is additive but not vice versa, as shown below.

==&amp;tau;-additive set functions==
Suppose that in addition to a sigma algebra &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, we have a [[Topological space|topology]] &amp;tau;. If for any [[Directed set|directed]] family of measurable open sets &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;sube;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;cap;&amp;tau;,
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup \mathcal{G} \right) = \sup_{G\in\mathcal{G}} \mu(G)&lt;/math&gt;{{math|,}}
we say that &amp;mu; is &amp;tau;-additive. In particular, if &amp;mu; is [[Inner regular measure|inner regular]] (with respect to compact sets) then it is &amp;tau;-additive.&lt;ref name=Fremlin&gt;D.H. Fremlin ''Measure Theory, Volume 4'', Torres Fremlin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

=== Basic properties ===
Useful properties of an additive function &amp;mu; include the following:
# Either &amp;mu;(&amp;empty;) = 0, or &amp;mu; assigns ∞ to all sets in its domain, or &amp;mu; assigns &amp;minus;∞ to all sets in its domain.
# If &amp;mu; is non-negative and ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'', then  &amp;mu;(''A'') &amp;le; &amp;mu;(''B'').
# If ''A'' &amp;sube; ''B'' and &amp;mu;(''B'') &amp;minus; &amp;mu;(''A'') is defined, then  &amp;mu;(''B'' \ ''A'') = &amp;mu;(''B'') &amp;minus; &amp;mu;(''A'').
# Given ''A'' and ''B'', &amp;mu;(''A'' &amp;cup; ''B'') + &amp;mu;(''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'') = &amp;mu;(''A'') + &amp;mu;(''B'').

==Examples==
An example of a  &amp;sigma;-additive function is the function &amp;mu; defined over the [[power set]] of the [[real number]]s, such that 
:&lt;math&gt; \mu (A)= \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mbox{ if } 0 \in A \\ 
                               0 &amp; \mbox{ if } 0 \notin A.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n,\dots&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of disjoint sets of real numbers, then either none of the sets contains 0, or precisely one of them does. In either case, the equality 
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;
holds.

See [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[signed measure]] for more examples of &amp;sigma;-additive functions.

===An additive function which is not &amp;sigma;-additive===
An example of an additive function which is not &amp;sigma;-additive is obtained by considering &amp;mu;, defined over the Lebesgue sets of the [[real number]]s by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(A)=\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{1}{k} \cdot \lambda\left(A \cap \left(0,k\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' denotes the [[Lebesgue measure]] and ''lim'' the [[Banach limit]].

One can check that this function is additive by using the linearity of the limit. That this function is not &amp;sigma;-additive follows by considering the sequence of disjoint sets
:&lt;math&gt;A_n=\left[n,n+1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
for ''n''=0, 1, 2, ... The union of these sets is the [[positive reals]], and &amp;mu; applied to the union is then one, while &amp;mu; applied to any of the individual sets is zero, so the sum of &amp;mu;(''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is also zero, which proves the counterexample.

==Generalizations==
One may define additive functions with values in any additive [[monoid]] (for example any [[group (mathematics)|group]] or more commonly a [[vector space]]). For sigma-additivity, one needs in addition that the concept of [[limit of a sequence]] be defined on that set. For example, [[spectral measure]]s are sigma-additive functions with values in a [[Banach algebra]]. Another example, also from quantum mechanics, is the [[positive operator-valued measure]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6935">In [[spherical trigonometry]], the '''law of cosines''' (also called the '''cosine rule for sides'''&lt;ref name=VNR/&gt;) is a theorem relating the sides and angles of spherical triangles, analogous to the ordinary [[law of cosines]] from plane [[trigonometry]].

[[Image:Law-of-haversines.svg|right|thumb|Spherical triangle solved by the law of cosines.]]
Given a unit sphere, a "spherical triangle" on the surface of the sphere is defined by  the [[great circle]]s connecting three points {{math|'''u''', '''v'''}}, and {{math|'''w'''}} on the sphere (shown at right).  If the lengths of these three sides are {{math|''a''}} (from {{math|'''u'''}} to {{math|'''v'''), ''b''}} (from {{math|'''u'''}} to {{math|'''w'''}}), and {{math|''c''}} (from {{math|'''v'''}} to {{math|'''w'''}}), and the angle of the corner opposite {{math|''c''}} is {{math|''C''}}, then the (first) spherical law of cosines states:&lt;ref name=Ireneus&gt;Romuald Ireneus 'Scibor-Marchocki, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/2363/trig02.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:44:36 Spherical trigonometry], ''Elementary-Geometry Trigonometry'' web page (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VNR&gt;W. Gellert, S. Gottwald, M. Hellwich, H. Kästner, and H. Küstner, ''The VNR Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics'', 2nd ed., ch. 12 (Van Nostrand Reinhold: New York, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos c = \cos a \cos b + \sin a \sin b \cos C\,&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is a unit sphere, the lengths {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are simply equal to the angles (in [[radian]]s) subtended by those sides from the center of the sphere. (For a non-unit sphere, the lengths are the subtended angles times the radius, and the formula still holds if {{math|''a'', ''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are reinterpreted as the subtended angles).  As a special case, for {{math|''C'' {{=}} {{sfrac|π|2}}}}, then {{math|cos ''C'' {{=}} 0}}, and one obtains the spherical analogue of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos c = \cos a \cos b\,&lt;/math&gt;

If the law of cosines is used to solve for {{math|''c''}}, the necessity of inverting the cosine magnifies [[rounding error]]s when {{math|''c''}} is small.  In this case, the alternative formulation of the [[law of haversines]] is preferable.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Sinnott, "Virtues of the Haversine", Sky and Telescope 68 (2), 159 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation on the law of cosines, the second spherical law of cosines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Reiman | first=István | year=1999 | title=Geometria és határterületei | publisher=Szalay Könyvkiadó és Kereskedőház Kft. | page=83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the '''cosine rule for angles'''&lt;ref name=VNR/&gt;) states:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos C = -\cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B \cos c\,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are the angles of the corners opposite to sides {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, respectively.  It can be obtained from consideration of a [[Spherical trigonometry#Polar triangles|spherical triangle dual]] to the given one.

==Proofs==
===First proof===
Let {{math|'''u''', '''v'''}}, and {{math|'''w'''}} denote the [[unit vector]]s from the center of the sphere to those corners of the triangle.  The angles and distances do not change if the coordinate system is rotated, so we can rotate the coordinate system so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is at the [[north pole]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is somewhere on the [[prime meridian]] (longitude of 0).  With this rotation, the [[spherical coordinates]] for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, \phi) = (1, a, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''θ'' is the angle measured from the north pole not from the equator, and the spherical coordinates for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, \phi) = (1, b, C)&lt;/math&gt;.  The Cartesian coordinates for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z) = (\sin a, 0, \cos a)&lt;/math&gt; and the Cartesian coordinates for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z) = (\sin b \cos C, \sin b \sin C, \cos b)&lt;/math&gt;.  The value of &lt;math&gt;\cos c&lt;/math&gt; is the dot product of the two Cartesian vectors, which is &lt;math&gt;\sin a \sin b \cos C + \cos a \cos b&lt;/math&gt;.

===Second proof===
Let {{math|'''u''', '''v'''}}, and {{math|'''w'''}} denote the [[unit vector]]s from the center of the sphere to those corners of the triangle.  We have {{math|1='''u''' · '''u''' = 1}}, {{math|1='''v''' · '''w''' = cos ''c''}}, {{math|1='''u''' · '''v''' = cos ''a''}}, and {{math|1='''u''' · '''w''' = cos ''b''}}.  The vectors {{math|'''u''' × '''v'''}} and {{math|'''u''' × '''w'''}} have lengths {{math|sin ''a''}} and {{math|sin ''b''}} respectively and the angle between them is {{math|''C''}}, so
:{{math|1=sin ''a'' sin ''b'' cos ''C'' = ('''u''' × '''v''') · ('''u''' × '''w''') = ('''u''' · '''u''')('''v''' · '''w''') − ('''u''' · '''v''')('''u''' · '''w''') = cos ''c'' − cos ''a'' cos ''b''}},
using [[cross product]]s, [[dot product]]s, and the [[Binet–Cauchy identity]] {{math|1=('''p''' × '''q''') · ('''r''' × '''s''') = ('''p''' · '''r''')('''q''' · '''s''') − ('''p''' · '''s''')('''q''' · '''r''')}}.

==Rearrangements==
The first and second spherical laws of cosines can be rearranged to put the sides ({{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}}) and angles ({{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C''}}) on opposite sides of the equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\cos C &amp;= \frac{\cos c - \cos a \cos b}{\sin a \sin b} \\
\\
\cos c &amp;= \frac{\cos C + \cos A \cos B}{\sin A \sin B} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Planar limit: small angles ==
For ''small'' spherical triangles, i.e. for small {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}, the spherical law of cosines is approximately the same as the ordinary planar law of cosines,
: &lt;math&gt;c^2 \approx a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C \,.&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this, we will use the [[small-angle approximation]] obtained from the [[Maclaurin series]] for the cosine and sine functions:
: &lt;math&gt;\cos a = 1 - \frac{a^2}{2} + O(a^4),\, \sin a = a + O(a^3)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these expressions into the spherical law of cosines nets:

: &lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{c^2}{2} + O(c^4) = 1 - \frac{a^2}{2} - \frac{b^2}{2} + \frac{a^2 b^2}{4} + O(a^4) + O(b^4) + \cos(C)(ab + O(a^3 b) + O(ab ^ 3) + O(a^3 b^3))&lt;/math&gt;

or after simplifying:

: &lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C + O(c^4) + O(a^4) + O(b^4) + O(a^2 b^2) + O(a^3 b) + O(ab ^ 3) + O(a^3 b^3).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[big O notation|big O]] terms for {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are dominated by {{math|''O''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) + ''O''(''b''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)}} as {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} get small, so we can write this last expression as:

: &lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C + O(a^4) + O(b^4) + O(c^4).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4244">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''st''-planar graph}}
In [[graph theory]], an '''''st''-planar graph''' is a [[bipolar orientation]] of a [[planar graph|plane graph]] for which both the source and the sink of the orientation are on the outer face of the graph. That is, it is a directed graph drawn without crossings in the plane, in such a way that there are no directed cycles in the graph, exactly one graph vertex has no incoming edges, exactly one graph vertex has no outgoing edges, and these two special vertices both lie on the outer face of the graph.&lt;ref name="dett"&gt;{{citation

Within the drawing, each face of the graph must have the same structure: there is one vertex that acts as the source of the face, one vertex that acts as the sink of the face, and all edges within the face are directed along two paths from the source to the sink. If one draws an additional edge from the sink of an ''st''-planar graph back to the source, through the outer face, and then constructs the [[dual graph]] (oriented each dual edge clockwise with respect to its primal edge) then the result is again an ''st''-planar graph, augmented with an extra edge in the same way.&lt;ref name="dett"/&gt;

==Order theory==
These graphs are closely related to [[partially ordered set]]s and [[Lattice (order)|lattices]]. The [[Hasse diagram]] of a partially ordered set is a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are the set elements, with an edge from ''x'' to ''y'' for each pair ''x'', ''y'' of elements for which ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'' in the partial order but for which there does not exist ''z'' with ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''z''.
A partially ordered set forms a complete lattice if and only if every subset of elements has a unique greatest lower bound and a unique least upper bound, and the [[order dimension]] of a partially ordered set is the least number of [[total order]]s on the same set of elements whose intersection is the given partial order.
If the vertices of an ''st''-planar graph are partially ordered by reachability, then this ordering always forms a two-dimensional complete lattice, whose Hasse diagram is the [[transitive reduction]] of the given graph. Conversely, the Hasse diagram of every two-dimensional complete lattice is always an ''st''-planar graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Graph drawing==
Based on this two-dimensional partial order property, every ''st''-planar graph can be given a [[dominance drawing]], in which for every two vertices ''u'' and ''v'' there exists a path from ''u'' to ''v'' if and only if both coordinates of ''u'' are smaller than the corresponding coordinates of&amp;nbsp;''v''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Di Battista|Eades|Tamassia|Tollis|1998}}, 4.7 Dominance Drawings, pp. 112–127.&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of such a drawing may also be used as a [[data structure]] that can be used to test whether one vertex of an ''st''-planar graph can reach another in [[constant time]] per query. Rotating such a drawing by 45° gives an [[upward planar drawing]] of the graph. A directed acyclic graph ''G'' has an [[upward planar drawing]] if and only if ''G'' is a subgraph of an ''st''-planar graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''stable model category''' is a [[pointed model category]] in which the suspension functor is an equivalence of the homotopy category with itself.

The prototypical examples are the category of [[spectrum (topology)|spectra]] in the [[stable homotopy theory]] and the category of chain complex of ''R''-modules. On the other hand, the category of pointed topological spaces and the category of pointed simplicial sets are not stable model categories.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7580">The use of '''[[exponential generating function]]s (EGFs)''' to study the properties of '''[[Stirling numbers]]''' is a classical exercise in [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]] and possibly the canonical example of how [[symbolic combinatorics]] is used. It also illustrates the parallels in the construction of these two types of numbers, lending support to the binomial-style notation that is used for them.

This article uses the coefficient extraction operator &lt;math&gt;[z^n]&lt;/math&gt; for [[formal power series]], as well as the (labelled) operators &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt; (for cycles) and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt; (for sets) on combinatorial classes, which are explained on the page for [[symbolic combinatorics]]. Given a combinatorial class, the cycle operator creates the class obtained by placing objects from the source class along a cycle of some length, where cyclical symmetries are taken into account, and the set operator creates the class obtained by placing objects from the source class in a set (symmetries from the symmetric group, i.e. an "unstructured bag".) The two combinatorial classes (shown without additional markers) are
* [[permutation]]s (for unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind):

::&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} = \operatorname{SET}(\operatorname{CYC}(\mathcal{Z})),&lt;/math&gt;

and
* [[set partition]]s into non-empty subsets (for Stirling numbers of the second kind):

:: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} = \operatorname{SET}(\operatorname{SET}_{\ge 1}(\mathcal{Z})),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the singleton class.

'''Warning''': The notation used here for the Stirling numbers is not that of the Wikipedia articles on Stirling numbers; square brackets denote the signed Stirling numbers here.

==Stirling numbers of the first kind==

The unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind count the number of permutations of [''n''] with ''k'' cycles. A permutation is a set of cycles, and hence the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\,&lt;/math&gt; of permutations is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} = \operatorname{SET}(\mathcal{U} \times \operatorname{CYC}(\mathcal{Z})), \, &lt;/math&gt;

where the singleton &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; marks cycles. This decomposition is examined in some detail on the page on the [[Random permutation statistics|statistics of random permutations]].

Translating to generating functions we obtain the mixed generating function of the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind:

:&lt;math&gt;G(z, u) = \exp \left( u \log \frac{1}{1-z} \right) =
\left(\frac{1}{1-z} \right)^u =
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^n 
\left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right] u^k \, \frac{z^n}{n!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind are obtained from the unsigned ones through the relation
:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{n-k} \left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right].&lt;/math&gt;
Hence the generating function &lt;math&gt;H(z, u)&lt;/math&gt; of these numbers is
:&lt;math&gt; H(z, u) = G(-z, -u) =
\left(\frac{1}{1+z} \right)^{-u} = (1+z)^u =
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^n 
(-1)^{n-k} \left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right] u^k \, \frac{z^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

A variety of identities may be derived by manipulating this [[generating function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(1+z)^u = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {u \choose n} z^n = 
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {z^n}{n!} \sum_{k=0}^n 
(-1)^{n-k} \left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right] u^k = 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty u^k
\sum_{n=k}^\infty \frac {z^n}{n!}
(-1)^{n-k} \left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right] = 
e^{u\log(1+z)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the order of summation may be exchanged, and derivatives taken, and then ''z'' or ''u'' may be fixed.

===Finite sums===
A simple sum is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k 
\left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right] = 
(-1)^n n!.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula holds because the exponential generating function of the sum is

:&lt;math&gt;H(z, -1) = \frac{1}{1+z}

\quad \mbox{and hence} \quad

n! [z^n] H(z, -1) = (-1)^n n!.&lt;/math&gt;

===Infinite sums===
Some infinite sums include

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=k}^\infty 
\left[\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right] 
\frac{z^n}{n!} = \frac {\left(\log (1+z)\right)^k}{k!}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; (the singularity nearest to &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;
of &lt;math&gt;\log (1+z)&lt;/math&gt; is at &lt;math&gt;z=-1.&lt;/math&gt;)

This relation holds because

:&lt;math&gt;[u^k] H(z, u) = [u^k] \exp \left( u \log (1+z) \right) =
\frac {\left(\log (1+z)\right)^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Stirling numbers of the second kind==

These numbers count the number of partitions of [''n''] into ''k'' nonempty subsets. First consider the total number of partitions, i.e. ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;B_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left\{\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right\}
\mbox{ and } B_0 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the [[Bell number]]s. The [[Flajolet–Sedgewick fundamental theorem]] applies (labelled case).
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\,&lt;/math&gt; of partitions into non-empty subsets is given by ("set of non-empty sets of singletons")

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} = \operatorname{SET}(\operatorname{SET}_{\ge 1}(\mathcal{Z})).&lt;/math&gt;

This decomposition is entirely analogous to the construction of the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\,&lt;/math&gt; of permutations from cycles, which is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} = \operatorname{SET}(\operatorname{CYC}(\mathcal{Z})).&lt;/math&gt;

and yields the Stirling numbers of the first kind. Hence the name "Stirling numbers of the second kind."

The decomposition is equivalent to the EGF

:&lt;math&gt; B(z) = \exp \left(\exp z - 1\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiate to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dz} B(z) = 
\exp \left(\exp z - 1\right) \exp z = B(z) \exp z,&lt;/math&gt;

which implies that

:&lt;math&gt; B_{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} B_k,&lt;/math&gt;

by convolution of [[exponential generating function]]s and because differentiating an EGF drops the first coefficient and shifts ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''z''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The EGF of the Stirling numbers of the second kind is obtained by marking every subset that goes into the partition with the term &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}\,&lt;/math&gt;, giving

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} = \operatorname{SET}(\mathcal{U} \times \operatorname{SET}_{\ge 1}(\mathcal{Z})).&lt;/math&gt;

Translating to generating functions, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; B(z, u) = \exp \left(u \left(\exp z - 1\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This EGF yields the formula for the Stirling numbers of the second kind:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{\begin{matrix} n \\ k \end{matrix}\right\} =
n! [u^k] [z^n] B(z, u) =
n! [z^n] \frac{(\exp z - 1)^k}{k!}&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;
n! [z^n] \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{j=0}^k {k \choose j} \exp(jz) (-1)^{k-j}
&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n!}{k!} \sum_{j=0}^k {k \choose j} (-1)^{k-j} \frac{j^n}{n!} =
\frac{1}{k!} \sum_{j=0}^k {k \choose j} (-1)^{k-j} j^n.&lt;/math&gt;

'''''The Game of Logic''''' is a book written by [[Lewis Carroll]], published in 1886. In addition to his well-known children's literature, Carroll was an academic mathematician who worked in [[mathematical logic]]. The book describes, in an informal and playful style, the use of a [[board game]] to represent logical [[proposition]]s and [[inference]]s. Carroll incorporated the game into a longer and more formal introductory logic textbook titled ''Symbolic Logic'', published in 1897. The books are sometimes reprinted in a single volume.

The '''Tompkins–Paige algorithm'''&lt;ref name=Tompkins&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--, named after [[????? Tompkins]] and [[????? Paige]],--&gt; is a computer [[algorithm]] for generating all [[permutation]]s of a finite set of objects.

== The method ==
Let ''P'' and ''c'' be arrays of length ''n'' with 1-based indexing (i.e. the first entry of an array has index 1). The algorithm for generating all ''n''! permutations of the set {1,2,...,''n''} is given by the following [[pseudocode]]:

 ''P'' ← [1, 2, ..., n];
 yield ''P'';
 ''c'' ← [*, 1, ..., 1]; (the first entry of ''c'' is not used)
 ''i'' ← 2;
 '''while''' ''i'' ≤ ''n'' '''do'''
     left-rotate the first ''i'' entries of ''P'';
     (e.g. left-rotating the first 4 entries of
     [4,2,5,3,1] would give [2,5,3,4,1])
     '''if''' ''c''[''i'']&lt;''i'' '''then'''
         ''c''[''i''] ← ''c''[''i'']+1;
         ''i'' ← 2;
         yield ''P'';
     '''else'''
         ''c''[''i''] ← 1;
         ''i'' ← ''i''+1;

In the above pseudocode, the statement "yield ''P''" means to output or record the set of permuted indices ''P''. If the algorithm is implemented correctly, ''P'' will be yielded exactly ''n''! times, each with a different set of permuted indices.

This algorithm is not the most efficient one among all existing permutation generation methods.&lt;ref name=Sedgewick&gt;{{cite journal | title = Permutation Generation Methods | journal = Computing Surveys |first=Robert |last=Sedgewick |authorlink=Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|volume= 9| issue= 2 |year= 1977|pages=137–164 | doi=10.1145/356689.356692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does it have to keep track of an auxiliary counting array (''c''), redundant permutations are also produced and ignored (because ''P'' is not yielded after left-rotation if ''c''[''i''] ≥ ''i'') in the course of generation. For instance, when ''n'' = 4, the algorithm will first yield ''P'' = [1,2,3,4] and then generate the other 23 permutations in 40 iterations (i.e. in 17 iterations, there are redundant permutations and ''P'' is not yielded). The following lists, in the order of generation, all 41 values of ''P'', where the parenthesized ones are redundant:
 P =  1234  c = *111  i=2
 P =  2134  c = *211  i=2
 P = (1234) c = *111  i=3

'''Warren Arthur Ambrose''' (October 25, 1914 – December 4, 1995) was Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and at the [[University of Buenos Aires]].

He was born in [[Virden, Illinois]] in 1914. He received his bachelor of science degree in 1935, his master's in 1936 and his [[Ph.D.]] in 1939, all from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;ref name=mit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1996/ambrose-0110.html |title=Professor Emeritus Warren Ambrose dies at 81 - MIT News Office |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=1996-01-10 |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Warren Ambrose was a food and wine connoisseur, and also a fan of jazz saxophone player, [[Charlie Parker|Charlie "Bird" Parker]]. He is noted for his work with MIT colleague, [[Isadore Singer]], both of whom helped to shape the pure mathematics department at MIT.&lt;ref name=ams&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199604/comm-ambrose.pdf |title=A Tribute to Warren Ambrose - I. M. Singer and H. Wu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from teaching at MIT in 1985, thereafter moving to [[France]]. Ambrose died in 1995 in [[Paris]].  He is survived by his wife, Jeannette (Grillet) Ambrose of Paris, two children from an earlier marriage, Adam Ambrose of Bisbee, AZ, and Ellen Ambrose of Laurel, MD, and four grandchildren,&lt;ref name=mit/&gt; David and Adam Holzsager, Ari Ambrose, and Jennifer Laurent.

== Career ==
Ambrose became an assistant professor at MIT in 1947, an associate professor in 1950 and full professor in 1957.&lt;ref name=mit/&gt; He was several times between 1939 and 1959 a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in  [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=3 |title=Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars |publisher=Ias.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106144327/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage?page=3 |archivedate=2013-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambrose is often considered one of the fathers of modern geometry.&lt;ref name=reflections&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3P0IQDorWEoC&amp;pg=PA111 |title=Reflections Of Eminent Economists - Michael Szenberg, Lall Ramrattan - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for making changes in the pure mathematics undergraduate curriculum at MIT to reflect recent findings in differential geometry. For example, less than ten years after André Weil presented the differential form, Ambrose was using it in his undergraduate differential geometry courses.  In the 1950s, Ambrose (together with I. M. Singer) made MIT into the only center in geometry in the United States outside the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=ams/&gt; His influence continued through his students, in particular [[Hung-Hsi Wu]] and [[John Rhodes (mathematician)|John Rhodes]], both of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In the 1960s Ambrose was a visiting professor at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. He is noted for his opposition of takeover of South American countries military regimes, specifically Argentina.&lt;ref name=mit/&gt;

== Political activism ==
In the summer of 1966, while a visiting professor at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, Ambrose was severely beaten along with Argentinian faculty members and students by Argentinian military police. This occurred shortly after a military regime took over public universities in Argentina. Ambrose responded by bringing several of the best and brightest students from the University of Buenos Aires back to MIT with him.&lt;ref name=reflections/&gt; Ambrose is often renowned amongst Latin American intellectuals for bringing attention to right-wing dictatorships in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP6CYnCbHOEC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=warren+ambrose+MIT&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1_lofAh5_H&amp;sig=BPPlvw9sh3m1LUYaqYAO6UvYfPw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DDTdTpGAPJPo2gX2_9HRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=warren%20ambrose%20MIT&amp;f=false |title=The Man Who Pushed America to War: The Extraordinary Life, Adventures, and ... - Aram Roston - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Ambrose signed a letter declaring his intention to [[tax resistance|refuse to pay taxes]] in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to also take this stand.&lt;ref&gt;"An Open Letter" [http://collection1.libraries.psu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/transaction/id/17162 archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;
