{{Politics of Scotland}}
{{Scots law}}
An '''Act of the Scottish Parliament''' ({{lang-gd|Achd Pàrlamaid na h-Alba}}) is [[primary legislation]] made by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. The power to create Acts was conferred to the Parliament by section 28 of the [[Scotland Act 1998]] following the successful [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 referendum on devolution]].&lt;ref name="1998-c-46"&gt;{{cite book|author1=HM Government|authorlink1=HM Government|title=Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46)|date=19 November 1998|publisher=The National Archives|isbn=0-10-544698-X|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126223544/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46|archivedate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="govuk_background-to-devolution"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cabinet Office|author2=Scotland Office|authorlink1=Cabinet Office|authorlink2=Scotland Office|title=Devolution settlement: Scotland - Detailed guidance - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/devolution-settlement-scotland|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409023423/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/devolution-settlement-scotland|archivedate=9 April 2016|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the establishment of the Parliament under the 1998 Act, all [[Union of 1707|post-union]] laws specific to Scotland were passed at the [[Westminster Parliament]]. Although the Westminster Parliament has retained the ability to legislate for Scotland, by [[Sewel convention|convention]] it does not do so without the [[Legislative consent motion|consent]] of the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46"/&gt;{{rp|(s. 28(7))}}&lt;ref name="govuk_devo-memorandum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Memorandum of Understanding and Supplementary Agreements|date=October 2013|publisher=Scottish Government|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0043/00436627.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328011810/http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0043/00436627.pdf|archivedate=28 March 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|(para. 14)}} Since the passing of the 1998 Act, the Westminster Parliament has passed five public general acts that apply only to Scotland.&lt;ref name="natarch_ukpga-for-scotland"&gt;{{cite web|author1=The National Archives|authorlink1=The National Archives (United Kingdom)|title=UK Public General Acts containing "scotland"|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga?title=scotland&amp;results-count=500|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708133319/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga?title=scotland&amp;results-count=500|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A draft Act is known as a Bill. Once it is passed by the Scottish Parliament and receives [[royal assent]], the Bill becomes an Act and is then a part of [[Scots Law]].&lt;ref name="1998-c-46" /&gt;{{rp|(ss. 28, 32, 36)}}
&lt;!--The Scottish Parliament's legislative competence – the areas in which it can make laws – is set by the various [[Scotland Acts]].--&gt;

=== Public Bills ===

A '''Public Bill''' is a Bill which is introduced by a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP), and which will deal with the general laws of Scotland, rather than the law as it applies to a single person or organisation. Public Bills are further divided into categories based on the MSP who proposed them: ''Government Bills'' (known as ''Executive Bills'' before September 2012)&lt;ref name="scotparl_legislation-summary_session-4"/&gt; for a member of the [[Scottish Government]]; ''Committee Bills'' for the [[convener]] of one of the [[committees of the Scottish Parliament]]; or ''Members' Bills'' for any MSP who is not a member of the Scottish Government.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Guidance on Public Bills – Part 1: Public Bills and background to the legislative process|date=June 2016|publisher=Scottish Parliament Corporate Body|edition=Session 5|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/25656.aspx|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708204926/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/25656.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public Bills are the most common type of Bill. In the [[4th Scottish Parliament|Parliament's fourth session]], 81 of the 86 proposed Bills were Public Bills.

=== Private Bills ===

A '''Private Bill''' (or sometimes a ''Personal Bill'') is a Bill which will apply only to the Bill's promoter: the specific person, [[Body corporate|corporation]], or [[unincorporated entity]] which is putting the Bill before Parliament. For example, the [[National Trust for Scotland]] was created by Act of Parliament in 1935, making its [[constitution]] part of the law.&lt;ref name="nts_order_1935"&gt;{{cite book|author1=HM Government|authorlink1=HM Government|title=National Trust for Scotland Order Confirmation Acts, 1935 to 1973|publisher=National Trust for Scotland|pages=6-32|url=http://www.nts.org.uk/about/downloads/nts_constitution_v3_0711.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708150756/http://www.nts.org.uk/about/downloads/nts_constitution_v3_0711.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, amending the Trust's constitution required an Act of the Scottish Parliament – the [[National Trust for Scotland (Governance etc.) Act 2013]].&lt;ref name="2013-asp-9"&gt;{{cite book|author1=The National Trust for Scotland|authorlink1=National Trust for Scotland|title=National Trust for Scotland (Governance etc.) Act 2013 (asp 9)|date=28 June 2013|publisher=The National Archives|isbn=978-0-10-590200-3|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2013/9|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708152020/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2013/9|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Private Bills are classified as ''Works Bills''. These are Bills to grant the [[statutory power]] to construct or alter works such as bridges, docks, roads, or tunnels, or the statutory power to [[Expropriation|compulsorily purchase or use]] land or buildings.&lt;ref name="scotparl_private-bills-guidance_pt-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scotparl_private-bills-guidance_annex-b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Guidance on Private Bills – Annex B: Classes of Works|date=May 2016|publisher=Scottish Parliament|edition=Session 5|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79096.aspx|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708163424/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79096.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike with Public Bills, anyone with suitable interest in the outcome of a Private Bill (such as residents near the site of a proposed work) can lodge an objection and have it considered by a parliamentary committee.&lt;ref name="scotparl_private-bills-guidance_part-3"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Guidance on Private Bills – Part 3: Objections|date=May 2016|publisher=Scottish Parliament|edition=Session 5|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79090.aspx|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708175010/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79090.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private Bills also differ from Public Bills in that they can legislate outside of the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. If all of the provisions of a Private Bill are within the Parliament's legislative competence, then the Bill's passage into an Act is covered by the Parliament's [[Rules of order|standing orders]]. If not, however, then the Bill's passage is covered under a 1936 Act of the UK Parliament.&lt;ref name="scotparl_private-bills-guidance_pt-1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Guidance on Private Bills – Part 1: Private Bills|date=May 2016|publisher=Scottish Parliament|edition=Session 5|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79083.aspx|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708161341/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79083.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1936-c-52"&gt;{{cite book|author1=HM Government|authorlink1=HM Government|title=Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1936 (c. 52) (26 Geo. 5 &amp; 1 Edw. 8)|date=31 July 1936|publisher=The National Archives|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5and1Edw8/26/52|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708161936/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5and1Edw8/26/52|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|(s. 1(5))}}

The number of Private Bills is low compared to Public Bills. In the fourth session of the Parliament, five of the 86 proposed Bills were Private Bills.

=== Hybrid Bills ===

A '''Hybrid Bill''' is a class of Bill introduced in 2009. It is a combination of the characteristics of Public and Private Bills and is intended for use where its contents relate to general law or public policy, but where those provisions may negatively affect specific persons or bodies (rather than the public in general). Hybrid Bills are always introduced by a member of the Scottish Government and, like Public Bills, can make general law provisions within the Scottish Parliament's legislative competence. However, like Private Bills, any person with a suitable interest can object and have their objections considered by a parliamentary committee, and a Hybrid Bill can be classed as a ''Works Bill'' depending on its provisions.&lt;ref name="scotparl_hybrid-bills-guidance_pt-1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Guidance on Hybrid Bills – Part 1: Hybrid Bills|date=October 2015|publisher=Scottish Parliament|edition=June 2014 (3rd Update, October 2015)|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79133.aspx|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708180411/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79133.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotparl_hybrid-bills-guidance_pt-3"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Guidance on Hybrid Bills – Part 3: Objections|date=October 2015|publisher=Scottish Parliament|edition=June 2014 (3rd Update, October 2015)|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79183.aspx|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708180444/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/79183.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Hybrid Bill put before the Parliament was the ''Forth Crossing Bill'' on 16 November 2009.&lt;ref name="scotparl_visitlearn_hybrid-bills"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Hybrid Bills - Visit &amp; Learn|url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/87712.aspx|website=www.parliament.scot|publisher=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708180629/http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/87712.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotparl_business_forth-crossing-bill"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Forth Crossing Bill - Parliamentary Business|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/22080.aspx|website=www.parliament.scot|publisher=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708181026/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/22080.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Bill was later passed as the [[Forth Crossing Act 2011]], which granted the Scottish Government the power to build the [[Queensferry Crossing]].&lt;ref name="2011-asp-2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Government|authorlink1=Scottish Government|title=Forth Crossing Act 2011 (asp 2)|date=20 January 2011|publisher=The National Archives|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2011/2/enacted|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708181332/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2011/2/enacted|archivedate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of Bills ==

There are a number of stages a Bill must pass through before it becomes an Act, but to pass through these stages it must first be introduced to Parliament. To be introduced, the Bill is prepared in accordance with the Parliament's standing orders along with its supporting documents: statements on legislative competence; [[cost estimate]]s relating to implementation of the Bill; [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] explanations of the Bill's provisions; any reports from consultations relating to the Bill; and a report from the [[Auditor General for Scotland]] if the Bill authorises charges on the [[Scottish Consolidated Fund]]. &lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Guidance on Public Bills – Part 2: Stages of Bills - the general rules|date=June 2016|publisher=Scottish Parliament Corporate Body|edition=Session 5|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/25685.aspx|accessdate=8 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708205358/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/25685.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|title=Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament – Chapter 9: Public Bill Procedures|date=22 April 2016|publisher=Scottish Parliament Corporate Body|edition=5th|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/26514.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708205843/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/26514.aspx|archivedate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal to Parliament ===

Following a Bill's introduction to Parliament, the first three stages a Bill passes through are broadly defined by section 36 of the Scotland Act 1998.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46" /&gt; The precise process is set out by the Parliament's standing orders, and varies slightly depending on how the Bill is classified.

==== General debate ====

The first stage after introduction is a debate of the Bill's intentions and its general principles, referred to in the standing orders as ''Stage 1'' and required by section 36(1)(a) of the 1998 Act.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46"/&gt; The Bill is referred to the relevant parliamentary committee or committees, plus the ''Delegated Powers and Law Reform'' committee (DPLR) if the Bill allows the creation of [[Scottish Statutory Instrument|secondary legislation]]. One of the relevant committees is designated the lead committee, and that committee prepares a report on the Bill's general principles. The DPLR, if it is involved, will also prepare a report on the necessity of conferring the power to create secondary legislation.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.34–2.44}}&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"/&gt;{{rp|9.6}}

Once prepared, the reports are presented to Parliament for consideration. The Parliament may [[Motion_(parliamentary_procedure)|move]] to have a further report produced by the lead committee (either on the Bill as a whole or on a specific part), or proceed to debate. A debate considers the committee reports, and is concluded by the MSP in charge of the Bill moving "that the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Bill." If that motion receives the support of the Parliament, the Bill proceeds to ''Stage 2''. If the motion fails, the Bill fails and does not proceed.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.45–2.50}}&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"/&gt;{{rp|9.6}}

In certain cases it is necessary to receive [[Crown Consent]] before the Bill can proceed, such as when the Bill affects [[royal prerogative]] or the private interests of the monarch or monarchs. Generally, Crown Consent will only be sought in ''Stage 1'' if a key component or a majority of the Bill deals with matters that require consent.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.51–2.54}}

==== Committee consideration ====

Once the Parliament agrees to the general principles of a Bill, the Bill progresses to ''Stage 2''. In this stage, the Bill may be referred back to the lead committee designated in ''Stage 1'', or may be transferred to one or more other committees. Occasionally, a Bill is transferred to a committee of the entire Scottish Parliament. The committees the Bill is referred to then cover the Bill in detail, and must agree on each individual portion (in contrast to ''Stage 1'', where only the general idea of the Bill must be agreed on). Specifically, the committees must agree on individual sections of the Bill, schedules to the Bill, and the Bill's [[long title]], and must do so in that order unless the committees or Parliament decide otherwise.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.55–2.56, 2.60–2.63}}&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"/&gt;{{rp|9.7.1–9.7.4}}

In this stage, a Bill can be [[Amendment|amended]], and any submitted amendments to a portion of the Bill must be considered before a committee can agree on that portion. MSPs not on any ''Stage 2'' committees can participate in discussion and submit amendments, but can't vote on whether amendments are accepted or rejected.&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"/&gt;{{rp|9.7.7}} Depending on the amendments submitted, it may be required to update the Bill's supporting documents. The ''Stage 2'' committees, unlike the ''Stage 1'' committees, do not produce a report on the Bill.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.59, 2.64–2.76}}&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"/&gt;{{rp|9.7.5–9.7.10}}

''Stage 2'' partially fulfils the requirements of section 36(1)(b) of the 1998 Act, along with ''Stage 3''.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46" /&gt;

==== Parliament consideration ====

Following committee consideration, the Bill is presented "as amended" to a meeting of the entire Scottish Parliament, where it is again debated and can again be amended. This is ''Stage 3'', and fulfils the requirements of sections 36(1)(b) and 36(1)(c) of the 1998 Act.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46" /&gt; Unlike in ''Stage 2'', the Parliament will only debate those amendments selected by the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament]]. Amendments are considered in order of the portions of the Bill they amend, unless Parliament agrees to consider them in a different order.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.77–2.82}}&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"/&gt;{{rp|9.8}}

Following the debate and consideration of the Bill and any ''Stage 3'' amendments, the Parliament may opt to send the Bill back to ''Stage 2'' for further consideration. However, if it is felt that adequate consideration has already been had, the Parliament will vote on whether to pass the Bill. If the Bill does not receive a majority in-favour votes, or if the vote is invalid, the Bill fails and does not proceed. The vote is considered invalid when an electronic vote is taken and fewer than a quarter of (129 total) MSPs vote.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.87–2.92}}&lt;ref name="scotparl_orders_chapter-9"/&gt;{{rp|9.8}}

If Crown Consent is required and was not gained before ''Stage 3'', it will usually be gained before the start of the vote on whether to pass the Bill.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.93}}

=== External to Parliament ===

[[File:Letters Patent for the Forth Crossing Act 2011 (asp 2).png|thumb|350px|The text of the Letters Patent granting royal assent for the [[Forth Crossing Act 2011]], as it appeared in the ''[[Edinburgh Gazette]]''.]]

[[File:The Great Seal of Scotland under HM Elizabeth II.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Great Seal of Scotland]] in red [[beeswax]]. An impression like this is attached to every Letters Patent giving royal assent.]]

Once passed by Parliament, the stages a Bill passes through before becoming an Act are set out by sections 32 to 36 of the Scotland Act 1998.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46" /&gt; These stages generally do not involve Parliament.

==== Statutory challenge ====

A passed Bill may be challenged by the [[Advocate General for Scotland]], the [[Lord Advocate]], or the [[Law Officers of the Crown|Attorney General]], who can refer it under section 33 of the 1998 Act to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] for review.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46"/&gt; The Supreme Court will then determine whether the Bill is within the Parliament's legislative competence and whether the Bill is to be referred to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) for review. Such a challenge may be lodged within the four weeks following the passing or approval of the Bill. If a Bill is referred to the ECJ, the Parliament can move to reconsider the Bill and have the reference withdrawn. If the reference is only to the Supreme Court, the Parliament must wait for the Court's decision. This type of statutory challenge is termed a ''Section 33 reference''.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.95–2.100}}

The [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] may also challenge by [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|order]] under section 35 of the 1998 Act. Section 35 provides that such challenges must be on the grounds that the Bill: is incompatible with international obligations; is incompatible with the interests of defence or [[national security]]; or deals with [[reserved matters]] and will have "an adverse effect on the operation of the law." These orders can be created within the four weeks following the passing or approval of the Bill, or within four weeks following the lodging of a section 33 reference against the Bill. The orders can remain active indefinitely, and are referred to as ''Section 35 orders''.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.96}}

==== Royal assent ====

{{see also|Royal assent}}

The final stage before a Bill can be classed as an Act is the receiving of royal assent – the approval of the monarch. Although the actual process of royal assent is a formality – royal assent has not been refused for {{age|1707|5|1}} years&lt;ref name="parluk_house-of-commons-chronology_page-7"&gt;{{cite book|author1=House of Commons|authorlink1=House of Commons of the United Kingdom|title=Factsheet G3: A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons|date=August 2010|page=7|edition=3.3|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709200726/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g03.pdf|archivedate=9 July 2016|format=PDF|issn=0144-4689}}&lt;/ref&gt; – sections 28 and 32 of the 1998 Act mean that a Bill cannot become an Act without royal assent. A Bill is submitted for royal assent by the Presiding Officer, who may only do so after either waiting for the four-week statutory challenge period to expire or after receiving confirmation that no statutory challenge will be lodged.&lt;ref name="1998-c-46" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.105}}

A Bill receives royal assent through [[Letters Patent]] under the [[Great Seal of Scotland]]. The Letters Patent are of the form:&lt;ref name="1999-si-737"&gt;{{cite book|author1=HM The Queen in Council|authorlink1=Queen-in-Council|title=The Scottish Parliament (Letters Patent and Proclamations) Order 1999 (SI 1999/737)|date=10 March 1999|publisher=The National Archives|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/737/made|accessdate=9 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173345/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/737/made|archivedate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
ELIZABETH THE SECOND by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Our other Realms and Territories Queen Head of the Commonwealth Defender of the Faith To Our trusty and well beloved the members of the Scottish Parliament.

GREETING:

FORASMUCH as various Bills have been passed by the Scottish Parliament and have been submitted to Us for Our Royal Assent by the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament in accordance with the Scotland Act 1998 the short Titles of which Bills are set forth in the Schedule hereto but those Bills by virtue of the Scotland Act 1998 do not become Acts of the Scottish Parliament nor have any effect in the Law without Our Royal Assent signified by Letters Patent under Our Scottish Seal (that is Our Seal appointed by the Treaty of Union to be kept and used in Scotland in place of the Great Seal of Scotland) signed with Our own hand and recorded in the Register of the Great Seal We have therefore caused these Our Letters Patent to be made and have signed them and by them do give Our Royal Assent to those Bills COMMANDING ALSO the Keeper of Our Scottish Seal to seal these Our Letters with that Seal.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF we have caused these Our Letters to be made Patent.

WITNESS Ourself at [...] the [...] day of [...] in the [...] year of Our Reign.

By The Queen Herself Signed with Her Own Hand.
}}

Once the Letters Patent are received and sealed, the Bill becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref name="scotparl_public-bills-guidance_part-2"/&gt;{{rp|2.108}} However, parts of or even the entire Act may not immediately have effect. An extreme example of this is the [[Easter Act 1928]], an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament which has never been put into effect.

==== Coming into force ====
{{main article|Coming into force}}

A Bill, after becoming an Act, does not necessarily have [[legal force]] immediately. Most Acts wholly or partially come into force the day after royal assent; many include provisions that must be ''brought into force'' by a commencement order (a statutory instrument). One example is the [[Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016]], which includes provisions for both:

{{Quote|
'''117 Commencement'''
:(1) The following provisions come into force on the day after Royal Assent—
::(a) sections 71 and 73 to 77,
::(b) this Part.
:(2) The other provisions of this Act come into force on such day as the Scottish Ministers may appoint.
:(3) An order under subsection (2) may include transitional, transitory, or saving provision.
|source=Section 117, Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016 (asp 1)&lt;ref name="2016-asp-1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016 (asp 1)|date=13 January 2016|publisher=The National Archives|isbn=978-0-10-590264-5|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/1|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710114653/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/1|archivedate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

As of July 2016, two commencement orders have brought sections 84 and 112 of that Act, respectively, into force. Section 84 was brought into force on 10 March 2016, and section 112 on 1 July 2016.&lt;ref name="2016-ssi-95"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Government|authorlink1=Scottish Government|title=The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016 (Commencement No.1 and Saving Provision) Order 2016 (SSI 2016/95)|date=10 February 2016|publisher=The National Archives|isbn=978-0-11-103161-2|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2016/95/made|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710115200/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2016/95/made|archivedate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2016-ssi-199"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Government|authorlink1=Scottish Government|title=The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016 (Commencement No.2) Order 2016 (SSI 2016/199)|date=9 June 2016|publisher=The National Archives|isbn=978-0-11-103226-8|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2016/199/made|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710115533/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2016/199/made|archivedate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style of an Act ==
=== Numbering ===

The numbering of Acts of the Scottish Parliament closely resembles that of Acts of other devolved legislatures in the UK, and of Acts of the UK Parliament. An Act's number consists of the calendar year in which the Act received royal assent, followed by the abbreviation "asp" (for '''''A'''ct of the '''S'''cottish '''P'''arliament''), followed by a number which increases consecutively from one with each Act in the calendar year. Thus, the first Act of 2016 is numbered ''2016 asp 1'', the second is ''2016 asp 2'', and so on. The first Act of 2017 is ''2017 asp 1'' because the final number resets each calendar year.

If multiple Acts receive royal assent on the same day, they are numbered based on the order in which their Letters Patent are received. If multiple Acts are specified in a single Letters Patent, the Acts are numbered by the order in which they are mentioned in the Letters.&lt;ref name="2010-asp-10"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10)|date=3 June 2010|publisher=The National Archives|isbn=978-0-10-590156-3|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/10|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505214901/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/10|archivedate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|(s. 38)}}&lt;ref name="1999-si-1379"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office|authorlink1=Under-Secretary of State for Scotland|title=The Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Publication and Interpretation etc. of Acts of the Scottish Parliament) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1379)|date=13 May 1999|publisher=The National Archives|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/1379/made|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711041938/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/1379/made|archivedate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|(art. 4)}}

=== Citation ===

An Act can be cited in a number of ways: by reference to its [[short title]] ("Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016"); by reference to its full number ("2016 asp 1"); or both ("Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016 (asp 1)"), although the exact appearance of this type of citation generally depends on the [[style guide]] in use.&lt;ref name="2010-asp-10"/&gt;{{rp|(s. 9)}}&lt;ref name="1999-si-1379" /&gt;{{rp|(art. 5)}}&lt;ref name="cardiffuni_citing-the-law_scottish-legislation"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cardiff University Information Services|authorlink1=Cardiff University|title=Citing the law|url=https://ilrb.cf.ac.uk/citingreferences/oscola/tutorial/page12.html|website=ilrb.cf.ac.uk|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204005808/https://ilrb.cf.ac.uk/citingreferences/oscola/tutorial/page12.html|archivedate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robertgordonuni_harvard-guide_scottish-legislation"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robert Gordon University|authorlink1=Robert Gordon University|title=Legislation - Act of the Scottish Parliament - RGU Harvard Referencing Guide|url=http://libguides.rgu.ac.uk/c.php?g=260908&amp;p=2009327|website=libguides.rgu.ac.uk|publisher=Robert Gordon University|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710160642/http://libguides.rgu.ac.uk/c.php?g=260908&amp;p=2009327|archivedate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enactment formula ===

{{main article|Enacting clause}}

The enactment formula for Acts of the Scottish Parliament is non-typical – unlike many others, it doesn't begin with a variation of the phrase "be it enacted..." or state from where the Parliament derives authority (a [[deity]] or the [[Monarch|sovereign]]). Instead, it states the date of the Bill being passed by the Parliament and the date of that Bill receiving royal assent (i.e. becoming an Act), in the manner as follows:

{{Quote|
The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on 28th April 2010 and received Royal Assent on 3rd June 2010
|source=Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10)&lt;ref name="2010-asp-10"/&gt;
}}

The enactment formula is then immediately followed by the Act's long title, and then the contents of the Act.

A '''division''' of a Bill or Act is a component, generally numbered, dealing with increasingly discrete topics, equivalent to the [[Chapter (books)|chapters]] of a book. For example, the highest-level division might be "trees," with two subdivisions for [[evergreen]] and [[deciduous]] trees, with each of those having subdivisions for particular species of trees. Different divisions are used depending on the role of that division (e.g. ''parts'' versus ''schedules'').

A table of divisions is shown. In this table ''"Continuous?"'' indicates whether the numbering of those divisions continues across divisions, or whether the numbering resets to the first value in the sequence at the start of the next-highest-level division. The ''"Optional?"'' column indicates whether, within that portion of the Act, that division can be omitted. While addenda are themselves optional, an addendum to an Act must use the ''paragraph'' division.

==== Body of the Act ====

The main [[body matter]] of an Act is divided into parts, then chapters, then sections, then subsections, then paragraphs, then sub- and sub-sub-paragraphs (or "heads"). The only division that must be used is the section; all others are optional, although chapters cannot be used without parts. These divisions are almost always numbered, although paragraphs may occasionally not be numbered, such as when being used for a list of definitions.

==== Addenda to the Act ====

Some Acts have schedules, a type of [[addendum]], which give additional information. Schedules are commonly used to provide lists of amendments to other Acts, but may be used anywhere it may not be appropriate to include the information in the Act's main text. For example, section 1 of the [[Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005]] gives a general definition of the [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator]], while schedule 1 to that Act gives more detail; and schedule 1 to the [[Budget (Scotland) Act 2016]] sets out the purposes for which money will be allocated to the Scottish Government, and how much money will be allocated to those purposes.&lt;ref name="2005-asp-6"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Parliament|authorlink1=Scottish Parliament|title=Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 (asp 10)|date=14 July 2005|publisher=The National Archives|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2005/10|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321041004/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2005/10|archivedate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2016-asp-12"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scottish Government|authorlink1=Scottish Government|title=Budget (Scotland) Act 2016 (asp 12)|date=30 March 2016|publisher=The National Archives|isbn=978-0-10-590286-7|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/12/enacted|accessdate=10 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710173509/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/12/enacted|archivedate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are multiple schedules, each is individually numbered; otherwise a schedule is not numbered. Schedules are then divided into parts, then chapters, then paragraphs, and then sub-paragraphs in the same way as the sections of the main body of the Act. As with the main body, parts and chapters are optional, and chapters cannot be used without parts. Although schedules still have the full force of law like sections, they are counted as additions rather than main components of the Act, and so a schedule is said to be "to an Act" rather than "of an Act."

==== Other ====

Both the main body of the Act and its addenda may have cross-headings. These are non-numbered divisions that don't affect the numbering of other divisions, and serve to make reading the document easier. For example, Part 1 Chapter 2 ("Scottish Charity Register") of the ''Charities'' Act mentioned above has cross-headings dividing it into portions related to the register itself, applying for entry to the register, acceptable names for charities on the register, and so on.&lt;ref name="2005-asp-6"/&gt; Cross-headings are shown in [[italic type]].

The '''Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973''' (P.L. 93-86, also known as the '''1973 U.S. Farm Bill''') was the 4-year [[farm bill]] that adopted [[target pricing|target prices]] and [[deficiency payments]] as a tool that would support [[farm income]] but reduce [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeitures]] to the [[Commodity Credit Corporation]] (CCC) of surplus stocks. (Target prices were eliminated by the [[1996 farm bill]] (P.L. 104-127), but restored by the [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1104).) It reduced payment limitations to $20,000 (from $55,000 set in 1970) for all [[program crop]]s. The Act might be considered the first [[Omnibus bill|omnibus]] farm bill because it went beyond simply authorizing farm [[commodity program]]s. It authorized [[disaster payments]] and disaster reserve [[inventories]]; created the Rural Environmental Conservation Program; amended the [[Food Stamp Act of 1964]] (P.L. 88-525), authorized the use of commodities for feeding low income mothers and young children (the origin of the [[Commodity Supplemental Food Program]]; and amended the [[Rural Development Act of 1972]] (P.L. 92-419).

&lt;!--[[File:(85) Paperbark.jpg|thumb|Bast fibre from ''[[Melaleuca]]'']] Article “Melaleuca” does not mention use as a fiber --&gt;

'''Bast fibre''' (also called '''phloem fibre''' or '''skin fibre''') is [[plant fibre]] collected from the [[phloem]] (the "inner bark", sometimes called "skin") or '''bast''' surrounding the stem of certain [[dicotyledon]]ous [[plant]]s. They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. Some of the economically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance [[flax]], [[hemp]], or [[ramie]], but also bast fibres from wild plants, as [[stinging nettle]], and trees such as [[Tilia|lime or linden]], [[wisteria]], and [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] have been used in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Textiles in Daily Life: Proceedings of the Third Biennial Symposium of the Textile Society of America, September 24–26 1992 |chapter=A Wisteria Grain Bag And Other Tree Bast Fiber Textiles Of Japan |chapter-url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/tsaconf/569/ |author=Mary Dusenbury |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bast fibres are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible.&lt;ref name=Esau&gt;{{cite book |author=Esau, K. |date=12 January 1977  |title=Anatomy of seed plants |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-24520-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibres from [[monocotyledon]]ous plants, called "leaf fibre", are classified as hard fibres and are stiff.&lt;ref name=Esau/&gt;

Since the valuable fibres are located in the phloem, they must often be separated from the [[xylem]] material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]. The process for this is called [[retting]], and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance [[high pH]] and [[chelating]] agents) or by [[pectin]]olytic [[enzyme]]s. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by [[pectin]] and [[calcium]] [[ion]]s. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher [[tensile strength]] than other kinds, and are used in high-quality [[textile]]s (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), [[rope]]s, [[yarn]], [[paper]], [[composite material]]s and [[burlap]]. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the ''fibre node'', that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.

==Use of bast fibre==
Plants that have been used for bast fibre include [[flax]] (from which [[linen]] is made), [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[kenaf]], [[kudzu]], [[tilia|linden]], [[milkweed]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], [[okra]], [[paper mulberry]], [[ramie]], and [[roselle hemp]].

Bast fibres are processed for use in [[carpet]], [[yarn]], [[rope]], [[geotextile]] (netting or matting), traditional carpets, [[burlap|hessian or burlap]], [[paper]], sacks, etc. Bast fibres are also used in the [[non-woven]], moulding, and composite technology industries for the manufacturing of non-woven mats and carpets, composite boards as furniture materials, automobile door panels and headliners, etc.  From prehistoric times through at least the early twentieth century, [[bast shoe]]s were woven from bast strips in the forest areas of Eastern Europe.

Where no other source of [[tanbark]] was available, bast has also been used for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] leather.&lt;ref name="HCC, Juchten"&gt;{{Cite web

{{Criminal law}}
'''Causation''' is the "causal relationship between conduct and result". In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it is defined as the ''[[actus reus]]'' (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with ''[[mens rea]]'' (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to [[inchoate offense]]s.

==Background concepts==
Legal systems more or less try to uphold the notions of [[Equity (law)|fairness]] and [[justice]]. If a [[State (polity)|state]] is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according to the idea that those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of [[strict liability]], in which the ''[[mens rea]]'' is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.

Even the youngest children quickly learn that, with varying degrees of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability to the extent that the extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.

===Relationship between causation and liability===
Causation of an event alone is insufficient to create legal liability.

Sometimes causation is one part of a multi-stage test for legal liability. For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the tort of negligence, the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a [[duty of care]], breached that duty, by so doing caused [[Property damage|damage]] to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. Causation is just one component of the tort.

On other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of [[product liability]], the courts have come to apply to principle of ''strict liability'' : the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent.

On still other occasions, causation is irrelevant to legal liability altogether. For example, under a contract of [[Indemnity|indemnity insurance]], the [[Insurance|insurer]] agrees to indemnify the [[Victimology|victim]] for harm not caused by the insurer, but by other parties.

Because of the difficulty in establishing causation, it is one area of the law where the case law overlaps significantly with general doctrines of analytic philosophy to do with causation. The two subjects have long been intermingled.

== Establishing causation ==
Where establishing causation is required to establish legal liability, it usually involves a two-stage inquiry, firstly establishing 'factual' causation, then 'legal' causation.

‘Factual’ causation must be established before inquiring into legal causation, perhaps by assessing if the defendant acted in the plaintiff’s loss.

Determining ‘legal’ causation often involves a question of public policy regarding the sort of situation in which, despite the outcome of the factual enquiry,  the defendant might nevertheless be released from liability, or impose liability.

==Establishing factual causation==
The usual method of establishing factual causation is the ''but-for test''. The but for test inquires ‘But for the defendant’s act, would the harm have occurred?’ A shoots and wounds B. We ask ‘But for A's act, would B have been wounded?’ The answer is ‘No.’ So we conclude that A caused the harm to B. The but for test is a test of necessity. It asks was it ‘necessary’ for the defendant’s act to have occurred for the harm to have occurred. In New South Wales, this requirement exists in s 5D of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW),&lt;ref name="CLA 5D"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5D}} General principles.&lt;/ref&gt; reinforcing established common law principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |date=10 November 2009 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One weakness in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally in such a case would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death.

The courts have generally accepted the but for test notwithstanding these weaknesses, qualifying it by saying that causation is to be understood “as the man in the street” would,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yorkshire Dale Steamship Co v Minister of War Transport]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|1942||AC|691|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, or by supplementing it with “common sense”.&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1993|litigants=[[March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=24 April 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This dilemma was handled in the [[United States]] in ''[[State v. Tally]]'', {{West|S|15||722|Ala.|1894|738}}, where the court ruled that: “The assistance given ... need not contribute to criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it.” Using this logic, A and B are liable in that no matter who was responsible for the fatal shot, the other "facilitated" the criminal act even though his shot was not necessary to deliver the fatal blow.

However, legal scholars have attempted to make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Tony Honoré]], and later [[Richard W. Wright (Professor, Chicago-Kent College of Law)|Richard Wright]], have said that something is a cause if it is a ‘necessary element of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the result’. This is known as the [[NESS test]]. In the case of the [[Summers v. Tice|two hunters]], the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being in the right place at the right time, gravity, etc. In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense.

Hart and Honore, in their famous work ''Causation in the Law'', also tackle the problem of 'too many causes'. For them, there are degrees of causal contribution.  A member of the NESS set is a "causally relevant condition". This is elevated into a "cause" where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. So, returning to our [[Hunting|hunter]] example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a "cause". On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated to the status of "cause". An intermediate position can be occupied by those who "occasion" harm, such as accomplices. Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal to the scene of the crime. Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a "cause" (on the but for or NESS test). So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. However, the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. They consider that once something is a "but for" (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy.

==Establishing legal causation==
Notwithstanding the fact that causation may be established in the above situations, the law often intervenes and says that it will nevertheless not hold the defendant liable because in the circumstances the defendant is not to be understood, in a legal sense, as having caused the loss. In the United States, this is known as the doctrine of [[proximate cause]]. The most important doctrine is that of ''novus actus interveniens'', which means a ‘new intervening act’ which may ‘cut the chain of causation’.

===Proximate cause===
{{Main|Proximate cause}}
The but-for test is factual causation and often gives us the right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. Two difficulties are immediately obvious. The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant tortious conduct would not have occurred. But for the victim of a crime missing the [[bus]], he or she would not have been at the site of the crime and hence the crime would not have occurred.  Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm. This often does not matter in the case where cause is only one element of liability, as the remote actor will most likely not have committed the other elements of the test. The legally liable cause is the one closest to or most proximate to the injury. This is known as the Proximate Cause rule. However, this situation can arise in strict liability situations.

===Intervening cause===
Imagine the following. A critically injures B. As B is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning. She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, A caused B's whole injury on the ‘but for’ or NESS test.&lt;ref name="CLA 5D"/&gt;&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"/&gt; However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning.

The effect of the principle may be stated simply:
:if the new event, whether through human agency or natural causes, does not break the chain, the original actor is liable for all the consequences flowing naturally from the initial circumstances. But if the new act breaks the chain, the liability of the initial actor stops at that point, and the new actor, if human, will be liable for all that flows from his or her contribution.

Note, however, that this does not apply if the [[Eggshell skull]] rule is used.&lt;ref&gt;''Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW'' (1985) 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite=(1998) 45 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 588 |courtname=auto |date=23 December 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For details, see article on the Eggshell Skull doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/camplr24&amp;div=6&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals# J. Stanley McQuade, The Eggshell Skull Rule and Related Problems in Recovery for Mental Harm in the Law of Torts, 24 Campbell L. Rev. 1, 46 (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
actus interveniens

===Independent sufficient causes===
When two or more negligent parties, where the consequence of their negligence joins together to cause damages, in a circumstance where either one of them alone would have caused it anyway, each is deemed to be an "Independent Sufficient Cause," because each could be deemed a "substantial factor,"  and both are held legally responsible for the damages. For example, where negligent firestarter A's fire joins with negligent firestarter B's fire to burn down House C, both A and B are held responsible. (e.g., ''Anderson v. Minneapolis, St: P. &amp; S. St. R.R. Co''., 146 Minn. 430, 179 N.W. 45 (1920).)  This is an element of Legal Cause.

===''Summers v. Tice'' Rule===

The other problem is that of overdetermination.  Imagine two hunters, A and B, who each negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye.  Each shot on its own would have been sufficient to cause the damage.  But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out?  Yes.  The same answer follows in relation to B's shot.  But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held that in order to prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See ''[[Summers v. Tice]]'', 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948).  This is known, simply, as the ''Summers v. Tice'' Rule.

===Concurrent actual causes===
Suppose that two actors' negligent acts combine to produce one set of damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have occurred at all.  This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes.  These are "concurrent actual causes".  In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their negligent acts. Example:  A leaves truck parked in the middle of the road at night with its lights off.  B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles.  Both parties were negligent. (''Hill v. Edmonds'', 26 A.D.2d 554, 270 N.Y.S.2d 1020 (1966).)

===Foreseeability===

Legal Causation is usually expressed as a question of 'foreseeability'.  An actor is liable for the foreseeable, but not the unforeseeable, consequences of his or her act.  For example, it is foreseeable that if I shoot someone on a beach and they are immobilized, they may drown in a rising tide rather than from the trauma of the gunshot wound or from loss of blood.  However it is not (generally speaking) foreseeable that they will be struck by lightning and killed by that event.

This type of causal foreseeability is to be distinguished from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which is a question of remoteness of damage, not causation.  For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, it would be hard to construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage.  There is no ''novus actus interveniens''.  However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence.&lt;ref name= "PC"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd]] (Wagon Mound No. 1) |year=1961 |court=UKPC |num=2 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1961] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 388; [1961] 1 [[All England Law Reports |All ER]] 404 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=18 January 1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.{{or|date=September 2011}}

==Example==
An example of how foreseeability does not apply to the extent of an injury is the [[eggshell skull rule]].  If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will need to go to the hospital for.  However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment.  Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.

== Other relevant considerations ==
Because causation in the law is a complex amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk.  Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.

===Foreseeability tests===
Some aspects of the physical world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to [[imputation (law)|impute]] knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any [[reasonable person]] would consider safe but a [[storm surge]] caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a ''novus actus''. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a [[flash flood]], an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a ''novus actus''.

The question of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B is only slightly injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say that he ''ought'' to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.

Similarly, in the quantification of damages generally and/or the partitioning of damages between two or more defendants, the extent of the liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.

===Risk===
Sometimes the reverse situation to a ''novus actus'' occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved but the court nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable.  In ''Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories'', {{West|P|607|2|924|Cal.|1980|}} the plaintiff's mother consumed [[diethylstilbestrol]] as a miscarriage preventative.&lt;ref name="Sindell5945"&gt;''Sindell'', at 594-95.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medicine, later re-called from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture.&lt;ref name="Sindell5945"/&gt; However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market.  The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref&gt;''Sindell'', at 596.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court held that the defendant was liable in proportion to its market share.&lt;ref name="Sindell6112"&gt;''Sindell'', at 611-12.{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‘risk based’ approach to liability.  The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm.&lt;ref name="Sindell6112"/&gt;  Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain.  However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In ''R v Miller'' {{Oscola|NEUT|1982|||6|UKHL|}}, the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.

===Evidence proving causation===
To be acceptable, any rule of law must be capable of being applied consistently, thus a definition of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B on the road and by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a [[Autopsy|post mortem]] to determine the initial degree of injury and the extent to which B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a ''novus actus'' breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a ''novus actus'' and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.

Roads are, by their nature, used by vehicles and it is clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is at risk of being further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more [[proximate cause]]. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] objectively.

== The future? ==
A difficult issue that has arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor increases the risk of its occurrence.  In ''[[Chester v Afshar]]'' {{Oscola|PROP|2004|4|All ER|587|[[House of Lords|HL]]|}}, a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically [[cauda equina syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Chester5"&gt;''Chester'' [5].{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury.&lt;ref name="Chester5"/&gt;  It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time.&lt;ref&gt;''Chester'' [7].{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The risk of the injury would be the same at both times.  Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way).  Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable.  Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.

==English criminal case law examples==

===''[[Breaking the chain|Novus actus interveniens]]''===
*'''Victim's contribution''' ''R v Dear'' (1996) CLR 595. Believing that the victim had sexually interfered with his 12-year-old daughter, the defendant attacked the victim with a Stanley knife. The defendant argued that the chain of causation had been broken because, two days later, the victim had committed suicide either by reopening his wounds or because he had failed to take steps to staunch the blood flow after the wounds had reopened spontaneously (i.e. the potential suicide constituted a ''novus actus interveniens''). It was held that the real question was whether the injuries inflicted by the defendant were an operating and significant cause of or contribution to the death. Distinctions between the victim's mere self-neglect (no break in the chain) and the victim's gross self-neglect (break in the chain) were not helpful. The victim's death resulted from bleeding from the artery severed by the defendant. Whether the resumption or continuation of that bleeding was deliberately caused by the victim, the defendant's conduct remained the operative and significant cause of the victim's death.
*'''Third party's inadvertent contribution''' ''[[R v Smith]]'' (1959) 2 QB 35 the defendant stabbed his victim twice in a barrack room brawl. Another soldier carried him to the medical centre but dropped him twice. The medical captain was very busy and failed to recognise the extent of the injuries. If the soldier had received proper treatment, he would have had a good chance of a complete recovery. Smith was convicted of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] because the wound was the "operating and substantial cause of death".  In ''R v Cheshire'' (1991) 3 AER 670, the victim was shot in the leg and stomach. In hospital, he suffered pneumonia and respiratory problems in intensive care so had a tracheotomy. After two months, he died. There was some medical negligence because the tracheotomy had caused a thickening of tissue ultimately causing suffocation. In upholding the conviction for [[murder in English law|murder]], [[Roy Beldam|Beldam LJ]] laid down the following test:
:Even though negligence in the treatment of the victim was the immediate cause of his death, the jury should not regard it as excluding the responsibility of the accused unless the negligent treatment was so independent of his acts, and in itself so potent in causing death, that they regard the contribution made by his acts as insignificant.
*'''Third party's deliberate intervention''' ''R v Malcherek'' (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The victim was placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that the doctors had broken the chain of causation  by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and substantial cause of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold the effect of the injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In ''R v Pagett'' (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in [[self-defence in English law|self-defence]] could not be regarded as a ''novus actus interveniens'' because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.

===Foreseeability===
*'''Victim's conscious actions''' ''[[R v. Blaue]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=R v Blaue |year=1975 |court=EWCA |division=Crim |num=3 |date=16 July 1975 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a criminal law application of the "[[thin skull rule]]" in [[criminal law]]. The defendant visited the home of a Jehovah's Witness and demanded sex. When she refused, he stabbed her four times. At hospital, she refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. There was no suggestion that the doctors had acted improperly. Blaue was convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful act, namely [[grievous bodily harm|wounding with intent]]. "But for" his actions, she would not have been faced with the choice about treatment and those who use violence on others must take their victims as they find them (albeit that he had known her religion and so her refusal was foreseeable).

'''''Collymore v Attorney General''''' [1969] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1969/1969_11.pdf UKPC 11] is a case of the [[Privy Council]] relevant for [[UK labour law]], concerning the [[right to strike]].

==Facts==
Collymore and other trade union members for oil companies claimed that a new Industrial Stabilisation Act 1965 in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] was ultra vires the constitution, which guaranteed freedom of association. The Act required no strikes pending binding arbitration.

==Judgment==
The Privy Council advised that the Act did not breach the Constitution. Lord Donovan said the following:

{{Cquote|The question thus posed is therefore simply a question of construction. But the arguments presented for the appellants, based on the assertion that the right to free collective bargaining and the right to strike are essential elements in freedom of association in trade unions, led to a prolonged examination in the courts below as to whether there is in law any "right" to strike. The question does not really arise if the respondent's contention as above summarised is right: for if "freedom of association" does not of itself import freedom to bargain collectively and to do so effectively by means of a strike, it is immaterial whether strike action is or is not the exercise of a "right" or a "freedom" or the enjoyment of "an immunity." Since, however, the matter was exhaustively canvassed in the courts below, their Lordships may say that they are in substantial agreement with the analysis of the situation which emerged. It was agreed before their Lordships that trade union law in Trinidad and Tobago was the same as trade union law in Great Britain as at the date when the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, took effect. Neither before that date nor since has there been in Great Britain any express enactment by statute of any right to strike, although in certain quarters such an enactment is still advocated. At common law before the enactment of the [[Trade Union Act 1871]], the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]], and the amendment to section 3 thereof effected by section 1 of the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], combinations of workmen to improve their wages and conditions were certainly in peril if in combination they withheld their labour or threatened to do so: but (subject to certain esoteric questions arising out of the decision in ''[[Rookes v Barnard]]'' [1964] AC 1129 and still unresolved by the [[Trade Disputes Act 1965]]) it is now well recognised that by reason of the statutes cited, as well as by decisions such as ''[[Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch]]'' [1942] AC 435 employees may lawfully withhold their labour in combination free from the restrictions and penalties which the common law formerly imposed. In this sense there is "freedom to strike."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13739">A '''common carrier''' in [[common law]] countries (corresponding to a '''public carrier''' as it may be presented in some [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems,&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica CD 2000 "Civil-law public carrier" from "carriage of goods"&lt;/ref&gt; usually called simply a '''''carrier''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/open-internet|title=Louisiana's Napoleon Complex|author= Daniel Engber|date=|website=Slate Group|accessdate=16 September 2018}}[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2005/09/louisianas_napoleon_complex.html]: Note: Louisiana uses "Common carrier"; law based on the Spanish and French civil law tradition, a version of the Napoleonic Code.&lt;/ref&gt; is a person or company that transports goods or people for any person or company and that is responsible for any possible loss of the goods during transport.&lt;ref name="Longman Business"&gt;Longman Business English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a [[regulatory body]]. The regulatory body has usually been granted "ministerial authority" by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality, as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.

A common carrier (also called a ''public carrier'' in UK English)&lt;ref name="Longman Business"/&gt; is distinguished from a contract carrier, which is a carrier that transports goods for only a certain number of clients and that can refuse to transport goods for anyone else, and from a [[private carrier]]. A common carrier holds itself out to provide service to the general [[General public|public]] without [[discrimination]] (to meet the needs of the regulator's quasi judicial role of impartiality toward the public's interest) for the "public convenience and necessity." A common carrier must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is "fit, willing, and able" to provide those services for which it is granted authority. Common carriers typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators. Public [[airline]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[bus line]]s, [[taxicab]] companies, [[phone companies]], [[internet service providers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/open-internet|title=Restoring Internet Freedom|author=|date=12 June 2017|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cruise ship]]s, motor carriers (i.e., [[canal]] [[barge|operating companies]], trucking companies), and other [[freight companies]] generally operate as common carriers. Under US law, an [[ocean]] [[freight forwarder]] cannot act as a common carrier.&lt;ref name="Longman Business"/&gt;

The term ''common carrier'' is a common law term, seldom used in continental Europe because it has no exact equivalent in civil-law systems. In continental Europe, the functional equivalent of a common carrier is referred to as a ''public carrier''&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; (or simply as a ''carrier''). However, ''public carrier'' in continental Europe is different from ''public carrier'' in British English, where it is a synonym for ''contract carrier.''

==General==
Although common carriers generally transport people&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stokes v. Saltonstall]]'', {{ussc|38|181|1839}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[good (economics)|good]]s, in the United States the term may also refer to [[telecommunications service provider]]s and [[public utility|public utilities]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In certain [[U.S. state]]s, [[amusement park]]s that operate [[roller coaster]]s and comparable rides have been found to be common carriers; a famous example is [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gomez v. Superior Court (Walt Disney Co.)'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/35C4t1125.htm 35 Cal. 4th 1125] (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulatory bodies may also grant carriers the authority to operate under contract with their customers instead of under common carrier authority, rates, schedules and rules. These regulated carriers, known as contract carriers, must demonstrate that they are "fit, willing and able" to provide service, according to standards enforced by the regulator. However, contract carriers are specifically not required to demonstrate that they will operate for the "public convenience and necessity." A contract carrier may be authorized to provide service over either fixed routes and schedules, i.e., as regular route carrier or on an ''ad hoc'' basis as an irregular route carrier.

It should be mentioned that the carrier refers only to the person ([[Juristic person|legal]] or [[Natural person|physical]]) that enters into a contract of carriage with the shipper. The carrier does not necessarily have to own or even be in the possession of a means of transport. Unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract, the carrier may use whatever means of transport approved in its operating authority, as long as it is the most favorable from the [[cargo]] interests' point of view. The carriers' duty is to get the goods to the agreed destination within the agreed time or within reasonable time. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The person that is physically transporting the goods on a means of transport is referred to as the "actual carrier." When a carrier subcontracts with another provider, such as an [[independent contractor]] or a third-party carrier, the common carrier is said to be providing "substituted service." The same person may hold both common carrier and contract carrier authority. In the case of a [[rail line]] in the US, the owner of the property is said to retain a "residual common carrier obligation," unless otherwise transferred (such as in the case of a [[commuter rail]] system, where the authority operating [[passenger trains]] may acquire the property but not this obligation from the former owner), and must operate the line if service is terminated. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In contrast, [[private carrier]]s are not licensed to offer a service to the public. Private carriers generally provide transport on an irregular or ''ad hoc'' basis for their owners.

Carriers were very common in rural areas prior to motorised transport. Regular services by [[horse-drawn vehicles]] would ply to local towns, taking goods to market or bringing back purchases for the [[village]]. If space permitted, passengers could also travel.

== Telecommunications ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Telephone numbering in Europe]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;

In the United States, [[telecommunications]] carriers are regulated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] under title II of the [[Communications Act of 1934]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/06/12/net-neutrality-takes-effect-today-heres-how-it-affects-you/|title=Net neutrality takes effect today. Here’s how it affects you.|first=Brian|last=Fung|date=12 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] made extensive revisions to the "Title II" provisions regarding common carriers and repealed the judicial 1982 AT&amp;T consent decree (often referred to as the "modification of final judgment" or "MFJ") that effectuated the breakup of AT&amp;T's Bell System. Further, the Act gives telephone companies the option of providing video programming on a common carrier basis or as a conventional cable television operator. If it chooses the former, the telephone company will face less regulation but will also have to comply with FCC regulations requiring what the Act refers to as "open video systems". The Act generally bars, with certain exceptions including most rural areas, acquisitions by telephone companies of more than a 10 percent interest in cable operators (and vice versa) and joint ventures between telephone companies and cable systems serving the same areas.

Using provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC classified [[Internet service providers]] as common carriers, effective June 12, 2015, for the purpose of enforcing [[net neutrality]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  Before that time, the Good Samaritan provision of the [[Communications Decency Act]] established immunity from liability for third party content on grounds of libel or slander, and the [[DMCA]] established that ISPs that comply with the DMCA would not be liable for the copyright violations of third parties on their network. On December 14, 2017, under a new presidential administration, the FCC reversed its own rules on net neutrality, essentially revoking common carrier status as a requirement for internet service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/14/the-fcc-is-expected-to-repeal-its-net-neutrality-rules-today-in-a-sweeping-act-of-deregulation/|title=The FCC just voted to repeal its net neutrality rules, in a sweeping act of deregulation|last=Fung|first=Brian|date=2017-12-14|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Senate narrowly passed a non-binding resolution aiming to reverse the FCC's decision and restore FCC's net neutrality rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/16/net-neutrality-is-getting-a-big-vote-in-the-senate-today-heres-what-to-expect/|title=Senate approves bipartisan resolution to restore FCC net neutrality rules|last=Fung|first=Brian|date=2018-05-16|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pipelines==
In the United States, many oil, gas and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are common carriers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates charged and other tariff terms imposed by interstate common carrier pipelines. Intrastate common carrier pipeline tariffs are often regulated by state agencies. The US and many states have delegated the power of [[eminent domain]] to common carrier gas pipelines.

==Legal implications==
Common carriers are subject to special laws and regulations that differ depending on the means of transport used, e.g. sea carriers are often governed by quite different rules from road carriers or railway carriers. In common law jurisdictions as well as under [[international law]], a common carrier is absolutely liable&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lovett v. Hobbs]]'' (1680) 89 Eng. Rep. 836.&lt;/ref&gt; for goods carried by it, with four exceptions:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gregory v Commonwealth Railways Cmr]]'' (1941) 66 CLR 50 at 74&lt;/ref&gt;
* An act of nature
* An act of the public enemies
* Fault or fraud by the shipper
* An inherent defect in the goods
A sea carrier may also, according to the [[Hague-Visby Rules]], escape liability on other grounds than the above-mentioned, e.g. a sea carrier is not liable for damages to the goods if the damage is the result of a fire on board the ship or the result of a navigational error committed by the ship's master or other crewmember.

Carriers typically incorporate further exceptions into a [[contract of carriage]], often specifically claiming not to be a common carrier.

An important legal requirement for common carrier as public provider is that it cannot ''discriminate,'' that is refuse the service unless there is some compelling reason. As of 2007, the status of Internet service providers as common carriers and their rights and responsibilities is widely debated ([[network neutrality]]).

The term common carrier does not exist in continental Europe but is distinctive to common law systems, particularly law systems in the US.&lt;ref&gt;De Witt: Multimodal Transport, LLP 1995, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ludditt v Ginger Coote Airways]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1947] A.C. 233; [1947] 1 All E.R. 328&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Privy Council]] (Lord Macmillan, Lord Wright, Lord Porter and Lord Simonds) held the liability of a public or common carrier of passengers is only to carry with due care. This is more limited than that of a common carrier of goods. The complete freedom of a carrier of passengers at common law to make such contracts as he thinks fit was not curtailed by the [[Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854]], and a specific contract that enlarges, diminishes or excludes his duty to take care (e.g., by a condition that the passenger travels "at his own risk against all casualties") cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable if the law authorises it. There was nothing in the provisions of the [[Canadian Transport Act 1938]] section 25 that would invalidate a provision excluding liability. ''[[Grand Trunk Railway Co of Canada v Robinson]]'' [1915] A.C. 740 was followed and ''[[Peek v North Staffordshire Railway]]'' 11 E.R. 1109 was distinguished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7039">In countries outside of its borders, a foreign power often has [[extraterritorial rights]] over its official representation (such as a [[Consul (representative)|consulate]]). If such concessions are obtained, they are often justified as protection of the foreign religion (especially in the case of [[Christianity|Christians]] in a [[Islam|Muslim]] state) such as the [[ahdname]] or [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]] granted by the Ottoman Sultan to commercial [[Diaspora]]s residing in the Ottoman Empire. The Sultan did not see this agreement as a bilateral agreement between equals, but merely as acknowledging the nation of foreigners living within his territory and offering them privileges similar to those given to non-Ottoman subjects. However, the European states viewed the ahdname as formal and official and therefore had difficulty enforcing the privileges to their satisfaction on many occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goffman|Aksan|2007|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==

A few examples:

*In 1261, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] assisted Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palæologus]] in reconquering [[Constantinople]] and were rewarded with [[Smyrna]] and [[Beyoğlu|Pera]] as well as a [[Black Sea]] trade [[monopoly]]. They rapidly developed markets along the Black Sea's shores, the principal one being [[Caffa]], and carried on a brisk trade, exporting mainly wine, oil, woolens and silks, and importing skins, furs, corn and [[Persia]]n goods. A consulate general of the empire of [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Gazaria]] was established as the local government of these colonies. Some Genoese moved to Caffa where they remained a minority, but were able to govern the city to suit their interests because of the presence of the Genoese consul. The Genoese also had a consular presence in [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] as early as 1322 where the consul served the interests of the merchants trading grain, honey, and other goods. Chilia and Caffa are examples of places where a wide variety of merchants came to trade and where consuls would have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Epstein|2006|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Genoese had a consul in Alexandria “who was empowered to settle disputes brought by a Saracen against a Genoese” after the agreement between Genoa and Mamluk in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Epstein|2006|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1453 Sultan [[Mehmed II]] laid siege to Constantinople thus ending the Byzantine Empire. However, the Genoese merchants of [[Galata]] declared their neutrality before the battle and Mehmed II restored the trading rights to the merchants through an [[ahidnâme]] after capturing the city. Mehmed II “[left] intact the Genoese community council of Pera, grant[ed] the district legal and some political autonomy, exempt[ed] its Genoese inhabitants from all extraordinary taxes and forced conversion, and concede[d] its alien residents the freedom to trade and travel in the Ottoman domains.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goffman|Aksan|2007|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not unprecedented, but was probably one of the most important examples of the ahdname being granted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oieahc.wm.edu/conferences/ottoman/papers/Eldem.pdf oieahc.wm.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326032258/http://oieahc.wm.edu/conferences/ottoman/papers/Eldem.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1855, Sir [[John Bowring]] signed a [[Bowring treaty|new treaty]] whereby King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) of Siam  agreed to the appointment of a British consul in [[Bangkok]] and to that official exercising full extraterritorial powers.  Sir [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]],  British Consul-General from 1859 to 1864, gives an account of his judicial training and responsibilities in a letter to his cousin dated 6 September 1860.&lt;ref name="JSS_Guehler_Letter"&gt;{{cite journal

|quote= ''Translation of a letter written in German by Sir Robert H. Schomburgk'' ...  sheds a light on living conditions in Siam at the time, especially so on the life at the British Consulate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; British subjects were permitted to own land in certain defined districts, customs and port dues and land revenues were fixed, and many new trade facilities were granted. This important arrangement was followed at intervals by similar treaties with the other powers, the last two being those with [[Japan]] in 1898 and [[Russia]] in 1899. A later convention established a second British consular district in the northern city of [[Chiang Mai]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} while Britain and [[France]] both appointed vice-consuls in different parts of the country. Thus Westerners in Siam (the [[China|Chinese]] had no consul) could only be tried for criminal offences, or sued in civil cases, in their own consular courts. A large portion of the work of the foreign Consuls, especially the British who also accepted cases from other Consuls,{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} was consequently judicial and in 1901 the British government appointed a special judge and an assistant judge to this post. Meanwhile, trade steadily increased, especially with Great Britain and the British neighbouring colonies of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].

In other cases a part of a weaker state is completely handed over (without the formal surrender of "naked" [[sovereignty]]) to be administered as a [[Concession (territory)|concession]], including the indigenous local population:

In the small [[Italy|Italian]] [[Concession territory|concession]] in [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] (a [[treaty port]], now Tianjin), the Consul was in charge of the entire local administration. A long list of French consuls-general in [[Shanghai]] served as both overseers of the [[Shanghai French Concession|French concession]] in this Chinese port as well as presidents of the metropolis's Municipal Council. This arrangement lasted from January 1848 until 15 May 1946 (shortly after the 28 February formal restoration of power from France to China).

==Consular Courts==

See main article:  [[Consular court]]

In places where consuls had [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial powers]] [[consular court]]s would also be established to handle civil and criminal cases against citizens and subjects of that country.   The British had the widest system of consular courts run by the [[Foreign Office]].   British consular courts could be found in Africa, the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Egypt]], China, Japan and Siam.

The '''Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology''', proposed in 1984 by the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] and finalized in 1986, spells out the basic federal policy for regulating the development and introduction of products derived from [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=Framework&gt;[http://usbiotechreg.epa.gov/usbiotechreg/ United States Regulatory Agencies Unified Biotechnology Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117144031/http://usbiotechreg.epa.gov/usbiotechreg/ |date=2012-11-17 }} web page contains only links to other .gov pages&lt;/ref&gt;

This regulatory policy framework that was developed under [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] to ensure safety of the public and to ensure the continuing development of the fledgling biotechnology industry without overly burdensome regulation.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Emily Marden, Risk and Regulation: U.S. Regulatory Policy on Genetically Modified Food and Agriculture, 44 B.C.L. Rev. 733 (2003)[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2236&amp;context=bclr]&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy as it developed had three tenets:  "(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of genetic modification (GM) techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products."&lt;ref name=Marsden /&gt;  These tenets were first described in the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, published by the President's Domestic Policy Council Working Group on Biotechnology through the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 1986.&lt;ref name=Framework /&gt;  
The U.S. policy framework contrasts with that of some of its major trading partners: the [[European Union]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] either have or are establishing separate mandatory labeling requirements for products containing genetically modified organisms.

This framework governed specific agency policies.   For example, the FDA’s 1992 policy statement on genetically engineered plant foods&lt;ref name=1992Policy&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Biotechnology/ucm096095.htm 1992 FDA Policy] &lt;/ref&gt; treats "transferred genetic material and the intended expression product or products" in food derived from GM crops as [[food additives]] subject to existing food additive regulation, under which that material may be considered either [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS) or not, initially at the producer's determination.&lt;ref name=1992Policy /&gt;  If the food additive is not GRAS, the producer is required to submit data proving that the food additive does not "adulterate" the food - in other words, that the additive is not injurious to health.&lt;ref name=1992Policy /&gt;  With respect to GM food, the FDA retained its ability to take enforcement action any food it found to be "adulterated", which would make its producer "subject to the full range of enforcement measures under the act, including seizure, injunction, and criminal prosecution of those who fail to meet their statutory duty."&lt;ref name=1992Policy /&gt;

[[USDA]] regulation of [[genetically modified crops]] is based on the [[Plant Protection Act]] and its definition of "plant pest."

The '''copyright law of the United States''' is intended to encourage the creation of art and culture by rewarding authors and artists with a set of exclusive rights. Copyright law grants authors and artists the exclusive right to make and sell copies of their works, the right to create derivative works, and the right to perform or display their works publicly. These exclusive rights are subject to a time limit, and generally expire 70 years after the author's death. In the United States, any music composed before January 1, 1923, is generally considered public domain.

United States [[copyright]] law was last generally revised by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], codified in [[Title 17 of the United States Code]]. The United States Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to create copyright law under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, known&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Fair Use and Copyright Center. U.S. Constitution. http://fairuse.stanford.edu/law/us-constitution/. Retrieved December 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Copyright Clause]]. Under the [[Copyright Clause]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] has the power, "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;United States Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, http://fairuse.stanford.edu/law/us-constitution/.

==History==
{{main article|History of copyright law of the United States}}
US [[copyright]] law traces its lineage back to the British [[Statute of Anne]], which influenced the first US federal copyright law, the [[Copyright Act of 1790]]. The Copyright Act has been updated several times, including, notably, the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] and the Sonny Bono [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998 (also called the "Mickey Mouse Protection Act", because it prevented the copyright from expiring on the first commercial success of the cartoon character Mickey Mouse).

==Purpose of copyright==
{{rquote|right|The Congress shall have Power [...] to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.|[[United States Constitution]]}}
The goal of copyright law, as set forth in the [[Copyright Clause]] of the [[US Constitution]], is "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Article 1 section 8&lt;/ref&gt; This includes incentivizing the creation of art, literature, architecture, music, and other works of authorship. As with many legal doctrines, the effectiveness of copyright law in achieving its stated purpose is a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html|title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion?|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE|date=18 August 2010|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works subject to copyright law ==
The United States copyright law protects "original works of authorship," fixed in a tangible medium&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}&lt;/ref&gt; including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and other intellectual works. This protection is available to both published and unpublished works. Copyright law includes the following types of works:
* Literary
* Musical
* Dramatic
* Pantomimes and choreographic works
* Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works
* Audio-visual works
* [[Sound recording and reproduction|Sound recordings]]
* [[Derivative work]]s
* Compilations
* Architectural works&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Freedom Foundation.

===Idea–expression dichotomy===
Copyright law protects the "expression" of an idea, but copyright does not protect the "idea" itself. This distinction is called the [[Idea–expression divide|idea–expression dichotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Baker v. Selden]], 101 U.S. 99 (1879); see also CDN Inc. v. Kapes, 197 F.3d 1256, 1261–62 (9th Cir. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between "idea" and "expression" is fundamental to copyright law. From the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}):
{{quote|In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.}}

For example, a paper describing a political theory is copyrightable. The paper is the ''expression'' of the author's ideas about the political theory. But the theory itself is just an ''idea'', and is not copyrightable. Another author is free to describe the same theory in their own words without infringing on the original author's copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Jones. The Myth of the Idea/Expression Dichotomy in Copyright Law. 10 Pace Law Review 551 (1990).
http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/plr/vol10/iss3/1. Retrieved December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fundamental, the idea–expression dichotomy is often difficult to put into practice. Reasonable people can disagree about where the unprotectable "idea" ends and the protectable "expression" begins. As Judge [[Learned Hand]] put it, "Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its 'expression.' Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7909069540715359056 Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp]''., 274 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compilations of facts and the ''sweat of the brow doctrine''===

Mere facts are not copyrightable. However, ''compilations of facts'' are treated differently, and may be copyrightable material.  The Copyright Act, {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|103}},  allows copyright protection for "compilations", as long as there is some "creative" or "original" act involved in developing the compilation, such as in the selection (deciding which facts to include or exclude), and arrangement (how facts are displayed and in what order). Copyright protection in compilations is limited to the ''selection and arrangement of facts'', not to the facts themselves.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' clarified the requirements for copyright in compilations. The Feist case denied copyright protection to a "white pages" phone book (a compilation of telephone numbers, listed alphabetically). In making this ruling, the Supreme Court rejected the "[[sweat of the brow]]" doctrine. That is, copyright protection requires creativity, and no amount of hard work ("sweat of the brow") can transform a non-creative list (like an alphabetical listing of phone numbers) into copyrightable subject matter. A mechanical, non-selective collection of facts (e.g., alphabetized phone numbers) cannot be protected by copyright.&lt;ref name="works.bepress.com"&gt;Bryan M. Carson. Legally Speaking -- The Top Ten Intellectual Property Cases of the Past 25 Years. Against the Grain 17.2 (April 2005). http://works.bepress.com/bryan_carson/28. Retrieved December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Useful articles===
Copyright protects artistic expression. Copyright does not protect useful articles, or objects with some useful functionality.  The Copyright Act states:

{{quote|A “useful article” is an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. An article that is normally a part of a useful article is considered a “useful article”.}}

{{quote|“the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html|title=U.S. Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1|work=copyright.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, many industrial designers create works that are both artistic and functional. Under these circumstances, Copyright Law only protects the artistic expression of such a work, and only to the extent that the artistic expression can be separated from its utilitarian function.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy P. Jong. Copyright of Engineering Drawings, Plans and Designs. Rochester, NY: Tracy Jong Law Firm. http://www.rochesterpatents.com
/CopyrightEDPD.htm. Retrieved December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] in the case ''[[Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc.]]'' to determine when a "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural feature" incorporated into a useful article is eligible for copyright protection,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-866_0971.pdf Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc.]'', No. 15-866, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 1-2 (quoting [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;101]).&lt;/ref&gt; holding that such features are eligible for copyright protection "only if the feature (1) can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work—either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression—if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-866_0971.pdf Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc.]'', No. 15-866, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Athletica'' began as a suit by Varsity Brands against Star Athletica for infringing the copyright of five cheerleader uniform designs.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-866_0971.pdf Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc.]'', No. 15-866, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), slip op. at 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying its new test to the cheerleader uniform designs, the court said:
{{quote|First, one can identify the decorations as features having pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities. Second, if the arrangement of colors, shapes, stripes, and chevrons on the surface of the cheerleading uniforms were separated from the uniform and applied in another medium—for example, on a painter’s canvas—they would qualify as "two-dimensional . . . works of . . . art". And imaginatively removing the surface decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium would not replicate the uniform itself. Indeed, respondents have applied the designs in this case to other media of expression—different types of clothing—without replicating the uniform. The decorations are therefore separable from the uniforms and eligible for copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-866_0971.pdf Star Athletica, L. L. C. v.

This produces a relatively low threshold for pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features on useful articles to be eligible for copyright protection, which one commentator clearly highlighted: the ''Star Athletica'' decision "really has ensured that all but the subtlest graphic designs will be able to gain copyright protection...once we determine that the designs 'hav[e] … graphic … qualities … [and could be] applied … on a painter’s canvas,' the test for copyrightability is met."&lt;ref name="Mann 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Ronald|title=Opinion analysis: Court uses cheerleader uniform case to validate broad copyright in industrial designs|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/opinion-analysis-court-uses-cheerleader-uniform-case-validate-broad-copyright-industrial-designs/|website=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works by the federal government===
{{details|Copyright status of work by the U.S. government}}

Works created by the federal government are not copyrightable. {{UnitedStatesCode|17|105}}. This restriction on copyright applies to publications produced by the United States Government, and its agents or employees within the scope of their employment. The specific language is as follows:

{{quote|Copyright protection under this title is not available for any work of the United States Government, but the United States Government is not precluded from receiving and holding copyrights transferred to it by assignment, bequest, or otherwise.}}

A "work of the United States Government" is defined in {{UnitedStatesCode|17|101}} as work prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties. Note that government contractors are generally not considered employees, and their works may be subject to copyright. Likewise, the US government can purchase and hold the copyright to works created by third parties.

The government may restrict access to works it has produced through other mechanisms. For instance, confidential or secret materials are not protected by copyright, but are restricted by other applicable laws. However, even in case of non-secret materials there are specific prohibitions against automatic access to work otherwise covered under {{UnitedStatesCode|17|105}} for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the current [[Seal of the President of the United States]] is in public domain as a government work, but its commercial use is limited by {{UnitedStatesCode|18|713}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal and state laws are not protected by copyright===
{{main article|Edict of government}}
Federal statutes are in the [[public domain]] and no copyright attaches to them. The same is true of court decisions. It is not difficult to see the motivations behind this:

{{quote|The citizens are the authors of the law, and therefore its owners, regardless of who actually drafts the provisions, because the law derives its authority from the consent of the public, expressed through the democratic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of Georgia v.

{{quote|As a matter of longstanding public policy, the U.S. Copyright Office will not register a government edict that has been issued by any state, local, or territorial government, including legislative enactments, judicial decisions, administrative rulings, public ordinances, or similar types of official legal materials.

However, several states, such as Oregon and Georgia, have claimed that the annotated editions of their laws are copyrightable. In July 2015, Georgia sued open information activist [[Carl Malamud]], founder of [[Public.Resource.Org]], in Federal court in Atlanta for [[copyright infringement]]. Malamud had posted the [[Official Code of Georgia Annotated]] on his website. In the complaint and in press releases, the State of Georgia claimed that this constituted “piracy” and “terrorism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Hiltzik |title=Georgia claims that publishing its state laws for free online is 'terrorism' |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=July 27, 2015 |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-state-of-georgia-copyright-wall-20150727-column.html |accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/metro/2015-09-14/group-countersues-georgia-copyright-fight-over-state-code |title=Group countersues Georgia in copyright fight over state code |date=September 14, 2015 |first=Kate |last=Brumback |publisher=The Augusta Chronicle |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusive rights==
There are six basic rights protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of copyright has the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following:
* To ''reproduce'' the work in copies or phonorecords;
* To prepare ''derivative works'' based upon the work;
* To ''distribute'' copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;
* To ''publicly perform'' the work, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works;
* To ''publicly display'' the work, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.
* To ''digitally'' transmit sound recordings by means of digital audio transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan M. Carson. The Law of Libraries and Archives. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A violation of any of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder is a [[copyright infringement]], unless fair use (or a similar affirmative defense) applies.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan M. Carson. Basic Copyright Exceptions for Educators. Bowling Green, Kentucky: Faculty Center for Excellence in Teaching, Western Kentucky University, 2013. http://works.bepress.com/bryan_carson/57. Retrieved December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship, Ownership, and Work for Hire===

The initial owner of the copyright to a work is the author, unless that work is a "work made for hire."

*'''Works for hire'''. If a work is made "for hire" within the meaning of the Copyright Act, then the ''employer'' or ''commissioning party'', is deemed to be the author and will own the copyright as though it were the true author.&lt;ref name="Section 101"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|101}}&lt;/ref&gt; These circumstances under which a work may be found to be a [[work for hire]] are:
**Work prepared by an ''employee'' within the scope of their employment. In Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989), the Supreme Court held that the term "employee" in this context should be interpreted according to common law agency principles. If the person doing the work is an "employee" within the meaning of the common law, and the work was done within the scope of their employment (whether the work is the kind they were employed to prepare; whether the preparation takes place primarily within the employer's time and place specifications; and whether the work was activated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer), then the work is a work for hire and the employer is the initial owner of the copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan M. Carson. Legally Speaking -- Independent Contractors, Work For Hire Agreements and The Way To Avoid A Sticky Mess. Against the Grain 16.6 (December 2005/January 2006). http://works.bepress.com/bryan_carson/55. Retrieved December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
**Specially ordered or commissioned works. Works created by independent contractors (rather than employees) can be deemed works for hire only if two conditions are satisfied. First, the work must fit into one of these categories: a contribution to a collective work, part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, a translation, a supplementary work, a compilation, an instructional text, a test, answer material for a test, or an atlas. Second, the parties must expressly agree in a written, signed instrument that the work will be considered a work made for hire.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, http://works.bepress.com/bryan_carson/55.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a work is not a work for hire, then the author will be the initial copyright owner. The author generally is the person who conceives of the copyrightable expression and "fixes" it in a "tangible medium of expression."  Special rules apply when multiple authors are involved:

*'''[[Joint authorship]]:''' The US copyright law recognises joint authorship in Section 101.&lt;ref name="Section 101" /&gt; The authors of a joint work are co-owners of a single copyright in the work. A joint work is "a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or independent parts of a unitary whole."&lt;ref name="Section 101"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Margoni &amp; Perry| title = Ownership in Complex Authorship: A Comparative Study of Joint Works | publisher = ssrn| year = 2012| pages = 16| ssrn = 1992610}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Collective work (US)|Collective work]]s''': A collective work is a collection of independent, separately copyrightable works of authorship, such as a newspaper, magazine, or encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="Section 101"/&gt; In the absence of an express assignment of copyright, the author of each individual work in the collection retains copyright in that work.&lt;ref name="Section 201"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler, or author of the collection, owns copyright in the expression he or she contributed, which is primarily the selection and arrangement of the separate contributions, but may include such things as a preface, advertisements, etc., that the collective author created.&lt;ref name="Section 101"/&gt;

===Transfers and licenses===
Three types of transfers exist for copyrighted works.
*Assignment
*Exclusive license
*Non-exclusive license

The first two, assignment and exclusive licenses, require the transfer to be in writing. Nonexclusive licenses need not be in writing and they may be implied by the circumstances. Transfers of copyright always involve one or more of the ''exclusive rights'' of copyright. For instance, a license may provide a right to perform a work, but not to reproduce it or to prepare a derivative work (adaptation right).&lt;ref&gt;Kunvay Copyright &amp; IP Assignment Explained: What Copyright Transfer and Assignment of Rights Really Means. http://blog.kunvay.com/copyright-ip-assignment-explained-copyright-transfer-assignment-rights-really-means/. Retrieved December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the license is governed by the applicable contract law, however there is substantial academic debate about to what extent the Copyright Act preempts state contract law principles.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Smith. Contract preemption: an issue to watch. February 8, 2011. Scholarly Communications @ Duke. https://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2011/02/08/contract-preemption-an-issue-to-watch/. Retrieved December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

An author, after transferring a copyright, can terminate the transfer under certain circumstances. This right to terminate the transfer is absolute and cannot be waived.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|203}}(a)(5); {{UnitedStatesCode|17|304}}(c)(5) ("Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration procedure==

[[File:Newspaper advert copyright patent and trade mark.jpg|thumb|Late 19th-century newspaper advertisement for copyright registration services|alt=Late 19th-century newspaper advertisement for copyright registration services. The text reads "United States and Foreign Copyright. Patents and Trade-Marks A Copyright will protect you from Pirates. And make you a fortune.

Consult us. Wormelle &amp; Van Mater, Managers, Columbia Copyright &amp; Patent Co. Inc, Washington, D.C."]]

Copyright is automatically granted to the author of an original work (that otherwise meets the basic copyright requirements, discussed above). Registration is not necessary. However, registration amplifies a copyright holder's rights in a number of ways. Registration is required before a lawsuit can be filed, and registration creates the possibility for enhanced "statutory" damages.

A copyright can be registered online at the US Copyright Office's website. The Copyright Office reviews applications for obvious errors or lack of copyrightable subject matter, and then issues a certificate of registration. The Copyright Office does not compare the authors new work against a collection of existing works or otherwise check for infringement.

===Deposit requirement===
The United States Copyright Office requires a deposit copy of the work for which copyright registration is sought. Deposits can be made through the Copyright Office's [http://www.copyright.gov/eco/ eCO System]. This deposit requirement serves two purposes. First, if a copyright infringement lawsuit arises, the owner may prove that the material that is infringed is exactly the same material for which the owner has secured a registration. Second, this requirement helps the Library of Congress build its collection of works.

Failure to comply with the deposit requirement, as modified by Copyright Office regulations, is punishable by fine, but does not result in forfeiture of copyright.

===Copyright notices===
{{main article|Copyright notice}}

The use of copyright notices is optional. The [[Berne Convention]], amending US copyright law in 1989, makes copyright automatic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf U.S. Copyright Office – Information Circular&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit—using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of "innocent infringement" being successful.&lt;ref name="USC, 17, 401 (d)" &gt;[[Title 17 of the United States Code|17 U.S.C.]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|401(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duration of copyright==
[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|right|500px|Expansion of U.S. [[copyright term]] (assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for seventy years)]]
Copyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. If the work was a "work for hire", then copyright persists for 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever is shorter. For works created before 1978, the copyright duration rules are complicated. However, works created before 1923 have made their way into the public domain.

===Works created before 1978===
For works published or registered before 1978, the maximum copyright duration is 95 years from the date of publication, if copyright was renewed during the 28th year following publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|304}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copyright renewal]] has been automatic since the [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]].

For works created before 1978, but not published or registered before 1978, the standard §302 copyright duration{{clarify|date=January 2018}} also applies. Prior to 1978, works had to be published or registered to receive copyright protection. Upon the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act (which was January 1, 1978) this requirement was removed and these unpublished, unregistered works received protection. However, Congress intended to provide an incentive for these authors to publish their unpublished works. To provide that incentive, these works, if published before 2003, would not have their protection expire before 2048.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

All copyrightable works published in the United States before 1923 are in the [[public domain]];&lt;ref&gt;"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2008].", ''[[Cornell University]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; works created before 1978 but not published until recently{{when|date=December 2017}} may be protected until 2047.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|303}}&lt;/ref&gt; For works that received their copyright before 1978, a renewal had to be filed in the work's 28th year with the Copyright Office for its term of protection to be extended. The need for renewal was eliminated by the [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]], but works that had already entered the public domain by non-renewal did not regain copyright protection. Therefore, works published before 1964 that were not renewed are in the public domain.

Before 1972, sound recordings were not subject to federal copyright, but copying was nonetheless regulated under various state [[tort]]s and statutes, some of which had no duration limit. The Sound Recording Amendment of 1971 extended federal copyright to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and declared that recordings fixed before that date would remain subject to state or [[common law]] copyright. Subsequent amendments had extended this latter provision until 2067.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|301}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, older sound recordings were not subject to the expiration rules that applied to contemporary visual works. Although these could have entered the public domain as a result of government authorship or formal grant by the owner, the practical effect has been to render public domain audio virtually nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jaszi |first1=Peter |last2=Lewis |first2=Nick |title=Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings under State Law and Its Impact on Use by Nonprofit Institutions: A 10-State Analysis |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-recording-preservation-plan/publications-and-reports/documents/pub146.pdf |website=Library of Congress |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources and Library of Congress |date=September 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation has changed with the 2018 enactment of the [[Music Modernization Act]], which extended federal copyright protection to all sound recordings, regardless of their date of creation, and preempted state copyright laws on those works. Under the Act, the first sound recordings to enter the public domain will be those fixed before 1923, which will enter the public domain on January 1, 2022. Recordings fixed between 1923 and February 14, 1972 will be phased into the public domain in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17963804/music-modernization-act-mma-copyright-law-bill-labels-congress | title = The Music Modernization Act has been signed into law | first =Dani  |last =Deahl | date = October 11, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/es/deeplinks/2018/09/new-music-modernization-act-has-major-fix-older-recordings-will-belong-public |title=The New Music Modernization Act Has a Major Fix: Older Recordings Will Belong to the Public, Orphan Recordings Will Be Heard Again |first=Mitch |last=Stolz |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=September 19, 2018 |accessdate=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, [[Percy Anderson (judge)|Judge Percy Anderson]] ruled in a lawsuit between ABS Entertainment and [[CBS Radio]] that "remastered" versions of pre-1972 recordings can receive a federal copyright as a distinct work due to the amount of creative effort expressed in the process.&lt;ref name="thr-cbs1972"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS Beats Lawsuit Over Pre-1972 Songs With Bold Copyright Argument|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/cbs-beats-lawsuit-pre-1972-898633|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright limitations, exceptions, and defenses==
United States copyright law includes numerous defenses, exceptions, and limitations. Some of the most important include:

* Copyright applies only to certain '''copyrightable subject matter''', codified within {{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}. Works that are not "original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression" are not subject to copyright. {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|17|102|b}} codifies that copyright protection does not extend to ideas, procedures, processes, systems, etc. Facts may not be copyrighted. "Useful articles" may not be copyrighted. Useful articles includes typeface designs (''[[Eltra Corp. v. Ringer]]''), fashion designs, blank forms, titles, names, short phrases, slogans, lists of ingredients and contents, domain names and band names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html|title=What Does Copyright Protect? (FAQ) - U.S. Copyright Office|work=copyright.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Macaca_nigra_self-portrait_large.jpg|thumb|200px|right|upright|As animal-made art, this [[monkey selfie]] is ineligible for copyright in the United States]]
* The [[first-sale doctrine|'''first sale doctrine''']]''',''' {{UnitedStatesCode|17|109}}, limits the rights of copyright holders to control the further distribution and display of copies of their works ''after'' the first sale by the copyright owner. The owner of a particular copy is entitled to "sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy" and to "display the copy publicly ... to viewers present at the place where the copy is located."
* The "good faith" defense (Section 504(c)(2)) reduces the statutory damages where the infringer was an educational institution, library, archive, or public broadcaster and reasonably believed that the infringing use was "fair use." 
* The Copyright Act includes specific exemptions for types of works and particular entities, such as '''libraries''' ({{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|108}}), '''public broadcasters''' ({{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|110}} and {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|118}}), '''braille''' ({{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|121}}), '''software backup copies''' ({{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|117}}), "cover license" permitting sound recording '''covers''' ({{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|115}}), and '''jukebox''' compulsory licenses ({{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|116}}).
* '''Provisions for the Blind and Disabled'''. The Copyright Act, in 17 USC 121 and 17 USC 110(8), includes specific statutory exceptions for reproduction of material for the blind or other persons with disabilities.  [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121 Section 121 (the "Chafee Amendment")] permits the reproduction of copyright works in [[Braille]], audio, electronic, [https://www.loc.gov/nls/reference/factsheets/webbraille2003.html Web-Braille], or other necessary formats. For instance, the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] (NLS) administers a program under Section 121, and the [[HathiTrust|HathiTrust Digital Library]] also relies on Section 121 in providing access to disabled users.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Authors Guild v. HathiTrust]]'', 902 F.Supp.2d 445 (SDNY 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Online Service Provider "Safe Harbor."''' [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|Section 512]] ("OCILLA", passed as part of the DMCA in 1998) provides a contingent "safe harbor" for online service providers from secondary liability for their users' copy infringements.
* US copyright law doesn’t allow animals to file copyright infringement lawsuits such as '''[[Animal-made art]]'''. i.e. a "photograph taken by a monkey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech-Culture/2014/0822/US-government-Monkey-selfies-ineligible-for-copyright | date = 22 August 2014 | accessdate = 23 August 2014 | first = Jacob | last = Axelrad | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | title = US government: Monkey selfies ineligible for copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Compendium313.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf |title=Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, § 313.2 |page=22 |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |date=December 22, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2015 |quote=To qualify as a work of 'authorship' a work must be created by a human being....

===Fair use===
{{main article|Fair use}}

Fair use is the use of limited amounts of copyrighted material in such a way as to not be an infringement. It is codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}, and states that "the fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright."  The section lists four factors that must be assessed to determine whether a particular use is fair.  There are no [[bright-line rule]]s regarding fair use and each determination is made on an individualized case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/|title = Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors|date = |accessdate = March 15, 2017|website =Stanford University Libraries |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes'':  Nonprofit educational and noncommercial uses are more likely to be fair use.  This does ''not'' mean that all nonprofit education and noncommercial uses are fair use or that all commercial uses are not fair. Instead, courts will balance the purpose and character of the use against the other factors below.  Additionally, “'''transformative'''” uses are more likely to be considered fair.  Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.
#''Nature of the copyrighted work'':  Using a more creative or imaginative work (such as a novel, movie, or song) is ''less'' likely to support fair use than using a factual work (such as a technical article or news item). In addition, use of an unpublished work is less likely to be considered fair.
#''Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole'':  Courts look at both the quantity and quality of the copyrighted material that was used. Using a large portion of the copyrighted work is less likely to be fair use. However, courts have occasionally found use of an ''entire'' work to be fair use, and in other contexts, using even a small amount of a copyrighted work was determined not to be fair use because the selection was an important part—or the “heart”—of the work.
#''Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work'':  Here, courts review whether, and to what extent, the unlicensed use harms the existing or future market for the copyright owner’s original work. In assessing this factor, courts consider whether the use is hurting the current market for the original work (for example, by displacing sales of the original) and/or whether the use could cause substantial harm if it were to become widespread.

In addition to these four factors, the statute also allows courts to consider any other factors that may be relevant to the fair use analysis. Courts evaluate fair use claims on a case-by-case basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on the specific facts of that case. There is ''no formula'' to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount of a work—or specific number of words, lines, pages, copies—may be used without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html|title = More Information on Fair Use|date = April 2015|accessdate = April 29, 2015|website =copyright.gov |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The justification of the fair use doctrine turns primarily on whether, and to what extent, the challenged use is ''transformative''. "The use must be productive and must employ the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original. A quotation of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to pass the test.... If, on the other hand, the secondary use adds value to the original--if the quoted matter is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings-- this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/levalfrustd.htm|title = Toward a Fair Use Standard|last = Leval|first = Pierre|date = 1990|journal = Harvard Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copyright Office provides a searchable list of fair use case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Cases|url=http://copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html|website=Copyright.gov|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies===
Although a [[parody]] can be considered a derivative work, and thus within the exclusive rights of the copyright owner, it may qualify as "fair use."  Parodies are not automatically fair use. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] stated that parody (transformative) "is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works." That commentary function provides some justification for use of the older work; in contrast, a satire (exaggerated) (which is not targeted at the work borrowed from) does not require use of the original work to make its point. (See ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'').&lt;ref name="works.bepress.com"/&gt;

==Infringement==
Copyright infringement occurs when someone violates one of the exclusive rights listed in 17 USC 106. Commonly, this involves someone creating or distributing a "copy" of a protected work that is "substantially similar" to the original version.

Infringement requires copying. If two people happen to write exactly the same story,  without knowledge of the other, there is no infringement.

===Copyright infringement litigation===

A copyright owner may bring a copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court. Federal courts have ''exclusive'' [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over copyright infringement cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Title 28 of the United States Code|28 U.S.C.]] {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|28|1338}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, an infringement case may not be brought in ''state'' courts. Note that the Copyright Office handles copyright registrations, but it does not adjudicate copyright infringement disputes.

==== Ownership of valid copyright ====
To bring a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copyright holder must establish ownership of a valid copyright and the copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.&lt;ref&gt;''see [[Feist v. Rural|Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.]]'' 499 U.S. 340, 361 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The copyright owner must also establish both (a) actual copying and (b) improper appropriation of the work.  The copyright owner, as plaintiff, bears the burden of establishing these three elements of the ''[[prima facie]]'' case for infringement.

A [[plaintiff]] establishes ownership by authorship (by the plaintiff itself or by someone who assigned rights to the plaintiff) of (1) an ''original'' work of authorship that is (2) fixed in a tangible medium (e.g. a book, musical recording, etc.).

Registration is not required to establish copyright protection, but registration is necessary before bringing a lawsuit. Registration is also useful because it creates a presumption of a ''valid'' copyright, it allows the plaintiff to collect enhanced "statutory damages", and to be eligible for an award of attorney fees.

A plaintiff establishes "actual copying" with direct or indirect evidence.  Direct evidence is satisfied either by a defendant's admission to copying or the testimony of witnesses who observed the defendant in the act.  More commonly, a plaintiff relies on circumstantial or indirect evidence.  A court will infer copying by a showing of a "'''striking similarity'''" between the copyrighted work and the alleged copy, along with a showing of both '''access''' and use of that access.&lt;ref&gt;''see Ty, Inc. v. GMA Accessories, Inc.'' 132 F.3d 1167 (7th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  A plaintiff may establish "access" by proof of distribution over a large geographical area, or by eyewitness testimony that the defendant owned a copy of the protected work.  Access alone is not sufficient to establish infringement.  The plaintiff must show a similarity between the two works, and the degree of similarity will affect the probability that illicit copying in fact occurred in the court's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' 132 F.3d 1167&lt;/ref&gt;  Even then, the plaintiff must show that the copying amounted to improper appropriation.  Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that not all copying constitutes infringement and a showing of misappropriation is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;''see Feist'' at 361&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Misappropriation ====
A copyrighted work may contain elements which are not copyrightable, such as facts, ideas, themes, or content in the [[public domain]].  A plaintiff alleging misappropriation must first demonstrate that what the defendant appropriated from the copyrighted work was protectible.  Second, a plaintiff must show that the '''intended audience''' will recognize '''[[substantial similarity|substantial similarities]]''' between the two works.  The intended audience may be the general public, or a specialized field.  The degree of similarity necessary for a court to find misappropriation is not easily defined.  Indeed, "the test for infringement of a copyright is of necessity vague."&lt;ref&gt;Judge [[Learned Hand]], ''Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp.'', 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2nd Cir. 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two methods are used to determine if unlawful appropriation has occurred: the "subtractive method" and the "totality method".

The '''subtractive method''', also known as the "abstraction/subtraction approach" seeks to analyze what parts of a copyrighted work are protectible and which are not.&lt;ref&gt;''see Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.'', 45 F.2d 119 (2nd Cir. 1930)&lt;/ref&gt;  The unprotected elements are ''subtracted'' and the fact finder then determines whether substantial similarities exist in the protectible expression which remains.  For instance, if the copyright holder for ''[[West Side Story]]'' alleged infringement, the elements of that musical borrowed from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' would be subtracted before comparing it to the allegedly infringing work because ''Romeo and Juliet'' exists in the public domain.

The '''totality method''', also known as the "total concept and feel" approach takes the work as a whole with all elements included when determining if a substantial similarity exists.
This was first formulated in ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co.]]'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv
 |last=Lehman|first=Bruce A. |page=104
 |title=Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure: The Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1vERuaJxIgC&amp;pg=PA104
 |accessdate=2012-06-23|date=1995-10-01|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-2415-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The individual elements of the alleged infringing work may by themselves be substantially different from their corresponding part in the copyrighted work, but nevertheless taken together be a clear misappropriation of copyrightable material.&lt;ref&gt;''see [[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'', 562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir. 1977) (holding that a series of [[McDonald's]] commercials portraying "McDonaldland" had used as its basis the "H.R. Pufnstuf" television show.  Corresponding characters to each, while displaying marked differences, taken altogether demonstrated that McDonald's had captured the total concept and feel of the show and had thus infringed).&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern courts may sometimes use both methods in its analysis of misappropriation.&lt;ref&gt;''see [[Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group]]'', 150 F.3d 132, 140 (2nd Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances, one method may find misappropriation while the other would not, making misappropriation a contentious topic in infringement litigation.&lt;ref&gt;''see Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.'', 982 F.2d 693, (2nd Cir. 1992) (where court chose the subtraction method for two computer programs whose total concept were the same.  Individual copied elements of the program were non-protectible material because they constituted a process or idea in the program, their utilitarian aspects barring copyright protection; no infringement found).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil remedies===
A successful copyright infringement plaintiff may seek both "injunctive relief" and monetary [[damages]].

'''Injunctions''': Copyright Act § 502 authorizes courts to grant both preliminary and permanent injunctions against copyright infringement. There are also provisions for impounding allegedly infringing copies and other materials used to infringe, and for their destruction.

'''Damages and/or Profits''': Copyright Act § 504 gives the copyright owner a choice of recovering: (1) their actual damages and any additional profits of the defendant; or (2) statutory damages.

====Equitable relief====

Both temporary and permanent injunctions are available to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.&lt;ref name="Section 502"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|502}}&lt;/ref&gt; An "injunction" is a court order directing the defendant to stop doing something (e.g., stop selling infringing copies).  One form of equitable relief that is available in copyright cases is a '''seizure order'''. At any time during the lawsuit, the court may order the impoundment of any and all copies of the infringing products. The seizure order may include materials used to produce such copies, such as master tapes, film negatives, printing plates, etc.  Items that are impounded during the course of the lawsuit can, if the plaintiff wins, be ordered destroyed as part of the final decree.

====Monetary damages====

A copyright holder can also seek monetary damages. Injunctions and damages are not [[mutually exclusive]]. One can have injunctions and no damages, or damages and no injunctions, or both injunctions and damages. There are two types of damages: actual damages and profits, or statutory damages.&lt;ref name="sec#504"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyright owner may recover the profits he or she would have earned absent the infringement (actual damages) and any profits the infringer might have made as a result of the infringement but that are not already considered in calculating actual damages.&lt;ref name="sec#504" /&gt; To recover actual damages, the plaintiff must prove to the court that, in the absence of the infringement, the plaintiff would have been able to make additional sales, or perhaps been able to charge higher prices, and that this would have resulted in profits given the owner's cost structure.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon V. Smith &amp; Russel L. Parr, "Intellectual Property: Valuation, Exploitation, and Infringement Damages," John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005, pp 617–630.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the profits earned by the infringer exploiting the copyrighted material may exceed those earned by or potentially available to the owner.  In these circumstances, the copyright owner can recover the infringer's profits if he or she can demonstrate a nexus between the profits and the infringing use.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Troxel and W.O. Kerr, "Assets and Finance: Calculating Intellectual Property Damages", West, 2014, pp 462-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statutory damages for copyright infringement|Statutory damages]] are available as an alternative to actual damages and profits.&lt;ref name = "sect#504c"/&gt; If the copyright was registered either (a) within three months of publication or (b) before the infringement, then the plaintiff is eligible to seek statutory damages.&lt;ref name="sect#504c"/&gt;  Statutory damages can be awarded by the court within the range of $750 to $30,000, but this can be lowered if the infringement is deemed inadvertent, or increased significantly if the infringement is willful.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''inter alia'', http://ipmetrics.net/blog/2010/06/17/copyright-infringement-damages/&lt;/ref&gt;

Statutory damages are sometimes preferable for the plaintiff if actual damages and profits are either too small, or too difficult to prove, or both.  There are, however, situations where statutory damages are not available. {{UnitedStatesCode|17|412}} provides:
* Statutory damages are not available if the work is unpublished and the infringement began before the effective date of its [[Copyright registration|registration]].
* Statutory damages are not available if the work is published but the infringement commenced after the first publication and before the effective date of its registration, unless registration is made within three months after the first publication.
Statutory damages are calculated per work infringed.&lt;ref name="sect#504c"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|504(c)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to clause (1) of Title 17, U.S.C. Section 504(c), statutory damages range from $750 per work to $30,000 per work, with two principal exceptions:
* In case of "innocent infringement", the amount may be reduced to a sum "not less than $200" for an effective range of $200 to $30,000 per work. "Innocent" is a technical term. In particular, if the work carries a copyright notice, the infringer cannot claim innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|17|402|d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In case of "willful infringement" (again, "willful" is a technical term), statutory damages can be no more than $150,000 for an effective range of $750 to $150,000 per work.&lt;ref name="sect#504c"/&gt;

Damages in copyright cases can be very high. In ''Lowry's Reports, Inc. v. Legg Mason Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;Lowry's Reports, Inc. v. Legg Mason Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 737 (D. Md. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; a 2003 lawsuit between a publisher of stock analysis newsletters against a company that buys one copy of the newsletters and makes multiple copies for use in-house, the jury awarded damages – actual damages for some newsletters and statutory damages for other newsletters – totaling $20 million.

====Attorney's fees====

Cost and attorney fees: Copyright Act § 505 permits courts, in their discretion, to award costs against either party and to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. The court may (but is not required to) award to the "prevailing party" reasonable attorney's fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|505}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to both a winning plaintiff (copyright owner) and a winning defendant (accused infringer).&lt;ref&gt;''Fogerty v. Fantasy'', {{ussc|510|517|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attorney's fees award is not available against the government.  Like statutory damages, attorney's fees are not available if the work infringed is not registered at the time of infringement.

===Criminal penalties===
{{main article|Criminal Copyright Law in the United States}}
In addition to the civil remedies, the Copyright Act provides for criminal prosecution in some cases of willful copyright infringement. There are also criminal sanctions for fraudulent copyright notice, fraudulent removal of copyright notice, and false representations in applications for copyright registration. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] imposes criminal sanctions for certain acts of circumvention and interference with copyright management information. There are not criminal sanctions for violating the rights of attribution and integrity held by the author of a work of visual art.

Criminal penalties for copyright infringement include:
* A [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] of not more than $500,000 or [[prison|imprisonment]] for not more than five years, or both, for the first [[Crime|offense]].
* A fine of not more than $1 million or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, for repeated offenses.
[[Nonprofit organization|Nonprofit]] libraries, archives, [[school|education institutions]] and [[public broadcasting]] entities are exempt from criminal prosecution.

Felony penalties for first offenses begin at seven copies for audiovisual works, and one hundred copies for sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/71mcrm.htm|title=9-71.000 - Copyright Law|work=justice.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government infringement===
The U.S. government, its agencies and officials, and corporations owned or controlled by it, are subject to suit for copyright infringement.  All infringement claims against the U.S. that did not arise in a foreign country must be filed with the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] within three years of the infringing action.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|28|1498|b}}-{{UnitedStatesCodeSub|28|1498|c|pipe=(c)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Claims filed in the wrong court are dismissed for lack of [[subject-matter jurisdiction]].  The government and its agencies are also authorized to settle the infringement claims out of court.

==Public domain==
{{main article|Public domain in the United States}}
Works in the [[public domain]] are free for anyone to copy and use. Strictly speaking, the term "public domain" means that the work is not covered by any [[intellectual property]] rights at all (copyright, trademark, patent, or otherwise).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Boyle| first = James| title = The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind| publisher = CSPD| year = 2008| pages = 38| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=Fn1Pl9Gv_EMC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn=978-0-300-13740-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this article discusses public domain with respect to copyright ''only''.

A work may enter the public domain in a number of different ways. For example, (a) the copyright protecting the work may have expired, or (b) the owner may have explicitly donated the work to the public, or (c) the work is not the type of work that copyright can protect.

== Orphan works ==
{{main article|Orphan works in the United States}}
The "[[orphan works]]" problem arose in the United States with the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976, which eliminated the need to register copyrighted works, instead declaring that all "original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression"&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; fall into copyright status. The elimination of registration also eliminated a central recording location to track and identify copyright-holders. Consequently, potential users of copyrighted works, e.g., filmmakers or biographers, must assume that many works they might use are copyrighted.  Where the planned use would not be otherwise permitted by law (for example, by [[fair use]]), they must themselves individually investigate the copyright status of each work they plan to use.  With no central database of copyright-holders, identifying and contacting copyright-holders can sometimes be difficult; those works that fall into this category may be considered "orphaned".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5754">The '''Critical Legal Conference''' ('''CLC''') is an annual critical legal theory conference which gathers a community of critical legal theoreticians and activists. Along with the [[Conference on Critical Legal Studies]] in America, and [[Critique du Droit]] in France it contributed to the formation of critical legal theory as a movement and field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1410293|title = The Critique of Law: What is 'Critical' about Critical Legal Theory?|journal = Journal of Law and Society|volume = 14|issue = 1|pages = 5–19|last1 = Hunt|first1 = Alan|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharyn L. Roach Anleu, ''Law and Social Change'', 63, Sage Publications inc. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference is based in the UK but it has also been held in India, Finland and Ireland. It is associated with the [[critical legal studies]] (CLS) movement and loosely associated with the journal [[Law &amp; Critique]].

Despite the putative association with American CLS, [[Costas Douzinas]], who has been closely involved with the British CLC from its outset, has argued that their ethos are very different. American CLS was intellectually focused on the "critique of the judicial institutions and reasoning" while its politics "were largely exhausted in the intrigue of the academy and the endless search for media exposure".&lt;ref name="Douzinas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Douzinas|first=Costas|title=Oubliez Critique|url=http://www.criticallegalthinking.com/Critical_Legal_Thinking/Douzinas_files/oubliez%20critique.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321005454/http://www.criticallegalthinking.com/Critical_Legal_Thinking/Douzinas_files/oubliez%20critique.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-21|df=}} Originally published in {{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10978-005-4907-8 | volume=16 | title=Oubliez Critique | journal=Law and Critique | pages=47–69| year=2005 | last1=Douzinas | first1=Costas }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, on the one hand, American CLS was a "political movement with little politics",&lt;ref name="Douzinas"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[t]he  British  Critical  Legal  Conference  (CLC),  on  the  other  hand,  is  an  intellectual movement with lots of politics. The annual CLC started in 1984 and has taken place without  interruption  ever since. In  all  these  years  of  operation  no  officers  or  posts, chairmen  and  secretaries,  committees  or  delegates  were  created. There  is  no organization. The conference was and remains just that: a conference and an umbrella name. We could call the CLC ‘a community always to come’, a broad church that exists for three days once every year in its gathering and ceases existing once it is over. Every September the place for the next conference is decided and people bid their good-byes for another year, leaving it to the next organiser to put together the programme.  No honour, power or position attaches to the conference, no promotion preferment or move to better posts follows  organisation  or  participation.  There  is  only  an  annual  conference  and people who turn out every year because they love ideas and they are concerned about the role of law in society and their own role within the institution.   Over the years, these conferences  introduced  themes,  schools  of  thought  and  movements  unknown  or dismissed by legal scholarship. Western marxism, postmodernism and deconstruction were the main theoretical influences of the early conferences but soon the new radicalism of race, gender, queer  and post-colonial theory were introduced in the legal  academy through the CLC. Indeed these conferences were the only academic venues in which such themes were discussed for many years before they became respectable and entered, albeit marginally, mainstream academia.&lt;ref name="Douzinas"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Critical Legal Conference was established in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Neil J. Smelser, Paul B. Baltes,   
International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, 2971, Pergamon (22 Nov 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and its first annual meeting  was held at the University of Kent in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1410297|title = Beyond the Public/Private Division: Law, Power and the Family|journal = Journal of Law and Society|volume = 14|issue = 1|pages = 61–76|last1 = Rose|first1 = Nikolas|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Hunt (professor)|Alan Hunt]] was the founding chair of the Critical Legal Conference.&lt;ref&gt;J.

The '''Cuba–Haiti Maritime Boundary Agreement''' is a 1977 [[treaty]] between [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]] which [[Boundary delimitation|delimits]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). ''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas, '' p.&amp;nbsp;217; Charney, Jonathan ''et al.'' (2005). ''International Maritime Boundaries,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;551–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite no official [[Cuba-Haiti relations|diplomatic relations]] at the time between the two countries, the treaty was signed in [[Havana]] on 27 October 1977. The text of the treaty sets out a [[border|boundary]] that is an approximate equidistant line between the two islands in the [[Windward Passage]]. The boundary consists of 50 straight-line [[ocean|maritime]] segments defined by 51 individual coordinate points. [[Navassa Island]], which is off the west coast of Haiti and which is claimed by Haiti and by the [[United States]], was disregarded in calculating the approximate equidistant line of the boundary. 

The treaty came into force on 6 January 1978 after it had been [[ratification|ratified]] by both countries.. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement between the Republic of Haiti and the Republic of Cuba Regarding the Delimitation of Maritime Boundaries between the Two States''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10956">A '''[[declaration of war]]''' is a formal declaration issued by a national [[government]] indicating that a state of [[war]] exists between that nation and another. In the [[United Kingdom]], only the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] has the power to declare war and peace, under the [[royal prerogative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm72/7239/7239.pdf The Governance of Britain - War powers and treaties: Limiting Executive powers], ''[[The Stationery Office]]'', 2007-10-25. Retrieved on 2009-03-15&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no declarations of war since the Second World War, though [[British Armed Forces]] have taken part in armed conflict on numerous occasions nonetheless.

There has been a long-running debate&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor|Norton-Taylor, Richard]] [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/dec/28/uk.military Former defence chiefs oppose role for MPs in war decisions], ''[[The Guardian]]''. 2007-12-28. Retrieved on 2009-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Kettle|Kettle, Martin]] [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/23/monarchy.iraq A declaration of war on this medieval royal prerogative], ''[[The Guardian]]''. 2005-08-23. Retrieved on 2009-03-15&lt;/ref&gt; regarding whether [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] alone should have the power to declare war and more widely to commit British forces to armed conflict. This was attempted (to the limited extent of possible war against [[Iraq]]) in 1999 with the introduction of the [[Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill]]. However [[Queen Elizabeth II]], acting upon the advice of her government at the time, refused to grant her consent&lt;ref name="parliament1"&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990723/debtext/90723-23.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the bill to be debated in Parliament and so it was dropped ([[Queen's Consent]] was needed before debate could take place because the bill affected the royal prerogative).&lt;ref name="parliament1"/&gt; The [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] originally included a section that would have required Parliamentary approval for use of the armed forces, but this was dropped from the bill before [[royal assent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5519">'''Domain name warehousing''' is the practice of [[Domain name registrar|registrars]] obtaining control of expired [[domain name]]s already under their management, with the intent to hold or “warehouse” names for their own use and/or profit.

Typically this practice occurs after a domain name has expired and the previous (registrant) has not exercised his or her right to renew the name within the allotted time frame; usually 45 days following expiration. A domain's expiration date and time can be calculated based on the expiration date in the [[Whois|WHOIS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHOIS|url=https://community.icann.org/display/gnsoiscp/WHOIS|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Auto-Renew Grace Period (0–45 days) and the Redemption Grace Period (RDP) of the registry managing the domain registration (30 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Renewing an Expired Domain|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/expired-2013-05-03-en|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
According to the Generic Names Supporting Organization Council (GNSO) Deletes Task Force Report (2003), a council organized under the [[ICANN|Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)]], three specific modes of warehousing have been identified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4.1  Domain name warehousing|url=http://gnso.icann.org/en/issues/deletes/report-final-17jun03.html|work=Deletes Task Force Final Report (2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The registrant allows the domain name to lapse, but registrar fails to delete the domain name during the grace period, resulting in a paid renewal to the registry.  The registrar subsequently assumes registration of the domain name.
# The registrant purchases the domain name through fraud and the registrar assumes registration of the name to resell in order to minimize losses.
# The registrar registers the domain in its own name outright.

==Controversy==
The Registrars Accreditation Agreement (RAA) currently does not disallow this practice. However, the ICANN community has open calls for policy changes to limit warehousing, as it is perceived as unfair to potential registrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibit Domain Name Warehousing and Self-Dealing by Registrars|url=https://community.icann.org/display/RAA/Prohibit+Domain+Name+Warehousing+and+Self-Dealing+by+Registrars|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary concern today with the practice of domain warehousing is that retail registrars, which have historically focused on serving individual and small business registrants, are now actively collecting lapsed domain names and offering drop catch services that conflict with the concept of fair access to domain names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibit Domain Name Warehousing and Self-Dealing by Registrars|url=https://community.icann.org/display/RAA/Prohibit+Domain+Name+Warehousing+and+Self-Dealing+by+Registrars|publisher=ICANN|accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional concern is that companies pooling scores of [[drop registrar]]s for additional registry connections will stand at the expiring domain spigot conducting [[domain tasting]] without paying, and then warehouse those that meet traffic criteria while denying the broader community a fair opportunity to compete for those expiring names.

From 2005 to 2008, GoDaddy had a subsidiary Standard Tactics, which held domains previously owned by GoDaddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Tactics, LLC: How GoDaddy Profits from Expired Domains|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2008/12/03/standard-tactics-llc-how-godaddy-profits-from-expired-domains/|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this was reported on, GoDaddy closed down Standard Tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoDaddy Moves To Close Shady Standard Tactics Subsidiary|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/18/godaddy-moves-to-close-shady-standard-tactics-subsidiary/|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, today, GoDaddy openly practices domain warehousing. Instead of letting domains which GoDaddy considers "Premium domains" expire, GoDaddy takes control of and lists as "Premium Domains" those domains, after the registrant - GoDaddy's customer - allows them to lapse, even before the end of the redemption period. These domains are often listed at GoDaddy auctions for thousands of dollars, as "Premium domains". GoDaddy sells these domains at auction while the original registrant is still entitled to redemption of the domain, with the stipulation that if the original registrant uses their right to redeem the domain and renews it within the redemption period, GoDaddy simply refunds the money paid by the winning bidder.

ICANN has not yet amended the RAA with policies to limit domain warehousing and related practices. Registrars are in a unique position to impact domain name pricing by introducing competitive bidding or auctions for expired domain names. Fair access to domain names is further impacted when registrars opt not to market the warehoused domains immediately, delaying the recycling of warehoused names indefinitely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24736">{{short description|A legal obligation to provide a standard of reasonable care when performing an activity that could foreseeably harm others }}
{{Tort law}} 
In [[Tort|tort law]], a '''duty of care''' is a [[Law|legal]] [[Law of obligations|obligation]] which is imposed on an individual requiring adherence to a [[standard of care|standard]] of [[Reasonable person|reasonable]] care while performing any acts that could foreseeably harm others. It is the first element that must be established to proceed with an action in [[negligence]]. The claimant must [[Cause of action|be able to show]] a duty of care imposed by law which the defendant has breached. In turn, breaching a [[duty]] may subject an individual to liability. The duty of care may be imposed ''by [[operation of law]]'' between individuals with no ''current'' direct relationship (familial or contractual or otherwise), but eventually become related in some manner, as defined by [[common law]] (meaning case law).

Duty of care may be considered a formalisation of the [[social contract]], the implicit responsibilities held by individuals towards others within [[society]]. It is not a requirement that a duty of care be defined by law, though it will often develop through the [[jurisprudence]] of [[common law]].

==Development of the ''general'' duty of care==
At common law, duties were formerly limited to those with whom one was in [[privity]] one way or another, as exemplified by cases like ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'' (1842). In the early 20th century, judges began to recognize that the cold realities of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (in which end users were frequently several parties removed from the original manufacturer) implied that enforcing the privity requirement against hapless consumers had harsh results in many [[product liability]] cases.  The idea of a general duty of care that runs to all who could be foreseeably affected by one's conduct (accompanied by the demolishing of the privity barrier) first appeared in the judgment of [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|William Brett (later Lord Esher)]], [[Master of the Rolls]], in ''[[Heaven v Pender]]'' (1883). Although Brett's formulation was rejected by the rest of the court, similar formulations later appeared in the landmark U.S. case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' (1916) and, in the UK, in ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' (1932).  Both ''MacPherson'' and ''Donoghue'' were product liability cases, and both expressly acknowledged and cited Brett's analysis as their inspiration.

==Scope==
Although the duty of care is easiest to understand in contexts like simple [[blunt trauma]], it is important to understand that the duty can be still found in situations where plaintiffs and defendants may be separated by vast distances of space and time.

For instance, an engineer or construction company involved in erecting a building may be reasonably responsible to tenants inhabiting the building many years in the future. This point is illustrated by the decision of the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] in ''Terlinde v. Neely'' 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980), later cited by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No. 36 v. Bird Construction Co.'' [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85:
{{bquote|The plaintiffs, being a member of the class for which the home was constructed, are entitled to a duty of care in construction commensurate with industry standards. In the light of the fact that the home was constructed as speculative, the home builder cannot reasonably argue he envisioned anything but a class of purchasers. By placing this product into the stream of commerce, the builder owes a duty of care to those who will use his product, so as to render him accountable for negligent workmanship.}}

==Responsibility==
Although the idea of a general duty of care is now widely accepted, there are significant differences among the [[common law]] jurisdictions concerning the specific circumstances under which that duty of care exists. Obviously, courts cannot impose unlimited liability and hold everyone liable for everyone else's problems; as [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] put it, to rule otherwise would be to expose defendants "to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche]]'', 255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;  There must be some reasonable limit to the duty of care; the problem is where to set that limit.

===England===
{{main article|Duty of care in English law}}

The question whether a duty of care exists depends firstly on whether there is an analogous case in which the Courts have previously held there to exist (or not exist) a duty of care; and, if there is no analogous case, what the particular court deciding the case at issue itself thinks about whether a duty of care exists. Situations in which a duty of care have previously been held to exist include doctor and patient, manufacturer and consumer &lt;ref&gt; Donoghue, infra &lt;/ref&gt;, and surveyor and mortgagor &lt;ref&gt; Smith v. Eric S Bush, [1990] 1 AC 831 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Accordingly, if there is an analogous case on duty of care, the court will simply apply that case to the facts of the new case without asking itself any normative question &lt;ref&gt; Robinson v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, [2018] UKSC 4 &lt;/ref&gt; . It is only if there is no similar case that the court will then go onto apply the normative criteria which Lord Bridge of Harwich sets out in ''[[Caparo Industries plc v Dickman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Caparo Industries plc v Dickman'' [1990] 2 AC 605&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[House of Lords]] set out the following three-part test:

* Harm must be a "reasonably foreseeable" result of the defendant's conduct;&lt;ref name="Donoghue v Stevenson"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Donoghue v Stevenson]] |court=UKHL |year=1932 |num=100 |parallelcite=[1932] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 562 |courtname=auto |date=26 May 1932}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|260|2015|litigants=Wormleaton v Thomas &amp; Coffey Limited (No 4) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1961|litigants=Chapman v Hearse |parallelcite=(1961) 106 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 112 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|169|2015|litigants=Endeavour Energy v Precision Helicopters Pty Ltd |parallelcite= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A relationship of "proximity" must exist between the defendant and the claimant;
* It must be "fair, just and reasonable" to impose liability.

===Australia===
The High Court of Australia has deviated from the British approach, which still recognises a proximity element. Rather, Australian law first determines whether the case at hand fits within an established category of case where a duty of care has been found.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1999|litigants=Perre v Apand |parallelcite= (1999) 198 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 180 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 217}} For example, occupiers of a premises automatically owe a duty of care to any person on their premises.&lt;ref name="Safeway Stores v Zaluzna"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1987|litigants=Safeway Stores v Zaluzna |parallelcite= (1987) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If this is not the case, then the plaintiff must prove that it was reasonably foreseeable that harm could result from the defendant's actions. If so, the Court then applies a 'salient features' test to determine whether the plaintiff is owed a duty of care.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt; Some of the salient features which the Court considers in making this inquiry include:
# Whether imposition of a duty of care would lead to 'indeterminate liability' – that is, it would interfere with the legitimate protection or pursuit of an individual's social or business interests.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 219-20}}
# Whether imposition of a duty would constitute an unreasonable burden on individual autonomy.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 223-5}}
# The degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff to the defendant's actions – their ability to guard against the harm.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 225-6}}
# The degree of knowledge which the defendant had about the probability and likely magnitude of harm to the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 230-1}}
Special rules exist for the establishment of duty of care where the plaintiff suffered mental harm, or where the defendant is a public authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Civil Liability Act 2002}} sections 27–33; 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To establish a duty of care, the plaintiff has to satisfy the requirement of CLA Act ss 27-33. In light of this, a large number of individuals cannot claim injuries as well. Meanwhile, compared to the ‘No-Fault Compensation’ system in New Zealand, the cost to claim injuries is much higher. In light of this, individuals especially the victims who lack knowledge or capability may choose not claim private nuisance after balancing the burden and outcomes. This view affirmed by Regina Graycar, he states that the courts in Australia are reluctant to award damages for personal injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Graycar, ‘Love’s Labour’s Cost: The High Court Decision in Van Gervan v Fenton’ (1993) 1 Torts Law Journal 122,136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, a plaintiff is able to recover for non-economic loss, including pain and suffering, loss of amenities/expectation of life and disfigurement, upon the severity of the loss being at least 15% of 'most extreme case'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Civil Liability Act 2002|16}}(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
As of October 2016, NSW Attorney General, Gabrielle Upton, has updated the maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss from $594,000 to $605,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Civil Liability (Non-economic Loss) Amendment Order'' 2016 (NSW) |url=https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2010/606/whole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On 27 March 2017, the French [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] adopted a law entitled “Devoir de vigilance des entreprises donneuses d'ordre”, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/dossiers/devoir_vigilance_entreprises_donneuses_ordre.asp Entreprises : devoir de vigilance des entreprises donneuses d'ordre], published 28 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; whose title has been translated into English as a "duty of vigilance" or "duty of care".&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Trading Initiative, [http://www.ethicaltrade.org/blog/france-adopts-new-corporate-duty-care-law France adopts new corporate “duty of care” law], 1 March 2017, accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The law will oblige large [[French companies]] (companies with at least 5,000 staff in France or 10,000 staff within their combined French and foreign offices over two consecutive years) &lt;ref&gt;Norton Rose Fulbright, [http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/147606/a-new-duty-of-care-for-the-most-significant-companies-in-france A new duty of care for the most significant companies in France], accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to:
:"Establish and implement a diligence plan which should state the measures taken to identify and prevent the occurrence of human rights and environmental risks resulting from their activities, the activities of companies they control and the activities of [[sub-contractor]]s and suppliers on whom they have a significant influence."&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Trading Initiative, [http://www.ethicaltrade.org/blog/france-adopts-new-corporate-duty-care-law France adopts new corporate “duty of care” law], 1 March 2017, accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Because each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s is a separate [[States' rights|sovereign]] free to develop its own tort law under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], there are several tests for finding a duty of care in [[United States tort law]].

====Foreseeability test====
In several states, like [[Florida]] and [[Massachusetts]], the sole test is whether the harm to the plaintiff from the defendant's actions was foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;''McCain v. Florida Power Corp.'', 593 So. 2d 500, 503 (Fla. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jupin v. Kask'', 849 N.E.2d 829, 835 (Mass. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multi-factor test====
The [[Supreme Court of California]], in a [[majority opinion]] by Justice [[David Eagleson]], criticized the idea that foreseeability, standing alone, constitutes an adequate basis on which to rest the duty of care: "Experience has shown that . . . there are clear judicial days on which a court can foresee forever and thus determine liability but none on which that foresight alone provides a socially and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of damages."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thing v. La Chusa]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/48C3d644.htm 48 Cal. 3d 644, 667] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing upon the work of scholars such as Fowler V. Harper, Fleming James Jr., and [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], [[California]] has developed a complicated [[balancing test]] consisting of multiple factors which must be carefully weighed against one another to determine whether a duty of care exists in a negligence action.

[[California Civil Code]] section 1714 imposes a general duty of ordinary care, which by default requires all persons to take reasonable measures to prevent harm to others.&lt;ref name="51 Cal.4th 764"&gt;Cabral v. Ralphs [http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/cabral-v-ralphs-grocery-33956 51 Cal.4th 764] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1968 case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'', the court held that judicial exceptions to this general duty of care should only be created if clearly justified based on the following public-policy factors:

*the foreseeability of harm to the injured party;
*the degree of certainty he or she suffered injury;
*the closeness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered;
*the moral blame attached to the defendant’s conduct;
*the policy of preventing future harm;
*the extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community of imposing a duty of care with resulting liability for breach;
*and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.&lt;ref name="69 Cal. 2d 108"&gt;''Rowland v. Christian'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/69C2d108.htm 69 Cal. 2d 108] (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1997 case added to this:

*the social utility of the defendant's conduct from which the injury arose.&lt;ref&gt;''Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/15C4t456.htm 15 Cal. 4th 456] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary California appellate decisions treat the ''Rowland'' decision as the "gold standard" for determining the existence of a legal duty of care, and generally refer to the criteria for determining the existence of a legal duty of care as the ''Rowland'' factors.&lt;ref&gt;''Romero v. Superior Court'', [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/89/1068.html 89 Cal.App.4th 1068] (2001), quoting, "Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc." [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/81/377.html 81 Cal. App. 4th 377] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the duty inquiry focuses on the general category of conduct at issue and the range of foreseeable harm it creates, rather than the specific actions or injuries in each case.&lt;ref&gt;''Ballard v. Aribe'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/41C3d564.htm#MA000696 41 Cal. 3d 564, 572 n.6] (1986).
In this oft-cited footnote, the Court stated: "[A] court's task — in determining 'duty' — is not to decide whether a particular plaintiff's injury was reasonably foreseeable in light of a particular defendant's conduct, but rather to evaluate more generally whether the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced that liability may appropriately be imposed on the negligent party."&lt;/ref&gt; Appellate lawyer [[Jeffrey Ehrlich]] persuaded the California Supreme Court to clarify the central importance of this distinction with its 2011 decision in ''Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co''. which requires "no duty" rulings to be based on categorical public-policy rules that can be applied to a range of cases, without reference to detailed facts.&lt;ref&gt;"Chavez v. Glock, Inc." [http://www.leagle.com/xmlresult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20CACO%2020120724024.xml 207 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1314] (2012), ''citing'', "Cabral v. Ralphs" [http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/cabral-v-ralphs-grocery-33956 51 Cal.4th 764, 772] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;    By requiring courts to apply the ''Rowland'' factors at this high level of factual generality, the ''Cabral'' decision preserved the role of juries in determining whether the defendant breached its duty of care based on the unique circumstances of each case.&lt;ref name="51 Cal.4th 764"/&gt;

A majority of U.S. states have adopted some kind of multi-factor analysis based on the work of Prosser and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. City of Fremont'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/68CA4t243.htm 68 Cal.App.4th 243] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states simply copied California's factors but modified them, like [[Michigan]] (which deleted the insurance factor and never picked up the social utility factor),&lt;ref&gt;''Buczkowski v. McKay'', 441 Mich. 96, 1100-1101; 490 N.W.2d 330 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; while others developed different lists of factors, such as this one from [[Tennessee]]:

*the foreseeability of the harm or injury;
*the possible magnitude of the potential harm or injury;
*the importance or social value of the activity engaged in by the defendant;
*the usefulness of the conduct to the defendant;
*the feasibility of alternative conduct;
*the costs and burdens associated with the alternative conduct;
*the relative usefulness of the alternative conduct;
*and the relative safety of the alternative conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''McCall v. Wilder'', 913 S.W.2d 150, 153 (Tenn. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 law review article identified 43 states that use a multifactor analysis in 23 various incarnations; consolidating them together results in a list of 42 different factors used by U.S. courts to determine whether a duty of care exists.&lt;ref&gt;W. Jonathan Cardi, ''The Hidden Legacy of Palsgraf: Modern Duty Law in Microcosm'', 91 B.U.L. Rev. 1873 (Dec. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tennessee Court of Appeal has also recently followed the California Supreme Court's lead by citing ''Cabral'' for the proposition that duty determinations must be made at the highest level of factual generality.&lt;ref&gt;"Gregory v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville", [http://judicialview.com/State-Cases/tennessee/Government__Politics/Gregory-v-Metropolitan-Government-of-Nashville-and-Davidson-County/28/565916 2012 WL 5306196, *10] (Tenn. Ct. App., 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{main article|Standard of care|Reasonable person}}

Once a duty exists, the plaintiff must show that the defendant ''breached'' it. This is generally treated as the second element of negligence in the United States. Breach involves testing the defendant's actions against the standard of a ''reasonable person'', which varies depending on the facts of the case. For example, [[physician]]s will be held to reasonable standards for members of their profession, rather than those of the general public, in negligence actions for [[medical malpractice]].

In turn, once the appropriate standard has been found, the ''breach'' is proven when the plaintiff shows that the defendant's conduct fell below or did not reach the relevant standard of reasonable care.&lt;ref&gt;''Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t26.htm 19 Cal.4th 26] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is possible that the defendant took every possible precaution and ''exceeded'' what would have been done by any reasonable person, yet the plaintiff was injured. If that is the case, then as a matter of law, the duty of care has not been breached and the plaintiff cannot recover in negligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Gilson v. Metropolitan Opera'', 5 N.Y.3d 574 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/186CA4t755.htm 186 Cal. App. 4th 755] (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This is the key difference between negligence and [[strict liability]]; if strict liability attaches to the defendant's conduct, then the plaintiff can recover under that theory regardless of whatever precautions were taken by the defendant.

==Examples==

=== Products ===
Product liability was the context in which the general duty of care first developed. Manufacturers owe a duty of care to consumers who ultimately purchase and use the products. In the case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562 of the House of Lords, [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] stated:

{{bquote|My Lords, if your Lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action you will be affirming the proposition that by Scots and English law alike a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.}}

===Land===
{{main article|Premises liability}}
[[File:Occupiers Liability Warning Notice Ireland.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A notice informing potential entrants of limits to the duty of care]]
At common law, in the case of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their premises varied depending on whether a person was classified as a [[trespasser]], [[licensee]], or [[invitee]]. This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions.  For example, England enacted the [[Occupiers Liability Act 1957]]. Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'',&lt;ref name="69 Cal. 2d 108"/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of California]] replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to ''all'' persons on one's land, regardless of their status. After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the [[California Legislature]] enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t714.htm 19 Cal. 4th 714] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado's highest court adopted the ''Rowland'' unified duty of care analysis in 1971. The resulting explosion of lawsuits against Colorado landowners caused the state legislature to enact the Colorado Premises Liability Act in 1986, which enacted a cleaned-up statutory version of the common law classifications ''and'' simultaneously expressly displaced all common law remedies against landowners in order to prevent state courts from again expanding their liability.

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], under the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, the duty of care to trespassers, visitors and "recreational users" can be restricted by the occupier; provided reasonable notice is given, for which a prominent notice at the usual entrance to the premises usually suffices.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1995/en/act/pub/0010/print.html|title=Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995|date=17 June 1995|work=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=2009-10-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
{{See also|Business judgment rule}}

In business, "the duty of care addresses the attentiveness and prudence of managers in performing their decision-making and supervisory functions."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"&gt;Alan R. Palmiter, ''Corporations: Examples and Explanations'', 5th ed. (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2006), 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The "business judgment rule presumes that directors (and officers) carry out their functions in [[good faith]], after sufficient investigation, and for acceptable reasons. Unless this presumption is overcome, courts abstain from second-guessing well-meaning business decisions even when they are flops. This is a risk that shareholders take when they make a corporate investment."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;

The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides principles and practices for evaluating risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docra.org/|title=The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard|last=|first=|date=|website=DoCRA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA evaluates safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7917">{{main|English people#Historical origins and identity}}

A '''national identity of the [[English people|English]]''' as the people or ethnic group native to [[England]] developed in the [[Middle Ages]] arguably beginning with the unification of the [[Kingdom of England]] in the 10th century, but explicitly in the 11th century after the [[Norman Conquest]], when [[Englishry]] came to be the status of the subject indigenous population.

From the eighteenth century the terms 'English' and 'British' began to be seen as interchangeable to many of the English.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxpo.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/national_identity/Smith_Paper.pdf|title=‘Set in the Silver Sea’: English National Identity and European Integration|last=Smith|first=Anthony|date=13 May 2005|work=Workshop: National Identity and Euroscepticism: A Comparison Between France and the United Kingdom|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the official [[census in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom census]] does record ethnicity, English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British is a single tick-box under the "White" heading for the answer to the ethnicity question asked in England and Wales (while making the distinction of [[Irish migration to Great Britain|white Irish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/measuring-equality/equality/ethnic-nat-identity-religion/ethnic-group/index.html|title=Ethnic group|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Englishness and [[Britishness]] are used synonymously in some contexts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/public_life/gwynfor_evans.shtml |title=South East Wales Public Life - Dr Gwynfor Evans |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two terms are not identical and the relation of each to the other is complex. Englishness is often a response to different national identities within Britain such as Scottishness, Irishness, Welshness and [[Cornish people|Cornishness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire and After: Englishness in Postcolonial Perspective|year=2010|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84545-320-6|pages=1–25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StFvN6zt9icC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=empire+and+after&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=z_eZTam2JJXU4wb8jdTUAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Introduction: Nationalism Beyond the NationState|editors=MacPhee, Graham and Prem Poddar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes Englishness is thought to be encapsulated in terms of a particular relation to sport: "fair play," for instance. Arguably, England's "national games" are football and, particularly, cricket.  As cricket historian Dominic Malcolm argues, the link between cricket and England's national identity became solidified through literature. Works such as James Love's "Cricket: an heroic poem" and Mary Mitford's "our Village,"  along with Nyren's "cricketers of my Time" and Pycroft's "The Cricket Field," purported to identify the characteristics of cricket with the notional characteristics of English society, such as pragmatism, integrity, and independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Dominic|title=Globalizing Cricket: Englishness, Empire and Identity|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|place=London |isbn=9781849665612|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">The '''European Legislation Identifier''' (ELI) provides, among others, a solution to uniquely identify and access national and European legislation online. This will guarantee easier access, exchange and reuse of legislation for public authorities, professional users, academics and citizens. ELI paves the way for a semantic web of legal gazettes and official journals
&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-1040_en.htm|title=Major progress towards transparency: a new European Legislation Identifier|date= 28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of ELI==
ELI uses [[URI Template]]s (RFC 6570)
&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6570.txt|title=URI Template (RFC-6570)|date=March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that carry semantics both from a legal and an end-user point of view.
Each Member State will build its own, self-describing URIs using the described components as well as taking into account their specific language requirements.

All the components are optional and can be selected based on national requirements and do not have a pre-defined order.

To enable the exchange of information the chosen URI template must be documented using the URI template mechanism.

Example:

:&lt;code&gt;/eli/{jurisdiction}/{agent}/{sub-agent}/{year}/{month}/{day}/{type}/{natural identifier}/{level 1…}/{point in time}/{version}/{language}&lt;/code&gt;

==Metadata==

In addition to HTTP URIs uniquely identifying legislation ELI encourages the use of relevant metadata elements to further describe it. Annex, section 2  fully specifies the corresponding recommended and optional elements and their underlying ontology) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Conclusions inviting the Introduction of a European Legislation Identifier|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1396269218211&amp;uri=CELEX:52012XG1026%2801%29|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RDFa==
ELI invites participating Member States to embed these metadata elements into the webpages of their Legal Information Systems using [[RDFa]].

The '''Executive Court of Prešov''', also known as ''Caraffa's slaughter'', was a political court which the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] count and imperial general [[Antonio Caraffa]], founded in 1681 in [[Prešov]] to murder and threaten [[Imre Thököly|Thököly]]'s followers. The board consisted of 4 imperial soldiers and 8 [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] noblemen and citizens. But as one of the judges claimed: each general's votes were limited; everything had to happen according to the general's will. They had to whisper their votes to Caraffa. The non-Hungarian members' votes weighed more, and even the judgements were not made according to the votes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4399">'''Film rights''' are rights under [[copyright]] law to produce a [[film]] as a [[derivative work]] of a given item of [[intellectual property]]. In [[US law]], these rights belong to the holder of the copyright, who may sell (or "[[option (filmmaking)|option]]") them to someone in the film industry—usually a [[film producer|producer]] or [[film director|director]], or sometimes a specialist broker of such properties—who will then try to gather industry professionals and secure the financial backing necessary to convert the property into a film. Such rights differ from the right to commercially exhibit a finished motion picture, which rights are usually referred to as "exhibition rights" or "public-performance rights".

==Origins==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the need to secure film rights of previously published or produced source materials still under copyright stems from [[case law]].  In 1907, the [[Kalem Company]] produced a one-reel [[silent film]] version of General [[Lew Wallace]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'' without first securing film rights.  Wallace's estate and his American publisher, [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] sued for [[copyright infringement]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing the [[precedent]] that all adaptations are subject to copyright.

== Options ==
When producers '''option''' a script, they are purchasing the right to buy certain rights to intellectual property.  A general option fee is 10% of the cost of the rights, should the producers manage to secure full financing for their project and have it "greenlit".    Because few projects actually manage to be greenlit, options allow producers to reduce their loss in the event that a project fails to come to fruition. Should the project be greenlit, an option provides a legally binding guarantee to purchase the film rights.

The contract for an option will specify the length of time it is valid for. If the producer is unable to have their project greenlit within the specified timeframe (e.g. two years), the option will expire. The rights holder can then put the previously optioned rights up for sale again. Or, the contract may allow the producer to renew the option for a certain price.

== Chain of title ==
As it is common for scripts to be stuck in [[development hell]], the options for a script may expire and be resold on multiple occasions. As well, producers who purchase an option and rework the script own the rights to their own derivative work- while the original rights holder owns the underlying rights.  This lineage is referred to as the [[chain of title]].  This lineage can become cloudy if the underlying rights are divided.  Producers may purchase the rights to a specific region (i.e. a country, the entire world, or the universe) and/or they may purchase ancillary rights such as merchandising rights.

In some cases, it may be uncertain as to the exact owners of a particular version of a script and to the exact set of rights.  It is important for an [[entertainment lawyer]] to determine how 'clean' a chain of title is.

{{refimprove|date=October 2006}}
The '''General People's Congress''' of [[Libya]] (''Mu'tammar al-sha'ab al 'âmm'') ({{lang-ar|مؤتمر الشعب العام الليبي}}) was the national legislature of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] governance structure. It consisted of 2,700 representatives of the [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]]. The GPC was the legislative forum that interacts with the [[General People's Committee]], whose members are secretaries of Libyan ministries. It notionally served as the intermediary between the masses and the leadership and was composed of the secretariats of some 600 local "basic popular congresses." 

The GPC secretariat and the cabinet secretaries were appointed by the GPC secretary general and confirmed by the annual GPC session. These cabinet secretaries were responsible for the routine operation of their ministries.

The [[People's Hall, Tripoli|People's Hall]], where the Congress met, was set on fire in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE71K0OP20110221 Reuters News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News; [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12520586 "Libya protests"]; 21 February 2011; accessed 02-23-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact''' ({{lang-de|Deutsch-polnischer Nichtangriffspakt}}; {{lang-pl|Polsko-niemiecki pakt o nieagresji}}) was an international [[treaty]] between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Second Polish Republic]], signed on January 26, 1934. Both countries pledged to resolve their problems by bilateral negotiations and to forgo armed conflict for a period of ten years. It effectively normalized relations between Poland and Germany, which were previously strained by border disputes arising from the territorial settlement in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Germany effectively recognized Poland's borders and moved to end an economically damaging [[customs war]] between the two countries that had taken place over the previous decade.  Before 1933 Poland had worried that some sort of alliance would take place between Germany and the Soviet Union, to the detriment of Poland. Therefore, Poland had a military alliance with France.  The Nazis and the Communists were bitter enemies of each other, so when Hitler came to power in 1933 the likelihood of hostile alliance seemed remote.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler’s Germany'' (1970) pp 57-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Piłsudski's reason==
One of the most noted of [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s foreign policies was his rumored proposal to France to declare war on Germany after [[Adolf Hitler]] had come to power, in January 1933. Some historians write that Piłsudski may have sounded out France regarding the possibility of joint military action against Germany, which had been openly rearming in violation of the [[Versailles Treaty]]. France's refusal might have been one of the reasons that Poland signed the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact.{{r|Torbus99_25|Quester2000_27|Urban97_539-40|Rothwell2001_92|EncBrit_Smogorzewski}}

However, the argument that the German-Polish non-aggression pact had been forced on Piłsudski by French refusal to wage a "[[preventive war]]" has been disputed by historians, who point out that there is no evidence in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal was ever advanced. They state that when in late October 1933, rumors of a Polish "preventive-war" proposal were reported in [[Paris]], their source was the Polish Embassy, which had informed French reporters that Poland had proposed a "preventive war" to [[France]] and [[Belgium]], but Poland and Germany had already been secretly negotiating their Pact. It has been argued that Piłsudski had had the Polish Embassy start rumors about a "preventive war" to pressure the Germans, who were demanding that Poland abrogate its 1921 [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|Franco-Polish alliance]]. The Pact would specifically exclude that alliance.&lt;ref name="Bel"&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Dariusz Baliszewski]], [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=70406 ''Ostatnia wojna marszałka''], Tygodnik "[[Wprost]]", Nr 1148 (28 November 2004), Polish, retrieved on 24 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that Piłsudski's reason for seeking the Pact with Germany was his concern over France's [[Maginot Line]]. Until 1929, French plans had called for a French offensive into the [[North German Plain]], in conjunction with offensives from Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]]. The construction of the Maginot Line, which began in 1929, indicated the French Army's preference for a strictly defensive stance, leaving, consequently, its eastern allies on their own. (That is exactly what happened in 1939 with the [[Phoney War]].) From Piłsudski's viewpoint, in light of France's military plans, a non-aggression pact with Germany would be the best choice for Poland.

Piłsudski used Hitler's rise to power and international isolation of Germany's new regime as an opportunity to reduce the risk that Poland would become the first victim of German aggression or of a [[Great Power]] deal (especially the [[Four Power Pact]]). Germany's new rulers seemed to depart from the traditionally [[Prussia]]n [[anti-Polish]] orientation. Piłsudski regarded the new chancellor as less dangerous than his immediate predecessors, such as [[Gustav Stresemann]], and he saw the [[Soviet Union]] as the greater threat and even opposed French and [[Czechoslovak]] efforts to include the Soviet Union in a common front against Germany.

The Poles insisted on stating that it did not nullify any previous international agreements, in particular the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]]. Nevertheless, by easing Poland's disputes with Germany bilaterally, the treaty weakened France's diplomatic position against Germany.

To allay any fears of a war against the Soviet Union, on May 5, 1934, Poland renewed the [[Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]], which had been first signed on July 25, 1932. It was extended until December 31, 1945, ignoring Hitler’s repeated suggestion to form a German-Polish alliance against the Soviets. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poland’s role in the Holocaust| url= https://www.theperspective.com/subjective-timeline/politics/polands-role-holocaust/|publisher= The Perspective |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland was able to maintain friendly relations with Germany for the next five years but also with France and Britain. However, it may have also led to foreign policy inattentiveness regarding the activities of the crumbling [[League of Nations]] and ignoring the collective security schemes proposed by French and Czechoslovakia in the early 1930s.

The Pact, soon followed by a trade agreement with Germany, is said to have granted Germany a settled eastern border and allowed Hitler time for rearmament. Five years later, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland.{{r|Kershaw2000_220|Davidson04_25}} Piłsudski distrusted German intentions on the whole but perceived Hitler's origins as an Austrian rather than a Prussian as a mitigating factor and stated that Hitler should stay in power as long as possible.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nOALhEZkYDkC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=pilsudski+pact+rearmament&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bQ-2N6F4eD&amp;sig=wmpce0ZjtuZRnt6Dk4y8FhUgCDc A Low Dishonest Decade]. Paul N. Hehn, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pact has been seen as an instance of political weakness brought on by Piłsudski's illness, and it was likened to the interwar lack of leadership displayed by [[Neville Chamberlain]] and [[Paul von Hindenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Owen]],
[http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/96/5/325 "Diseased, demented, depressed: serious illness in Heads of State"], [[QJM: An International Journal of Medicine]] 96 (2003), 325-336.&lt;/ref&gt;

German policy changed drastically in late 1938, after the annexation of [[Sudetenland]] sealed the fate of Czechoslovakia, and Poland became Hitler's next target. In October 1938, German Foreign Minister [[Joachim Ribbentrop]] presented Poland with the proposition of renewing the Pact in exchange for allowing the [[Free City of Danzig]] to be annexed by Germany and the construction of an extraterritorial motorway and railway through the [[Polish Corridor]], with Germany accepting Poland's postwar borders.{{r|Wegener_Jul40}} Poland refused. As a consequence, Hitler rescinded the Pact unilaterally on April 28, 1939,{{r|Brown2004_173}} during an address before the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], as Germany renewed its territorial claims in Poland. After another few months of rising tension, and following the execution of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between Germany and the [[Soviet Union]], which contained a secret protocol by which Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland between them, [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Germany invaded Poland]] on September 1, 1939, initiating [[World War II]].

'''Herbert Hovenkamp''' (born 1948&lt;ref&gt;http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n84166675/&lt;/ref&gt;) is the James G. Dinan University Professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] and the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. Prior to that he held the Ben and Dorothy Willie Chair at the [[University of Iowa College of Law]]. Hovenkamp is a recognized expert and prolific author in the area of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]. He received a BA from [[Calvin College]] and earned an MA, PhD, and Doctor of Jurisprudence from [[The University of Texas at Austin]]. Hovenkamp was previously Professor of Law at the [[University of California]] [[Hastings College of Law]].  Professor Hovenkamp is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

== Antitrust Scholarship ==
Professor Hovenkamp is generally regarded as "the most influential antitrust scholar of our generation"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/antitrust/pdfs/antitrust_enterprise.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''New York Times'' reported that many consider him "the dean of American antitrust law."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/10/business/att-and-t-mobile-merger-is-a-textbook-case.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hovenkamp%20dean&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the sole surviving author of ''Antitrust Law'', the most cited legal reference on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinestore.cch.com/productdetail.asp?productid=3656&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of the last ten antitrust cases heard by the United States Supreme Court, either the petitioner or the solicitor general pointed to Hovenkamp as supporting the position the justices were being urged to take.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news-releases.uiowa.edu/2009/april/042309hovenkamp.html&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Hovenkamp’s writings have been cited in 36 Supreme Court decisions and more than 1300 decisions in the lower courts.

Thomas Hungar, deputy solicitor general of the United States from 2003 to 2008, has called Hovenkamp one of the prime shapers of antitrust legal interpretation by U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news-releases.uiowa.edu/2009/april/042309hovenkamp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Professor Hovenkamp received the John Sherman Award from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.  The award is presented approximately once every three years to "a person or persons for their outstanding achievement in antitrust law, contributing to the protection of American consumers and to the preservation of economic liberty."

'''Human rights literature''' is a literary [[genre]] that deals with [[human rights]] issues, and thus - directly or indirectly - promotes values of [[human rights]]. The goal of human rights literature is to combine the literary driving force with the motivation for action, which is a fundamental and integral element of the struggle for protection of human rights. This literary genre is based on the concept of "Engaged Literature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/343936/litterature-engagee |title=Littérature engagée &amp;#124; French literature &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was articulated by the French writer and philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Human rights literature is committed to society and believes that each one of us has moral duty and power to make a social change. It is based on the belief of the enormous power of literature to make a change, and in the responsibility of the author toward readers both on the social aspect and the artistic one.

==Background==
The concept of human rights literature was first articulated in the foreword to ''Freedom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin Greenland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/10/freedom-amnesty-international-short-stories |title=Freedom: Short Stories &amp;#124; Book review &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an anthology of short stories by renowned authors from around the world published in Britain in 2010 by Mainstream Publishing in cooperation with the human rights organization [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIUK : Book search and order online : Freedom|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/books_details.asp?BookID=103 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613222342/https://www.amnesty.org.uk/books_details.asp?BookID=103 |archivedate=June 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were written in the spirit of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

The foreword - "The Tremendous Power of Literature", by Vered Cohen Barzilay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://novelrights.com/2011/07/13/the-tremendous-power-of-literatureforeword-from-freedom/ |title=The Tremendous Power of Literature/Foreword from "Freedom" |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the relationship between the Italian novella  "Prima di Lasciarsi" by [[Gabriella Ambrosio]] (English: "[[Before We Say Goodbye]]") and human rights.

The foreword along with the book was translated into various languages and published around the world in many countries including UK, US, Canada, Poland, Spain, Latin America, and Italy. At the 2010 Edinburgh Book festival the preliminary concept was first introduced in public discussion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/212-before_we_say_goodbye |title=Before We Say Goodbye - Edinburgh Festival guide &amp;#124; Fest |publisher=Festmag.co.uk |date=2010-08-12 |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228111532/https://www.festmag.co.uk/archive/2010/212-before_we_say_goodbye |archivedate=2014-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2012 it was formally introduced by Cohen-Barzilay at [[Oxford University]], UK, at a panel discussion held under the title "The Power of Literature and Human Rights" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talks.ox.ac.uk/talk/index/8103 |title=Oxford Talks : The Power of Literature and Human Rights |publisher=Talks.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early 2013 at the Literary Festival at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/events/2013/literature.aspx |title=The Power of Literature and Human Rights - 2013 - Events - Centre for the Study of Human Rights - Home |publisher=.lse.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Cohen-Barzilay founded Novel Rights e-publishing, an e- publishing house specializing in creating and promoting Human Rights Literature.

==Engaged literature and the connection to human rights literature==
"Human rights literature" is based on the idea of "engaged literature" that was first formulated by the French writer and [[philosopher]] [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his book ''What is literature?''.  Sartre argued that intellectuals and the ordinary citizens must take a stand, especially in regard to major political conflicts. Sartre hoped that literature would serve as a means to enable oppressed minority groups gain recognition and that members of the elites would be moved to action as a result of the influence of literature. He argued that should a novel end with a call for action, it has to consciously address groups that have the power to act.

Sartre offers a double function for literature, acting  as both a mirror for the oppressor and as also as a source of inspiration and guidance for the oppressed, though he does not explicitly explain what the action to be taken is or how to take it within the framework of committed literature. Various actions should be chosen according to their contribution to the realization of a socialist democracy, but the author must not decide according to dogma, in the manner of a conscientious objector.

As a moral concept, human rights literature deals directly or indirectly with human rights and leads its readers to understand and act to protect human rights. The literary products are accompanied by general information concerning human rights and organizations, as well as suggestions for direct action that go hand in hand with subjects that arise from the literature.

==The power of literature vs. the power of art==
Sartre argued that "the reader of the novel submits to the book before him, abandoning his worldly existence to assume a vicarious one while he reads. He lives the problem which he himself helps to create, placing himself in the most sympathetic position white relation to what the writer wishes to say". [[Marina Nemat]], author of "Prisoner of Teheran"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinanemat.com/books.html |title=Marina Nemat |publisher=www.marinanemat.com |date=2007-12-15 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the winner of the first European Parliament 'Human Dignity' award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/88795/toronto-author-marina-nemat-awarded-first-human-dignity-prize-by-european-parliament-presentation-in-milan-italy-on-december-15-2007 |title=SLOPEN LITERARY AGENCY &amp;#124; Toronto author Marina Nemat awarded first "Human Dignity" prize by European Parliament; presentation in Milan, Italy, on December 15, 2007 |publisher=Newswire.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains: "Literature allows the victim to become a survivor and stand up to the past to ensure a better future. It is literature that carries the human experience, reaches our hearts, and makes us feel the pain of those who have been treated unjustly. Without literature and narrative, we would lose our identity as human beings and will dissolve in the darkness of time and our repeated mistakes that lead us from one preventable devastation to the next".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/2012/09/06/marina-nemat-authors-note-leila/ |title=Marina Nemat, Author’s Note /"Leila" |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, human rights literature emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately isolated from the world and geopolitical events, and regional or global social crises. Human rights literature does not believe in writing for purely artistic aesthetic purposes. It calls on writers to exercise their moral-social duty wherein the power of the literary creation on the public is enormous and rarely come to fruition. According to the American philosopher professor [[Martha Nussbaum]] in her book: [[Poetic justice|"Poetic Justice"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Justice-Literary-Imagination-Public/dp/0807041092 |title=Poetic Justice: The Literary Imagination and Public Life: Martha C. Nussbaum: 9780807041093: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that social sympathy is a necessary condition for equitable treatment in courts of law. Judges, Nussbaum has observed, are short of imaginative data about the persons they must judge, and novels are one place they can look for guidance. The author [[Richard Rorty]] wrote in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/3RORTY.pdf |format=PDF |title=Human Rights, Rationality and Sentimentality |publisher=Nyu.edu |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty wrote about the "human rights culture" a term he declair to borrow from the Argentinian jurist and philosopher Eduardo Rabossi. In an article called "Human Rights Naturalized", Rabossi argues that philosophers should think of this culture as a new, welcome fact of the post-Holocaust world, They should stop trying to get behind or beneath this fact.

In her essay "The Tremendous Power of Literature" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/acmart/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307588838&amp;view=toc |title=Random House Academic |publisher=Randomhouse.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vered Cohen Barzilay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=Novel Rights |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes:  "Literature can be as powerful as life itself. It can be like our [[prophecy]]. It can inspire us to change our world and give us the comfort, hope, passion and strength that we need in order to fight to create a better future for us, as well as all humanity. We just need to keep on reading and to allow the tremendous power of literature to enter our hearts and lead us to our own path." Indeed, Human Rights Literature does not impose on the authors actual call for action, rather, the writer’s task ends as soon as he completes the writing process. Only the readers’ response can answer whether the creation inspires social change or motivates for action.

Human rights literature provides the readers with an opportunity for a direct action, however it is not a compulsory requirement. In fact, the commitment is an unwritten accord between the readers and the literary creation developed through the reading process, which holds simultaneously the freedom to refrain from action.

==Criticism and response==
Critics of engaged literature argue that such literature is propaganda and that it is created and used  for political purposes. But if the literature becomes propaganda the reader would see through that, and the magic, the intimate process of communion between the reader and the author’s inner voice will not unfold.

It is argued that for the purpose of reaching the masses such literature will be reduced to the lowest common denominator while compromising quality standards to a limited criteria of stimulation for action. Sartre stresses that both writers and social leaders must constantly aim for developing and improving their readers’ intellectual level,  offering readers something beyond the familiar and providing an opportunity to expand horizons.

Another criticism of engaged literature suggests irrelevance of the commitment for action during times of large-scale events or conflicts once these circumstances change, and while a great novel is eternal and can exist in timeless literary space. Sartre argued that those who attack engaged literature are manifesting again the old desire to retreat into a private shell and ignore events which may someday reach their lives. Authors, he claimed, are trying in vain to isolate themselves from reality, and during a demanding writing process they are cut off from social problems, and thus, create literature for sheer escapism. All novels, whatever else they may do, inevitably instruct us on life. Engaged novel tells us that we may or may not, relate this knowledge to whatever sphere of reality we choose, whenever and however we wish. We cannot meet reality in our own terms. The novel, which has always presented the reader with knowledge of real life, is changing the form of its presentation in order to accord with a more accurate conception of the relation between the individual and reality.

As [[Gabriella Ambrosio]], author of ''[[Before We Say Goodbye]]'', writes in the foreword of her short story "Sticko": "At times, writers are afraid to know what is inevitable: that “pure” art does not exist. None of us is pure or innocent: any word carrying imaginative power produces culture, and culture produces behaviour." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novelrights.com/sources/ |title=Inspiration Sources &amp;#124; Novel Rights &amp;#124; Human Rights Literature ePublishing |publisher=Novel Rights |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dilemma which was raised by intellectuals and in literary circles is the issue of the author’s competence to the task if indeed a novel is an adequate tool for generating social action. Can authors understand the substantive social issues? Or handle the risk and complexity as not to support a false cause? Or be discussed only by experts? What has been suggested was that the engaged novel requires greater talent and wider knowledge by novelists than has been necessary before, and in fact create a new generation of engaged authors.

As for irrelevance of human rights issues outside a specific context in time, the answer is embodied in the relevance and validity of human rights’ values which were articulated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. These principles transcend the era in which they were articulated and bring a set of burning social issues to the surface.
An example of a novel set in a temporal and geographical context which transcended these limits is [[Harper Lee]]’s ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''. While the book’s focus on racism in the United States covered events in the author’s environment at a specific time, it highlighted the larger issue of racism and discrimination in a universal manner, transcending the local context of the story. With its social commitment for change, the book had an enormous impact, not only on local issue of racism, but rather as an influencing generations of readers around the world.

==Literature and the human rights movement==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2018}}Unlike the abstract commitment to social action of Sartre’s engaged literature, human rights literature places human rights at the core of its moral and social duty.  It emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately cut off from the world, geopolitical changes or social crises. Human rights literature does not believe writing is solely an artistic aesthetic exercise, and calls on writers to realize the social commitment under the power of their literary creation that it effects on the public is enormous and does not come to fruition often. And thus, human rights literature manifests that unique and close links exist between literature and human rights campaigns.

Lynn Hunt identified these links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2002/april17/hunt-417.html |title=Empathy with literary characters helped spur concept of human rights, scholar says: 04/02 |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=2002-04-17 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Inventing Human Rights: A History'', she examines the emergence of the prose narrative in the 18th century and the role it played in the conception of the human rights idea. Hunt demonstrates how ideas of human relationships portrayed in novels and art generated a powerful fictional empathy which helped spreading this new idea.  ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by [[Nelle Harper Lee]] is one example of a novel that had major contribution and impact on American public opinion on the issue of race and rights. Another example is [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]’s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was the best-selling novel of the 19th century. The book had a deep impact on public opinion in the US on the issue of slavery and is seen as one of the triggers to the Abolitionist movement in the 1850s.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}
Many other books and novels had great impact on human rights issues and struggles,{{According to whom|date=January 2018}} for example: [[Toni Morrison]]’s ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', [[Giannina Braschi]]’s ''[[United States of Banana]]'', [[Franz Kafka]]’s ''[[The Trial]]'' and ''Night'' by [[Elie Wiesel]].

==Freedom of expression and persecution of authors==
While the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and subsequent international covenants defined Freedom of Thought and Expression as fundamental human rights, constant and frequent attacks on these freedoms takes place under dictatorships and repressive regimes in attempt to silence any protest or dissent. Censorship is exercised on each and every publication while are often writers and journalists are persecuted, imprisoned and executed. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] is a Chinese literary critic, writer, professor, and human rights activist. He published a manifesto calling for freedom of expression and free elections, and in 2009 was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "inciting subversion of state power”. Like Xiaobo, many authors suffer persecution as authorities recognize their unique power and ability to impact on the masses. [[Salman Rushdie]], an awarded British-Muslim novelist and essayist of Indian origin became a target following the publication his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988). The book was the center of a major controversy in the Islamic world because of what was perceived as an irreverent depiction of [[Muhammad]].  Death threats were made against him, including a [[fatwā]] issued by [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], the Supreme Leader of Iran, on 14 February 1989 and a bounty was offered for Rushdie's death. Rushdi was forced to hide and live under police protection for many years.  Years later Rushdi became the president of [[PEN International]], the worldwide association of writers who fights for freedom of expression, and acts as a powerful voice on behalf of writers harassed, imprisoned and sometimes killed for their views.

Rogers College of Law''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.arizona.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; at the '''University of Arizona''' has created an academic center for the study of American Indian and indigenous peoples law, policy, and human rights. The '''Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program''' furthers the research, training, and advocacy of Indian law and [[international law]] of [[indigenous peoples]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.arizona.edu/indigenous-peoples-law-policy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002020918/http://www.law.arizona.edu/depts/iplp/index.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Courses and clinical opportunities are offered in areas of law and policy concerning indigenous peoples in the United States and around the world. What makes the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program at the University of Arizona Law (Arizona Law) unique is our approach to legal education in the field of federal Indian law, tribal law and policy, and indigenous peoples human rights. Students are trained in the classroom and in real-world settings by faculty who are leaders both in their academic fields and as practitioners in tribal, national, and international forums. Through clinical studies and direct advocacy under the supervision of the world's most distinguished scholars in the field, students and practitioners provide legal and other forms of assistance to local and international indigenous communities.  

The IPLP Program has been involved in numerous indigenous legal issues around the world. Students and professors in the IPLP Program have assisted Central American Maya villages that have filed lawsuits in the Belize Supreme Court alleging that both the attorney general of Belize and the minister of Natural Resources and Environment had violated their property rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://uanews.org/node/16401 and https://law.arizona.edu/maya-communities-southern-belize &lt;/ref&gt;  

Faculty and students of the IPLP Program have worked in coordination with other groups representing [[Carrie Dann]] and recently deceased [[Mary Dann]], who have struggled against the federal government for decades over [[Western Shoshone]] territory, in precedent-setting proceedings before the Organization of American States' [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and the United Nations [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]]. It culminated with the Inter-American Commission issuing a report in which it condemned the United States for violating the Dann sisters' human rights. &lt;ref&gt;https://law.arizona.edu/western-shoshone&lt;/ref&gt;  

In addition, IPLP Program personnel and affiliates have worked with the people of [[Awas Tingni]], a Mayangna (Sumo) indigenous community located on the Atlantic Coast in Nicaragua, for many years with the landmark case decided by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], Mayagna (Sumo) Community of Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua. After a lengthy legal battle, the community successfully gained legal recognition of its customary land tenure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.arizona.edu/awas-tingni |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://law.arizona.edu/awas-tingni |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5291">'''Inheritance law''' regulates the financial consequences that arise as a result of the death of individuals, as well as the subsequent transfer of their assets. The governing legislation in Bulgaria regulating the legal aspects of the subject is the Bulgarian Inheritance Act ({{lang-bg|Закон за наследството}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lex.bg/bg/laws/ldoc/2121542657 Закон за наследството] (Bulgarian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of law== 
The main legal source is the Inheritance Act (BG "Закон за наследството", entered into force on the 30th of April 1949). The Act stipulates that inheritance can be inherited either by means of:
*Statutory provisions
or:
*A will which contains the testator's expressed will.

==Statutory succession (Chapter 2 of the Bulgarian Inheritance Act)==
The right of inheritance is usually governed by statutory provisions which set out the order of succession by the respective successors. The Bulgarian Inheritance Act provides for four levels of successors in order of succession rights whereby those in the preceding level exclude those in the successive ones. The inheritance shall be received by the following natural persons according to the following order:
*Level I: descendants of the deceased;
*Level II: the parents of the deceased 
*Level III: 
#grandparents of the deceased and their descendants;
#siblings of the deceased and their descendants;
*Level IV Collateral heirs from the third to the sixth level of inheritance.
In addition, the spouse of the deceased inherits together with the heirs of the first to the third level and replaces the heirs in the fourth level. It shall be noted that legal entities do not have capacity to receive inheritance. 

==Testament==
Article 13 of the Bulgarian Inheritance Act provides that each person, having reached the age of 18, may dispose of his property upon his death through a Will, provided that he has capacity to act independently and reasonably. The testator may dispose of all of his assets or only parts of it through a Will. The testator may dispose of all of his assets provided that he does not infringe the legally compulsory portion of the inheritance.
The Bulgarian Inheritance Act provides for two types of testament:

#The notarial testament (Art. 24(2)) which is to be drafted by the notary in the presence of two witnesses.
#The handwritten will (Art. 25) must be personally handwritten by the testator. At the request of the testator, the handwritten will could be kept by a notary or by a third party for safekeeping purposes. This will must be signed by the testator.
The repeal of a testamentary disposition is possible in the cases provided in Article 38 of the Bulgarian Inheritance Act: by drawing a new will or a notarial document expressing the testator’s explicit wish to withdraw the last will.
According to Article 42 may be void in the following cases:

*When the testamentary disposition has been made in favour of a person who does not have testamentary capacity;
*When testamentary disposition has been made by mistake, under coercion or fraud;
*If the motive for the disposition itself is contrary to the law, public order or moral

==Compulsory portion==
If the deceased has left descendants, parents or a spouse, he shall not deprive them from their compulsory portion either through his testamentary disposition or a gift. The testator shall only dispose of the rest of his assets.

==Acceptance and waiver of inheritances==
The heir is vested with inheritance by means of the testator’s wishes. The acceptance of the inheritance is not limited in time. However, it should be noted that once the heir has accepted the inheritance, he may no longer withdraw his acceptance. The inheritance may be accepted by two affirmative legal acts:

* explicitly - by a written declaration to the district court in the place of accrual of the inheritance, which is to be registered in a designated book (Article 49(1));
* implicitly - by an act of heirs which unambiguously indicates his intention to accept the inheritance or when if he hides the property  (Art. 49(2)).

The waiver of the succession is carried out by a written declaration to the district court. The declaration is registered in a designated book. The law provides for nullity of the waiver if it is limited, made only for a part of the inheritance or under certain conditions. In case the heir has renounced his share of the inheritance or has otherwise lost his inheritance rights, the shares of the other heirs increase accordingly. 

Inheritance in Bulgaria is subject to inheritance tax.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10750">'''Insurability''' can mean either whether a particular type of loss (risk) can be insured in theory,&lt;ref&gt;Wiening EA. (2002). ''Foundations of Risk Management and Insurance'', 6.3. 1st edition. AICPCU.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether a particular client is insurable for by a particular company because of particular circumstance and the quality assigned by an [[Insurance company|insurance provider]] pertaining to the [[risk]] that a given client would have.&lt;ref name=Free&gt;See [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/insurability The Free Dictionary definition of Insurability]. Accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual with very low insurability may be said to be '''uninsurable''', and an insurance company will refuse to issue a policy to such an applicant.&lt;ref name=Free /&gt; For example, an individual with a [[terminal illness]] and a [[life expectancy]] of 6 months would be uninsurable for [[term life insurance]]. This is because the probability is so high for the individual to die within the term of the insurance, that he/she would present much too high a liability for the insurance company. A similar, and stereotypical, example would be [[earthquake insurance]] in [[California]].

Insurability is sometimes an issue in [[case law]] of [[torts]] and [[contracts]].  It also comes up in issues involving [[tontine]]s and other [[insurance fraud]] schemes.  In [[real property law]] and [[real estate]], insurability of [[title]] means the [[realty]] is [[marketable]].

== Characteristics of insurable risks ==

Risk which can be insured by private companies typically share seven common characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;This discussion is adapted from Mehr and Camack “Principles of Insurance”, 6th edition, 1976, pp 34 – 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Large number of similar exposure units'''.  Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the [[law of large numbers]] in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include [[Lloyd's of London]], which is famous for insuring the life or health of actors, actresses and sports figures. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different rates.
#'''Definite Loss'''. The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.
#'''Accidental Loss'''.  The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance.  The loss should be ‘pure,’ in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost.  Events that contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks, are generally not considered insurable.
#'''Large Loss'''.  The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured.  Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims.  For small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses.  There is little point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.
#'''Affordable Premium'''.  If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, it is not likely that anyone will buy insurance, even if on offer.  Further, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer.  If there is no such chance of loss, the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance.  (See the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] [[List of FASB Pronouncements|standard number 113]])
#'''Calculable Loss'''. There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.
#'''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses'''.  Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-[[catastrophe modeling|catastrophic]], meaning that the one losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, on the order of 5 [[Percentage|percent]]. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the U.S., [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. An instance where the question whether insurability exists is contested is the case of [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society, edited by David H. Guston, Sage Publications, 2010; see Articles on Insurance and Reinsurance.&lt;/ref&gt; In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer’s capital constraint.  Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.

{{Main|Insurable interest}}

Insurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured.&lt;ref name=Interest&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Insurable+interest The Free Dictionary definition of Insurable interest], citing cases at 1 Burr. 489.

Accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also mean the interest of a [[beneficiary]] of a [[life insurance]] policy to prove need for the proceeds, called the "insurable interest doctrine".&lt;ref name=QandA /&gt;  Specifically, insurable interest is:
{{quote|An interest based upon a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage through the continued life, health and bodily safety of another person, and, consequently, loss by reason of their death or disability; or A substantial interest engendered by love and affection if closely related by blood or by law.|Society of Actuaries&lt;ref name=SOA&gt;Kevin Oldani, ''You Bet Your Life: Insurable Interest in Life Insurance'', found at [http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/094bk_rev-annual06.pdf Society of Actuaries website], citing [[Life Assurance Act]] (England 1774).  Accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, husbands/wives have an insurable interest in their spouse, and children have an insurable interest in their parents (and vice versa). Close relatives are assumed to have an insurable interest in the lives of those relatives, but more distant relatives, such as cousins and in-laws cannot buy insurance of the lives of others related by these connections.&lt;ref name="FreeAdvice"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Insurable Interest in a Life Insurance Policy | work = Life Insurance Law | publisher = Free Advice  | date = 1995–2009
| url = http://law.freeadvice.com/insurance_law/life_insurance_law/insurable-interest-life-insurance.htm  | accessdate = 2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person is presumed to have an insurable interest in his or her own life,&lt;ref&gt;''Griffiths v. Fleming'' [[legal citation|[1909] 1 KB 805]]; ''M'Farlane v. Royal London Friendly Society'' [[legal citation|(1886) 2 TLR 755]]&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to be alive and in good health rather than being sick, injured or dead. If a person obtains an insurance policy on their own life, it is presumed that the person would only name a beneficiary who wants the insured to be alive and healthy.&lt;ref name="FreeAdvice" /&gt;

A person is considered to have an unlimited interest in the life of their spouse, which the law considers broadly equivalent to having an insurable interest in their own life. Even if not financially dependent on the other, it is legitimate to insure against the death of a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;''Griffiths v. Fleming'' [[legal citation|[1909] 1 KB 805]]; [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]], section 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many insurers will accept policies of [[cohabitation|cohabiting]] couples, they could potentially be invalidated. In recent years, there have been moves to pass clear statutory provisions in this regard, which have not yet borne fruit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishexecutive.gov.uk/library2/doc11/rfl-12.asp ''Report on Family Law''; Cohabitation, s. XVI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222022/http://www.scottishexecutive.gov.uk/library2/doc11/rfl-12.asp |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[Scottish Law Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar treatment was recently extended to [[civil partnership|civil partners]] under section 253 of the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]] and in the law of some [[United States|states]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Insurable interest is no longer strictly an element of life insurance contracts under modern law, for example with [[viatication]] agreements and [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] [[donation]]s.&lt;ref name=SOA /&gt;  Often there is no requirement today that the beneficiary have a proven insurable interest in the life of the insured when the insured has purchased the insurance.&lt;ref name="FreeAdvice" /&gt;

{{see also|Impossibility defense}}

'''Legal impossibility''' is a traditional [[common law]] [[defense (legal)|defense]] to a charge of an attempted [[crime]]. Legal impossibility arises when the act, if completed, would not be a crime.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|707}} A person believes she is committing a [[crime]], but the act is, in fact, lawful. For example, a person may believe she is receiving stolen goods, but the goods are in fact not stolen.

A different form of legal impossibility (Known as "hybrid legal impossibility") comes into play when an actor's goal is illegal, but commission of the crime is impossible due to a factual mistake regarding the legal status of one of the attendant circumstances of one of the elements of the crime. For example, a man attempting to bribe someone whom he mistakenly believes is a juror is not liable for attempted bribery of a juror.  On the other hand, some jurisdictions may find the actor guilty of attempt.  For example, under the Model Penal Code, the defendant can be guilty of the attempted crime if the facts being the way she thought they were would indeed make it a crime; however, she would not be guilty of the completed crime, because the crime was never completed.

After killing a trainer in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]], she was hanged in nearby [[Erwin, Tennessee]], in 1916. Her death is sometimes interpreted as a [[cautionary tale]] of circus [[Cruelty to animals|animal abuse]] during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krajicek |first=David J. |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/fed-circus-elephant-lynched-murder-1916-article-1.2149605 |title='Fed up' circus elephant lynched for 'murder' in 1916 |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2015-03-14 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Red Eldridge==
On September 11, 1916, a homeless man named Red Eldridge, who landed a job as a transient hotel clerk,&lt;ref name=BlueRidgeCountry /&gt; was hired as an assistant elephant trainer by the ''Sparks World Famous Shows'' circus. He was killed by Mary in [[Sullivan County, Tennessee]], on the evening of September 12. Eldridge led the elephant parade, although he was not qualified, riding on the top of Mary's back; Mary was the star of the show, walking at the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodge|first1=Randy|last2=Price|first2=Charles Edwin|title=The Day they Hung the Elephant|date=1992|publisher=Overmountain Press|location=Johnson City, Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several accounts of his death. One, recounted by W.H. Coleman, who claimed to be a witness, is that he prodded her behind the ear with a hook after she reached down to nibble on a [[watermelon]] rind. She went into a rage, snatched Eldridge with her trunk, threw him against a drink stand and stepped on his head, crushing it.&lt;ref name="BlueRidgeCountry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blueridgecountry.com/articles/mary-the-elephant|title=The Day They Hanged Mary The Elephant in Tennessee - BlueRidgeCountry.com|work=BlueRidgeCountry.com|author=Joan V. Schroeder|date=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary newspaper account, from the ''Johnson City Staff'', said that Mary "collided its trunk vice-like about [Eldridge's] body, lifted him 10 feet in the air, then dashed him with fury to the ground... and with the full force of her beastly fury is said to have sunk [sic] her giant tusks entirely through his body. The animal then trampled the dying form of Eldridge as if seeking a murderous triumph, then with a sudden... swing of her massive foot hurled his body into the crowd."&lt;ref name=BlueRidgeCountry /&gt;

==Execution==
The details of the aftermath are confused in a maze of sensationalist newspaper stories and [[folklore]]. Most accounts indicate that she calmed down afterward and did not charge the onlookers, who began chanting "Kill the elephant! Let's kill it." Within minutes, local [[blacksmith]] Hench Cox tried to kill Mary, firing five rounds with little effect.&lt;ref name=BlueRidgeCountry /&gt; Meanwhile, the leaders of several nearby towns threatened not to allow the circus to visit if Mary was included.
The circus owner, Charlie Sparks, reluctantly decided that the only way to quickly resolve the potentially ruinous situation was to kill the wounded elephant in public. On the following day, a foggy and rainy September 13, 1916, Mary was transported by rail to [[Unicoi County, Tennessee]], where a crowd of over 2,500 people (including most of the town's children) assembled in the [[Clinchfield Railroad]] yard.

The elephant was hanged by the neck from a railcar-mounted industrial [[derrick]] between four o'clock and five o'clock that afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brummette|first1=John|title=Trains, Chains, Blame, and Elephant Appeal: A Case Study of the Public Relations Significance of Mary the Elephant|journal=Public Relations Review 38|date=2012|pages=341–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt resulted in a snapped chain, causing Mary to fall and break her hip as dozens of children fled in terror. The severely wounded elephant died during a second attempt and was buried beside the tracks. A veterinarian examined Mary after the hanging and determined that she had a severely infected tooth in the precise spot where Red Eldridge had prodded her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snapjudgment.org/big-mary|title=Big Mary|publisher=SnapJudgement|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of a widely distributed (and heavily retouched) photo of her death was disputed years later by ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=BlueRidgeCountry /&gt;{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The '''National Central Library of Florence''' ({{lang-it|Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze}}, '''BNCF''') is a [[Public library|public]] [[national library]] in [[Florence]], the largest in Italy and one of the most important in [[Europe]], one of the two central libraries of [[Italy]], along with the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Roma|Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale]] of Rome.

==History==
The library was founded in 1714 when scholar [[Antonio Magliabechi]] bequeathed his entire collection of books, encompassing approximately 30,000 volumes, to the city of Florence. By 1743, it was required that a copy of every work published in [[Tuscany]] be submitted to the library. Originally known as the Magliabechiana, the library was opened to the public in 1747. Its holdings were combined with those of the {{illm|Biblioteca Palatina Lorenese|it}} in 1861, and by 1885, the library had been renamed as the National Central Library of Florence, or the BNCF. Since 1870, the library has collected copies of all Italian publications.

Since 1935, the collections have been housed in a building designed by [[Cesare Bazzani]] and V. Mazzei, located along the [[Arno River]] in the quarter of [[Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. Before this, they were found in various rooms belonging to the [[Uffizi Gallery]].

The National Library System (SBN), located in the BNCF, is responsible for the automation of library services and the indexing of national holdings.

Unfortunately, a major [[The Flood of the River Arno in Florence, Italy|flood of the Arno River]] in 1966 damaged nearly one-third of the library's holdings, most notably its periodicals and Palatine and Magliabechi collections. The Restoration Center was subsequently established and may be credited with saving many of these priceless artifacts. However, much work remains to be done and some items are forever lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the National Library of Italy-Florence | url=http://libraries.theeuropeanlibrary.org/ItalyFlorence/Library/history_en.xml | accessdate = 2007-04-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211214314/http://libraries.theeuropeanlibrary.org/ItalyFlorence/Library/history_en.xml |archivedate = 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesaurus==

The library curates the [[BNCF Thesaurus]] ({{Lang|it|Nuovo soggettario}}), a "subject indexing tool for various types of resources".&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thesaurus BNCF - the Datahub|url=https://datahub.io/dataset/thesaurus-bncf|publisher=[[DataHub]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3428">'''Parliamentary counsel''' are [[lawyer]]s who prepare legislation that it is proposed to pass into law.  The terms '''Parliamentary drafter''', '''Parliamentary draftsman''', '''legislative drafting officer''' and '''legislative counsel''' are also widely used.  These terms are used in relation to the [[United Kingdom]] [[parliament]] in Westminster, and other parliaments and assemblies based on the [[Westminster system]].  The official title, and organisation, of the parliamentary counsel varies between legislatures.  For example, those who draft government legislation for the UK parliament form the [[Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (United Kingdom)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] (established in 1869 under the title of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel) while the [[Parliamentary Counsel Office (Scottish Government)|Scottish Government's Parliamentary Counsel Office]] drafts legislation for the [[Scottish Parliament]], the (Northern Irish) Office of the Legislative Counsel drafts legislation for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the (Welsh) [[Office_for_the_Welsh_Legislative_Counsel|Office of the Legislative Counsel]] performs the same role in relation to the [[National Assembly for Wales]].  In the [[Republic of Ireland]], there is an [[Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to Government]].  In Australia, each state, territory and the federal government has an Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  

The job of a parliamentary drafter is to draft the detailed form of proposed [[law]]s, in a way that will accurately reflect the intentions of the politicians who are promulgating them, without leaving loopholes or producing perverse results.&lt;ref&gt;McCluskie QC, John Cameron, "Who Wrote This Bill? The Life and Work of Scottish Parliamentary Counsel", Scottish Parliamentary Review, Vol. I, No. 2 (Jan, 2014) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an almost impossible task, and the pursuit of exact and watertight legislation has often resulted in obscure and convoluted language.  Such language has been criticised both by government bodies such as the committee under Sir [[David Renton]] that reported in 1975 (and recommended drafting which was more based on principles than specific details to address every possible situation).  

In parliamentary discussion, the drafter is rarely if ever referred to by name, but only as an office.  However, the post has been held by a number of distinguished [[lawyer]]s, for example [[Bernard O'Dowd]] in Australia, [[John Ferguson McLennan]] specialising in [[Scots law|Scottish law]] (which though enacted entirely in the UK parliament from 1707 until 1999, is distinct from [[English law]]), and [[William Philip Schreiner]] in [[South Africa]].

'''Pre-packaged insolvency''' (a "pre-pack") is a kind of [[bankruptcy]] procedure, where a restructure plan is agreed in advance of a company declaring its insolvency. In the [[United States]] pre-packs are often used in a [[Chapter 11]] filing. In the [[United Kingdom]], pre-packs have become popular since the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], which has made [[Administration (law)|administration]] the dominant insolvency procedure. Such arrangements are also available in [[Canada]] under the [[Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act]].

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|UK insolvency law}}
The term "pre-pack sale" has been defined by the Association of Business Recovery Professionals as, "an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company’s business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an administrator, and the administrator effects the sale immediately on, or shortly after, his appointment".&lt;ref name="r3.org.uk"&gt;http://www.r3.org.uk/media/documents/technical_library/SIPS/SIP%2016%20E&amp;W.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between a pre-pack sale and a normal sale is that in a normal sale the administrator markets the business and negotiates the terms of the sale after his appointment.

The reasons an administrator sells on a [[pre-pack]] basis, rather than after post-appointment marketing, vary from case to case, but they often involve the following considerations. A pre-pack sale avoids the costs of trading (which means creditors receive more back), and indeed, the company and the administrator may not have the funds to trade. It also avoids the administrator taking on the risks associated with trading. The value of the business may deteriorate during administration trading.

There may be other factors to prevent trading, such as regulatory problems.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html for consideration of these issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have held that an administrator can sell the company's assets immediately upon his appointment, without court approval or the approval of the creditors,&lt;ref&gt;Re T&amp;D Industries Plc [2000] 1 WLR 646; Re Transbus International Limited [2004] 1 WLR 2654&lt;/ref&gt; and he can do so even if the majority creditor objects.&lt;ref&gt;Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have even approved transactions that, as a "necessary evil", have made payments to the former management while leaving little or nothing to [[unsecured creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Re [[Halliwells LLP]] [2010] EWHC 2036 (Ch) at para 20 http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2036.html&amp;query=halliwells+and+LLP&amp;method=boolean&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals issued ''Statement of Insolvency Practice 16''&lt;ref name="r3.org.uk"/&gt; to require insolvency practitioners acting as administrators to disclose a number of matters to all creditors as soon as possible after the completion of the sale. This was done in an attempt to provide greater transparency to creditors.

On 1 November 2013, following a government-commissioned review, a new ''Statement of Insolvency Practice 16'' was introduced. It requires administrators to disclose the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://lucasjohnson.co.uk/statement-of-insolvency-practice-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*The source of the administrator’s initial introduction and the date of the introduction
*The extent of the administrator’s involvement prior to appointment
*The alternative courses of action that were considered by the administrator, with an explanation of possible financial outcomes
*Whether efforts were made to consult with major creditors
*Why it was not appropriate to trade the business and offer it for sale as a going concern, during the administration
*Details of requests made to potential funders to fund working capital requirements
*Details of registered charges and dates of creation
*If the business or business assets have been acquired from an insolvency practitioner within the previous 24 months, or longer if the administrator deems that relevant to creditors’ understanding, the administrator should disclose both the details of that transaction and whether the administrator, administrator’s firm or associates were involved
*Any marketing activities conducted by the company and/or the administrator and the outcome of those activities
*The names and professional qualifications of any valuers and confirmation they have confirmed their independence
*Any valuations obtained of the business or the underlying assets
*A summary of the basis of the valuation adopted by the administrator or his valuers/advisers
*The rationale for the basis of the valuations obtained and an explanation of the sale of the assets compared to those valuations.  If no valuation has been obtained, the reason for not having done so and how the administrator was satisfied as to the value of the assets
*The date of the transaction
*The identity of the purchaser
*Any connection between the purchaser and the directors, shareholders or secured creditors of the company or their associates
*The names of any directors, or former directors, of the company who are involved in the management or ownership of the purchaser, or of any other entity into which any of the assets are transferred
*In transactions impacting on more than one related company (e.g. a group transaction) the administrator should ensure that the disclosure is sufficient to enable a transparent explanation (for instance, allocation of consideration paid)
*Whether any directors had given guarantees for amounts due from the company to a prior financier, and whether that financier is financing the new business
*Details of the assets involved and the nature of the transaction
*The consideration for the transaction, terms of payment, and any condition of the contract that could materially affect the consideration
*Sale consideration disclosed under broad asset valuation categories and split between fixed and floating charge realisations
*Any options, buy-back arrangements or similar conditions attached to the contract of sale
*If the sale is part of a wider transaction, a description of the other aspects of the transaction.

The main benefit of a pre-pack administration is the 'continuity' of the business - the company is protected by the court. This gets rid of debts and contracts. It does not get rid of employees due to the [[Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006]] (TUPE).  Another big advantage is that the cost of the process is lower than trading administration, as the administrators do not need to find funding to trade the business. The downside of a pre-pack administration is that it can attract negative publicity if the former directors are seen to be shedding liabilities.

The [[Insolvency Service]] monitors compliance with SIP 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/insolvency-profession/regulation/statements-of-insolvency-practice/sip-16-reports-pre-packs&lt;/ref&gt; Its reports show that in 2010 it reported 10 insolvency practitioners to their licensing bodies, and in 2011 it reported 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2174788/21-ips-reported-compliance-pre-packs-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, typically the term ''pre-packaged insolvency'' is recoined as '''pre-packaged bankruptcy'''.  A conventional bankruptcy case is one in which the debtor files for Chapter 11 relief without having agreed in advance to the terms of a plan of reorganization with its creditors. During the course of the Chapter 11 case, the debtor or, if the debtor does not retain the exclusive right to propose a plan, a creditor or creditor group may formulate and propose a plan of reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pros And Cons Of Prepackaged Bankruptcy|url=http://www.stblaw.com/docs/default-source/cold-fusion-existing-content/publications/pub1647.pdf?sfvrsn=2|publisher=Law 360|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the ''protection'' of the court until it emerges. An example is the [[airline industry]]; in 2006, over half the industry's [[seating capacity]] was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Delta and Northwest airlines both file for bankruptcy | url = http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/bankruptcy_airlines/ | accessdate = November 17, 2005 | work=CNN | date=2005-09-14 | first1=Chris | last1=Isidore | first2=/Money | last2=Senior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pre-packaged case, the plan proponents will have secured sufficient support from creditors to confirm their plan of reorganization prior to filing for Chapter 11 reorganization. Pre-packaged plans of reorganization virtually always impair (i.e. pay less than in full) one or more classes of creditors, and so in order to ensure that the plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court, the plan proponents must secure the support of at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of at least one such impaired class, in addition to ensuring the plan complies with all other requirements for confirmation. Two procedurally difficult aspects of the process are the announcement (which must be structured so as not to trigger contractual termination provisions) and getting the requisite creditor approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/bankruptcy/articles/820493|title=3 Tips For Acing A Prepackaged Ch. 11 - Law360|website=www.law360.com|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a new entity completed the purchase of continuing operations, assets and trademarks of [[General Motors]] as a part of the 'pre-packaged' [[Chapter 11]] reorganization.&lt;ref name=Stoll&gt;Stoll, John D., and Neil King Jr. (July 10, 2009).[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124722154897622577 GM Emerges From Bankruptcy].''The Wall Street Journal''.

Retrieved on July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining pre-petition creditors claims are paid from the former corporation's assets.&lt;ref name=Stoll/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPO/&gt;

==Criticism==
A review from [[Wolverhampton University]] identified the several criticisms of pre-pack sales.  There is a general concern that the pre-pack administrator, in agreeing to the pre-pack in consultation with the company’s management team (and usually its secured creditors), favours the interests of the managers and secured creditors ahead of those of the unsecured creditors.  The speed and secrecy of the transaction often lead to a deal being executed, about which the unsecured creditors know nothing and offers them little or no return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellard|first1=Mark|last2=Walton|first2=Peter|title=A Comparative Analysis of Anglo-Australian Pre-packs: Can the Means Be Made to Justify the Ends?|journal=International Insolvency Review|date=26 Sep 2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=143–181|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iir.1201/abstract|accessdate=28 July 2014|doi=10.1002/iir.1201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is often a suspicion that the consideration paid for the business may not have been maximized due to the absence of [[open market]]ing. Credit may have been incurred inappropriately prior to the pre-pack and this may not be fully investigated.&lt;ref&gt;"When is pre-packaged administration appropriate?"http://www.ntu.ac.uk/nls/document_uploads/112698.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticism of this nature had been levelled at pre-pack sales by John Moulton of [[Alchemy Partners]] in January 2009, saying 'Pre-packs could be very easily abused. Bad management can plan for a prepack months in advance, line up an administrator – and then be back running the business immediately. It means when retailers fail they are often being kept with the same directors when it would be much healthier if new management arrived and with fresh money to invest".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1104725/Pre-pack-deals-risk-cheating-creditors-Private-equity-boss-warns-abuse-quickie-bankruptcy.html#ixzz0rDL91vtB&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5135">The '''Price–Harney Truce''' was a document signed on May 21, 1861, between United States Army General [[William S. Harney]] (Commander of the U.S. Army's Western Department) and [[Missouri State Guard]] commander [[Sterling Price]] at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].

The truce sought to forestall the outbreak of violence in the state of Missouri following the [[Camp Jackson Affair]], in which Union army troops under the command of Captain [[Nathaniel Lyon]] had captured [[Missouri State Militia (pre-Missouri State Guard)|Missouri State Militia]] mustered on the outskirts of St. Louis.  While Lyon marched the captured militia to the [[St. Louis Arsenal]] through a crowd, a civilian riot ensued. The soldiers fired into the crowd and killed several people.  In the aftermath of the riot, the [[Missouri State Legislature]] enacted the governor's "Military Bill" replacing the Missouri State Militia with a new [[Missouri State Guard]].  The governor appointed [[Sterling Price]] major general and commander of the State Guard.

General Harney had been away from St. Louis during the Camp Jackson affair.  Upon his return, he met with Price to sign a joint statement "for the purpose of removing misapprehensions and allaying public excitement," its object being "that of restoring peace and good order to the people of the State in subordination to the laws of the General and State Governments."[http://www.missouricivilwarmuseum.org/documents/21may1861price-harney.htm]

The Price–Harney Truce made federal forces responsible for order in the St. Louis area, and state forces responsible for order in the rest of the state. Under the terms of the truce, as understood by Harney, the agreement obligated the Missouri State Guard to protect Unionist Missourians from harassment and to hold the state for the Union. Harney also informed Price that several clauses in Missouri's recently enacted "Military Bill" would have to be modified to remove potential conflicts with the federal government's legal authority.

The truce drew the immediate ire of a wide variety of Missouri Unionists (including the politically powerful Congressman [[Francis Preston Blair, Jr.|Frank Blair]]), who lobbied President Lincoln and the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to have Harney relieved of command. In the face of reports of abuses against Missouri Unionists, and continued negotiations between Governor Jackson and the Confederate Government, Lincoln approved Harney's replacement as commander of the Western District by newly promoted Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. The change of command took place on May 30. Whereas Harney was recognized as a legalistic and cautious Unionist, Lyon was an outspoken Abolitionist, with a long-standing relationship with several militant Missouri Unionist organizations.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Lyon's elevation effectively ended the truce with Price.

On June 11 Missouri Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson]] held a last-ditch meeting at the [[Planter's House Hotel]] in St. Louis to delay open conflict in the State. Jackson was an open Confederate sympathizer and Price had been a conditional Unionist until the Camp Jackson Affair. During the meeting, Lyon angrily refused Price's requests to limit federal forces to the metropolitan St. Louis area, and to disband "Home Guard" companies established by Missouri Unionists. Lyon refused to accept any limitations on his military actions in the state, and eventually halted the meeting, informing Governor Jackson and MG Price that such limitations on federal authority "means war". Price and Jackson returned to the State Capitol at Jefferson City, and worked to concentrate State Guard forces in anticipation of open warfare with Unionist forces. Three days later Lyon landed troops at the state capitol from steamboats and occupied the city without a shot fired. Lyon's mixed force of volunteers and Regulars subsequently routed the State Guard at the June 17, 1861 [[Battle of Boonville]] which gave Unionist forces control of Jefferson City, the Missouri River line and the strategic North Missouri Railroad.

In the absence of Governor Jackson, who had fled to the southern part of the state with the Guardsmen, the State Constitutional Convention called itself into session, declared the office of governor vacant, and appointed [[Hamilton Gamble]], former state chief justice, as governor of the [[Provisional Government of Missouri]]. Gamble served from 1861 to 1864, when he died in office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12701">The '''Prime Time Access Rule (PTAR)''' was a broadcasting regulation that was instituted in the [[United States]] by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in 1970 to restrict the amount of network [[broadcast programming|programming]] that a local [[television station]] either [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] or [[network affiliate|affiliated]] with a [[television network]] can air during "[[prime time]]". This rule was repealed by the FCC in 1996.

==Issuance==
The PTAR was issued in 1970 and was implemented at the beginning of the 1971-72 television season (the week of September 13–19, 1971). It was re-examined periodically and underwent several modifications since its initial implementation.

The PTAR was instated over the concern that the [[Big Three television networks|three major television networks]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]]) dominated the [[television program]] production market, controlled much of the programming presented to the public, and inhibited the development of competing program sources. The FCC believed that PTAR would ultimately increase the level of competition in [[production company|program production]], reduce the networks' control over programming decisions made by their affiliates, and thereby increase the diversity of programs available to the public.

To ensure that independent companies would have access, the FCC, at the same time, instituted the [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules]] (commonly known as "fin-syn"), which prohibited networks from owning syndication arms. Existing syndication divisions operated by the networks were forced to be spun off as new companies independent of network management (such as [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]], originally created by [[CBS]] to distribute its content, and eventually expanded outside of program syndication and distribution in the succeeding years post-spinoff).

Immediately prior to its repeal, the Prime Time Access Rule applied only to owned-and-operated or affiliated network stations in the 50 largest [[media market|television markets]]. It restricted these stations from broadcasting more than three hours of network programming during the four-hour prime-time block each evening and established the first hour of prime time (7:00–8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], 6:00–7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]] and [[Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone|Hawaii–Aleutian Time]]) as the "prime access hour".

By the early 1980s, the PTAR had introduced a policy amendment prohibiting stations in the 50 television markets with the highest prime time viewership from broadcasting more than three hours of network programming during the four-hour "prime time" block. Stations had to find original programming to fill during the "prime time" fraction. However, the rule exempted certain types of programming, such as overruns of live sports events, special news, documentary and children's programming, and certain sports and network programming of a special nature.

To comply with the PTAR, most local television stations presented at least one syndicated [[game show]] between 7:00 and 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.; ironically, these were usually additional episodes of existing network daytime game shows (occasionally with a different host), distributed by companies that before 1971 had been subsidiaries owned by the networks (such as the former CBS property [[Viacom]] and former ABC property [[Worldvision Enterprises]]) and produced by the same production companies at the same studios as their daytime counterparts, effectively circumventing the purpose of the rule. Other programming that was often scheduled in these time slots were revivals of ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' (both shows that had been canceled by their respective networks, CBS and ABC, in the spring of 1971, before PTAR took effect).  Still others (most notably [[WIS]] in Columbia, SC) used the hour to carry their local evening newscast, a tradition that continues to this day.

The loss of the extra hour forced networks to eliminate a significant amount of its programming schedule; this led to an exacerbation of an already-existing trend in television programming known as the "[[rural purge]]", where programming that targeted less affluent, rural or older viewers (most notably, several series carried by CBS including ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'' and ''[[Green Acres]]'') was cancelled by the networks.

==Elimination==
The PTAR was eliminated on August 30, 1996, the commission having determined it was "no longer necessary" as a tool to promote independent production or affiliate autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FCC Repeals PTAR Rule|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/nrmm5085.txt|author=Audrey Spivack|author2=Kara Palamaras|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=July 28, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the major networks have not reclaimed the traditional "access" period in early primetime, this is most likely due to pressure from affiliates to retain control of one of the more profitable parts of their programming schedules. Several [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs (such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and ''[[Jeopardy!]]'') are still broadcast in the "prime access hour", and have earned audiences equal to or greater than many network shows. Other broadcast stations have expanded local news operations to carry local newscasts in the said hour.  In 2010, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] was allowed to present [[2010 World Series|World Series]] games that started around 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time, so as to prevent games from running into the 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern) hour. In 2014 and 2015, CBS moved its Thursday prime time to start at 7:30 p.m. for the first eight weeks of the season to allow for a full pregame show for ''[[Thursday Night Football]]''.

Smaller networks such as [[Ion Television|Pax TV]] began programming full 24-hour schedules after the rule change.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} Some networks, though, had programmed the "access" hour despite the rule, particularly Spanish-language networks that hold responsibility for the majority of their affiliates' programming schedules, such as [[Univision]] and [[Telemundo]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Sunday nights==
A 1975 revision to the PTAR allowed networks to program the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m./6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. time slot on Sundays, and the majority of the major networks have done so ever since. ABC has programmed ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' in the slot for much of the time since 1993 (except for a period from 1997 to 2002, when ABC broadcast ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' in the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour), while CBS has shown ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in the slot consistently since 1975. NBC has mostly broadcast ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' in the slot since 1996, though since regaining [[NFL on NBC|NFL broadcasting rights]] in 2006, during [[American football|football]] season the network airs ''[[Football Night in America]]'' in the slot as a [[pre-game show]] to its ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' broadcasts. 

The slot has been used by the networks to broadcast run-over programming from [[National Football League|NFL]] games, since the NFL broadcasting contracts require the games to air in their entirety (this happened as a result of the [[Heidi Game]] in 1968, in which NBC cut away from an [[Oakland Raiders]]-[[New York Jets]] game to air the [[television film]] ''[[Heidi (1968 film)|Heidi]]'', prior to the Raiders' comeback late in the fourth quarter). While CBS "shifts" its Sunday evening schedule to start after its [[NFL on CBS|NFL coverage]] concludes, Fox has utilized a different approach: the network completely pre-empted its lineup until the last game it [[NFL on Fox|held the right to broadcast in each region]] had finished until 2004, upon which it joined its prime-time lineup in progress (pre-empting portions or even the entirety of programs scheduled to air in the "first" hour of its prime time schedule following the game's designated time slot).  Similarly, if necessary, major tournaments in professional golf are also treated in this manner;  since 1987 (the year Daylight Saving Time was moved earlier), The [[Masters Tournament]] has begun to finish into the hour.  The U. S. Open and Men's PGA Championship, depending on the region, also can be overrun into the time slot, with Pacific Time Zone tournaments allowing networks to run into prime time hours.  

Since 2005, Fox has aired the [[post-game show]], ''[[NFL on Fox#Post-game show: The OT|The OT]]'', in the slot as "filler" programming between its NFL coverage and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., with its length depending on how late the final game ends, since NFL games with a 4:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern) start time almost always end by 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., even if the game goes into [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]]. Fox has continued the practice for [[NASCAR on Fox|Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] races, as the [[Daytona 500]] and on occasion, a West Coast Swing event such as the [[Auto Club Speedway]] round, was designed to creep into the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour, and the U. S. Open, typically held on the Sunday closest to the longest day of the year, will also do such. Before that, the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour on Fox was seen similar to that of the [[Friday night death slot]] on all of the networks, as several shows near the end of their runs (such as ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'') were scheduled to air in the time period but ultimately got pre-empted by Fox's NFL coverage. This tradition has continued during the off-season, with the most recent examples of shows [[burning off|burned off]] on Sundays at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. half-hour being ''[['Til Death]]'' and ''[[Sons of Tucson]]'' during the spring and summer of 2010, and ''[[Mulaney]]'' in 2014.

On October 7, 2018, [[The CW]] resumed programming a prime time lineup on Sunday nights. However, unlike its previous effort to program that night from the network's launch in September 2006 (a byproduct of originally adopting co-predecessor [[The WB]]'s 30-hour weekly base schedule upon The CW's launch) until it ceded the timeslot to its affiliates in September 2009, The CW opted to only to offer programming during the "common prime" slot (8:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET/PT) offered on weekdays and Saturdays by the conventional broadcast networks that have launched on U.S. television since Fox's expansion to include prime time program offerings in April 1987. This move marked the first such instance of a major U.S. television network not programming that hour since the 1975 PTAR revision was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/cw-sunday-primetime-block-1202698748/|title=CW Plans Sunday Primetime Block for 2018-19 Season|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|date=14 February 2018|work=Variety|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CW Expanding Original Programming to Sundays|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-expanding-original-programming-sundays-1084766|author=Lesley Goldberg|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Billboard–Hollywood Reporter Media Group|date=February 14, 2018|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The CW Fall Schedule: Supergirl and Charmed Take Over Sunday, Arrow Targets Monday, Jane Held to '19|url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/17/cw-fall-lineup-2018-supergirl-sunday-charmed-schedule/|author=Michael Ausiello|website=[[TVLine]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 17, 2018|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CW rolls out six-night schedule starting in October; see list of premieres|url=https://pix11.com/2018/09/24/cw-rolls-out-six-night-schedule-starting-in-october-see-list-of-premieres/|website=[[WPIX]]|publisher=[[Tribune Broadcasting]]|date=September 24, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9962">'''Public-interest immunity''' ('''PII'''), previously known as '''Crown privilege''', is a principle of [[English law|English]] [[common law]] under which the [[English courts]] can grant a [[court order]] allowing one [[litigant]] to refrain from [[Discovery (law)|disclosing]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to the other litigants where disclosure would be damaging to the [[public interest]].  This is an exception to the usual rule that all parties in litigation must disclose any evidence that is relevant to the proceedings.  In making a PII order, the court has to balance the public interest in the administration of justice (which demands that relevant material is available to the parties to litigation) and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of certain documents whose disclosure would be damaging. PII orders have been used in criminal law against large organised criminal outfits and drug dealers where the identity of paid police informants could be at risk.

==Seeking the order==
An order that PII applies would usually be sought by the British government to protect [[official secret]]s, and so can be perceived as a [[gag order|gagging order]].  Where a minister believes that PII applies, he signs a PII certificate, which then allows the court to make the final decision on whether the balance of public interest was in favour of disclosure or not.  Generally, a court will allow a claim of PII without inspecting the documents: only where there is some doubt will the court inspect the documents to decide whether PII applies.

Originally, a government minister was under a duty to advance a PII point where PII could be relevant, and the court took a certificate from a minister claiming PII as final and conclusive.  However, over time, there has been an increase in both the ability of a minister to make a disclosure, notwithstanding the potential application of PII, and the ability of the courts to review a claim of PII.  In ''Conway v Rimmer'' [1968], the House of Lords held that the courts retained the final decision on whether PII should be upheld, and, in ''R v [[Chief Constable]] of West Midlands, ex parte Wiley'' [1995], the [[House of Lords]] decided that a minister could discharge his duty by making his own judgment of where the public interest lies (that is, to disclose or to assert PII).  In practice, this is thought to have led to a reduction in the number of cases when PII is asserted.

==History==
PII was previously known as Crown Privilege, and derived from the same principle as the immunity of [[the Crown]] from prosecution before the [[Crown Proceedings Act 1947]].  However, PII is not limited to the Crown (see the ''NSPCC'' case mentioned below), and cannot be waived save in exceptional circumstances.

A number of PII certificates were signed in relation to the prosecutions of individuals involved in the [[Arms-to-Iraq|Matrix Churchill "Arms to Iraq"]] case, a subject that was subsequently investigated in the [[Scott Report]].

===Examples===
*''Duncan v. Cammell Laird and Co. Ltd'' [1942] AC 624.  The [[submarine]] [[HMS Thetis (N25)|HMS ''Thetis'']] sank on 1 June 1939 during [[sea trial]]s with the loss of 99 lives.  The families of the sailors who had been killed in the disaster claimed damages from the builders, [[Cammell Laird]].  The [[House of Lords]] upheld a certificate issued by the [[Admiralty]] claiming PII in relation to the plans of the submarine.  The House of Lords also held that the courts should take a PII certificate at face value.
*''Tomlinson v HMG''. In 1995, former MI6 officer [[Richard Tomlinson]] attempted to bring [[MI6]] before an [[employment tribunal]] to seek compensation for unfair dismissal. MI6 argued that this would "damage national security" and obtained a PII from the then Foreign Secretary [[Sir Malcolm Rifkind]] to block Tomlinson's application. Tomlinson argued vociferously that the real reason that MI6 obtained the PII certificate was to cover up their incompetent and dishonest personnel management.
*''Conway v Rimmer'' [1968].  The House of Lords held that the courts are the final arbiters of whether PII applies or not.  
*''D v. National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children'' [1978] AC 171.  The [[NSPCC]] investigated an allegation that D was mistreating her child.  D claimed damages, and sought documents from the NSPCC to identify who had made the allegation.  The House of Lords upheld the NSPCC's claim of PII, since its legitimate role in protecting the welfare of children was clearly in the public interest and would be threatened by disclosure.
*''[[Air Canada]] v. [[Secretary of State for Trade]]'' [1983] 2 AC 384.  A group of [[airline]]s claimed that the [[British Airports Authority]] had unlawfully increased [[landing fee]]s at the instigation of a government minister.  The minister disclosed some documents, but claimed PII in respect of others.  The House of Lords decided not to inspect the disputed documents, holding that inspection was only required if they were "reasonably likely" to assist or damage a party's case.
*''R v Chief Constable of West Midlands, ex parte Wiley'' [1995] 1 AC 274.  The House of Lords decided that a minister could discharge his duty by making his own judgment of where the public interest lies, and was not obliged to claim PII in all cases where it may be applicable.
* The [[Scott Inquiry]] found that public interest immunity certificates had been issued which withheld from defence counsel certain documents which would have exonerated the defendants in the Matrix Churchill trial.
* ''R v [[Paul Burrell]]'' [2002] – A public-interest immunity certificate allowed the prosecution to apply to the judge for a ruling that disclosure of certain information would be harmful to the public interest and should not be made public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,825502,00.html MPs criticise Queen over Burrell case – The Guardian, Nov 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''R v Hicks, Nute and Rowe'' [2002] – A public-interest immunity certificate was presented to the court by the Crown Prosecution Service after about ten minutes of this hearing. A possible reason for the introduction of the PII certificate was that the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] refuses to reveal the circumstances under which it transferred several of its properties (including [[Tintagel Castle]]) to the care of [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornishstannaryparliament.co.uk/justice.html  On the Road to Justice for the Cornish]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''R v. Yam'' [2008] (trial of Wang Yam for the murder of [[Allan Chappelow]]) – In December 2007 the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] indicated it would ask for this trial for murder, burglary and deception to be held "[[in camera]]", making it the first UK murder trial ever heard behind closed doors without access by press or public. A public-interest immunity certificate was sought by the [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]]; it was reported by ''[[the Times]]'' on 13 December 2007 that the grounds were "on the basis of protecting national security interests and to protect the identity of informants". A further order was made under the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] prohibiting the press from any speculation as to the reasons for parts of the trial being held in private. In the [[Court of Appeal]] on 28 January, the "gagging order" was upheld, with the [[Lord Chief Justice]] insisting that a fair trial would be possible even if some or all of it is held "in camera".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Bid for open murder trial fails" | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7213797.stm | date=2008-01-28 | accessdate=2008-01-29  | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2008/269.html ''Regina v. Wang Yam'',] [2008] EWCA Crim. 269, United Kingdom Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, January 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Binyam Mohamed|R (Mohamed)]] v [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]'' [Feb 2010]

== European Convention on Human Rights ==
Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right to a fair trial; an "implied" right stemming from this is that of "equality of arms" – the idea that hearings should be adversarial and both parties should have access to the same evidence and witnesses. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has held that Article 6 (especially the "implied" rights) is not an absolute right and that measures restricting the rights of the defence so as to safeguard an important public interest are lawful if "strictly necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

It is of note that fewer PII certificates have been issued in recent years. For example, MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining a PII certificate since the 1995 Tomlinson case, and have thus been subject to court scrutiny for investigations such as the inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales, and allegations that their officers partook in torture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16928">'''Refund anticipation loan''' ('''RAL''') is a short-term [[consumer loan]] in the [[United States]] provided by a third party against an expected [[tax refund]] for the duration it takes the tax authority to pay the refund. The loan term was usually about two to three weeks, related to the time it took the [[US Internal Revenue Service|U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] to deposit refunds in electronic accounts. The loans were designed to make the refund available in as little as 24 hours. They were secured by a taxpayer's expected tax refund, and designed to offer customers quicker access to funds.

The costs to the borrower could be significant compared to other lending and some consumer organizations warned consumers of the risk involved in this type of loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/nebraska/migration/other-news/2013/03/refund-anticipation-loans-come-with-risks/ |title=Refund Anticipation Loans Come With Risks |date=March 5, 2013 |publisher=BetterBusinessBureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are a largely discontinued financial product and beginning with the 2013 tax filing season, they have been largely replaced with the similar '''refund anticipation checks''' ('''RAC'''),&lt;ref name=BetterBusinessBureau_Feb.2013&gt;[http://alaskaoregonwesternwashington.bbb.org/article/refund-anticipation-loans-come-with-risks-40407 Refund Anticipation Loans Come With Risks], Better Business Bureau, 2/26/2013.

' . . "They have to disclose all the fees so make sure you carefully read any papers that you sign, giving them rights to your refund, because that's exactly what you're doing," said Hudson [Katy Hudson, Consumer Credit Counseling Services President]. . '&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a hodge podge of other financial products.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney_March_6_2013&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/06/pf/taxes/tax-refund-loans/ New tax refund loans carry sky-high fees and rates], CNNMoney, Blake Ellis, March 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

RACs are temporary accounts which wait for the client's IRS tax refund, and which also provides a way for the client to pay for tax preparation out of the refund. Both financial products have similar fees and similar risks of third-party bank "cross-collection".

A similar process in [[Canada]] to a RAL is termed "[[tax rebate discounting]]".

==United States==
In the United States prior to the 2013 tax filing season, taxpayers could apply for a refund anticipation loan through a paid professional [[tax preparation]] service, where a fee is typically charged for the preparation of the [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]]. [[Internal Revenue Service]] rules prohibit basing this fee on the amount of the expected refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/pcir230.pdf|publisher=U.S. Dept of the Treasury|title=U.S. Dept of the Treasury Circular 230}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional fee was usually charged for the services of originating a bank product and establishing a short-term bank account. By law this fee must be the same on both loan and non-loan bank products, and in 2004 the average fee was $32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lendittome.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BuildingBetterRAC.pdf|publisher= Consumer Law|accessdate=2008-10-16|title=Building a Better Refund Anticipation Check}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank through which the loan was made charges finance charges.

According to the [[National Consumer Law Center]], 12 million taxpayers used a RAL in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11362964/|title= E-filing can make high-fee loans unnecessary - Tax Tactics |publisher= MSNBC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With e-filing and IRS partnerships that help consumers [[IRS e-file|e-file]] for free, U.S. taxpayers can generally receive their tax refunds within three weeks and sometimes as quickly as ten to fourteen days if they choose to receive their refund via direct deposit. As of 2017, 70% of US taxpayers have access to free e-file and tax preparation services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erb|first1=Kelly Phillips|title=IRS Announces Free File Now Open, More Than 70% Of Taxpayers Can E-File For Free|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2016/01/17/irs-announces-free-file-now-open-more-than-70-of-taxpayers-can-e-file-for-free/#45aa872d7736|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rendered RALs less attractive to some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/itax/news/20010131b.asp|title= Cheaper and still fast alternatives to refund anticipation loans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Format footnotes|date=February 2017}}&lt;!--Just this paragraph--&gt;
RALs began in 1985 when Ronald Smith, an Accountant in Virginia Beach, VA started the practice of Refund Advance Loans at his accounting firm, Action Accounting &amp; Taxes located at 5441 Virginia Beach Blvd.  This service of Loans On Tax Refunds was advertised widely through WYAH, TV and on Cox Cable in the Hampton Roads area by Action Accounting &amp; Taxes in 1985, 1986 and 1987.  The Advance Refund Loans became a huge business success from the start and a sensation in the area in 1986 and 1987 and was the first and only firm in the United States that was offering that service according to the IRS.  In 1986 a salesman from Charlie Falk's Auto on Virginia Beach Blvd, where today Town Centre now exits, asked Mr. Smith if they could make an arrangement where Action Accounting &amp; Taxes could prepare taxes for customers seeking to purchase cars in order to supplement their down payments on used or new car purchases.  Mr. Smith agreed to this idea and that was the beginning of Loans on Tax Refunds being used in conjunction with car financing and that practice then quickly spread throughout the area and then throughout the entire United States.  Mr. Smith was the first one to invent, organize and pioneer the process of Tax Refund Loans in this way and went on to make millions in this business.  The financing was originally fully handled by Joel S. Coplon and Company, a small private financing company closely connected with Mr. Smith at the time.   Action Accounting and Taxes, the firm that Mr. Smith owned, was one mile from where John Hewitt was just starting a new business venture.  Mr. Hewitt had just recently purchased Mel Jackson's Tax Service which was a run down group of offices throughout the Hampton Road's area.  Mr. Hewitt began to offer Refund Anticipation Loans in 1988 and built a national franchise out of the idea which funded and built Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.  Then in 1989 H &amp; R Block joined in the industry and it became a billion dollar industry across the United States being coopted into thousands of different accounting firms and tax practices across the United States and abroad.  It was reported in 1989 that H &amp; R Block had doubled it's business at over 4,000 locations due to the introduction of this new Refund Loan Service.  It later spread to Canada as well through Liberty Tax Service and in time this company moved into the United States market as well offering the same service.  The proliferation of this tax loan practice coincided with the introduction of electronic filing which [[IRS e-file|IRS introduced electronic filing]] as a way to decrease its cost of operation.  Previous to this time refunds would take on average two to three months to come back from the IRS which is why the Loan on Tax Refund also known as Refund Anticipations Loan business flourished.  In 1988, Mr. Smith as well as Mr. Coplon were jointly sued by the Attorney General of Virginia in a Richmond State Court for charging usurious interest.  Mr. Smith was eventually dismissed from the case and it was reported by the State's Attorney at the time that the reason for his dismissal from the case was that Mr. Smith was "not culpable".&lt;ref&gt;(WAVY TV News, "Action Accounting", April 20–28, 1987),(Virginian Pilot &amp; Ledger Starr, Sept. 21, 1987, Action Accounting &amp; Tax Service), (USA Today, "Joel S. Coplon",  Oct. 6, 1988). (Wall Street Journal, "H &amp; R Block Doubled Business With Tax Refund Loan Offer", April 25, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tax preparer]] would, within 24 hours of submission, receive from the IRS confirmation that the submission was free of mathematical errors, and that the filer had no liens or delinquent federal student loans. This meant that there was good chance that the IRS would pay the refund within weeks, barring fraudulent income reporting. At that point the preparer would issue the filer a check for the amount of the expected refund minus a commission. In 1995, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Beneficial's $30 electronic filing fee and $59 loan fee amounted to a 250 percent APR on a refund of $1,000.&lt;ref name = msnbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DB123AF931A15751C0A963958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS; Bank Challenges I.R.S. on Refunds for Borrowers |publisher= New York Times | date=1995-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitation of the system had begun by the early 1990s; filers misreported their income to inflate their refund. As a result of this, and also to discourage filers from this rather uneconomical offer, in 1994 the IRS stopped providing tax preparers a confirmation that a deposit would take place for a certain amount and that it would begin sending refunds directly to taxpayers instead of banks that made the loan,&lt;ref name = msnbc/&gt; but not having the desired effects, the confirmations were re-instated the following year.

==Controversy==
According to the [[Consumer Federation of America]] and the [[National Consumer Law Center]], RALs are controversial because, like [[payday loan]]s and [[title loan]]s, RALs are high-profit, low-risk loans marketed toward the working poor. A 2006 study by the NCLC and the [[Consumer Federation of America]] found that "Based upon the prices for RALs in 2006, a consumer can expect to pay about $100 in order to get a RAL for the average refund of about $2,150 from a commercial tax preparation chain this year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/2006_RAL_report.pdf|title=The NCLC/CFA 2006 Refund Anticipation Loan Report| author=Chi Chi Wu, Jean Ann Fox &amp; Patrick Woodall| publisher= Consumer Federation of America &amp; National Consumer Law Center|year=2006|pages=7|accessdate=2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of RALs, like the [[National Consumer Law Center]], argue that the profit motive of the lender results in RALs being issued too often to low-income individuals who are made to believe the wait for their refund is longer than it really is, who do not realize they are taking a loan, do not understand the high interest rates charged by the loan (often exceeding 100% APR until the last two tax filing seasons), and who do not actually need the funds immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/itax/news/20030127a1.asp?caret=6|title= The high price of refund anticipation loans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-party cross-collection of bank debt ("previous debt") for both RALs and RACs==
As part of applying for both financial products, the client is directing his or her refund to the account-issuing bank. Cross-collection occurs in cases where the bank uses this occasion to collect debt owed another bank. As the IRS Taxpayer Advocate described the practice in 2006: "if a taxpayer owes money on a defaulted RAL to Bank A and subsequently attempts to buy another RAL from Bank B, Bank B is authorized to collect the outstanding debt from the RAL proceeds, transmit the funds to Bank A".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/2007_objectives_report_vol_ii_ral_final.pdf National Taxpayer Advocate’s 2007 Objectives Report to Congress, Volume II, The Role Of The IRS In The Refund Anticipation Loan Industry], IRS, page 10, June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is somewhat unclear how broad is the type of debt for which banks cross-collect. This practice is often not adequately disclosed to the tax preparation client.  As a lawsuit filing against H&amp;R Block by the [[California]] [[California Attorney General|Attorney General]] in February 2006 stated, "H&amp;R Block does not adequately tell such customers about any alleged debts, or that when they sign the new RAL application, they agree to automatic debt collection—including collection on alleged RAL-related debts from other tax preparers or banks. These applications are denied, and the customer's anticipated refund is used to pay off the debt, plus a fee".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1261 Attorney General Lockyer Files Lawsuit Against H&amp;R Block for Illegally Marketing and Selling High-Cost Loans as ‘Instant' Tax Refunds], News Release, Office of the Attorney General, State of California, Bill Lockyer, (former) Attorney General, Edmund G. Brown Jr., (current) Attorney General, Feb. 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tax prep firms often vaguely refer to this practice merely as "previous debt".

This risk exists even if the client is only using the RAC account for purposes of taking the tax preparation fees out of the refund.&lt;ref name=KGET_Feb.2013/&gt;

==Jan. 2011:  IRS will not be providing "debt indicator"==
On August 5, 2010, the IRS announced that for the upcoming 2011 tax filing season, the agency would no longer be providing preparers and associated financial institutions with the "debt indicator" (a one-letter code that discloses whether or not the taxpayer owes [[back taxes]] and whether or not the taxpayer owes federally collected obligations such as [[child support]], [[student loans]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gZhidWFh-omq3dh3M486iDXA4JbAD9HDHDKG0 IRS to end release of taxpayer debt information], EILEEN AJ CONNELLY (Associated Press), Friday, August 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IRSPressRelease5Aug2010&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=226310,00.html IRS Removes Debt Indicator for 2011 Tax Filing Season], (IRS news release), IR-2010-89, Aug. 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxpayers themselves will continue to have access to information about their refund through the "Where's My Refund?" feature at the irs.gov website.&lt;ref name=IRSPressRelease5Aug2010/&gt;

In the same news release, the IRS stated it was exploring ways to allow filers to directly split off part of the refund to pay for professional tax preparation, possibly starting in January 2012. The IRS is asking for input from filers, consumer advocates, and those in the tax preparation community regarding whether this would be cost-effective.&lt;ref name=IRSPressRelease5Aug2010/&gt;

==Jan. 2013:  Major U.S. banks stop offering RALs==
Beginning with the 2013 tax season, major U.S. banks will no longer be offering RALs. They will instead be offering the similar financial products of RACs, which are not loans but are rather temporary accounts which sit empty waiting for the client's IRS refund.&lt;ref name=BetterBusinessBureau_Feb.2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=KGET_Feb.2013/&gt;

'''S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC''' ({{IPAc-en|d|aʊ}}) is a joint venture between [[S&amp;P Global]], the [[CME Group]], and [[News Corp]] that was announced in 2011 and later launched in 2012.  It produces, maintains, licenses, and markets [[stock market index|stock market indices]] as benchmarks and as the basis of investable products, such as [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), mutual funds, and [[structured product]]s. The company currently has employees in 15 cities worldwide, including [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], Frankfurt, Singapore, [[Hong Kong]], Beijing, and Dubai.

The company's best known indices are the [[S&amp;P 500]] and the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA), which was created in 1896. The company also manages the oldest index in use, the [[Dow Jones Transportation Average|Dow Jones Transportation Index]], created in 1882 by [[Charles Dow]], the founder of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

==Indices defined==
A market [[Stock market index|index]] (plural: indices) follows a certain market and gives investors a single number to summarize its ups and downs. It enables the world's institutional (and retail) investors to track a [[market (economics)|market]] or [[market sector]] without having to aggregate the underlying components. It is a convenient way for someone interested in a broad, narrow, or extremely narrow group of securities to track them.

[[Pension funds]] and other money managers often use indexes as benchmarks. This means that "active" investors (those who pick various securities to [[buy and hold]] for their returns) track their own returns against a benchmark index (an index that typifies its market) to see if they are out- or under-performing that market. Investors who do not want to do this (those who buy into indexes or securities that use indexes as their basis) are called "passive" investors. They are known to link their portfolios to the broad market and do not try to outguess conventional market wisdom. Passive investors argue that almost no active investors can beat the overall markets in the long-term. This choice is described by a theory in investing called the [[efficient market hypothesis]].

==Indices by S&amp;P Dow Jones==
The DJI has over 130,000 indexes, although many are used by only relatively few people. Most are principally equity (stock) indexes but also contain fixed-income, futures, options, private equity, commodity, currency, bond, and other alternative [[Asset allocation|asset class]] metrics. Dow Jones Indexes says that all its products are maintained according to clear, unbiased, and systematic methodologies that are fully integrated within index families.

DJI and [[Sustainable Asset Management]] (SAM), launched the [[Dow Jones Sustainability Index|Dow Jones Sustainability Indices]] in 1999.  These indexes track performance of sustainability-driven companies around the world. There are currently 70 DJSI licensees held by asset managers in 16 countries to manage a variety of financial products, including active and passive funds, certificates and segregated accounts.

DJI partnered with AIG to create the [[Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index]]. It tracks trades on [[futures contract]]s for physical commodities, like energy (petroleum, gas), [[precious metal]]s (gold, silver), industrial metals (zinc, copper), grains (corn, wheat), livestock (lean hogs, live cattle), among others.

[[UBS]] Securities LLC has acquired [[AIG]] Financial Product Corp.'s commodity business as of May 6, 2009. As such, the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Indexes have been re-branded as the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Indexes effective May 7, 2009.

The Dow Jones Select Dividend Indexes reflects the performance of leading dividend-yielding stocks. It includes global and regional indexes. It was DJI's first fundamentals-driven index.

Dow Jones Indexes also does "specialty" indexes for specific markets or interests. It has the Dow Jones U.S. Economic Stimulus Index, the Olympic-inspired Dow Jones Summer/Winter Games, the race-car centric Dow Jones Formula 1 Index and the closely followed Dow Jones Luxury Index, among others.

Companies can also request that specific indexes be created to suit their clients' interest or for publicity purposes. This is popular with smaller asset management and public relations firms.

==Recent history==
DJI launches an average of one index or index family per week. It often creates an index for a specific event (i.e. Dow Jones 2008 Summer Games Index, launched December 2007), a specific market (Dow Jones Luxury Index, launched June 2008), or a very small market (Dow Jones Cyprus Titans 10 Index). In some instances it cooperates with other entities to create a custom index (Barron’s 400 Index, launched September 2007).

Dow Jones Industrial Average historical data (along with several other major indexes) recently became available on a new website, www.djaverages.com. The company also has a widely read quarterly newsletter called ''Insights'' that covers the industry.

===Recent notable developments at DJI===

* March 2008 – [[Chicago Climate Exchange]], Inc. (CCX), the world's first and North America's only voluntary, legally binding, integrated [[greenhouse gas]] emissions reduction registry and trading system, announced that Dow Jones Indexes and [[Sustainable Asset Management]] had granted CCX a license for the Dow Jones Sustainability World (DJSI World) and Dow Jones Sustainability North America Indexes (DJSI North America). The contracts are listed on CCX's wholly owned subsidiary Chicago Climate Futures Exchange (CCFE), the world's leading environmental derivatives exchange. They trade emissions credits and DJI makes the indexes that are based on them.
* July 2008 – DJI partnered with [[Brookfield Asset Management]] (BAM) to develop the Dow Jones Brookfield Infrastructure Indexes. This index series was designed to serve as benchmarks of companies that own and operate key infrastructure assets, like toll roads, pipelines and ports.
* July 2007 – The Iowa Peace officers Retirement System has adopted the Dow Jones Wilshire Index Family (now called the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Indexes; see below). These indexes are popular benchmarks for pension funds looking to minimize risk and market exposure. They used the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000sm (now called the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index), to benchmark its [[equity investment]] portfolio.
* August 2008 – News Corp. Chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] announced a new worldwide benchmark index—[[the Global Dow]]. It will comprise 150 stocks around the world that will include large companies in established markets, but also rising stars in [[emerging markets]] as well as companies specializing in new technologies. Murdoch made the announcement in [[Mumbai|Mumbai, India]], emphasizing its global outlook.
* April 2009 – Dow Jones rolled out the Dow Jones Total Stock Market (TSM) Indexes. They were designed to provide comprehensive coverage of the U.S. equity market. Its flagship index was intended to be the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index, an all-inclusive measure composed of all U.S. equity securities with readily available prices. It is sliced according to stock-size segment, style and sector to create distinct sub-indexes that track every major segment of the market. DJI claims that the indexes were created and maintained according to an objective and transparent methodology with the fundamental aim of providing reliable, accurate measures of U.S. equity performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djindexes.com/mdsidx/html/pressrelease/press-release-archive.html#20090401 |title=Dow Jones Indexes &amp;#124; 2009 Press Release Archive |publisher=Djindexes.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218191353/http://www.djindexes.com/mdsidx/html/pressrelease/press-release-archive.html#20090401 |archivedate=February 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 1, 2009 – DJI changed the components of the famous benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average. It cut Citigroup and GM – both of which were trading at or under $1 per share (and both of which, after receiving Federal bailout money, were practically government wards). They were replaced by insurance giant Travelers and IT pioneer Cisco Systems.
* June 2009 – Later that month, Dow Jones Indexes announced a joint marketing agreement with LVA Indices (Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvaindices.com |title=LVA Indices |publisher=LVA Indices |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Proveedor Integral de Precios (PIP) to create a new series of corporate and government fixed income indexes called Dow Jones Latixx Indexes [http://www.latixx.com]. It started with dozens of Mexican and Chilean bonds, with plans to move into Costa Rica, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. In February 2010, it added 22 new bonds from Chile and Mexico. In October 2010, it launched Peruvian bond indexes and on June 8, 2011, it added four Costa Rican bond indexes.
* Fall 2009 – Dow Jones Indexes was named Most Innovative ETF Index Provider 2009 for the Americas by exchangetradedfunds.com
* October 2009 – The Dow Jones GCC Titans 50 Real Return Index became the basis for the first exchange traded fund (ETF) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The licensee is National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD). The index measures the performance of 50 leading component stocks traded in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saudi Gazette|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009101551541|title=Dow Jones launches GCC Titans 50 index|publisher=Saudi Gazette|date=|accessdate=June 14, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712035954/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009101551541|archivedate=July 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, DJI launched DJIM Greater China Index. It has been licensed to ETFs in Malaysia and other countries.
* November 2009 – Charles Schwab licensed five Dow Jones Total Stock Market (TSM) Size and Style indexes for exchange traded funds. It is "Chuck's" first proprietary line of ETFs. In that same month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was licensed by Simplex Asset Management in Japan to underlie an ETF. This is the first time the DJIA was licensed to a Japanese ETF. It launched in December 2009.
* January 2010 – DJI announced that the Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index would serve as the basis of the first fixed-income [[exchange-traded note]] (ETN) available in Israel. This was the first time the index has been licensed as the basis for an exchange-traded product globally. The ETN is sponsored by Harel SAL, a subsidiary of Harel Finance, and is available on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). In addition to the Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index, Dow Jones Indexes licensed the Dow Jones Brazil Titans 20 Index as the basis for an Israeli ETN that was listed at the TASE.
* February 10, 2010 – Dow Jones and CME Group announced an agreement to form a joint venture to operate a global financial index services business. The definitive agreement is set to provide for CME Group to own 90% of the venture to which Dow Jones will contribute its Dow Jones Indexes business valued at $675 million. Dow Jones is expected to hold the remaining 10% and retain a key role in the management of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. CME Group will contribute a business which provides certain market data services said to be valued at $607.5 million to the joint venture. The new joint venture will also raise approximately $613 million in third-party debt which will be used to pay a $607.5 million distribution to Dow Jones. The deal was expected to close in the 1st quarter 2010 since it passed regulatory clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201003041114dowjonesdjonline000587&amp;title=cme-group-and-dow-jones-receive-clearance-for-index-deal |title=Latest News Headlines |publisher=NASDAQ.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 4, 2010 – Dow Jones Indexes signed a memorandum with [[The Global Fund]] to Fight AIDs, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to explore the creation of a family of indexes that could be licensed as the basis for investment products. The first is expected to be called the Dow Jones Global Fund 50 Index, which would most likely focus on Blue Chip stocks. Both The Global Fund and Dow Jones Indexes hoped to benefit from this collaboration. The Global Fund wants to further strengthen its engagement with the private sector and bring to bear the power of financial markets to help its efforts around the world. The Global Fund is a leading multilateral financing organization in global health with commitments with more than US$19 billion to date. Dow Jones Indexes intended to add to its range of socially conscious indexes that will complement its increasingly diverse range of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/pressreleases/?pr=pr_100305|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609184702/http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/pressreleases/?pr=pr_100305|archivedate=2011-06-09|title=The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis &amp; Malaria, Dow Jones Indexes Sign Memorandum to Explore Creation of Co-branded Indexes|date=March 5, 2010|work=The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* December 2010 – The Dow Jones Global Fund 50 Index was launched, based on 50 large companies that support The Global Fund's activities. It was licensed to db X-trackers, the leading ETF platform of Deutsche Bank, to serve as a basis for a financial product, the db x-trackers Global Fund Supporters ETF. The ETF begins trading today on the Frankfurt stock exchange.
* March 18, 2010 – CME Group and Dow Jones Indexes officially launched the new joint venture (JV). CME Group has 90% ownership.
* April 8, 2010 – The new JV continued to create new products, such as the Dow Jones Contrarian Opportunities Index, which went live on April 8, 2010. It is a rules-based index that has a “contrarian” investment strategy focusing on companies with strong recent fundamentals but a lagging three-year-trailing return. The index has been licensed to Javelin Investment Management to underlie an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the NYSE Euronext. It is the only index family that tracks the [[contrarian investing]] strategy.

{{Politics of SADR}}

'''Sahrawi nationality law''' is the law of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR) governing nationality and citizenship.  SADR is a [[Legal status of Western Sahara|partially recognized state]] which claims sovereignty over the entire territory of [[Western Sahara]], but only administers part of that territory.

==Legal framework==
The legal basis for Sahrawi nationality law is established in Article 104 of the [[Constitution of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Sahrawi constitution]] which provides that the [[Sahrawi National Council]] can make:&lt;ref name="1999 Constitution"&gt;[http://www.arso.org/03-const.99.htm 1999 Constitution] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* fundamental legislation on nationality, the right to citizenship and civil status; and
* general laws relating to the status of foreigners.

Generally, international practice is that nationality is established at birth by a child's place of birth ([[jus soli]]) or bloodline ([[jus sanguinis]]). When new states are established, typically citizenship is extended to all those who were born in the territory of the new state or who were lawfully resident in that territory for a specified period before the establishment of the new state. Typically, nationality may also be acquired later in life through naturalization. Corporations, ships, and other legal persons also have a nationality, generally in the state under whose laws the legal person was formed. However, it is unclear whether the Sahrawi National Council has exercised any of its powers to make laws under Article 104 of the Sahrawi constitution. Because of this, it is not possible to determine with legal certainty who in fact is a Sahrawi citizen.

== Responsibilities of Sahrawi citizens ==
[[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] citizens enjoy a range of rights under the Sahrawi constitution such as those relating to participation in the political, economic and social life of SADR. Sahrawi citizens are also subject to a number of obligations, some of which reflect the particular circumstances of the Sahrawi Republic. The following obligations are imposed on Sahrawi citizens under Chapter Five of Sahrawi constitution:&lt;ref name="1999 Constitution"/&gt;
*to respect the Constitution and the laws of the Republic;
*to defend the country and participate in its liberation;
*to defend national unity and fight against all violations of the will of the people;
*to participate in national service as may be laid down by law;

Citizens who are parents are also obliged to protect their families and their education while children must respect their parents.

==Status of Moroccan settlers==
Among the [[Western Sahara]]n population there is a very significant number of people who have resettled in Western Sahara from Morocco ([[Moroccan settlers]]) or who were born in Western Sahara, the children of Moroccan settlers. Some estimate that Moroccan settlers and their descendants now constitute a majority of the Western Sahara population although estimates vary. For some years, the SADR government has stated that it is willing in principle to allow Moroccan settlers to vote in the long stalled United Nations ([[MINURSO]]) supervised referendum on Western Sahara independence or integration with Morocco.

On 10 April 2007, the [[Polisario Front]] - the government of SADR – presented its "Proposal of the Polisario Front for a mutually acceptable political solution assuring the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara".&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071215144505/http://www.radiokcentrale.it/PROPOSITION_DU_FRONT_POLISARIO_POUR_UNE_SOLUTION_original_(3).doc Polisario Settlement Proposal, April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 Proposal the Polisario Front went further to reassure Moroccan settlers that they will continue to have a future in Western Sahara if the proposed referendum takes place and results in Sahrawi independence. Paragraph 9 of the Proposal states that in the context of Sahrawi independence, the Sahrawi government would provide:&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss.co.za/dynamic/administration/file_manager/file_links/OP155.PDF?link_id=21&amp;slink_id=5215&amp;link_type=12&amp;slink_type=23&amp;tmpl_id=3 South African Institute for Security Studies]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geo.international.gc.ca/world/site/includes/print.asp?lang=fr&amp;print=1&amp;url=%2Fcanada_un%2Fottawa%2Fcanada_un%2Funupdate-fr.asp&amp;id=9376 Canadian Government Website report on SADR offer of citizenship to Moroccan settlers]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| guarantees regarding the status and rights and obligations of the Moroccan population of Western Sahara, including their participation in the political, economic and social life of the territory of Western Sahara. In that regard, the Sahrawi State would accord Sahrawi nationality to every Moroccan citizen legally established in the territory who requests it.}}

In the absence of a comprehensive Sahrawi nationality law, the citizenship of settlers who came from Morocco or the smaller number who came to Western Sahara when it was a [[Spanish Sahara|Spanish colony and province]] - and indeed that of ethnic Sahrawis themselves will remain unclear.

The future status of [[Western Sahara]] remains the subject of UN sponsored negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front. Future developments in Sahrawi nationality law (and indeed its continued existence) may well be shaped by the outcome of those negotiations.

In March 2013, Hassan Serghouchni, an old Moroccan [[political prisoner]] in the 1980s residing in [[Oujda]], sent a letter to the Sahrawi Republic embassy in [[Algiers]] asking for the concession of the Sahrawi nationality, being the first Moroccan to demand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Un Marocain demande à devenir citoyen de la " RASD "|url=http://www.demainonline.com/2013/03/15/un-marocain-demande-a-devenir-citoyen-de-la-rasd/|publisher=[[Demain]]|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=17 March 2013|language=fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318014627/http://www.demainonline.com/2013/03/15/un-marocain-demande-a-devenir-citoyen-de-la-rasd/|archivedate=18 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 Serghouchni had renounced to the Moroccan nationality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alhadathacharki.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2111:2012-10-08-21-20-53&amp;catid=86:%D8%AD%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%A9&amp;Itemid=551 المعتقل السياسي السابق "حسن سغروشني" يتخلى رسميا عن جنسيته المغربية] Alhadathacharki.com, 8 October 2012 {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">The '''seven-deadly-sins law for juvenile offenders''' is a [[law]] intended to address the increasing rates of [[violent crime]] among youth.&lt;ref name="banks"&gt;Banks 2007, Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; The law has taken many forms in different state legislatures in the [[United States]], however the "[[seven deadly sins]]" aspect always refers to the jurisdiction of the superior court over the trial of any juvenile 13–17 years old who allegedly committed [[murder]], [[rape]], [[armed robbery]] with firearm, aggravated [[child molestation]], aggravated [[sodomy]], aggravated [[sexual battery]], or voluntary [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;Overview SB 440, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1990s, numerous US states enacted seven-deadly-sins laws to combat so-called teen "superpredators," a predicted wave of remorseless teenaged criminals. However, this prediction did not come to fruition.&lt;ref name="armstrong" /&gt;

Among the states in the US to pass such a bill was Georgia,&lt;ref name="banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="act"&gt;Georgia Senate, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; whose State Bill 440 attempted "to provide that certain juvenile offenders who commit certain violent felonies shall be tried as adults in the superior court."&lt;ref name="act" /&gt; However, in 2009, a bill softened the effects of that law, regressing from the default to try violent minor offenders as adults.&lt;ref name="armstrong" /&gt;

In April, 1994, the law was passed in the U.S. state of Georgia and means that the crimes of murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, rape, aggravated sexual battery, aggravated sodomy and aggravated child molestation carry a minimum of 10 years in prison, with the latter four  crimes carrying a minimum of 25 years to life in prison. First-degree murder is punishable by death, life in prison without parole or life in prison with no parole for at least 30 years, while second-degree carries a sentence of imprisonment for not less than 10 years and up to 30 years. Any person convicted a second time of any of these crimes will automatically be sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of parole. The law went into effect on January 1, 1995.

The '''Ship Security Alert System''' (SSAS) is part of the [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code|ISPS code]] and is a system that contributes to the [[International Maritime Organization]]'s (IMO)'s efforts to strengthen maritime security and suppress acts of terrorism and piracy against shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Security/Guide_to_Maritime_Security/Guidance/Documents/MSC.136(76).pdf | title=Resolution MSC.136 | accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is an IMO regulated system.  In case of attempted [[piracy]] or terrorism, the ship's SSAS beacon can be activated, and appropriate [[law-enforcement]] or military forces can be dispatched.  An SSAS beacon operates with similar principles to the [[Transponder (aviation)#Emergency codes|aircraft transponder emergency code 7700]].

'''State Bankruptcies in the 1840s''' (in the United States) occurred in [[Arkansas]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[Mississippi]], [[Pennsylvania]], and the territory of [[Florida]]. The end of an [[inflationary]] period from 1834–1839 and the [[Panic of 1837]] led to a tightening of credit lending from the [[Bank of England]]. By 1841, nineteen of the twenty-six U.S. states and two of the three territories had issued bonds and incurred state debt.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, 1843b, Report No. 296, pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the aforementioned states and territory were forced to default on payments and enter bankruptcy. The states were borrowing to fund transportation investments as well as raising capital to start new banks. Northern states, such as Pennsylvania and Maryland, incurred debt through the building of canals to connect the Midwest to ports on the Atlantic Ocean. Midwest states, including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, built railroads and canals throughout the region, while Southern States raised capital to fund new banks to improve a weakened banking system. The majority of state debt was owed to parties outside the U.S., primarily Europe.&lt;ref name=Mcgrane&gt;McGrane, Reginald C. ''Foreign bondholders and American state debts''. New York: MacMillan, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; State debts were largely paid off in full by the late 1840s, although no direct sanctions were enacted to force repayment. The state bankruptcies led to The Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was later repealed in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;5 Stat. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inflationary Period Pre-1837==
The years from 1834–1837 leading up to the State bankruptcies were inflationary until the [[Panic of 1837]]. Prices for cotton and other exports sent overseas were rising. Through trade and state-backed bonds, the United States had a strong inflow of capital from the [[Bank of England]] and other European parties. Large infrastructure investments were being made domestically with the excess inflow of monetary value to the U.S. Much of the westward expansion of the United States was brought about from overseas funding for railroads and canals. Increasing the efficiency of transportation made it easier for people to move away from the large ports on the East coast.&lt;ref name=jenks&gt;[[Jenks, Leland Hamilton]] (1927). The Migration of British Capital to 1875. Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 66–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern States===
Pennsylvania and Maryland had viewed the success of the [[Erie Canal]] in connecting rural New York and the Midwest to the ports on the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=Mcgrane /&gt; The investment in building a new canal was costly but well compensated in trade opportunities further down the road. Both Pennsylvania and Maryland began borrowing from European groups to fund the construction of similar transportation infrastructure. By 1841, Maryland had amassed a total debt of a little over $12 million with more than $11 million used for transportation purposes. Pennsylvania had a lower proportion of transportation to other uses debt ratio compared to Maryland but had a total debt that was nearly three times that of Maryland’s. Transportation investment debt reached over $30 million in Pennsylvania by 1841.&lt;ref name=data&gt;U.S. Congress, House of Representatives( 1843b) Report No. 296, 27th Congress, 3rd Session&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midwest States===
The Midwest states were also borrowing to increase transportation infrastructure, similar to the Northern States, but railroads were the prime mode of transportation in the Midwest in this period. Canals were also being established at this time. Nearly all of the Mid-western state debts were incurred for transportation uses. The Midwest states borrowed on a much smaller scale than Pennsylvania and Maryland, reaching about $37 million, total, between Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio.&lt;ref name=data /&gt;

===Southern States===
The Southern states were much different in the means of borrowing compared to the rest of the nation. At the time, the Southern banking system was small and insignificant compared to that in the North. United States bonds were issued to both foreign and domestic parties to raise capital. The raised capital was used to fund new banks and to allow already established banks the capital to grow upon.&lt;ref name= data /&gt;

==Causes of Collapse and Bankruptcies==
In 1836, the [[Bank of England]] decided to tighten the loaning of credit both domestically and to foreign parties to help increase dwindling reserves of monetary value held in the banks. Due to an open free trade economy domestic banks were forced to follow the interest rate changes made in England in fear of falling behind in competition.&lt;ref&gt;Temin, Peter (1969). The Jacksonian Economy. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. pp. 122–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Demand for cotton plummeted, by early 1837 the price of cotton was down 25%. Much of the nation, especially the South, was heavily dependent on trade of agriculture. Unstable crop prices had devastating effects in the South at the time.&lt;ref name=jenks /&gt; Overall the tightening of credit had a widespread devastating effect in the United States because the infrastructure investment projects, brought about by large inflows of capital from Europe, were left unfinished and without further funding.

==Effects==
The tightening of credit from European parties led to many unfinished and unfunded infrastructure investment projects in the United States. Canals in Pennsylvania and Maryland were unfinished along with many railroads in the Midwest. Southern banks soon failed and bonds were unable to be paid back in full across the country.

===Northern States===
Both Pennsylvania and Maryland borrowed heavily from European sources to fund canals connecting their ports to the Midwest and both could not make the interest payments early in the 1840s, due to the Panic of 1837, and had to declare bankruptcy. Both states were well populated and relatively wealthy for the time so after a few tries they were able to raise their taxes to a point sustainable and were able to continue payment on loans relatively quickly.&lt;ref name=jenks /&gt;&lt;ref name=kettell&gt;Kettell, Thomas P. "State Debts." Hunt's Merchants Magazine, November 1847a, 17(5), pp. 466-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midwest States===
The Midwest states including Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan borrowed funds to build transportation infrastructure in the form of railroads and canals. With the tightening of funding from foreign sources most investment opportunities collapsed and only Ohio was able to avoid defaulting on loans. Indiana and Illinois were able to reach agreements with lenders to continue funding of the projects if payments were still met along with some speculations. Illinois deeded the Illinois and Michigan canal to their creditors as payment and Indiana agreed to pay half the debts while the Wabash and Erie canals were held in trust to pay the rest. Michigan followed similar procedures as Illinois and Indiana but agreements forced them to only pay a fraction of the total debts.&lt;ref name=jenks/&gt;&lt;ref name= kettell/&gt;

===Southern States===
Most Southern states felt similar effects causing bankruptcies in 1841. The many banks that had been established as a means of expanding Southern banking failed at an alarmingly high rate. Courts ruled that the states were not responsible for bonds issued to banks but were responsible for any bonds issued directly by the states. Many banks had large sums of debt and no way to pay for it. Quite often bonds issued and backed by banks were done outside of regulation standards giving banks a means to repudiate their debts. Debt repayment or repudiation was split among the states. Some states such as Louisiana and Arkansas liquidated the banks to pay off debts while states like Mississippi and Florida refused to pay their debts in full.&lt;ref name=jenks /&gt;&lt;ref name= kettell/&gt;

===September===
The referendum held on 26 September had a single topic, namely the revision of [[unemployment benefits]]. The centre and right-wing parties were in favour of the revision, which was undertaken to reduce the debt of the ALV, while the left-wing parties were against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vimentis.ch/d/publikation/188/Abstimmung+26.09.2010%3A+Revision+der+Arbeitslosenversicherung.html Abstimmung 26.09.2010: Revision der Arbeitslosenversicherung] Vimentis&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was approved by 53.4% of voters, although only the German-speaking cantons (all of them except [[Basel-Stadt]], which was against it with 50.4%) approved it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/sanierung_arbeitslosenversicherung_1.7689573.html Deutschschweizer Stimmvolk bringt den Durchbruch] NZZ, 26 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/roestigraben_beim_abstimmungsresultat_1.7705277.html Und wieder klafft der Röstigraben] NZZ, 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===November===
The referendum held on 28 November had two issues:
{{anchor|Ausschaffungsinitiative}}
* ''«Für die Ausschaffung krimineller Ausländer»'' ("For the deportation of [[ Immigrant criminality|criminal foreigners]]"), proposed by the [[Swiss People's Party]], as well as a counterproposal by the other partes; and
* ''«Steuergerechtigkeits-Initiative»'' ("Taxation justice [[Federal popular initiative|initiative]]") for higher taxes on high incomes and property as well as the introduction of a minimum cantonal tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/eidgenoessische_abstimmung_vom_28_november_2010_2.46954 Eidgenössische Abstimmung vom 28. November 2010] NZZ&lt;/ref&gt;

The SVP's [[federal popular initiative]] on deportation was accepted with 52.2% and a majority of cantons in favour, while the counterproposal failed with only 44.5% in favour. Whilst it was not required, the tie-breaker showed a majority of voters against but a majority of cantons for. On February 28, 2016, [[Swiss referendums, 2016#February referendums|a follow-up initiative]], also launched by the SVP, was rejected by voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raaflaub |first=Christian |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/-initiative_literal-implementation-causes-controversy/41863564 |title=Deportation initiative back before voters - SWI |website=Swissinfo.ch |date=2016-01-06 |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens |first=Thomas |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/february-28-vote_fate-of-foreign-criminals-hangs-in-voters--hands/41984634 |title=Swiss voters reject hardline initiative on criminal foreigners - SWI |website=Swissinfo.ch |date=2016-02-28 |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Set"&gt;{{cite web | title=Foreign Criminal Expulsion Law Set for October | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/2010-initiative_foreign-criminal-expulsion-law-set-for-october/42001678 | date=March 4, 2016 | publisher=''[[Swissinfo]]'' | accessdate=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deportation initiative went in effect on October 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="Set"/&gt;

HOLLAND, [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=10666088 Court: Sexually dangerous can be kept in prison], [[Associated Press]]. Retrieved 5-16-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, introduced by the [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]], was upheld against a challenge that it fell outside the [[enumerated powers]] granted to [[United States Congress|Congress]] by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The decision did not rule on any other aspect of the law's constitutionality, because only the particular issue of Congressional authority was properly before the Court.&lt;ref name="scotuspdf"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1224.pdf |title=08-1224 United States v.

== Background ==
Six days before Graydon Earl Comstock was to have completed a 37-month sentence for receiving [[child pornography]], Attorney General [[Alberto R. Gonzales]] certified that Comstock was a [[sexually dangerous person]]. The law that Attorney General Gonzales was applying was ruled unconstitutional by lower courts on the grounds it exceeded Congress’s constitutional authority.
Argued in January 2010 by [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Elena Kagan]], the position of the United States was that the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] gave Congress the power to enact the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/us/politics/18offenders.html Justices Rule That Sex Offenders May Be Held After Their Sentences End], nytimes.com, by Adam Liptak, May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decision ==
[[Stephen Breyer]] delivered the opinion of the Court, which decided that the "Necessary and Proper" Clause permitted Congress to enact such a provision. John Roberts, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor joined Breyer's opinion. Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito filed opinions concurring in the judgment. Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion in which Antonin Scalia joined in all but Part III– A–1–b.&lt;ref name="scotuspdf"/&gt;

=== Five considerations ===
The Court said: "We base this conclusion on five considerations, taken together." The five considerations are as follows.  
* First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress broad power to enact laws that are "rationally related" and "reasonably adapted" to executing the other enumerated powers.  
* Second, the statute at issue "constitutes a modest addition" to related statutes that have existed for many decades.  
* Third, the statute in question reasonably extends longstanding policy. 
* Fourth, the statute properly accounts for state interests, by ending the federal government's role "with respect to an individual covered by the statute" whenever a state requests.  
* Fifth, the statute is narrowly tailored to only address the legitimate federal interest.
