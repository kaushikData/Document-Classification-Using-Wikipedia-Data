"'''25 Minutes to Go'''" is a song by [[Shel Silverstein]], from his 1962 album ''Inside Folk Songs''.&lt;ref name="allmusic-album"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Folk Songs - Shel Silverstein {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/inside-folk-songs-mw0000494004|website=AllMusic|accessdate=10 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130025053/http://www.allmusic.com/album/inside-folk-songs-mw0000494004|archivedate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==
The song is literally "[[gallows humor]]", as it is sung by a man awaiting his own execution by hanging. Each verse consists of two lines, of which the first line is anything from humorous to poignant, and the second line is a minute-by-minute countdown.

:Well they're buildin' the gallows outside my cell. 
:I got 25 minutes to go.

:And in 25 minutes I'll be in hell. 
:I got 24 minutes to go.

The song is similar in concept to Silverstein's children's song "Boa Constrictor": It presents the point of view of someone who is experiencing a calamity in "real time," composing and singing as the events unfold, with a fatal conclusion. "Boa Constrictor", like "25 Minutes to Go", appeared on Silverstein's 1962 album ''Inside Folk Songs''.&lt;ref name="allmusic-album" /&gt;

'''Artificial grammar learning''' ('''AGL''') is a paradigm of study within [[cognitive psychology]] and [[linguistics]]. Its goal is to investigate the processes that underlie human [[language learning]] by testing subjects' ability to learn a made-up grammar in a laboratory setting. It was developed to evaluate the processes of human language learning but has also been utilized to study [[implicit learning]] in a more general sense. The area of interest is typically the subjects' ability to detect patterns and statistical regularities during a training phase and then use their new knowledge of those patterns in a testing phase. The testing phase can either use the symbols or sounds used in the training phase or transfer the patterns to another set of symbols or sounds as surface structure.

Many researchers propose that the rules of the artificial grammar are learned on an implicit level since the rules of the grammar are never explicitly presented to the participants.  The paradigm has also recently been utilized for other areas of research such as [[language learning aptitude]], structural priming &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Michelle|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|last3=Pine|first3=Julian M.|last4=Blything|first4=Ryan|last5=Rowland|first5=Caroline F.|date=2015-05|title=When and how do children develop knowledge of verb argument structure? Evidence from verb bias effects in a structural priming task|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2014.12.002|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=81|pages=1–15|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2014.12.002|issn=0749-596X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to investigate which brain structures are involved in [[syntax]] acquisition and implicit learning.

Apart from humans, the paradigm has also been used to investigate pattern learning in other species, e.g. [[cottontop tamarin]]s and [[starlings]].

==History==
More than half a century ago [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]]&lt;ref name="Miller, 1958"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=G.A.|title=Free recall of redundant strings of letters.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1958|volume=56|issue=6|pages=485–491|doi=10.1037/h0044933}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the paradigm of artificial grammar learning in order to investigate the influence of explicit grammar structures on human learning, he designed a grammar model of letters with different sequences. His research demonstrated that it was easier to remember a structured grammar sequence than a random sequence of letters. His explanation was that learners could identify the common characteristics between learned sequences and accordingly encode them to a memory set. He predicted that subjects could identify which letters will most likely appear together as a sequence repeatedly and which letters would not and that the subjects would use this information to form memory sets. Those memory sets served participants as a strategy later on during their memory tests.

Reber&lt;ref name="Reber, 1967" /&gt; doubted Miller's explanation. He claimed that if participants could encode the grammar rules as productive memory sets, then they should be able to verbalize their strategy in detail. He conducted research that led to the development of the modern AGL paradigm. This research used a synthetic grammar learning model to test implicit learning. AGL became the most used and tested model in the field. As in the original paradigm developed by Miller, participants were asked to memorize a list of letter strings which were created from an artificial grammar rule model. It was only during the test phase that participants were told that there was a set of rules behind the letter sequences they memorized. They were then instructed to categorize new letter strings based on the same set of rules which they had not previously been exposed to. They classified new letter strings as "grammatical" (constructed from the grammar rule), vs. "randomly constructed" sequences. If subjects correctly sorted the new strings above chance level, it could be inferred that subjects had acquired the grammatical rule structure without any explicit instruction of the rules. Reber&lt;ref name="Reber, 1967" /&gt; found that participants sorted out new strings above chance level. While they reported using strategies during the sorting task, they could not actually verbalize those strategies. Subjects could identify which strings were grammatically correct but could not identify the rules that composed grammatical strings.

This research was replicated and expanded upon by many others.&lt;ref name="Mathews et al., 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=R.C.|author2=Buss, R. R.|author3=Stanley, W. B.|author4=Blanchard-Fields, F.|author5=Cho, J. R.|author6=Druhan, B.|title=Role of implicit and explicit  processes in learning from examples: A synergistic effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1989|volume=15|pages=1083–1100|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.6.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooks &amp; Vokey, 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=L.R.|author2=Vokey, J.R.|title=Abstract analogies and abstracted grammars: Comments on Reber (1989) and Mathews et al.

These studies also identified common characteristics for the implicitly acquired knowledge:

#Abstract representation for the set of rules.
#Unconscious strategies that can be tested with performance.

== The modern paradigm ==

The modern AGL paradigm can be used to investigate explicit and implicit learning, although it is most often used to test implicit learning. In a typical AGL experiment, participants are required to memorize strings of letters previously generated by a specific [[grammar]]. The length of the strings usually ranges from 2-9 letters per string. An example of such a grammar is shown in figure 1.

[[File:Artificial grammar learning example.jpg|framed|center]]

Figure 1: '''Example of an artificial grammar rule'''
* Ruleful strings:'''VXVS, TPTXVS'''  Unruleful strings:'''VXXXS, TPTPS'''

In order to compose a grammatically "ruleful" string of letters, according to the predetermined grammar rule, a subject must follow the rules for the pairing of letters as represented in the model (figure 1). When observing a violation of the grammatical rule system that composes the string, it is considered an "unruleful" or randomly constructed string.

In the case of a standard AGL implicit learning task,&lt;ref name="Reber, 1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|title=Implicit learning of artificial grammars.|journal=Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|year=1967|volume=5|issue=6|pages=855–863|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(67)80149-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; subjects are not told that the strings are based on a specific grammar. Instead, they are simply given the task to memorize the letter strings for a memory. After the learning phase, subjects are told that the letter strings presented during the learning phase were based on specific rules, but are not explicitly told what the rules are. During a test phase, the subjects are instructed to categorize new letter strings as "ruleful" or "unruleful". The dependent variable usually measured is the percentage of correctly categorized strings. Implicit learning is considered to be successful when the percentage of correctly sorted strings is significantly higher than chance level. If this significant difference is found, it indicates the existence of a learning process that is more involved than memorizing the presented letter strings.&lt;ref name="Seger, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seger|first=C.A.|title=Implicit learning.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1994|volume=115|issue=2|pages=163–196|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.2.163|pmid=8165269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bayesian learning==
The mechanism behind the implicit learning that is hypothesized to occur while people engage in artificial grammar learning is [[statistical learning]] or, more specifically, [[Bayesian learning]]. Bayesian learning takes into account types of biases or "prior probability distributions" individuals have that contribute to the outcome of implicit learning tasks. These biases can be thought of as a probability distribution that contains the probability that each possible hypothesis is likely to be correct. Due to the structure of the [[Bayesian model]], the inferences output by the model are in the form of a probability distribution rather than a single most probable event. This output distribution is a "posterior probability distribution". The posterior probability of each hypothesis in the original distribution is the probability of the hypothesis being true given the data and the probability of data given the hypothesis is true.&lt;ref name="Kapatsinski, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapatsinski|first=V.|title=The Architecture of Grammar in Artificial Grammar Learning: Formal Biases in the Acquisition of Morphophonology and the Nature of the Learning Task.|journal=Indiana University|year=2009|pages=1–260|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/ef2c4969c167d0581a932fe2fcfd5fff/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This Bayesian model for learning is fundamental for understanding the pattern detection process involved in implicit learning and, therefore, the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of artificial grammar learning rules. It is hypothesized that the implicit learning of grammar involves predicting co-occurrences of certain words in a certain order. For example,  "the dog chased the ball" is a sentence that can be learned as grammatically correct on an implicit level due to the high co-occurrence of "chase" being one of the words to follow "dog". A sentence like "the dog cat the ball" is implicitly recognized as grammatically incorrect due to the lack of utterances that contain those words paired in that specific order. This process is important for teasing apart thematic roles and parts of speech in grammatical processing (see [[grammar]]). While the labeling of the thematic roles and parts of speech is explicit, the identification of words and parts of speech is implicit.

==Explanatory models==

Traditional approaches to AGL claim that the stored knowledge obtained during the learning phase is abstract.&lt;ref name="Reber, 1967" /&gt; Other approaches&lt;ref name="Brooks &amp; Vokey, 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vokey &amp; Brooks, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vokey|first=J.R.|author2=Brooks, L.R.|title=Salience of item knowledge in learning artificial grammar.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1992|volume=18|pages=328–344|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.18.2.328}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that this stored knowledge is concrete and consists of [[wikt:exemplar|exemplars]] of strings encountered during the learning phase or "chunks" of these exemplars.&lt;ref name="Perruchet &amp; Pacteau, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Servan-Schreiber &amp; Anderson, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Servan-Schreiber|first=E.|author2=Anderson, J.R.|title=Chunking as a mechanism of implicit learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1990|volume=16|pages=592–608|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.16.4.592}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, it is assumed that the information stored in memory is retrieved in the test phase and is used to aid decisions about letter strings.&lt;ref name="Pothos, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pothos|first=E.M.|title=Theories of artificial grammar learning|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=227–244|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poznanski &amp; Tzelgov, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poznanski|first=Y.|author2=Tzelgov, J.|title=What is implicit in implicit artificial grammar learning?|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2010|volume=63|pages=1495–2015|doi=10.1080/17470210903398121}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
3 main approaches attempt to explain the AGL phenomena:
 
# ''Abstract Approach'': According to this traditional approach, participants acquire an abstract representation of the artificial grammar rule in the learning stage. That abstract structure helps them to decide if the new string presented during the test phase is grammatical or randomly constructed.&lt;ref name="Reber, 1969"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|title=Transfer of syntactic structure in syntactic languages|journal=Experimental Psychology|year=1969|volume=81|pages=115–119|doi=10.1037/h0027454}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Concrete knowledge approach'': This approach proposes that during the learning stage participants learn specific examples of strings and store them in their memory. During the testing stage, participants do not sort the new strings according to an abstract rule; instead they will sort them according to their similarity to the examples stored in memory from the learning stage. There are multiple opinions concerning how concrete the learned knowledge really is. Brooks &amp; Vokey&lt;ref name="Brooks &amp; Vokey, 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vokey &amp; Brooks, 1992" /&gt;  argue that all of the knowledge stored in memory is represented as concrete examples of the full examples studied during the learning stage. The strings are sorted during the testing stage according to a full representation of the string examples from the learning stage. On the other hand, Perruchet &amp; Pacteau&lt;ref name="Perruchet &amp; Pacteau, 1990" /&gt; claimed that the knowledge of the strings from the learning stage is stored in the form of "memory chunks" where 2 - 3 letters are learned as a sequence along with knowledge about their permitted location in the full string.&lt;ref name="Perruchet &amp; Pacteau, 1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Servan-Schreiber &amp; Anderson, 1990" /&gt;
# ''Dual Factor approach'': Dual process learning model, combines the approaches described above. This approach proposes that a person will rely on concrete knowledge when they can. When they cannot rely on concrete knowledge (for example on a [[transfer of learning]] task), the person will use abstract knowledge of the rules.&lt;ref name="Mathews et al., 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McAndrews &amp; Moscovitch, 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=M.P.|author2=Moscovitch, M.|title=Rule-based and exemplar-based classification in artificial grammar learning|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1985|volume=13|pages=469–475|doi=10.3758/bf03198460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reber, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|title=Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1989|volume=118|pages=219–235|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.118.3.219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reber &amp; Allen, 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=A.S.|author2=Allen, R.|title=Analogic abstraction strategies in synthetic grammar learning: A functionalist interpretation|journal=Cognition|year=1978|volume=6|pages=189–221|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(78)90013-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research with [[amnesia]] patients suggests the "Dual Factor approach" may be the most accurate model.&lt;ref name="Knowlton &amp; Squire, 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knowlton|first=B.J.|author2=Squire, L.R.|title=Artificial Grammar Learning Depends on Implicit Acquisition of Both Abstract and Exemplar-Specific Information|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=1|pages=169–181|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.1.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experiments with amnesiac patients support the idea that AGL involves both abstract concepts and concrete exemplars. Amnesiacs were able to classify stimuli as "grammatical" vs. "randomly constructed" just as well as participants in the control group. While able to successfully complete the task, amnesiacs were not able to explicitly recall grammatical "chunks" of the letter sequence while the control group was able to explicitly recall them. When performing the task with the same grammar rules but a different sequence of letters than those that they were previously tested on, both amnesiacs and the control group were able to complete the task (although performance was better when the task was completed using the same set of letters used for training). The results of the experiment support the dual factor approach to artificial grammar learning in that people use abstract information to learn rules for grammars and use concrete, exemplar-specific memory for chunks. Since the amnesiacs were unable to store specific "chunks" in memory, they completed the task using an abstract set of rules. The control group was able to store these specific chunks in memory and (as evidenced by recall) did store these examples in memory for later reference.

==Automaticity debate==

AGL research has been criticized due to the "automatic question": Is AGL considered to be an automatic process? During encoding (see [[encoding (memory)]]), performance can be automatic in the sense of occurring without conscious monitoring (without conscious guidance by the performer’s intentions). In the case of AGL, it was claimed that implicit learning is an automatic process due to the fact that it is done with no intention of learning a specific grammar rule.&lt;ref name="Reber, 1967" /&gt; This complies with the classic definition of an "automatic process" as a fast, unconscious, effortless process that may start unintentionally. When aroused, it continues until it is over without the ability to stop or ignore its consequences.&lt;ref name="Hasher &amp; Zacks, 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hasher|first=L.|author2=Zacks, R.|title=Automatic and effortful processes in memory|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|year=1979|volume=108|pages=356–388|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.108.3.356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider, Dumais &amp; Shiffrin, 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=W. |author2=Dumais, S.

Alternative definitions for automatic process have been given.&lt;ref name="Tzelgov, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tzelgov|first=J.|title=Automaticity and processing without awareness|journal=Psyche|year=1999|volume=5|url=http://journalpsyche.org/files/0xaa5a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan, 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Logan|first=G.D.|title=Attention and automaticity in Stroop and priming tasks: Theory and data|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1980|volume=12|pages=523–553|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan, 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Logan|first=G.D.|title=Executive control of thought and action|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=1985|volume=60|pages=193–210|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(85)90055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reber's presumption that AGL is automatic could be problematic by implying that an unintentional process is an automatic process in its essence. 
When focusing on AGL tests, a few issues need to be addressed. The process is complex and contains encoding and [[recall (memory)|recall]] or retrieval. Both encoding and retrieval could be interpreted as automatic processes since what was encoded during the learning stage is not necessary for the task intentionally performed during the test stage.&lt;ref name="Perlman &amp; Tzelgov, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perlman|first=A.|author2=Tzelgov, J.|title=Interaction between encoding and retrieval in the domain of sequence learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2006|volume=32|pages=118–130|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.32.1.118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers need to differentiate between implicitness as referring to the process of learning or knowledge encoding and also as referring to performance during the test phase or knowledge retrieval. Knowledge encoded during training may include many aspects of the presented stimuli (whole strings, relations among elements, etc.). The contribution of the various components to performance depends on both the specific instruction in the acquisition phase and the requirements of the retrieval task.&lt;ref name="Poznanski &amp; Tzelgov, 2010" /&gt; Therefore, the instructions on every phase are important in order to determine whether or not each stage will require automatic processing. Each phase should be evaluated for automaticity separately.

One hypothesis that contradicts the automaticity of AGL is the "mere exposure effect". The mere exposure effect is increased affect towards a stimulus that is the result of nonreinforced, repeated exposure to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Manza, Zizak &amp; Reber, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manza|first=L. |author2=Zizak, D. |author3=Reber, A.S.|title=Artificial grammar learning and the mere exposure effect: Emotional preference tasks and the implicit learning process|journal=In Stadler, M.A. &amp; Frensch, P.A. (Eds.), Handbook of implicit learning|year=1998|volume=Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.|pages=201–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from over 200 experiments on this effect indicate that there is a positive relationship between mean "goodness" rating and frequency of stimulus exposure. Stimuli for these experiments included line drawings, polygons and nonsense words (which are types of stimuli used in AGL research). These experiments exposed participants to each stimulus up to 25 times. Following each exposure participants were asked to rate the degree to which each stimulus suggested "good" vs. "bad" affect on a 7-point scale. In addition to the main pattern of results, it was also found in several experiments that participants rated higher positive affect for previously exposed items than for novel items. Since [[implicit cognition]] should not reference previous study episodes, the effects on affect ratings should not have been observed if processing of this stimuli is truly implicit. The results of these experiments suggests that different categorization of the strings may occur due to differences in affect associated with the strings and not due to implicitly learned grammar rules.

==Artificial intelligence==

Since the advent of computers and [[artificial intelligence]], computer programs have been adapted that attempt to simulate the implicit learning process observed in the AGL paradigm. The AI programs first adapted to simulate both natural and artificial grammar learning used the following basic structure:

;Given: A set of grammatical sentences from some language.

;Find: A procedure for recognizing and/or generating all grammatical sentences in that language.

An early model for AI grammar learning is Wolff's SNPR System.&lt;ref name="WOLFF1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolff | first1 = J.G. | year = 1982 | title = Language acquisition, data compression and generalization | url = http://www.cognitionresearch.org/papers/ll/lang_comm_1982/wolff_1982.doc | journal = Language &amp; Communication | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 57–89 | doi = 10.1016/0271-5309(82)90035-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacWhinney, 1987" /&gt; The program acquires a series of letters with no pauses or punctuation between words and sentences. The program then examines the string in subsets and looks for common sequences of symbols and defines "chunks" in terms of these sequences (these chunks are akin to the exemplar-specific chunks described for AGL). As the model acquires these chunks through exposure, the chunks begin to replace the sequences of unbroken letters. When a chunk precedes or follows a common chunk, then the model determines disjunctive classes in terms of the first set.&lt;ref name="MacWhinney, 1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacWhinney|first=B.|title=Mechanisms of language acquisition|year=1987|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Hillsdale, NJ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-XJAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when the model encounters "the-dog-chased" and "the-cat-chased" it classifies "dog" and "cat" as being members of the same class since they both precede "chase". While the model sorts chunks into classes, it does explicitly define these groups (e.g., noun, verb). Early AI models of grammar learning such as these ignored the importance of negative instances of grammar's effect on grammar acquisition and were also lacking in the ability to connect grammatical rules to [[pragmatics]] and [[semantics]]. Newer models have attempted to factor these details in.
The Unified Model&lt;ref name="MacWhinney, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacWhinney|first=B.|title=A Unified Model|journal=In Robinson, P. &amp; Ellis, N. (Eds.), Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics and Second Language Acquisition|year=2008|volume=Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to take both of these factors into account. The model breaks down grammar according to "cues". Languages mark case roles using five possible cue types: word order, case marking, agreement, intonation and verb-based expectation (see [[grammar]]). The influence that each cue has over a language's grammar is determined by its "cue strength" and "cue validity". Both of these values are determined using the same formula, except that cue strength is defined through experimental results and cue validity is defined through corpus counts from language databases. The formula for cue strength/validity is as follows:

: Cue strength/cue validity = cue availability * cue reliability

Cue availability is the proportion of times that the cue is available over the times that it is needed. Cue reliability is the proportion of times that the cue is correct over the total occurrences of the cue. By incorporating cue reliability along with cue availability, The Unified Model is able to account for the effects of negative instances of grammar since it takes accuracy and not just frequency into account. As a result, this also accounts for the semantic and pragmatic information since cues that do not produce grammar in the appropriate context will have low cue strength and cue validity. While MacWhinney's model&lt;ref name="MacWhinney, 2008" /&gt; also simulates natural grammar learning, it attempts to model the implicit learning processes observed in the AGL paradigm.

==Cognitive neuroscience and the AGL paradigm==

Contemporary studies with AGL have attempted to identify which structures are involved in the acquisition of grammar and implicit learning. Agrammatic aphasic patients (see [[Agrammatism]]) were tested with the AGL paradigm. The results show that breakdown of language in agrammatic aphasia is associated with an impairment in artificial grammar learning, indicating damage to domain-general neural mechanisms sub serving both language and sequential learning.&lt;ref name="Christiansen et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=M.H. |author2=Kelly, M.L. |author3=Shillcock, R.C. |author4=Greenfield, K.|title=Impaired artificial grammar learning in agrammatism|journal=Cognition|year=2010|volume=116|issue=3|pages=383–393|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.015 |pmid=20605017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
De Vries, Barth, Maiworm, Knecht, Zwitserlood &amp; Flöel&lt;ref name="De Vries, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Vries|first=M.H. |author2=Barth, A.C.R. |author3=Maiworm, S. |author4=Knecht, S. |author5=Zwisterlood, P.  |author6=Floel, A.|title=Electrical stimulation of Broca's area enhances implicit learning of artificial grammar|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2010|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2427–2436|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21385}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that electrical stimulation of [[Broca's area]] enhances implicit learning of an artificial grammar. Direct current stimulation may facilitate acquisition of grammatical knowledge, a finding of potential interest for rehabilitation of aphasia.
Petersson, Vasiliki &amp; Hagoort,&lt;ref name="Petersson et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petersson|first=K.M. |author2=Vasiliki, F. |author3=Hagoort, P.|title=What artificial grammar learning reveals about the neurobiology of syntax|journal=Brain &amp; Language|year=2010|pages=340–353|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc%3A101939%3A11/component/escidoc%3A532052/Petersson_What_Artifical_grammar_Brain_Lang_Corrected%20_Proof.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; examine the neurobiological correlates of [[syntax]], the processing of structured sequences, by comparing [[fMRI]] results on artificial and natural language syntax. They argue that the "[[Chomsky hierarchy]]" is not directly relevant for neurobiological systems through AGL testing.

The '''Association for the Protection of the Lebanese Heritage''' or '''APLH''' is a cultural heritage, [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Zouk Mosbeh]], [[Keserwan District]] of [[Mount Lebanon]], [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Mar-21/167419-activists-plan-march-against-hippodrome-reconstruction.ashx#axzz20djNikM0 Alabaster, Olivia., Activists plan march against Hippodrome reconstruction, The Daily Star Lebanon, March 21, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150405000945/http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2010/08/29/RTV2177310/ LEBANON: Historic houses in Beirut are falling victim to a massive building boom despite efforts by Lebanese conservationists, ITN Source, 29 August 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was originally formed in March 2010 by a group of activists on [[Facebook]], officially registered with the [[Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (Lebanon)|Ministry of Interior and Municipalities]] on 13 July 2010. The permit number of the association is 1764. The association aims to preserve and promote historical, cultural and urban heritage within Lebanon (including public spaces), which has come under increased threat of destruction through rampant [[urbanization]], as all are viewed as thoroughly connected to protect Lebanese society by preserving its history and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sfeir, Mia., Femme Magazine - Préhistoire VS Urbanisation, le témoignage d’Henri Fleisch - Issue 206 - P.70 Published June 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of its first activities, the association organized a march and invited fellow activists [[Save Beirut Heritage]] to join the event in [[Gemmayze]] in September 2010 to protest and point out all the sites where heritage buildings had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130219012514/http://m.dailystar.com.lb/Article.aspx?id=120474 NGO hopes to save Beirut, brick by brick, The Daily Star, 23 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/8943 Beirut developers destroy ancient Phoenician port, Al Akbar, 26 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; This candlelight march was followed by several initiatives, which included [[petition]]s, various awareness events and participation in conferences. In 2011, the APLH organized a billboard campaign in Beirut with help from Pikasso, L'Hôte Libanais, and Mr Farid Chehab, the founder of [[advertising agency]] H&amp;C Leo Burnett. During the launch of the campaign in Beirut, the APLH president [[Pascale Ingea]] represented Lebanon at an international forum called “Urban Transformations, Creative Ecosystems and Social Cohesion, European Cultural Policies between Crisis and Development” in [[Ravello]], Italy. The APLH also launched the idea of a community service day, to encourage citizens to be more environmentally responsible. A cleaning day was organized at the [[Maameltein Roman bridge]] which was covered by the [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation]] on its program "Helwa Beirut". Since 2012 the APLH saw most of its efforts focused on [[Demonstration (people)|public demonstration]]s, scientific research, technical studies, legal complaints and lawsuits to protest and protect such archaeological sites as the [[Beirut Hippodrome|Roman Hippodrome of Beirut]], the Roman Theater of Beirutand site BEY194; slip ways for Phoenician ships, known as the alleged 2nd [[Phoenician port of Beirut]] and the Early Bronze Age (c.3200-2400 BC) Canaanite city at Tell Fadous – Kfardebian / Batroun - North Lebanon, as well as traditional buildings like “Medawar Villa” known as “Amin Maalouf House”, and to face inappropriate urban projects like “Fouad Boutros Highway”, with aiming to protect green areas like “Jesuit Public Garden” and marine public zones like “Daliet El Raouche” and “Ramlet El Baida”.&lt;ref name="Alabaster"&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Travel-and-Tourism/2011/Nov-09/153409-ngo-petitions-to-protect-alleged-phoenician-wall.ashx#axzz20djNikM0 Alabaster, Olicia., "NGO petitions to protect alleged Phoenician wall", The Daily Star, 9 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=415856 |title="Behind the destruction of Beirut’s heritage" Shane Farrell, Now Lebanon, 4 July 2012. |access-date=2012-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717150603/http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=415856 |archive-date=2012-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president of the association is [[Pascale Ingea]] with [[Nadine Maatouk-Haddad]] as current vice-president, [[Josef Haddad]] as current secretary and Mireille Haddad as current accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Article.aspx?id=178652#axzz20djNikM0 Salhani, Justin., Archaeological report: Razed ruins not Phoenician port, The Daily Star Lebanon, 29 June 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Ingea and Haddad, Jad Mhanna was also a founding member and [[Raja Noujaim]], sites officer acts as an official APLH representative.

Interviewed by the [[Daily Star (Lebanon)]], Ingea stressed the non-partisan nature of the association, saying ''““The contractors have a lot of power” and “there’s a lot of politics involved,”''. Speaking of the challenges facing the conservation of Lebanese heritage sites, she added ''“Culture must lead to the development of the city: In any other country of the world it is unacceptable just to cut out archaeology. It’s important that we Lebanese know that we have voices, and that we recognize that we cannot allow our history and our identity to disappear in this way.”''&lt;ref name="Alabaster"/&gt;

On October 2, 2015 the APLH launched its first media-book detailing the history of the Chehab Palace. The palace which became in the late 1950s the Spanish Embassy in Beirut, represents an important part of the Lebanese heritage. The Mediabook, entitled [http://www.protect-lebaneseheritage.com/blog/2015/10/04/the-aplh-launches-its-first-book-le-palais-chehab/ Palais Chehab]  was produced with help from the Spanish Embassy in Beirut and published in house by the APLH through its editorial branch, Chroniques Du Liban.

Facing the systematic destruction of Lebanese Heritage and the deliberate procrastination in voting
a heritage protection Law in the Lebanese Parliament, the APLH devised the [https://lebaneseheritage.crowdmap.com/main/ APLH Heritage Crowdmap]:a free online site map of the Lebanese territory linked to google earth, and which enables any citizen to register
undocumented Lebanese Heritage sites in their vicinity, as well as alert the APLH about illegal demolitions.
All entries are then moderated and approved by the APLH prior to going online. The APLH Heritage Crowdmap
is an innovation on the Lebanese and Middle Eastern scale, allowing the safeguarding of Lebanese memory
(as archaeology and traditional buildings) in the wake of the deliberate corruption and lack of political will
endangering Lebanese Cultural and Historical Identity.

'''Bhoja II''' was a 13th-century king of the [[Paramara dynasty]] in central India. He succeeded [[Arjunavarman II|Arjuna II]] as the king of [[Dhar]]a in [[Malwa]] region.

According to ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'', written by the Jain poet Nayachandra Suri, the [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|Chahmana]] ruler [[Hammiradeva|Hammira]] defeated Arjuna of Sarasapura and Bhoja of Dhara. Based on this, [[R. C. Majumdar]] concluded that Hammira must have invaded Malwa twice: once during the reign of Arjuna II, and again, during the reign of Bhoja II.{{sfn|Majumdar|1966|pp=85-86}} Because Hammira ascended the Chauhan throne during 1282-83, Bhoja must have ascended the Paramara throne sometime after 1283 CE.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|p=828}}

Pratipal Bhatia, on the other hand, speculates that Arjuna II's minister Goga-deva rebelled against him, and put Bhoja II on the throne of Dhara as a titular king. The 16th-century historian [[Firishta]] describes Goga as the "Raja of Malwa". According to Bhatia's theory, Goga-deva became the ''de facto'' independent ruler of one part of the Paramara kingdom, while Arjuna II continued to control another part.{{sfn|Bhatia|1970|p=160}}

Bhoja II was succeeded by [[Mahlakadeva]].{{sfn|Majumdar|1966|pp=853}}

The '''''Book of Henryków''''' ({{lang-pl|Księga henrykowska}}, {{lang-la|Liber fundationis claustri Sancte Marie Virginis in Heinrichau}}) is a [[Latin]] chronicle of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey in [[Henryków, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Henryków]] in [[Lower Silesia]]. Originally created as a registry of belongings looted during the [[Mongol raids]] of 1241, with time it was extended to include the history of the monastery. It is notable as the earliest document to include a sentence written entirely in what can be interpreted as an [[Old Polish language]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Kent]], Harold Lancour, Jay E. Daily, ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science'', CRC Press, 1978, pg. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tmnVublw2pwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Book+of+Henryk%C3%B3w+Polish&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=pl#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pod"&gt;Barbara i Adam Podgórscy: Słownik gwar śląskich. Katowice: Wydawnictwo KOS, 2008, page 12. {{ISBN|978-83-60528-54-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the book is on exhibition in the Archdiocesan Museum in [[Wrocław]]. October 9, 2015 ''Book of Henryków'' entered in the list of [[UNESCO]] "[[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World]]".

The first part of the 100-page-long book is devoted to the early history of the abbey, from its foundation by [[Henry the Bearded]] in 1227 until 1259. The second part includes the later history until 1310. In the record for 1270 a settler from the nearby village is reported to say to his wife "Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai", which could be roughly translated as "Let me, I shall grind, and you take a rest".

The circumstances under which this sentence was written closely reflected the cultural and literary conditions in Poland in the first centuries of its national existence. It appeared in a Latin chronicle, written by a German abbot. The man who reportedly uttered the sentence almost one hundred years earlier was Bogwal, a Czech (Bogwalus Boemus), a local settler and subject of [[Bolesław the Tall]], as he felt compassion for his local wife, who "very often stood grinding by the [[quern-stone]]". The local village, [[Brukalice]], came to be named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17863">'''Cognitive valence theory''' ('''CVT''') is a theoretical framework that describes and explains the process of intimacy exchange within a dyad relationship. [[Peter A. Andersen]],{{Who?|date=November 2015}} PhD created the cognitive valence theory to answer questions regarding intimacy relationships among colleagues, close friends and intimate friends, married couples and family members.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy or immediacy behavior is that behavior that provides closeness or distance within a dyad relationship. Closeness projects a positive feeling in a relationship, and distance projects a negative feeling within a relationship. Intimacy or immediacy behavior can be ''negatively valenced'' or ''positively valenced''.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valence (psychology)|Valence]], associated with [[physics]], is used here to describe the degree of negativity or positivity in expected information. If your partner perceives your actions as negative, then the interaction may repel your partner away from you. If your partner perceives your actions as positive, then the interaction may be accepted and may encourage closeness. Affection and intimacy promotes positive valence in a relationship. CVT uses non-verbal and verbal communications criteria to analyze behavioral situations.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive valence theory: the focus of CVT==

CVT focuses on how intimate relationships are initiated and why only a few relationships are extended past initial contact.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; CVT employs six factors or [[schema (psychology)|schemata]] to explain verbal and non-verbal intimacy behaviors, interpersonal perceptions, physiological arousal, social cognition and relational outcomes within a specified relationship.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1985, pp. 1-36"&gt;Andersen, 1985, pp. 1–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1989, np"&gt;Andersen, 1989, np&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1998, pp. 39-72"&gt;Andersen, 1998, pp. 39–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, pp. 228-237"&gt;Andersen, 1999, pp. 228–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp.181–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 512-514&lt;/ref&gt; CVT utilizes six types of schemata that regulate interpersonal interaction: culture, personality, interpersonal valence, situation, state, and the relationship.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1985, pp. 1-36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1989, np"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1998, pp. 39-72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, pp. 228-237"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp.181–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517&lt;/ref&gt; Each schema explores intimacy or immediacy behavior when interlaced with human emotion. CVT focuses on these six schemata in relations to moderate levels of arousal in human emotions. Moderate levels of arousal are acceptable in a dyad relationship, but high levels of arousal may cause undue excitement, panic, fear, anger and disorientation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"/&gt;

== Nonverbal and verbal communications ==

[[Nonverbal communication]] is the process of communications by sending and receiving messages without speaking. Intimate relations may be affected by the use of nonverbal communications. Nonverbal communications are transmitted through messaging that utilizes [[haptic communication]]s (touching, hugs, kisses and caressing someone); [[body language]] (physical appearance, posture, gestures and eye contact); [[oculesics]] (or eye behavior, including pupil dilation); [[kinesics]] (facial expressions and receptive contact from others); and [[chronemics]] (time spent with someone else or waiting for someone).&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"/&gt; All these nonverbal behaviors can affect intimacy or immediacy within a relationship.

[[Verbal communication]] or dialogue communications also plays an important part in a dyad relationship. While nonverbal communication provides a forum conducive to wordless conversation, verbal conversation can provide the monologue or dialogue to vocally express personal feelings, emotions and supplement nonverbal actions. However, research has shown that only 7% of all communications is directly related to verbal communications. Research further reports that 38% of communications are by the tone of voice and 55% of communication is determined by body language—posture, gestures and eye contact.&lt;ref name="Mehrabian &amp; Ferris, 1967"&gt;Mehrabian &amp; Ferris, 1967, pp. 248–252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative and positive valence ===

Negative valence behavior is [[nonverbal communication]] transmission of a behavioral feeling or emotion received in a negative manner. The receiver perceives the negative transmission and may repel your contact or interaction. As in physics, negative particles repel which may cause the receiver of the transmission or communication to avoid your contact.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; As the example stated above, initial contact of noticing another person in the grocery store or gas station may not be returned, through an acknowledgement of the initiator’s smile or gesture or the gesture of acknowledgement may purport a stare, frown or other look suggesting “leave me alone” or “not interested.” Intimacy or immediacy may be detrimental to a relationship if that immediacy is negatively accepted by the receiver.

Positive valence behavior is another non-verbal transmission of a behavioral feeling or emotion from one person to another and received in a positive manner. The receiver perceives the positive transmission and may be attracted to that person.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Positive behavior may affect intimacy or immediacy within the dyad relationship, but this positive behavior must be recognized and acknowledged by the receiver or partner.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp. 181–185&lt;/ref&gt; Initial contact within an impending dyad relationship may be as simple as noticing another person in a grocery store or gas station. A first look or glance from the initiator may be returned with a smile or gesture of acknowledgement by the receiver. This gesture may then be returned to the initiator as a positive, and further contact may be encouraged.

== Cognitive schemata ==

Andersen (1993, Planap, 1985) suggests that cognitive schemata or our social knowledge help interpret various social interactions. CVT incorporates these six schemata into the regulation or guidance of interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===

[[Culture]] is the total expression of one’s behavior patterns, arts, values, goals, and practices of a population or community.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary"&gt;Merriam-Webster collegiate dictionary, 2002, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geertz]] (1973) further argues “…this school of thought holds that culture is composed of psychological structures by means of which individuals or groups of individuals guide their behavior”.&lt;ref name="Geertz, 1973"&gt;Geertz, 1973, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Culture plays a definitive role in the formation of human behavior. In some cultures, it is permissible to hold hands; other cultures this open act of compassion is forbidden. Looking or gazing upon another is accepted; other cultures, the eyes are not directed at anyone not of your family. Public affection is acceptable in one country but to kiss, touch or hold someone’s hand is blasphemous. This behavior may be deemed negatively valenced.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===

[[Personality type|Personality]] or [[personality traits]] also affect intimacy or immediacy within a dyad relationship. Just as humans differ in their size, weight and emotional attributes, human personalities differ in their degree of sociability, their likes and dislikes, the level of tolerance towards shyness and openness and their adherence to [[proxemics]] or the distance displaced from one person towards another. Essentially, this is where knowing your partner’s personality is crucial to a happy relationship. This relationship promotes positive valence or misinterpreting your partner’s personality may promote a negative valence.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 513&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal valence ===

Interpersonal Valence can be best described as a nonverbal communication typology. A touch from someone you like is received differently than an unwanted touch. Interpersonal valence has a positive affect for socially and physically attractive people and a negative valence for those not so attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of attraction may be within the initiator’s point of view or may also be perceived from the receiver.

=== State ===
Andersen argues here that [[:wikt:mental state|state]] is the internal, short-term condition affecting communications.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; This form of state suggests that external behavioral situations affect one’s internal behavioral, coping adaptability. Simply, disagreements at home or at the office signal a negative valence of immediacy or intimacy. An argument with your boss or a disrespectful employee may lower your internal coping adaptability, and negative valence emerges. However, one’s acceptance of intimacy or immediacy is higher when positive valence is experienced. A good day at the office, congratulations on the successful completion a special project or a home cooked meal may amplify positive valence and increase immediacy or intimacy.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt;

=== The relationship ===

The relationship is the most important part of the cognitive schemata model.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; Partnership within a dyad has numerous labels. Within relationships ([[interpersonal relationships]]), we label our dyad partners as acquaintances, friends, colleagues, professional coworkers, personal friends, family members, fellow college students and college professors and, those people whose paths cross with ours simply as convenient contacts.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Each dyad partner, whether initial or long-term may display a level of intimacy or immediacy based on a degree of appropriateness for the situation. Public forums are the stage in which positive or negative valence performs. As stated earlier, an unwanted look or a touch may heighten the degree of negative valence. In contrast, a look or an accepted touch may heighten the degree of positive valence and be the most desirable behavior for each of the dyad partners. Relationships are dependent upon both partners and their commitment to the dyad. Relationships therefore are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive Valence Theory or CVT offers one explanation for this fragility. Negative valence received from any of the cognitive schemata can result in a negative relational outcome.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, p. 229"&gt;Andersen, 1999, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Negative valence reduces the intimacy or immediacy strength within a relationship. Negative valence can also thwart healthy dyad growth by heightening the lack of love and care within the dyad. Positive valence acts in a 180 degree fashion as positive feeling promotes growth and strengthens the love and care within the dyad. With positive valence, there can still be risks, but the rewards may outweigh the costs.

=== Valence violations ===

As mentioned above, valence is the degree of positivity or negativity in expected information. Relational outcomes will become negatively valenced when violations occur within the six schemata. Negative valence here can be associated with the amount of relationships we initially form and the amount of relationships that become long lasting.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Andersen’s cognitive valence theory points out (under relational outcome) how violations of any of the six schemata will affect a dyad relationship. Negative violations can result in (1) negative cognitive and affective appraisals of your partner; (2) compensation/reduction intimacy behaviors, and (3) reductions in relational closeness or disengagement.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, p. 229"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; The theory further describes the degree of positivity associated with positive relational outcomes within a dyad relationship. Andersen’s cognitive valence theory also points that (under relational outcome) how positive valenced intimacy can  show (1) positive cognitive and affective appraisals of one’s partner; (2) reciprocity or an increase in intimacy behaviors, and (3) increase in relational growth and closeness.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

[[Expectancy violations theory]] (EVT) focuses on people’s reactions to unexpected human behavior. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics of the communicators.&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; Yuhua, 2007"&gt;McPherson &amp; Yuhua, 2007, pp. 18–33&lt;/ref&gt; EVT requires determining whether one interactant's behavior change qualifies as a positive or negative violation. Within the realm of involvement and immediacy changes, it predicts that (a) unexpected positive behavior by a positively valenced interactant will produce reciprocal behavior, (b) unexpected negative behavior by a positively valenced interactant will produce compensatory behavior, (c) unexpected negative behavior by a negatively valenced interactant will produce reciprocal negative behavior, and (d) unexpected positive behavior by a negatively valenced interactant may produce either reciprocal or compensatory behavior, depending on which is more salient – the valence of the behavior or the valence of the interactant.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"&gt;Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995, pp. 251–279&lt;/ref&gt; The Arousal-Labeling theory (ALT) likewise posits that both compensation and reciprocity may occur, but the focus of this model is on how the undifferentiated arousal engendered by a partner's behavior change is effectively labeled – positive labels producing reciprocity and negative labels producing compensation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt; Discrepancy-Arousal theory (DAT) combines arousal and affect with expectancies, predicting that discrepancies from expected behavior patterns produce arousal change, that moderate arousal change is effectively positive and elicits approach (typically reciprocity), and that high arousal change is effectively negative and elicits avoidance (typically compensation).&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt;

== Conclusion ==

Cognitive valence theory seeks to describe and explain the process of intimacy exchange within a dyad relationship. CVT accomplishes this process through the employment of six schemata: culture, personality, interpersonal valence, situation, state, and the relationship. Intimacy behaviors provide the strength and positivity to generate close, personal friendships. These friendships may be found in the home family, an impending personal relationship and/or marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, 518&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ''if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it''.&lt;ref name="Covey, 2004"&gt;Covey, 2004, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Computers and Writing''''' is the name of a conference as well as a sub-field of [[college]] [[English studies]] whose members are dedicated to the academic study of how [[personal computer|computers]], as well as other, related digital technologies, affect [[literacy]] and the writing process. The range of inquiry in this field is quite broad and can include studies as diverse as works of video game theory to a quantitative study of first-year college students using [[Microsoft Word]]. Some frequently addressed topics include [[hypertext]] theory, [[visual rhetoric]], [[multimedia]] authoring, [[distance learning]], digital rhetoric or [[eRhetoric]], [[usability]] studies, the formation and lifecycles of online communities, and how various media change reading and writing practices, textual conventions, and genres. Other topics examine social or critical issues in computer technology and literacy, such as the issues of the "[[digital divide]]", equitable access to computer-writing resources, and critical technological literacies.

==The field==
The field, which (in the United States, at least) has grown out of rhetoric and [[composition studies]], is inter-disciplinary, and members also do scholarly work and teaching in such allied and diverse areas as technical and professional communication, [[linguistics]], [[sociology]], and [[law]]. The most important journals supporting this field are ''Computers &amp; Composition'', ''Computers &amp; Composition Online'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cconlinejournal.org|title=Computers and Composition Online|website=cconlinejournal.org|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy.]]'' Though there is no single professional organization covering this field, an information resource portal exists at http://computersandwriting.org. The professional organization [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] has a committee, known as the 7Cs committee (CCCC Committee on Computers in Composition and Communication), that selects onsite and online hosts for the Computers &amp; Writing conference and coordinates the "Technology Innovator Award" presented at that annual conference.

== Conference and conference history ==

The [[Academic conference|conference]] "Computers and Writing" was established in 1982 in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Donald Ross and Lillian Bridwell.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Lisa|date=1995|title=The Evolution of the Computers and Writing Conference|url=|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=12|pages=279–292|via=|doi=10.1016/s8755-4615(05)80066-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference was informal at first, but over the years, it has grown from a grassroots organized conference to an established, mainstream conference that examines the ways in which computers change writing practice and pedagogy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Lisa|date=2006|title=The evolution of the Computers and Writing Conference, the second decade|url=|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=23|pages=211–227|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In earlier conferences, the scholarship presented often explored how computers influenced individual writers, but during the late 1980s and 1990s, scholarship shifted to [[hypertext]] and [[hypermedia]], and therefore, the social nature of computer mediated writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The conference originally presented original or "homemade" [[software design]] associated with word processing and editing, but eventually switched to commercial software as commercial software became more common for both individual students and educational institutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The conference has a history of technological optimism, and often, scholarship presented is optimistic regarding technology's influence on writing.  However, the conference also has a history of examining and voicing fears and concerns related to computer technology, and some of these fears are related to institutional policies and control as well as the fear of being overwhelmed by the constant march of technological innovation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The conference has also traditionally explored the ways in which computer mediated writing can be used in socially responsible ways, as is evident by the [[Feminist theory|feminist]] roots of the conference and subfield.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Estee|date=2013|title=Reflecting upon the Past, Sitting with the Present, and Charting our Future: Gail Hawisher and Cynthia Selfe Discussing the Community of Computers &amp; Composition|url=|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=30|pages=349–357|via=|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2013.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference’s feminist roots are evident in its support of minority scholars and scholarship. Awards such as the Hawisher and Selfe Caring for the Future Scholarship provide opportunities for new presenters in Computers and Writing related fields to attend the conference. This scholarship is preferably awarded to minority scholars who are involved in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hawisherselfe.org|title=Caring for the Future Award|website=hawisherselfe.org|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Janine|last2=Cirio|first2=Joseph|last3=Del Hierro|first3=Victor|last4=Gonzales|first4=Laura|last5=Robinson|first5=Joy|last6=Haas|first6=Angela|date=Fall 2017|title=Caring for the Future: Initiatives for Further Inclusion in Computers and Writing|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/22.1/disputatio/butler-et-al/index.html|journal=Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy|publisher=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the conference was originally more focused on software and hardware decisions and use, the conference has steadily become more concerned with the theoretical application of computers in writing pedagogy and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This attention to theory mirrors a shift to embrace [[Multimodality|multimodal]] compositions as texts and [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] growth as the conference became more mainstream and established in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The conference has been held annually since 1988, which is the year that the [[Conference on College Composition and Communication|CCCC]] Committee on Computers established a subcommittee to support the Computers and Writing Conference.  While the journal ''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-composition Computers and Composition]'', founded by Cynthia Selfe and Kate Kiefer in 1983,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is not officially connected to the ''Computers and Writing'' Conference, both began around the same time and explore the subfield within the larger fields of [[composition studies]] and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Pedagogy==
Computers and writing pedagogy allows students learn practical applications and implications of writing by exploring complex concepts such as visual rhetoric, issues of access, and the social implications of online writing. Students and teachers, together, interrogate the computer as an environment where writing can be facilitated in a variety of ways. Particular attention tends to be paid to the production and consumption of digital, multimodal, and new media texts. The majority of computers and writing scholars seem to agree that engaging students in the production of such multimodal/digital texts is crucial to the learning process in our digitally infused moment, but how best to do this is somewhat controversial.

During the 1960s and 1970s, which was also known as the “Birth of Composition”, Computer-Assisted instruction was used to "observe" students and provided instant positive, negative, or constructive feedback.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Whithaus, Carl. "The Development of Early Computer-Assisted Writing Instruction (1960-1978): The Double Logic of Media and Tools." Computers &amp; the Humanities, vol. 38, no. 2, May 2004, pp. 149-162.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was initial criticism from anti-technology groups. Many teachers thought that the technology needed improvement because the programs did not allow for creative expression of the students since the programs only acted as an evaluator, reader, and feedback agent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since that time the technology has improved immensely. Now the programs require multimodality, creativity, and technical complexity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Edwards-Groves, Christine. "Interactive Creative Technologies: Changing Learning Practices and Pedagogies in the Writing Classroom." Australian Journal of Language &amp; Literacy, vol. 35, no. 1, Feb. 2012, pp. 99-113.&lt;/ref&gt; The problems the students face in these programs now require much more comprehensive thinking and creativity to the point that it is difficult to still call the subject “writing” because the students are required to know much more.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Computers and writing pedagogies must be dynamic and adaptable to the ways in which technology, media, and the sociopolitical spaces operate in a constant state of flux.  Discussions about negotiating paradigm shifts abound in disciplinary journals, and teachers continually develop new approaches that engage with and build upon developments in digital technology and new media texts. Because most scholars in this area work within a university system that privileges print-media over digital text, much of the work produced and assigned by these teachers and scholars continues to be relatively traditional.  While a Computers and Writing pedagogy should encourage the use of sampling, remixing, and file sharing that invites students to conceive themselves as reproducers or co-authors of digital compositions as well as consumers, this is not always an achievable goal. In the pedagogical paradigm shift that computers and composition scholars strive for, students play a vital role in the construction and transformation of knowledge.

==Writing in the age of communication technology==
In the age of communication technology, amateurs and experts collaborate to create, sustain, and develop virtual communities based on what Gee and Hayes (2011) call "passionate [[affinity spaces]]", or communities organized around "a shared endeavor, interest, or passion". Technology, specifically blogs, can be an excellent way to build learning communities and help students learn to write authentically for and respond to various audiences by making their writing public. On the virtual playing field, knowledge and talent matter more than degrees and professional memberships, so these spaces offer students a new learning environment and space to collaborate on the production and distribution of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=James Paul|title=Language and Learning in the Digital Age|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-60277-8|pages=69–71|author2=Elisabeth R. Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aligning with the notion of "affinity space," composition scholars have coined the term "[[cultural ecology]]" to examine the complex social and cultural contexts that shape the development of technological literacy. Drawing from the literacy narratives of two participants, Hawisher, Selfe, Moraski, and Pearson theorize five themes emergent from the cultural ecology of literacy, namely the "cultural, material, educational, and familial contexts" that shape and are shaped by literacy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawisher|first=Gail|last2=Selfe|first2=Cynthia|last3=Moraski|first3=Brittney|last4=Pearson|first4=Melissa|date=2004|title=Becoming Literate in the Information Age: Cultural Ecologies and the Literacies of Technology|jstor=4140666|journal=CCC|volume=55|pages=642–692|via=|doi=10.2307/4140666}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five themes of cultural ecology pinpoint that technological literacy goes through life spans, that literacy provides the medium for people to exert their agency, that literacy occurs and develops both within and outside of school contexts, that the conditions of access influence people's literacy development, and that literacy practices and values transmit via family units. Kristine Blair further complicates "cultural ecology" by pointing out the positive impacts of cultural conflicts in constructing online discourses and political discussions, while at the same time warning that students may not undergo transformation through exposure to the conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blair|first=Kristine|date=1998|title=Literacy, dialogue, and difference in the 'electronic contact zone'|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755461598900044|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=15|pages=317–329|via=|doi=10.1016/S8755-4615(98)90004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also looming behind the issue of culture in computer and writing is the [[digital divide]]. Cynthia Selfe points out the ways through which gaining access to technological literacy is situated in unequal social, cultural, economic, and political situations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selfe|first=Cynthia|date=1999|title=Technology and Literacy: A Story about the Perils of Not Paying Attention|journal=CCC|volume=50|pages=411–436|via=|jstor=358859}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Selfe writes, "computers continue to be distributed along the related axes of race and socioeconomic status and this distribution continues to ongoing patterns of racism and to the continuation of poverty." To address the digital divide, Selfe calls upon educators and compositionists to rethink computer literacy as a political act that requires paying critical attention to inequality issues and taking political actions in specific disciplinary contexts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Defamiliarization''' or '''''ostranenie''''' ({{lang-rus|остранение|p=ɐstrɐˈnʲenʲɪjə}}) is the [[art]]istic technique of presenting to audiences common things in an unfamiliar or strange way &lt;!--typically (is it also used for other rasons / without an explicit intention?)--&gt;in order to enhance perception of the familiar.

== History ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to (De Guzman, 2016), Defamiliarization of that which is or has become familiar or taken for granted, hence automatically perceived, is the basic function of all devices. And with defamiliarization come both the slowing down and the increased difficulty (impeding) of the process of reading and comprehending and an awareness of the artistic procedures (devices) causing them.  (Margolin 2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "defamiliarization" was first coined in 1917 by [[Viktor Shklovsky]] in his essay "Art as Device" (alternate translation: "Art as Technique") (Crawford 209).  Shklovsky invented the term as a means to "distinguish poetic from practical language on the basis of the former's perceptibility" (Crawford 209).  Essentially, he is stating that [[poetic language]] is fundamentally different than the language that we use every day because it is more difficult to understand:  "Poetic speech is ''formed speech''.  [[Prose]] is ordinary speech – economical, easy, proper, the goddess of prose [''dea prosae''] is a goddess of the accurate, facile type, of the "direct" expression of a child" (Shklovsky 20).  This difference is the key to the creation of art and the prevention of "over-automatization," which causes an individual to "function as though by formula" (Shklovsky 16).  This distinction between artistic language and everyday language, for Shklovsky, applies to all artistic forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known.  The technique of art is to make objects ‘unfamiliar,' to make forms difficult to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged. (Shklovsky 16) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, defamiliarization serves as a means to force individuals to recognize artistic language:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In studying poetic speech in its phonetic and [[Word|lexical]] structure as well as in its characteristic distribution of words and in the characteristic thought structures compounded from the words, we find everywhere the artistic trademark – that is, we find material obviously created to remove the automatism of perception; the author's purpose is to create the vision which results from that deautomatized perception.  A work is created "artistically" so that its perception is impeded and the greatest possible effect is produced through the slowness of the perception.  (Shklovsky 19)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This technique is meant to be especially useful in distinguishing poetry from prose, for, as [[Aristotle]] said, "poetic language must appear strange and wonderful" (Shklovsky 19).

=== In Russian literature ===

To illustrate what he means by defamiliarization, Shklovsky uses examples from [[Tolstoy]], whom he cites as using the technique throughout his works: "The narrator of '[[Kholstomer]],' for example, is a horse, and it is the horse's point of view (rather than a person's) that makes the content of the story seem unfamiliar" (Shklovsky 16).  As a Russian Formalist, many of Shklovsky's examples use Russian authors and Russian dialects: "And currently [[Maxim Gorky]] is changing his diction from the old literary language to the new literary colloquialism of [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]].  Ordinary speech and literary language have thereby changed places (see the work of [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and many others)" (Shklovsky 19-20).

Defamiliarization also includes the use of foreign languages within a work.  At the time that Shklovsky was writing, there was a change in the use of language in both [[literature]] and everyday spoken Russian.  As Shklovsky puts it: "Russian literary language, which was originally foreign to [[Russia]], has so permeated the language of the people that it has blended with their conversation.  On the other hand, literature has now begun to show a tendency towards the use of dialects and/or barbarisms" (Shklovsky 19).

=== Différance ===

Shklovsky's defamiliarization can also be compared to [[Jacques Derrida]]'s concept of [[différance]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What Shklovskij wants to show is that the operation of defamiliarization and its consequent perception in the literary system is like the winding of a watch (the introduction of energy into a physical system): both "originate" difference, change, value, motion, presence.  Considered against the general and functional background of Derridian différance, what Shklovskij calls "perception" can be considered a matrix for production of difference.  (Crawford 212) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since the term différance refers to the dual meanings of the [[French language|French]] word difference to mean both "to differ" and "to defer", defamiliarization draws attention to the use of common language in such a way as to alter one's perception of an easily understandable object or concept.  The use of defamiliarization both differs and defers, since the use of the technique alters one's perception of a concept (to defer), and forces one to think about the concept in different, often more complex, terms (to differ).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shklovskij's formulations negate or cancel out the existence/possibility of a "real" perception: variously, by (1) the familiar Formalist denial of a link between literature and life, connoting their status as non-communicating vessels, (2) always, as if compulsively, referring to a real experience in terms of empty, dead, and automatized repetition and recognition, and (3) implicitly locating real perception at an unspecifiable temporally anterior and spatially other place, at a mythic "first time" of naïve experience, the loss of which to automatization is  to be restored by aesthetic perceptual fullness. (Crawford 218)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Uncanny ===

The influence of Russian Formalism on twentieth-century art and culture is largely due to the literary technique of defamiliarization or ‘making strange’, and has also been linked to Freud’s notion of the uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, Nicholas.  ''The Uncanny''.  New York: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Das Unheimliche'' ("The Uncanny"),&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund.  ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Volume XVII.  Ed. James Strachey.  London: Hogarth Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud states that “the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar,” however, this is not a fear of the unknown, but more of a feeling about something being both strange and familiar (220).  The connection between ''ostranenie'' and the uncanny can be seen where Freud muses on the technique of literary uncanniness: “It is true that the writer creates a kind of uncertainty in us in the beginning by not letting us know, no doubt purposely, whether he is taking us into the real world or into a purely fantastic one of his own creation” (230).  When “the writer pretends to move in the world of common reality,” they can situate supernatural events, such as the animation of inanimate objects, in the quotidian, day-to-day reality of the modern world, defamiliarizing the reader and provoking an uncanny feeling (250).

== Usage ==
The technique appears in English Romantic poetry, particularly in the poetry of [[Wordsworth]], and was defined in the following way by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'': "To carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood; to combine the child's sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which every day for perhaps forty years had rendered familiar ... this is the character and privilege of genius." 
 
In more recent times, it has been associated with the poet and playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], whose [[Verfremdungseffekt]] ("estrangement effect") was a potent element of his approach to theater. In fact, as Willett points out, Verfremdungseffekt is "a translation of the Russian critic Viktor Shklovskij's phrase 'Priem Ostranenija', or 'device for making strange'".&lt;ref&gt;(Willett, John.  ''Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic''.  New York: Hill and Wang, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Brecht, in turn, has been highly influential for artists and filmmakers including Jean-Luc Godard and Yvonne Rainer.

'''Dumbarton Oaks Papers''' (DOP) is an academic journal founded in 1941 for the publication of articles relating to civilizations of the [[Ancient history|late antique]], [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]], and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods.

Publication was suspended during World War II, resuming in 1946 irregularly at first, and eventually published annually by the mid-1950s.

An '''estuary''' is a partially enclosed coastal body of [[brackish water]] with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D. W. |year=1967 |chapter= What is an estuary: physical viewpoint |pages=3–5 |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=Lauf |title= Estuaries |series=A.A.A.S. Publ. |volume=83 |location=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments. They are subject both to marine influences—such as [[tides]], waves, and the influx of saline water—and to riverine influences—such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The mixing of sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in [[sediment]], making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.&lt;ref name="McLusky"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLusky |first=D. S. |last2=Elliott |first2=M. |year=2004 |title=The Estuarine Ecosystem: Ecology, Threats and Management |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-852508-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most existing estuaries formed during the [[Holocene]] epoch with the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000–12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolanski |first=E. |year=2007 |title=Estuarine Ecohydrology |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-53066-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estuaries are typically classified according to their [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] features or to water-circulation patterns. They can have many different names, such as bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets, or sounds, although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and may be fully saline.

The banks of many estuaries are amongst the most heavily populated areas of the world, with about 60% of the world's population living along estuaries and the coast.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} As a result, many estuaries suffer [[Habitat destruction|degradation]] from a variety of factors including: sedimentation from [[soil erosion]] from [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]], and other [[Land degradation|poor farming practices]]; [[overfishing]]; drainage and filling of wetlands; [[eutrophication]] due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s, [[radionuclide]]s and [[hydrocarbon]]s from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., &amp; Lucas, M.

The word "estuary" is derived from the Latin word ''aestuarium'' meaning tidal inlet of the sea, which in itself is derived from the term ''aestus'', meaning tide. There have been many definitions proposed to describe an estuary. The most widely accepted definition is: "a semi-enclosed coastal body of water, which has a free connection with the open sea, and within which sea water is measurably diluted with freshwater derived from land drainage".&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; However, this definition excludes a number of coastal water bodies such as coastal lagoons and [[Brackish water|brackish]] seas. A more comprehensive definition of an estuary is "a semi-enclosed body of water connected to the sea as far as the [[tidal limit]] or the salt intrusion limit and receiving freshwater runoff; however the freshwater inflow may not be perennial, the connection to the sea may be closed for part of the year and tidal influence may be negligible".&lt;ref name="Wolanski"/&gt; This broad definition also includes [[fjord]]s, [[lagoon]]s, [[river mouth]]s, and [[tidal creek]]s. An estuary is a dynamic [[ecosystem]] having a connection to the open sea through which the [[sea water]] enters with the rhythm of the [[tide]]s. The sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the [[fresh water]] flowing from rivers and streams. The pattern of dilution varies between different estuaries and depends on the volume of fresh water, the tidal range, and the extent of evaporation of the water in the estuary.&lt;ref name="McLusky"/&gt;

==Classification based on geomorphology==

===Drowned river valleys===
{{main|Ria}}
Drowned river valleys are also known as coastal plain estuaries. In places where the sea level is rising relative to the land, sea water progressively penetrates into river valleys and the topography of the estuary remains similar to that of a river valley. This is the most common type of estuary in temperate climates. Well-studied estuaries include the [[Severn Estuary]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Ems Dollart Region|Ems Dollard]] along the Dutch-German border.

The width-to-depth ratio of these estuaries is typically large, appearing wedge-shaped (in cross-section) in the inner part and broadening and deepening seaward.  Water depths rarely exceed {{convert|30|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. [[Ria#Examples|Examples of this type of estuary]] in the U.S. are the [[Hudson River]], [[Chesapeake Bay]], and [[Delaware Bay]] along the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] coast, and [[Galveston Bay]] and [[Tampa Bay]] along the [[Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kunneke |first=J. T. |first2=T. F. |last2=Palik |year=1984 |url=http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/others/85_15.pdf |title=Tampa Bay environmental atlas |journal=U.S. Fish Wildl. Serv. Biol. Rep. |volume=85 |issue=15 |pages=3 |accessdate=January 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lagoon-type or bar-built===
Bar-built estuaries are found in place where the deposition of sediment has kept pace with rising sea level so that the estuaries are shallow and separated from the sea by sand spits or barrier islands. They are relatively common in tropical and subtropical locations.

These estuaries are semi-isolated from ocean waters by barrier beaches ([[barrier island]]s and barrier [[Spit (landform)|spits]]). Formation of barrier beaches partially encloses the estuary, with only narrow inlets allowing contact with the ocean waters. Bar-built estuaries typically develop on gently sloping plains located along tectonically stable edges of continents and marginal sea coasts. They are extensive along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S. in areas with active coastal deposition of sediments and where tidal ranges are less than {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The barrier beaches that enclose bar-built estuaries have been developed in several ways:
* building up of offshore bars by wave action, in which sand from the sea floor is deposited in elongated bars parallel to the shoreline,
* reworking of sediment discharge from rivers by wave, current, and wind action into beaches, overwash flats, and dunes,
* engulfment of mainland beach ridges (ridges developed from the erosion of coastal plain sediments around 5000 years ago) due to sea level rise and resulting in the breaching of the ridges and flooding of the coastal lowlands, forming shallow lagoons, and
* elongation of barrier spits from the erosion of headlands due to the action of [[longshore current]]s, with the spits growing in the direction of the littoral drift.
Barrier beaches form in shallow water and are generally parallel to the shoreline, resulting in long, narrow estuaries. The average water depth is usually less than {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and rarely exceeds {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Examples of bar-built estuaries are [[Barnegat Bay]], [[New Jersey]]; [[Laguna Madre]],&lt;ref&gt;1393960326&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas]]; and [[Pamlico Sound]], [[North Carolina]].

===Fjord-type===
Fjords were formed where pleistocene glaciers deepened and widened existing river valleys so that they become U-shaped in cross sections. At their mouths there are typically rocks, bars or [[Aquatic sill|sills]] of [[Moraine|glacial deposits]], which have the effects of modifying the estuarine circulation.
 
[[Fjord]]-type estuaries are formed in deeply eroded valleys formed by [[glacier]]s. These U-shaped estuaries typically have steep sides, rock bottoms, and underwater sills contoured by glacial movement. The estuary is shallowest at its mouth, where terminal glacial [[moraine]]s or rock bars form sills that restrict water flow. In the upper reaches of the estuary, the depth can exceed {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. The width-to-depth ratio is generally small. In estuaries with very shallow sills, tidal oscillations only affect the water down to the depth of the sill, and the waters deeper than that may remain stagnant for a very long time, so there is only an occasional exchange of the deep water of the estuary with the ocean. If the sill depth is deep, water circulation is less restricted, and there is a slow but steady exchange of water between the estuary and the ocean. Fjord-type estuaries can be found along the coasts of [[Alaska]], the [[Puget Sound]] region of western [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], [[British Columbia]], eastern Canada, [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], New Zealand, and Norway.

===Tectonically produced===
These estuaries are formed by subsidence or land cut off from the ocean by land movement associated with [[Fault (geology)|faulting]], [[volcano]]es, and [[landslide]]s.  [[Inundation]] from eustatic sea level rise during the [[Holocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|Epoch]] has also contributed to the formation of these estuaries.  There are only a small number of [[Tectonics|tectonically]] produced estuaries; one example is the [[San Francisco Bay]], which was formed by the crustal movements of the [[San Andreas fault]] system causing the inundation of the lower reaches of the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River|San Joaquin rivers]].&lt;ref name="Kennish"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennish |first=M. J. |year=1986 |title=Ecology of Estuaries. Volume I: Physical and Chemical Aspects |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0-8493-5892-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification based on water circulation==
{{See also|Estuarine water circulation}}

===Salt wedge===
In this type of estuary, river output greatly exceeds marine input and tidal effects have a minor importance.  Fresh water floats on top of the seawater in a layer that gradually thins as it moves seaward.  The denser seawater moves landward along the bottom of the estuary, forming a wedge-shaped layer that is thinner as it approaches land.  As a velocity difference develops between the two layers, shear forces generate internal waves at the interface, mixing the seawater upward with the freshwater.  An example of a salt wedge estuary is the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name="Kennish"/&gt;

===Partially mixed===
As tidal forcing increases, river output becomes less than the marine input.  Here, current induced turbulence causes mixing of the whole water column such that salinity varies more longitudinally rather than vertically, leading to a moderately stratified condition.  Examples include the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and [[Narragansett Bay]].&lt;ref name="Kennish"/&gt;

===Well-mixed===
Tidal mixing forces exceed river output, resulting in a well mixed water column and the disappearance of the vertical salinity gradient.  The freshwater-seawater boundary is eliminated due to the intense turbulent mixing and eddy effects.  The lower reaches of [[Delaware Bay]] and the [[Raritan River]] in [[New Jersey]] are examples of vertically homogenous estuaries.&lt;ref name="Kennish"/&gt;

===Inverse===
Inverse estuaries occur in dry climates where evaporation greatly exceeds the inflow of fresh water.  A salinity maximum zone is formed, and both riverine and oceanic water flow close to the surface towards this zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolanski |first=E. |year=1986 |title=An evaporation-driven salinity maximum zone in Australian tropical estuaries |journal=Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=415–424 |doi=10.1016/0272-7714(86)90065-X |bibcode = 1986ECSS...22..415W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This water is pushed downward and spreads along the bottom in both the seaward and landward direction.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"/&gt; An example of an inverse estuary is [[Spencer Gulf]], South Australia.

===Intermittent===
Estuary type varies dramatically depending on freshwater input, and is capable of changing from a wholly marine [[embayment]] to any of the other estuary types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tomczak |first=M. |year=2000 |url=http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/IntroOc/notes/lecture12.html |title=Oceanography Notes Ch. 12:  Estuaries |accessdate=30 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=J. H. |year=1981 |title=Estuarine Ecology |location=Rotterdam |publisher=A. A. Balkema |isbn=90-6191-205-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiochemical variation==
The most important variable characteristics of estuary water are the concentration of dissolved oxygen, [[salinity]] and [[sediment]] load. There is extreme spatial variability in salinity, with a range of near zero at the [[tidal limit]] of tributary rivers to 3.4% at the estuary mouth. At any one point the salinity will vary considerably over time and seasons, making it a harsh environment for organisms. Sediment often settles in intertidal [[mudflats]] which are extremely difficult to colonize. No points of attachment exist for [[algae]], so vegetation based habitat is not established.{{clarify|date=June 2012}} Sediment can also clog feeding and respiratory structures of species, and special adaptations exist within mudflat species to cope with this problem. Lastly, [[dissolved oxygen]] variation can cause problems for life forms. Nutrient-rich sediment from man-made sources can promote primary production life cycles, perhaps leading to eventual decay removing the dissolved oxygen from the water; thus [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] or [[Dead zone (ecology)|anoxic]] zones can develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaiser |year=2005 |title=Marine Ecology. Processes, Systems and Impacts |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=019924975X |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for marine life==
Estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity. Estuaries provide habitats for many fish nurseries, depending upon their locations in the world, such as [[salmon]] and [[sea trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bronwyn M. |last=Gillanders |url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2003/247/m247p281.pdf |title=Evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats for mobile marine fauna: an important component of nurseries |year=2003 |series=Marine Ecology Progress Series }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Bird migration|migratory]] bird populations, such as the [[black-tailed godwit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jennifer A. |last=Gill |title=The buffer effect and large-scale population regulation in migratory birds |year=2001 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=412 |issue=6845 |pages=436–438 |doi=10.1038/35086568 |pmid=11473317}}&lt;/ref&gt; make essential use of estuaries.

Two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in [[salinity]] and [[sedimentation]]. Many species of [[fish]] and [[invertebrate]]s have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed [[osmoconformer]]s and [[osmoregulator]]s. Many animals also [[burrowing|burrow]] to avoid [[predation]] and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux.

[[Phytoplankton]] are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the [[tide]]s. Their productivity is largely dependent upon the [[turbidity]] of the water. The main phytoplankton present are [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]] which are abundant in the sediment.

It is important to remember that a primary source of food for many organisms on estuaries, including [[bacteria]], is [[detritus]] from the settlement of the sedimentation.

==Human impact==
Of the thirty-two largest cities in the world in the early 1990s, twenty-two were located on estuaries.&lt;ref name="RossDA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=D. A. |year=1995 |title=Introduction to Oceanography |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins College Publishers |isbn=978-0-673-46938-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ecosystems, estuaries are under threat from human activities such as [[pollution]] and [[overfishing]]. They are also threatened by sewage, coastal settlement, land clearance and much more. Estuaries are affected by events far upstream, and concentrate materials such as pollutants and sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Branch |title=Estuarine vulnerability and ecological impacts: Estuaries of South Africa, edited by Brian R. Allanson and Dan Baird |journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=14 |issue=12 |year=1999 |pages=499 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01732-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land run-off and industrial, agricultural, and domestic waste enter rivers and are discharged into estuaries. Contaminants can be introduced which do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment, such as [[Marine debris|plastics]], [[pesticide]]s, [[furan]]s, [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[phenol]]s and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]].

Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called [[bioaccumulation]]. They also accumulate in [[benthic]] environments, such as estuaries and [[bay muds]]: a geological record of human activities of the last century. The elemental composition of [[biofilm]] reflect areas of the estuary impacted by human activities, and over time may shift the basic composition of the ecosystem, and the reversible or irreversible changes in the abiotic and biotic parts of the systems from the bottom up.&lt;ref name="Río de la Plata"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312247369_Total_and_extractable_elemental_composition_of_the_intertidal_estuarine_biofilm_of_the_Rio_de_la_Plata_Disentangling_natural_and_anthropogenic_influences | title=Total and extractable elemental composition of the intertidal estuarine biofilm of the Río de la Plata: Disentangling natural and anthropogenic influences| author=J. García-Alonso, D. Lercari, B.F. Araujo, M.G. Almeida, C.E. Rezende | journal=[[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]] | year=5 March 2017 | volume=187 | pages=53–61 | doi=10.1016/j.ecss.2016.12.018| bibcode=2017ECSS..187...53G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Chinese and Russian industrial pollution, such as phenols and heavy metals, has devastated fish stocks in the [[Amur River]] and damaged its estuary soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npolar.no/ansipra/english/Indexpages/Ethnic_groups.html#19 "Indigenous Peoples of the Russian North, Siberia and Far East: Nivkh"] by Arctic Network for the Support of the Indigenous Peoples of the Russian Arctic&lt;/ref&gt;

Estuaries tend to be naturally [[eutrophic]] because [[land runoff]] discharges nutrients into estuaries. With human activities, land run-off also now includes the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans. Excess oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sebastian A.|last=Gerlach |title=Marine Pollution: Diagnosis and Therapy |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=zjMRAAAAYAAJ&amp;q|publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1981 |isbn=0387109404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations.
Overfishing also occurs. [[Chesapeake Bay]] once had a flourishing [[oyster]] population that has been almost wiped out by overfishing. Oysters filter these pollutants, and either eat them or shape them into small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are harmless. Historically the oysters filtered the estuary's entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days. Today that process takes almost a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://habitat.noaa.gov/restorationtechniques/public/habitat.cfm?HabitatID=2&amp;HabitatTopicID=11 |title=Oyster Reefs: Ecological importance |publisher=US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003114619/http://habitat.noaa.gov/restorationtechniques/public/habitat.cfm?HabitatID=2&amp;HabitatTopicID=11 |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sediment, nutrients, and algae can cause problems in local waters.

The '''Friedrichsfelde Palace''' ({{lang-de|Schloss Friedrichsfelde}}) is a [[Neoclassical Architecture|Neoclassical]]-style building in the centre of the [[Tierpark Berlin]] in [[Berlin-Friedrichsfelde]]. It was property of various [[Nobility|noble]] Prussians and occasionally owned by [[List of monarchs of Prussia|Prussian Kings]]&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.schloss-friedrichsfelde.de/geschichte-schloss-friedrichsfelde "The History of Friedrichsfelde Palace"], ''Schloss Friedrichsfelde''. Retrieved on 12 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. Currently, the palace offers [[Exhibition|exhibitions]] about its history and is a place for musical concerts. 

==History of the palace==

Formerly constructed around 1695 by architect [[Johann Arnold Nering]] as ''Rosenfelde Palace'', the building received its current name in 1699 since [[Frederick I of Prussia]] came into possession of the palace. In 1719, architect Martin Heinrich Böhme expanded the dimensions of the building on behalf of its new owner, [[Margrave Albert Frederick of Brandenburg-Schwedt]]. Thus, Friedrichsfelde Palace was equipped with new [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] stairs and the size of the [[Facade|facade]] was extended. 1762, the building became property of [[Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia]], brother of [[Frederick the Great]]. He aspired to rebuild the palace completely. However, he discarded his plans for Friedrichsfelde Palace and instead used them for the construction of [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] in [[Berlin-Mitte]]. Sold several times in the course of the following decades, Friedrichsfelde Palace received its [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] appearance in 1800. In summer 1816, [[Tresckow|Carl of Treskow]] acquired the building and hired the Prussian landscape architect [[Peter Joseph Lenné]] to transform the park of the palace into an [[English landscape garden]]. 

The palace remained in possession of family Tresckow until May [[1945]], when the [[Red Army]] conquered the palace. The building itself overcame [[World War II]] with only a few damages. The [[Restoration (cultural heritage)|restorations]] of Friedrichsfelde Palace started in 1967. Since 1981, the building is used for musical concerts and as a museum.

In 1954 a law was passed, changing the corporate name to "Gallaudet College."  (The collegiate department of the Columbia Institution had gone by the name "Gallaudet College" since 1894.)

Founded in 1864, Gallaudet University was originally a grammar school for both Deaf and blind children.  It was the first school for the advanced education of the Deaf and hard of hearing in the world and remains the only higher education institution in which all programs and services are specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students. Hearing students are admitted to the graduate school and a small number are also admitted as undergraduates each year. The university was named after [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]], a notable figure in the advancement of deaf education.

Gallaudet University is officially bilingual, with [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and written [[English language|English]] used for instruction and by the college community. Although there are no specific ASL proficiency requirements for undergraduate admission, many graduate programs require varying degrees of knowledge of the language as a prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallaudet.edu/x571.xml Communication &amp; Culture Issues – Gallaudet University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016092852/http://gallaudet.edu/x571.xml |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, [[philanthropist]] and former [[United States Postmaster General]] [[Amos Kendall]] became aware of several deaf and blind children in [[Washington, D.C.]], who were not receiving proper care. Kendall had the courts declare the children to be his wards and donated {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of his land to establish housing and a school for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Gallaudet University|url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/Gallaudet_University/About_Gallaudet/History.html|publisher=Gallaudet University|accessdate=July 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwAq7VI?url=http://www.gallaudet.edu/Gallaudet_University/About_Gallaudet/History.html|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]] was the first superintendent of the new school. Later, John Carlin suggested placing a monument of [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] with [[Alice Cogswell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deafbiography.com/biography/johncarlinbio.htm |title=John Carlin |publisher=Deafbiography.com |date= |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316015834/http://deafbiography.com/biography/johncarlinbio.htm |archivedate=March 16, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, the [[34th United States Congress|34th Congress]] passed H.R. 806, which chartered the [[grammar school]] as the '''Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind''' and funded tuition costs for indigent deaf, dumb (mute), or blind children belonging to the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=011/llsl011.db&amp;recNum=182|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=July 18, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwCWeUO?url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, in 1864, the [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]] authorized the institution to grant and confirm college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=38th Congress: Session 1, Chapter 52|url=http://www.saveourdeafschools.org/an_act_to_authorize_the_columbia_institution_to_confer_degrees_april_8_1864.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwNlpoJ?url=http://www.saveourdeafschools.org/an_act_to_authorize_the_columbia_institution_to_confer_degrees_april_8_1864.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collegiate department became known as the '''National Deaf-Mute College'''. The following year, in 1865, the 38th Congress removed the instruction that the institution was to educate the blind, and renamed it the '''Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb'''.

In 1954, Congress amended the charter of the institution, changing the corporate name to '''Gallaudet College''', which had been the official name of the collegiate department since 1894.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallaudet College Hearing Before the Committee on Education and Labor|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/expansion_era.pdf|work=83rd Congress, Second Session|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=May 5, 1954|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwOIv7M?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/expansion_era.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 17 years as Dean of the College in the 1950s and 1960s, George Ernst Detmold was a significant figure in helping the college achieve accreditation. He also led the college in developing new departments, especially drama. He directed Gallaudet theater productions, which eventually led to starting the [[National Theatre of the Deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/15/AR2005081501363.html|title=Gallaudet Dean George Detmold, 88|date=August 16, 2005|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111201655/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/15/AR2005081501363.html|archivedate=January 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Congress again amended the charter of the Institution, renaming it '''Gallaudet University'''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{usctc|20|55}}, "EDUCATION OF THE DEAF"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history (1859–1880)===
[[File:Gallaudet University.jpg|thumb|Florida Avenue entrance]]
The school was established in 1857 with considerable efforts being made by several concerned citizens of Washington, D.C.  Two houses were used, one purchased and one rented. On November 1, 1858, the First Annual Report was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1858.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=1 November 1858|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwD21yF?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1858.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the school's second full year of operation (1858–1859), 14 deaf students and 7 blind students were in attendance.  Superintendent Gallaudet, anticipating the future growth of the school, requested money for more buildings, lamenting the fact that the money was not issued in the year prior, due to federal budget problems. The Second Annual Report was submitted November 5, 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1859.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=5 November 1859|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwEpHBo?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1859.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the third academic year (1859–1860), Kendall beseeched the federal government for funds to relocate the school to more spacious grounds. Gallaudet praised Kendall for donating money needed to construct a new brick building; however, both school buildings were already at capacity. There were 24 deaf students, necessitating a second teacher of the deaf.  The teacher of the 6 blind students resigned due to health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1860.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=5 November 1860|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwG8YH6?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1860.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1860–61 academic year, the Civil War had been in progress for over six months. Gallaudet reported that the students were safe and free from fear.  There were 35 deaf students and 6 blind students in attendance during the academic year.  An art teacher was hired for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1861.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=5 November 1861|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwJA95u?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1861.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1861–62, new monies provided for industrial education were used to rent a nearby shop in order to teach cabinet-making to the male students.  Plans were underway to construct a new building using $9,000 that Congress appropriated to the school.  There were 35 deaf students and 6 blind students.  During vacation in August a regiment of troops used the brick building for a hospital, and some of the students who stayed over the summer helped with tending to the sick soldiers. One soldier died. For the first time, Gallaudet proposed expanding the school to create a college for deaf students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifth Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1862.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=3 November 1862|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwKVodx?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1862.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with new construction completed for the 1862-1863 school year, the school was still at capacity and more money was needed to purchase {{convert|13|acre|m2}} of adjoining land and then build even more buildings.  Gallaudet asked for money to pipe in water from the river, as the existing cistern and well were inadequate to the school's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifth Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1863.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=15 October 1863|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwM8dWZ?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1863.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

College-level courses were offered for the first time during the 1864-65 academic year. Congress provided approval for Columbia to grant college degrees, and an enabling act for the college was passed and approved by President Lincoln.  An elaborate inauguration ceremony was held in June with [[Laurent Clerc]] in attendance. Fourteen acres of land was purchased with money supplied by the government. Gallaudet was promoted to the position of president of the institution. He continued to push for funds for expansion and new buildings. Gallaudet also proposed discontinuing services for blind students, saying that the small number of blind students would be better served at the school for the blind in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seventh Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1864.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=17 November 1864|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwPzf63?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1864.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enrollment numbers increased rapidly during the 1864–65 academic year. Gallaudet asked the government for money to accomplish several projects, including the construction of an ice house and a gas house, sewer lines, and more.  Major construction continued on campus.  The name of the collegiate department was changed to "National Deaf-Mute College".  The blind students were transferred to a school in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1865.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=6 November 1865|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwVrBC1?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1865.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1865–66 academic year, Gallaudet responded to criticism from supporters of the [[Oralism|oral method]] in Massachusetts, saying that oral instruction is usually of little value to congenitally deaf children. Gallaudet proposed that a representative of the school be sent to Europe to study the methods employed there, in order to determine which types of instructional methods might be added to those methods already being used successfully at the Columbia Institution and other American schools.  Combined enrollment of all levels of instruction, including the collegiate level, exceeded 100 for the first time during this year.  There were 25 students enrolled in the college, including students from 14 states of all parts of the Union. Edward Allen Fay joined the faculty as a professor of history, having learned to sign as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ninth Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1866.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=6 November 1866|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwXA8G9?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1866.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Columbia institution old fowler hall circa 1866.jpg|right|thumb|Old Fowler Hall, circa 1866]]
In the 1866–67 academic year, the building for the primary school was extended and sickness was thereby reduced. A mathematics professor was hired for the first time. More money was needed to accommodate additional students expected to swell the ranks of the school.

Gallaudet gave a lengthy account of his travels to Europe and was very critical of the extent to which speech is taught to deaf children in European schools for the deaf.  Nevertheless, he recommended that a limited amount of speech training be afforded to deaf students in America to those who show they can benefit.  His travels took him to: [[Doncaster]], [[England]]; [[Birmingham]], England; [[Manchester]], England; [[Liverpool]], England; [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]; Belfast, Ireland ([[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]); [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]; [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]; [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]], [[Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort]], France; [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]; Leipsic, Saxony ([[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]); Lubec ([[Lübeck]], Germany); Frankfort On-the-Main ([[Frankfurt]], Germany); [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]; [[Zurich]], Switzerland; [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]; [[Paris]], France; Weissenfels, Prussia ([[Weißenfels]], Germany); Prague, Bohemia; ([[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]);  Berlin, Prussia ([[Berlin]], Germany); [[Milan]], [[Italy]]; [[Genoa]], Italy; [[Turin]], Italy; Dresden, Saxony ([[Dresden]], Germany); [[London]], England; [[Edinburgh]], Scotland; [[Bordeaux]], France; [[Marseille]]s, France; Munich, Bavaria ([[Munich]], Germany); [[Bruges]], Belgium; [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]; Åbo, Finland ([[Turku]], [[Finland]]); [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]; and [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tenth Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1867.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=28 October 1867|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwYHQIL?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1867.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest educational conference in the then-history of deaf education was held during the month of May 1868 in Washington, D.C., largely made up of principals of schools for the deaf.  Fourteen schools for the deaf were represented from 22 different states.  The chief topic of discussion was the recommendations put forth by Edward Gallaudet regarding adding articulation lessons to schools' curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleventh Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1868.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=26 October 1868|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGweVi8D?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1868.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868–69, the first students completed a full course of college studies, all graduating with bachelor's degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twelfth Annual Report|url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1869.pdf|publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools|date=20 October 1869|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwfuU3O?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1869.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the school, Amos Kendall, died in November 1869.  Gallaudet delivered a eulogy at the board meeting in January 1870.  The main central building was partially completed, with rooms in the basement and on the first floor first being used.  Plans were being made to purchase Amos Kendall's estate, which adjoined the grounds of the school.  Gallaudet cautioned Congress that Kendall's heirs had plans to subdivide the property if it was not sold to Columbia, and hence the land would never again become available for purchase as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Twelfth Annual Report |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1870.pdf |publisher=Save Our Deaf Schools |date=29 October 1870 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwkYyhj?url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/columbia_institution_1870.pdf |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, Laura Sheridan, a hearing woman, inquired about Gallaudet University's accepting women.  She was told that deaf women could not enter the institution. In 1887 Gallaudet agreed to allow women to apply with the intent that women would not stay. Temporary living arrangements were made and the college remained co-educational.&lt;ref&gt;Marschark, Marc, Lang, Harry G. and Albertini, John A. "Educating Deaf Students".

===Deaf President Now (1988)===
{{Main|Deaf President Now}}

Student strikes at Gallaudet University starting March 6, 1988, revolutionized the perception and education of [[Deaf culture]]. Deaf students were outraged at the selection of another hearing president, [[Elisabeth Zinser]]; the university had never selected a deaf person for this position. Alumni, faculty, staff, and students demanded that the next president of the university be deaf. After a week of protest and activism, Zinser resigned and was replaced by [[I. King Jordan]]. This movement became known as ''[[Deaf President Now]]'' (DPN).

===Unity for Gallaudet Movement (2006)===
{{Main|Unity for Gallaudet}}
[[File:Gallaudet union.jpg|thumb|Student Academic Center (SAC)]]
Jordan announced his retirement in September 2005. On May 1, 2006, the university's board of trustees announced that [[Jane Fernandes]], the university's current [[Provost (education)|provost]], would be the university's next president. This was met with protests from the student body, both in person on campus and in internet blogs and forums.

Initially, students cited the lack of racial diversity among finalists, Fernandes's lack of warmth,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'': [http://chronicle.com/article/Student-Protests-Over/36959 "Student Protests Over Presidential Pick Return to Gallaudet U."] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111013211927/http://chronicle.com/article/Student-Protests-Over/36959 |date=October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and her lack of fluency in [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050300920.html "Gallaudet Names New President."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621193115/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050300920.html |date=June 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan publicly accused some critics of rejecting Fernandes because "she is not deaf enough." He described the protest as "[[identity politics]]", saying, "We are squabbling about what it means to be deaf."&lt;ref&gt;[[Fox News]]: [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,194885,00.html "Is Gallaudet University's Dean 'Deaf Enough'?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512220728/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,194885,00.html |date=May 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Fernandes "would like to see the institution become more inclusive of people who might not have grown up using sign language," stating that Gallaudet must embrace "all kinds of deaf people."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/14/AR2006051400805.html "Signs of Change At Gallaudet."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061940/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/14/AR2006051400805.html |date=September 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who opposed her said that they feared a "weakening of American Sign Language at an institution that should be its standard-bearer."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/us/13gallaudet.html?ex=1158811200&amp;en=f75aa9c5d1e56b07&amp;ei=5070 "Protests Continue at University for Deaf."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514193506/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/us/13gallaudet.html?ex=1158811200&amp;en=f75aa9c5d1e56b07&amp;ei=5070 |date=May 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters said Fernandes distorted their arguments and that the protest centered on her inability to lead, an unfair selection process and longstanding problems at the school.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/22/AR2006102201086.html "Source of Gallaudet Turmoil Is Up for Debate."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304122518/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/22/AR2006102201086.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring 2006 protest, students blocked entrances to the Gallaudet campus, held rallies, and set up tents near the university's main entrance. Fernandes, appointed to serve as president-designate until Jordan retired, said that she would not step down. On May 8, the faculty gave a vote of no confidence for Fernandes.

When the fall 2006 academic year resumed, some students, faculty, staff, and alumni continued their protest, calling for Fernandes to step down and for the presidential search to be done again. On October 11, a group of protesting students shut down the campus. On October 16 at a regularly scheduled meeting, faculty members voted 138 to 24 to block Fernandes from becoming president of Gallaudet University.

Fernandes said, "I really don't understand so I have to believe it's not about me. ... I believe it's about evolution and change and growth in the deaf community."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/14/AR2006101400375_2.html?nav=hcmodule "Gallaudet Reopens With Protesters Still At Front Gates."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135013/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/14/AR2006101400375_2.html?nav=hcmodule |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, the university withdrew the appointment of Fernandes.&lt;ref&gt;Inside Gallaudet: [http://news.gallaudet.edu/?id=9633 "Board of Trustees votes to terminate Dr. Jane Fernandes appointment as president"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201100255/http://news.gallaudet.edu/?id=9633 |date=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece in ''The Washington Post'', Jordan defended Fernandes's remarks and denounced the board's decision and the actions of the protesters, saying, "I am convinced that the board made a serious error in acceding to the demands of the protesters by terminating Fernandes's presidency before it began."&lt;ref name="Post12-10-06"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/10/AR2006121000242.html Gallaudet Chooses Interim President] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143651/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/10/AR2006121000242.html |date=March 22, 2018 }}, ''Washington Post'', December 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Davila|Robert Davila]] would serve as interim president for a period of up to two years.&lt;ref name="Post1-21-07" /&gt; He was formally installed on May 9, 2007, during a ceremony that included a speech by D.C.

===Redevelopment of campus (2015–2024)===
In October 2014, the Gallaudet University board of trustees announced a 10-year, $450 million development of its campus along 6th Street NE. The development, which includes both campus property as well as college-owned residential and retail property across the street, will be overseen by [[JBG Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.gallaudet.edu/news/6th-street-jbg | title=GALLAUDET SELECTS THE JBG COMPANIES FOR 6TH STREET NE DEVELOPMENT | publisher=Gallaudet University | date=October 11, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803005946/https://www.gallaudet.edu/news/6th-street-jbg | archivedate=August 3, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2014/10/10/gallaudet-selects-jbg-for-campus-development.html | title=Gallaudet Selects JBG for Campus Development | first=Jeff | last=Clabaugh | publisher=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=October 10, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803005245/https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2014/10/10/gallaudet-selects-jbg-for-campus-development.html | archivedate=August 3, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
[[File:Gallaudet baseball team 1886.jpg|right|thumb|Gallaudet baseball team, 1886]]

Gallaudet is a member of [[NCAA Division III]] and the [[North Eastern Athletic Conference]].&lt;ref name="gallaudetathletics.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallaudetathletics.com/sports/generalnews/2008-09/06152009GallaudetJoinsNEAC |title=Gallaudet Bison Athletics : Gallaudet University Joins North Eastern Athletic Conference |publisher=Gallaudetathletics.com |date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwvBIzG?url=http://www.gallaudetathletics.com/sports/generalnews/2008-09/06152009GallaudetJoinsNEAC |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams that play in the North Eastern Athletic Conference are the men's and women's basketball, cross country, soccer teams, along with the baseball, softball, and volleyball teams.&lt;ref name="gallaudetathletics.com"/&gt; However, the Gallaudet football team plays in the [[Eastern Collegiate Football Conference]]. In addition to the football team, which plays in a different conference than most sports at Gallaudet, the men's and women's swimming teams, as well as the men's and women's track and field teams, compete as independents. The Bison compete in [[college baseball|baseball]], [[college basketball|basketball]], [[cross country running]], [[college football|football]], [[track and field|indoor and outdoor track and field]], [[college soccer|soccer]], [[softball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], and [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]]. Their colors are [[buff (color)|buff]] and [[blue]], which were chosen after Union soldiers' uniforms in the Civil War.

===Women's basketball===
Gallaudet women's basketball made its biggest splash in 1999, with a group of players from the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf among those leading the way. [[Ronda Jo Miller]], most certainly the greatest women's basketball player in the program's history, was a three-time Division III All-America selection, as well as one of the top women's volleyball players.

Under the leadership of coach Kitty Baldridge, Miller, Touria Ouahid, Ronda Johnson and Jenny Cooper led the Bison to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three seasons. Receiving one of the lowest seeds as an at-large team into the Division III NCAA Tournament field, which numbered just 48 teams, the Bison traveled to St. Mary's College (Md.), the school which had just defeated them in the Capital Athletic Conference tournament, and came away with an 80-73 win. In the second round, Gallaudet faced a team from The College of New Jersey which had received a first-round bye and was highly favored, but Miller poured in 38 points, using a variety of impressive shots. The Bison advanced to the Sweet 16 round of the 1999 tournament before falling to host school Salem State College (Mass.).&lt;ref name=D3hoops1&gt;{{cite web|title=Beware the Thundering Herd|url=http://www.d3hoops.com/notables/1999/03/beware-thundering-herd-gallaudet|work=D3hoops.com|publisher=D3hoops.com|accessdate=23 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402171942/http://www.d3hoops.com/notables/1999/03/beware-thundering-herd-gallaudet|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller finished with 2,656 points scored, 1,545 rebounds and 373 blocked shots, and was called "one of the best basketball players in Division III history" by the NCAA.&lt;ref name=NCAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Embracing the silence|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/embracing-silence|work=NCAA.org|publisher=NCAA.org|accessdate=23 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312153846/http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/embracing-silence|archivedate=March 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Cook coached the team briefly to success. The team had not won a conference game in five years and even lost a game by 75 points in Cook's first year in charge.&lt;ref name=ABC_WomensBball&gt;{{cite news|last=Donvan|first=John|title=Gallaudet University Making Noise in Women's Basketball|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/gallaudet-university-making-noise-womens-basketball/story?id=12908803|accessdate=14 May 2013|date=February 3, 2011|agency=ABC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwvu5ej?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/gallaudet-university-making-noise-womens-basketball/story?id=12908803|archivedate=April 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's persistence on defense and discipline turned the program around. Gallaudet began the 2010–11 season on a 20-game winning streak and finished the season 24–4 (20–2 in conference play). Cook was named North Eastern Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, and senior Easter Faafiti was voted NEAC Player of the Year.

After a victory over Penn State-Berks in the 2010–11 season, Penn State guard Corin Bishop "said that she views the Gallaudet team as a great basketball team, not a team of deaf players." Hayes of Gallaudet later said, "I feel like there are people who stereotype us as deaf players, I'm just like everyone else who plays basketball".&lt;ref name=ABC_WomensBball/&gt; In an interview with Lydia Lum of ''Diverse'', he said, "Because of us, there's a growing awareness that there are differences between deaf people, but we're all the same."&lt;ref name=Lum&gt;{{cite web|last=Lum|first=Lydia|title=Gallaudet Women on the Road to Winner's Circle|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/14820/|work=Diverse Issues in Higher Education|publisher=Cox, Matthews and Assoc.|accessdate=14 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026014811/http://diverseeducation.com/article/14820/|archivedate=October 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Gallaudet Bison football}}
The [[American football|football]] [[huddle]] originated at Gallaudet when the team noticed that their opponents were trying to see and read their signs in order to try to guess their plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pr.gallaudet.edu/GallaudetHistory/page3.html |title=The History of Gallaudet University (page 3) |publisher=Pr.gallaudet.edu |date=November 7, 1997 |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415005157/http://pr.gallaudet.edu/GallaudetHistory/page3.html |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an undefeated season in 2005, which was achieved after 122 years, head coach Ed Hottle began his campaign to return Gallaudet to the NCAA ranks. With support from the Gallaudet administration, the Bison played their last season of club football in 2006 and played a full NCAA slate of eight games in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081501367.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Sound and the Fury | first=Brooke | last=Foster | date=August 19, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108072855/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/15/AR2007081501367.html | archivedate=November 8, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2009 football season, Coach Hottle left to become the first head coach of the first football team at [[Stevenson University]]. He announced his decision in a heart-felt meeting with the football team. Offensive Coordinator Chuck Goldstein was tapped to be the interim head coach of the football team. On December 17, 2009, the interim tag was removed and he is now the permanent head coach of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldstein Named Gallaudet's 36th Head Football Coach, Davis Elevated to Assistant Coach|url=http://gallaudetathletics.com/sports/fball/2009-10/releases/coachingmoves|publisher=Gallaudet University|accessdate=16 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185930/http://gallaudetathletics.com/sports/fball/2009-10/releases/coachingmoves|archivedate=March 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallaudet University's football team has a longstanding rivalry with [[Catholic University Cardinals football|Catholic University of America]], another school in the Washington D.C. area. On September 7, 2012, Gallaudet University defeated Catholic University of America for the first time in the 106-year history of the rivalry between the two D.C. schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallaudet Defeats Catholic for the First Time in the School History|url=http://www.gallaudetathletics.com/sports/fball/2012-13/releases/recap_catholic|publisher=Gallaudet University Athletics|accessdate=7 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920062525/http://www.gallaudetathletics.com/sports/fball/2012-13/releases/recap_catholic|archivedate=September 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2013, Gallaudet's football program began a remarkable run for the Division III playoffs and garnering a considerable amount of publicity, winning the regular season with a 9-1 record, before falling to [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] in the first round of the playoffs and ending the season with a 9-2 (.818) overall record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/11/gallaudet-football-prepares-for-first-ever-playoff-game-97237.html|title=Gallaudet football prepares for first ever playoff game|first=The Associated|last=Press|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216102112/http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/11/gallaudet-football-prepares-for-first-ever-playoff-game-97237.html|archivedate=December 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnycentral.com/m/news/story?id=976784#.Uq7Ft3i9LCQ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216102243/http://www.cnycentral.com/m/news/story?id=976784 |date=December 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gates to the Temple of Medamud''' are two monumental gateways to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic-era]] phase of the [[Temple of Montu (Medamud)|Temple of Montu]] at [[Medamud]], located to the north of Luxor on the right bank of the Nile. They are now in the collections of the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]].

The earlier of the two, the Gate of [[Ptolemy III]], is only partly conserved but retains traces of its paintwork. Its bas-reliefs suggest it marked the entrance to an offerings room inside the temple. The later gate, the Gate of [[Ptolemy IV]], could be wholly reconstructed and probably marked one of the main entrances to the temple.

This is only one measure of affluence and not necessarily the most suitable for all purposes. Different measures, such as mean income per capita, would produce different lists.

| [[Psychosurgery]]
|
|
| 1880s
|Psychosurgery (also called neurosurgery for [[mental disorder]]) has a long history. During the 1960s and 1970s, it became the subject of increasing public concern and debate, culminating in the US with congressional hearings. Particularly controversial was the work of Harvard neurosurgeon [[Vernon Mark]] and psychiatrist [[Frank Ervin]], who wrote a book entitled ''Violence and the Brain'' in 1970.&lt;ref name="Mashour"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2004.09.002 | last1 = Mashour | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Walker | first2 = E.E. | last3 = Martuza | first3 = R.L. | year = 2005 | title = Psychosurgery: past, present and future | url = | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 409–18 | pmid=15914249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1977 endorsed the continued limited use of psychosurgical procedures.&lt;ref name="Mashour"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0269889714000349 | last1 = Casey | first1 = B.P. | title =  The surgical elimination of violence?

In the US and other Western countries, the number of operations has further declined over the past 30 years, a period during which there have been no major advances in ablative psychosurgery.&lt;ref name="Sachdev"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831c8475 | last1 = Sachdev | first1 = P. | last2 = Chen | first2 = X. | year = 2009 | title = Neurosurgical treatment of mood disorders: traditional psychosurgery and the advent of deep brain stimulation | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 25–31 | pmid = 19122531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[The Monster Study]]
| United States
| Iowa
| 1939
| The Monster Study is the name given to a [[stuttering]] experiment performed on orphan children in [[Davenport, Iowa]] in 1939. It was conducted by [[Wendell Johnson]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. The research began with the selection of 22 subjects from a veterans' orphanage in Iowa. None were told the intent of the research, and they believed that they were to receive speech therapy. The study was trying to induce stuttering in healthy children. The experiment became national news in the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' in 2001, and a book was written. On 17 August 2007, six of the orphan children were awarded $925,000 by the State of Iowa for lifelong psychological and emotional scars caused by six months of torment during the Iowa University experiment. Although none of the children became stutterers, some became self-conscious and reluctant to speak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6952446.stm Huge payout in US stuttering case] – BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the University of Iowa called the experiment "regrettable".

The trial data suggested that the drug was not efficacious and that the paroxetine group were more likely to think about suicide. The paper that wrote up the study was published in 2001, osensibly authored by a group of academics, but actually ghostwritten by the drug company. The article downplayed the negative findings and concluded that paroxetine helped with teenage depression. The company used this paper to promote paroxetine for teenagers. The ensuing controversy led to several lawsuits, including from the parents of teenagers who killed themselves while taking the drug, and intensified the debate about [[medical ghostwriting]] and [[conflict of interest]] in clinical trials. In 2012 the US Justice Department fined GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion for several violations, including withholding data on paroxetine, unlawfully promoting it for adolescents, and preparing a misleading article about study 329.

They wanted the hospital to allow them to travel to the U.S. for an experimental therapy that may have provided some temporary benefit but likely would not have improved his neurological condition, due to a [[mitochondrial DNA]] depletion disease (the treatment is [[nucleoside bypass therapy]]). At the least, they wanted for the hospital to continue to provide [[advanced life support]] [[palliative care]] for their son—respiration, nutrition, hydration—or to send him home on life support to eventually die, but those requests were also denied and support was turned off on July 27th, 2017. Gard died the next day.

[[File:Datuk shrine Pulau Pangkor 2007 006.jpg|thumb|250px|Shrine of Panglima Hijau, a ''Datuk'' or (in Malaysian Chinese) ''[[Na Tuk Kong]]'', a [[tutelary deity|god of the place]] on [[Pangkor Island]].]]

'''Malaysian folk religion''' refers to the [[animism|animistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs and practices that are still held by many in the [[Islam]]ic-majority country of [[Malaysia]]. Malaysian folk faith is practiced either openly or covertly depending on the type of rituals performed. 

Some forms of belief are not recognised by the government as a religion for statistical purposes although such practices are not outlawed. There is a deep interaction between the [[Chinese folk religion]] of the large [[Malaysian Chinese]] population, and the indigenous Malaysian folk religion.

==Overview==
{{see also|Datuk Keramat}}
[[File:Poh-San-Teng-2290.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Poh San Teng Temple]] is the oldest temple dedicated to the [[Hakka people|Hakka]]n ancestral figure of [[Tua Pek Kong]], reputedly one of the first settlers of [[Penang]]; it was built in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazingmelaka.com/2011/12/sam-po-keng-temple/|title=Sam Po Keng Temple|work=AmazingMelaka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are different types of Malaysian folk religion practised throughout the country. [[shamanism|Shamanic]] performances are held by people known as ''[[dukun]]s'', otherwise also known as ''dukun'' or ''pawang''. Most [[Orang Asli]] (indigenous people) are [[animism|animists]] and believe in spirits residing in certain objects. However, some have recently converted to mainstream religions due to state-sponsored Muslim [[dawah]] or [[evangelism]] by Christian missionaries.

In [[Indonesia]], indigenous religions are also practised by various [[Borneo|Bornean]] tribal groups. [[Chinese Indonesians]] generally practice folk religion, which is also animistic in nature. The word ''bomoh'' has been used throughout the country to describe any person with knowledge or power to perform certain spiritual rituals including traditional healing, and as a substitute for the word "shaman". Generally speaking, Indonesians have deep [[superstition|superstitious]] beliefs, especially more so in the rural areas.

==History==
[[File:Da Bogong Temple Kusu Island.JPG|thumb|[[Tua Pek Kong]] Temple on [[Kusu Island]], [[Singapore]].]]
Historically, before the arrival and spread of [[Islam]] in the 15th century, and the spread of [[Christianity]] from the 19th century, the inhabitants in the land were either [[Hindu]] or practiced indigenous faiths. In the peninsula, widespread [[Islamization]] is said to have begun in 1409 after [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] became [[Sultanate of Malacca|Sultan of Malacca]] and converted to [[Islam]] after marrying a princess from the [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate]]. Since then, other Sultanates in the Malay peninsula have adopted Islam. Also since then, and continuing after the independence of Malaysia, Islam played a central role in Malaysian society.

Similarly in East Malaysia, folk religion was widespread prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries from Europe. The practice of [[headhunting]] was quite common in these societies.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Susan, [http://www.seasite.niu.edu/crossroads/russell/headhunting.htm "Head-hunting in Southeast Asia"], ''Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University''. Accessed 15 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sabah]], the [[Kadazan-Dusun]]s worshipped [[Kinoingan]], a rice deity, and celebrate [[Kaamatan]], the harvest festival, every year. During Kaamatan, there are certain rituals which has to be carried out by the high priestesses known as ''[[bobohizan]]s'' (or ''bobolian'' in the Bundu-Liwan dialect of [[Dusun language|Dusun]]). Today, most Kadazan-Dusuns have adopted Christianity, but some still celebrate Kaamatan. However, the number of bobohizans has tremendously dropped and this role is on the brink of extinction.&lt;ref name=dailyexpress&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=29782 "Set up knowledge academy on traditional healing: Pairin  "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234850/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=29782 |date=26 September 2007 }}, ''Daily Express'', 6 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Sarawak]], it has been said that the animism practised by the [[Iban people|Ibans]] and other related groups is the most developed, elaborated, and intellectualised in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Cavendish, Richard]], [[Man, Myth &amp; Magic (encyclopedia)|"Man, Myth &amp; Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural (vol. 3)"]], New York: Marshall Cavendish Corp. (1970); [http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_29.html pg. 312]. Accessed 13 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk religious practice in East Malaysia is related to the religion of [[Kaharingan]] in [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], which has been recognised as an official religion by the Indonesian government. However, the rituals involved are not entirely similar with variations depending on the ethnic subgroups which practices it.

==Shamanism and traditional healing==
{{main|Bomoh|Dukun|Pawang}}
The shamans ''bomohs'' or [[witch doctor]]s still practice their craft in Malaysia. The bomoh practice by Malays have been [[syncretism|integrated]] into Islam and is not forbidden.&lt;ref name=islamonline&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/english/Science/2002/10/article16.shtml "Malaysian Bomoh Practitioners: a Dying Breed"], ''Islam Online''. Accessed 12 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as [[traditional medicine|traditional healers]] and sometimes serve as an alternative to conventional modern medicine. However, the practice has sometimes been viewed negatively by Malaysian society as in some instances bomohs have the power to cast spells (jampi) and have used them on other people with ill effects. The number practitioners of bomohs has also dropped.&lt;ref name="islamonline" /&gt;

The bobohizans of Sabah are also shamans and are traditional healers. They also act as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate with spirits and play an important role in the rituals involved during Kaamatan, a harvest festival celebration of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]].

Recently there has been suggestions for the need and importance to preserve the practice of bomohs and other shamans as traditional healers and to complement or substitute conventional modern medicine.&lt;ref name="dailyexpress" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=184419 "Bomoh And Malays Are Inseparable, Says Don"], ''Bernama'', 8 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysian Chinese Gods==
{{main|Na Tuk Kong|Tua Pek Kong|}}
[[File:Pagoda of Tua Pek Kong Temple.JPG|thumb|A pagoda of [[Tua Pek Kong Temple, Sibu]].]]
'''Tua Pek Kong''' ({{zh|c=大伯公|p=Dàbó Gōng}}, [[Hakka]]: Thai phak koong, [[Hokkien]]: Tuā-peh-kong, {{lang-ms|Topekong}}. lit. "grand uncle") is one of the pantheon of [[Shenism in Southeast Asia|Malaysian Chinese deities]]. He is believed to have arrived in [[Penang]] 40 years before [[Francis Light]] in 1746. 

Tua Pek Kong is said to have been a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] named Zhang Li ({{zh|c=张理}}). His [[Sumatra]]-bound boat was struck by wind and accidentally landed on [[Penang]] off Malaysia, which at that time had only 50 inhabitants. After his death, the local people began worshipping him and built the Tua Pek Kong temple there. Today Tua Pek Kong is worshipped by Malaysian Chinese throughout the country.

==Chinese folk religion==
{{Further|Shenism in Southeast Asia}}
Today most of the Chinese population in Malaysia are [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]], while the rest are [[Confucianism|Confucianist]], [[Daoism|Taoist]], Christians, and a small number of Muslims and Hindus. Most Chinese Malaysians still adhere to Chinese folk religion or [[veneration of the dead]] in tandem with mainstream religious practices. 

Some have stopped practising this religion after adopting a mainstream religion which prohibits animism or [[idolatry]]. As is the case in [[China]], the practice of this religion is not documented by the government for statistics purpose. Thus the number of followers in Malaysia can only be estimated.

{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}

In [[linguistics]], '''mama''' and '''papa''' are considered a special case of [[false cognate]]s.  In many [[language]]s of the world, sequences of sounds similar to {{IPA|/mama/}} and {{IPA|/papa/}} mean "[[mother]]" and "[[father]]", usually but not always in that order.  This is thought to be a coincidence resulting from the process of early  [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name="Jakobson"&gt;[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson, R.]] (1962) [https://archive.org/stream/selectedwritings01jako#page/538/mode/2up "Why 'mama' and 'papa'?"] In Jakobson, R. ''Selected Writings, Vol. I: Phonological Studies'', pp. 538–545. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;[[Johanna Nichols|Nichols, J.]] (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tBsd89VO4HsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA253 "Why 'me' and 'thee'?"] ''Historical Linguistics 1999: Selected Papers from the 14th International Conference on Historical Linguistics'', Vancouver, 9–13 August 1999,  ed. Laurel J. Brinton, John Benjamins Publishing, 2001, pages 253-276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bancel"&gt;Bancel, P.J. and A.M. de l'Etang. (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MV46AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417 "The Age of Mama and Papa"] Bengtson J. D. In ''Hot Pursuit of Language in Prehistory: Essays in the four fields of anthropology.'' (John Benjamins Publishing, Dec 3, 2008), pages 417-438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bancel-2"&gt;Bancel, P.J. and A.M. de l'Etang. (2013) [https://books.google.com/books?id=S64bAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA333 "Brave new words"] In ''New Perspectives on the Origins of Language'', ed. C. Lefebvre, B. Comrie, H. Cohen (John Benjamins Publishing, Nov 15, 2013), pages 333-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

These terms use speech sounds that are among the easiest to produce: bilabials like {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, and {{IPA|/b/}}, and the open vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.  They are, therefore, often among the first word-like sounds made by [[babbling]] babies ('''babble words'''), and parents tend to associate the first sound babies make with themselves and to employ them subsequently as part of their [[Baby talk|baby-talk]] lexicon. Thus, there is no need to ascribe to common ancestry the similarities of [[!Kung language|!Kung]] ''ba'', [[Aramaic]] ''abba'', [[Mandarin Chinese]] ''bàba'', and [[Persian language|Persian]] ''baba'' (all "father"); or [[Navajo language|Navajo]] ''amá'', [[Mandarin Chinese]] ''māma'', [[Swahili language|Swahili]] ''mama'', [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] ''mama'', and [[Polish language|Polish]] ''mama'' (all "mother").  For the same reason, some scientists believe that 'mama' and 'papa' were among the first words that humans spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gosline|first1=Anna|title=Family words came first for early humans|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6188-family-words-came-first-for-early-humans.html#.VXqzvvntlBc|publisher=NEW SCIENTIST|date=26 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, there is nothing of motherhood or fatherhood inherent in the sounds.

Variants using other sounds do occur: for example, in Fijian, the word for "mother" is ''nana'', the  Turkish word is ''ana'', and in [[Old Japanese]], the word for "mother" was ''papa''. The modern Japanese word for "father," ''chichi'', is from older ''titi''.  Very few languages lack labial consonants (this mostly being attested on a family basis, in the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] and some of the [[Athabaskan languages]]), and only [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]] is known to lack an open vowel /a/. The Tagalog ''-na-'' / ''-ta-'' ("mom" / "dad" words) parallel the more common ''ma'' / ''pa'' in nasality / orality of the consonants and identity of place of articulation.  

The linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] hypothesized that the nasal sound in "mama" comes from the nasal murmur that babies produce when breastfeeding:

{{Quote|text=Often the sucking activities of a child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation which can be produced when the lips are pressed to mother’s breast or to the feeding bottle and the mouth full. Later, this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal at the mere sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish. When the mouth is free from nutrition, the nasal murmur may be supplied with an oral, particularly labial release; it may also obtain an optional vocalic support. |author=Roman Jakobson |source=Why 'Mama' and 'Papa'?}}

* Though ''amma'' and ''nana'' are used in [[Tulu language|Tulu]], they are not really Tulu words but used due to the influence of neighboring states' languages. The actual words for ''mother'' in Tulu is ''nane'' pronounced {{IPA-all|nane}} and the word for ''father'' in Tulu is ''amme'' pronounced {{IPA-all|amæ}}. Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages (similar to [[Georgian language|Georgian]] in that sense).
* In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], "''Thalli''" and "''Thandri''" are used for mother and father in formal Telugu. ''Tata'' and ''nana or pa'' are used for mother and father for the informal way. Notice how ''nana'' refers to ''maternal grandfather'' in Hindi, and how that differs from its Telugu meaning. "''Nayana''" is also used for father in informal Telugu in the [[Rayalaseema]] region of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] of India. Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages (similar to [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] in that sense).
* In [[Malayalam]], the word for mother is  "''Amma''" and for father is "''Achan''". In scholastic usage, ''Mathav'' and ''Pithav'' are used respectively. "''Achan''" is a transformed Malayalam equivalent of the Sanskrit "''Arya''" for "Sir/Master" (''Arya'' - ''ajja'' -&gt; ''ayya)''. Other words like "''Appan''", "'Bappa'" etc. are also used for father, and words such as "''Umma''", "''Ammachi''" for mother.
* In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], "''Thaai''" and "''Thanthai''" are the formal Tamil words for mother and father; informally ''Amma'' and ''Appa'' are much more common words for mother and father respectively.
*In the [[Kannada]] language, "''Thaayi''" for mother and "''Thande''" for father are used formally. But to address them informally Kannadigas use ''amma'' for mother and ''appa'' for father.

===Uralic languages===
* [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''ema''
* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''apa'' means "father" and ''anya'' means mother, which tends to use open vowels such as {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. For formal usage, these words are applied, but both ''mama'' and ''papa'' are used as well, in informal speech. For family internal addressing, ''apu'' and ''anyu'' (variants of "apa" and "anya," respectively) are also used.
* [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''emä'' (note: The use of "emä" is considered archaic in the meaning "mother of a child". The modern word is "äiti" derived from Gothic "aiþei".)

===Indo-European languages===
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]  nena/nëna / mama

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Description'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS) satisfies a variety of broad academic and [[vocational]] purposes. It can be suited to the [[pastor]], [[layman]] or beginning academic as an entry level Master's Degree in [[theology]]. It is often geared toward individuals seeking an introductory [[graduate degree]] in religion for service in a supportive role in their local [[Local church|congregation]]. Depending upon the school, the program can vary from as little as 36 [[semester]]/54 quarter hours up to 48 [[semester]]/72 quarter hours typically. It may or may not include a [[thesis]], [http://edglossary.org/capstone-project/ capstone] or summation. Frequently, it is a classwork only degree.

'''Programs of Study'''
&lt;br&gt;
The degree may take several differing forms such as:
M.A.T.S. (General [[theology]] degree non-specified)
[[Biblical Studies]]
[[Systematic Theology]]
[[Old Testament]]
[[New Testament]]
[[Historical Theology]]
[[Christian Apologetics]]

'''[[Accreditation]]'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies is a degree recognized by [http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html accrediting agencies] such as the [[Association of Theological Schools|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]), [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|TRACS]] ([[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]), the [[Association for Biblical Higher Education|ABHE]] ([[Association for Biblical Higher Education]]) and other accrediting bodies. It is classified as a Category D: Basic Program Oriented Toward General Theological Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/accrediting-standards-architecture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]).

'''Degree Status'''
&lt;br&gt;
While requiring only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the credit hours that are required of a [[Master of Divinity|M.Div]] ([[Master of Divinity]]), it is generally considered equal as a prerequisite for entering advanced degree programs such as for an [[Master of Sacred Theology|STM]] ([[Master of Sacred Theology]]) or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral studies]]. However, the student will likely be required to know (or learn remedially) [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or another [[modern language]] in order to enter an advanced degree program if they haven't learned these yet.

'''Mr. Tickle''' is the first book in the ''[[Mr. Men]]'' series by [[Roger Hargreaves]], published 10 August 1971.

The story was originally based on a question by his son, [[Adam Hargreaves]], who asked what a [[Tickling|tickle]] would look like.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Plot==
Mr. Tickle's story begins with him in bed and making himself breakfast without getting up because of his "extraordinarily long arms". He then decides that it is a [[tickling]] sort of day and thus journeys around town tickling people – a teacher, a policeman, a greengrocer, a child, a station guard, a pilot, a doctor, a butcher and a postman. The book ends with a warning that Mr. Tickle could be lurking around your doorway, waiting to tickle you or your children.

It is a relatively unusual Mr. Men book in that the main character gets up to some naughty behaviour, yet there is no corrective action taken to mend his mischievous ways; thus, Mr. Tickle is left free to tickle another day and learns nothing from it.

==''The Mr. Men Show''==
In the 2008 TV series ''[[The Mr. Men Show]]'', Mr. Tickle remains relatively the same in looks, though his hat has a stripe and his arms are normally sized, but can stretch out when needed. However, he tickles other Mr. Men and Little Misses (due to the obvious absence of humans in Dillydale). As far as character traits go, he is still determined to tickle everyone he interacts with, but instead of doing it for mischief he does it to make people happy and will stop when nobody wants him to tickle them, save for when the opportunity knocks with Mr. Grumpy, who appears to be his favorite target. He also gets his own catchphrase, "Somebody needs a tickle!" In the US and UK Versions, he is voiced by [[Jeff Stewart (voice actor)|Jeff Stewart]] and [[Rob Rackstraw]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2464">'''Nosism''', from the Latin ''nos'', "we", is the practice of using the pronoun "[[we]]" to refer to oneself when expressing a personal opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Compact Edition, 1989, Page 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nosism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordsmith.org/words/nosism.html |title=A.Word.A.Day – nosism |accessdate=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the person using the nosism different uses can be distinguished:

== Royal "we" or ''pluralis majestatis'' ==
{{Main|Royal we}}

The royal "we" (''pluralis majestatis'') refers to a single person holding a high office, such as a [[monarch]], [[bishop]], or [[pope]].

=={{anchor|Editorial we}} Editorial "we"==
The editorial "we" is a similar phenomenon, in which an [[editorial]] [[columnist]] in a newspaper or a similar commentator in another medium refers to themselves as ''we'' when giving their opinion. Here, the writer casts themselves in the role of a [[spokesperson]]: either for the media institution that employs them, or more generally on behalf of the party or body of citizens who agree with the commentary.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Author's "we" or ''pluralis modestiae'' {{Anchor|pluralis modestiae}}==
Similar to the editorial "we", ''pluralis modestiae'' is the practice common in mathematical and scientific literature of referring to a generic [[Grammatical person|third person]] by ''we'' (instead of the more common ''one'' or the informal ''you''):
* ''By adding four and five, we obtain nine.''
* ''We are thus led also to a definition of "time" in physics.'' – [[Albert Einstein]]

"We" in this sense often refers to "the reader and the author," since the author often assumes that the reader knows and agrees with certain principles or previous theorems for the sake of brevity (or, if not, the reader is prompted to look them up).

This practice is discouraged in the social sciences because it fails to distinguish between sole authorship and co-authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1557982414|page=30|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pronunciation''' is the way in which a word or a [[language]] is spoken.  This may refer to generally agreed-upon sequences of sounds used in speaking a given word or language in a specific [[dialect]] ("correct pronunciation"), or simply the way a particular individual speaks a word or language.

A word can be spoken in different ways by various individuals or groups, depending on many factors, such as: the duration of the cultural exposure of their childhood, the location of their current residence, [[speech disorder|speech]] or [[list of voice disorders|voice disorders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beech |first=John R. |last2=Harding |first2=Leonora |last3=Hilton-Jones |first3=Diana |title=Assessment in Speech and Language Therapy |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=tMQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 |chapter=Assessment of Articulation and Phonology |chapter-url=https://books.google.es/books?id=tMQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 |editor-last=Grunwell |editor-first=Pam |year=1993 |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |isbn=0-415-07882-2 |page=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; their [[ethnic group]], their [[social class]], or their [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings |last=Paulston |first=Christina Bratt |last2=Tucker |first2=G.

==Linguistic terminology==
Syllables are counted as units of sound ([[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]) that they use in their [[language]].  The branch of [[linguistics]] which studies these units of sound is [[phonetics]].  Phones which play the same role are grouped together into classes called [[phoneme]]s; the study of these is phonemics or phonematics or [[phonology]].  Phones as components of articulation are usually described using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=Tanja |date=June 12, 2006 |title=Multilingual Speech Processing |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=LC2WKbEr85YC&amp;pg=PA12 |chapter=Language Characteristics |chapter-url=https://books.google.es/books?id=LC2WKbEr85YC&amp;pg=PA5 |editor-last=Kirchhoff |editor-first=Katrin | page=12 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=0-12-088501-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23370">'''Public interest law''' loosely, refers to legal practices undertaken to help poor or marginalized people, or to effect change in social policies in the public interest, on 'not for profit' terms ([[pro bono|''pro bono publico'']]). In general terms it means a legal action initiated in the court of law for the protection of Public Interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/nature-and-importance-of-public.html Nature and Importance of Public Interest Litigation], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not a body of law or a legal field, matters lawyers work on. Rather, it denotes the clientele they represent. Instead of serving powerful economic interests, it stands for the advocacy of otherwise under-represented or vulnerable individuals, especially those living in poverty. It has grown to encompass a broader range of activities, typically the field of non-lawyers like civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forster|first1=Christine M. (University of New South Wales, Sydney)|last2=Jivan|first2=Vedna (University of Technology Sydney, Sydney)|title=Public Interest Litigation and Human Rights Implementation: The Indian and Australian Experience|url=https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/10475/2007005097OK.pdf#page=4|page=3|journal=Asian Journal of Comparative Law|publisher=The Berkeley Electronic Press|year=2008|accessdate=8 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210072159/https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/10475/2007005097OK.pdf#page=4|archivedate=10 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a common ethic for public-interest lawyers in a growing number of countries remains “fighting for the little guy”.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central and Eastern Europe ==
At the end of the communist period in the early 1990s, the national legal systems of Central and Eastern Europe were still in a formative stage. The most important source of legal authority for the new human rights groups came from outside the region: the [[Council of Europe]], with its [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Rekosh&gt;Edwin Rekosh, Constructing Public Interest Law: Transnational Collaboration and Exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, 13 UCLA J. Int'l L.&amp; For. Aff.55, 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, in the mid-1990s, U.S. experiences became more relevant. The Council of Europe's prerequisite that lawyers use their own country's courts first to seek legal remedies before turning to the European bodies gradually became more than a pro forma exercise, and civil society organizations began to make more effective use of domestic means of adjudication. But by the time local activists were ready to consider the utility of [[impact litigation]], test cases, and other tactics familiar from the U.S. experience, they already understood that their ultimate tactical weapon in any piece of litigation was to use the threat or reality of a supportive decision at the European Court of Human Rights. With this background in mind, it made more sense for the promoters of public interest law in Central and Eastern Europe to talk about "strategic litigation" than about public interest litigation. Using the instrumentality of the European Court of Human Rights effectively required a strategic approach. Not all human rights cases were likely to receive a favorable ruling; a negative ruling could produce more damage to the human rights cause than no ruling at all. The European Court had a rich case law that could provide clues to how a future case might be decided, and there were procedural aspects, such as the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, to consider.

The core lesson from the U.S. experience for local activists was how courts could be used effectively as a tool for civil society engagement in governance.&lt;ref name=Rekosh /&gt;
== Italy ==
The changes to the Italian electoral law from 2014 to 2017 were both "caused by actions born from the bottom (...) the result of a methodical, studied and concerted action. It has been featured by university professors, constitutional and electoral law-makers, parliamentarians and other elected representatives (...), representatives of civil society and ordinary citizens. Their names are, as voters, in more than twenty introductory pleadings (quotations or appeals)"&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.nomos-leattualitaneldiritto.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/maestri-2.pdf Gabriele Maestri, ''ORIZZONTI DI TECNICA ELETTORALE: PROBLEMI SUPERATI, IRRISOLTI ED EMERSI ALLA LUCE DELLA SENTENZA N. 35 DEL 2017'', Nomos, n. 2/2017].&lt;/ref&gt;, all of them brought [[pro bono]].

==China==
Public interest law (公益法, pronounced Gong Yi Fa) is an accepted term in China, where the basic institutions supporting the rule of law are still extremely nascent. China does not have a common-law system in which lawyers are expected to play a key role in “making law.”  Nevertheless, a small but effective community of lawyers has gained acceptance of public interest litigation as a legitimate means of resolving social issues and contributing to a harmonious society, and non-governmental actors have significantly improved the enforcement of rights for migrant workers, women, children and those suffering from environmental degradation, among others. For example, public interest lawyers in China have filed lawsuits in court successfully challenging workplace sexual harassment and the involuntary confinement of healthy people to mental hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2011 Annual Report, Parts II and III (October 10, 2011), available at {{cite web |url=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223223/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}; see generally R.P. Peerenboom, China's Long March toward Rule of Law (Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese reformers believe that one avenue for speeding the development of public interest law is implementing an associational standing rule by which organizations can instigate lawsuits to protect the interests of its members. Currently, China’s Civil Procedure Law is undergoing revision. One of the proposed amendments would create a form of associational standing. In theory, the new law would give domestic NGOs the power to file lawsuits in their own name on behalf of their members, but the proposed amendment has engendered spirited debate and its fate is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Draft limits scale of class-action lawsuits|work= [[China Daily]]|date= April 24, 2012|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-04/25/content_15131945.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Public interest law in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong public interest law is an emerging field. The chief vehicle for pursuing public interest claims is judicial review. This is the process by which decisions of the government are challenged in the courts. There has been a surge in judicial review cases since 2000. Environmental issues&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2004/27.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(Society%20for%20Protection%20of%20the%20Harbour%20Ltd%20and%20Town%20Planning%20Board) Society for Protection of the Harbour Ltd v Town Planning Board] [2004] 1 HKLRD 396; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/757.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Clean%20Air%20Foundation%20Ltd Clean Air Foundation Ltd v The Government of the HKSAR] [2007] HKEC 1356.&lt;/ref&gt; and minority rights&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/39.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(W%20and%20Registrar%20of%20Marriages) W v Registrar of Marriages] [2013] HKCFA 39; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/17.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Vallejos%20Evangeline%20Banao Vallejos Evangeline Banao v Commissioner of Registration &amp; Anor] [2013] HKCFA 17.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most litigated areas.

One of the pioneers in public interest law in Hong Kong was Pamela Baker. In the late 1980s she litigated a series of landmark courtroom cases challenging the government’s treatment of Vietnamese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Geoffrey. [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries ''"Pam Baker"''], ''"[[The Guardian]]"'', Saturday 27 April 2002. Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] was established with the aim of promoting better human rights protection in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk|title=基本法第廿三條|website=www.hkhrm.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the majority of [[Cause lawyering | cause lawyers]] who represent citizens and social groups in human rights and public policy litigation on a consistent basis in Hong Kong are also members of political parties or active participants in social movements outside the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, the [[Legal Aid Department]] provides funding to legal services for those who pass the means and merits test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lad.gov.hk/eng/las/overview.html|title=Legal Aid Department - Legal Aid Schemes - Overview|website=www.lad.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Legal Aid Schemes that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 673.&lt;/ref&gt; However, NGOs and charitable organizations are not eligible to get legal aid.&lt;ref name="karen"&gt;Kong, Karen. "Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?" 39 HKLJ 767, 768.&lt;/ref&gt; The NGOs and Charitable organizations contributed to opening of avenues for people who deserved justice but lacked interest to approach courts and helped them in becoming petitioners to get justice.

Apart from legal aid, the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] and [[The Law Society of Hong Kong]] jointly provides the Duty Lawyer Scheme which offers free legal representation to eligible defendants on the first day of court appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/duty/duty.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Duty Lawyer Scheme : The Duty Lawyer Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also run the Free Legal Advice Scheme at their Legal Advice Centres within nine District Offices in Hong Kong with the aim to provide one-off preliminary legal advice to the general public without imposing any means test.&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/free/free.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Free Legal Advice Scheme : Free Legal Advice Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong operate their own Bar Free Legal Service Scheme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ archived] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073406/http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Free Legal Consultation Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choosehklawyer.org/en/search_fl_start.asp|title=ChooseHKLawyer|website=www.choosehklawyer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively where enrolled law firms and barristers specializing in different fields volunteer to give consultations on a pro bono basis.&lt;ref name="chung"&gt;Chung, Eugenie. "Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse" 40 [2010] HKLJ 719, 731-732.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, unlike in the United States where NGOs and public interest law groups routinely bring public interest lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved individuals, in-house counsel working in NGOs and charities in Hong Kong are not allowed to directly represent the people these organizations serve.&lt;ref&gt;Precht, Robert. [http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1310978/more-public-interest-lawyers-can-help-ease-hong-kongs-social "More public interest lawyers can help ease Hong Kong's social tensions], ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (17 September 2013). Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators believe that the inability of NGOs to directly represent clients in legal proceedings has dampened the growth of public interest law in Hong Kong.

Law schools in Hong Kong also organize various programs to promote the idea of ''pro bono'' legal service to students.&lt;ref name="hkuscheme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ke.hku.hk/eng/highlights/2010/legal|title=KE Spotlight - Community Engagement - HKU Knowledge Exchange|website=www.ke.hku.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro bono committees of law firms in Hong Kong also meet on a bimonthly basis in the Hong Kong Legal Community Roundtable, a forum for international law firms to discuss development of pro bono work in Hong Kong and the region.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer Brown LLP, [http://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/d3066e31-ce28-4bef-8230-0ae6dc5897d2/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/575b4443-1989-4db6-be21-19736d732225/ProBonoUpdate_042010.pdf "Pro Bono Update" (Spring 2010)], page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
{{See also|Public interest litigation in India}}
"Public Interest Litigation" or PIL right since its inception in the Indian judicial system,&lt;ref name="Mother of PIL"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rajagopal|first1=Krishnadas|title=Starting the PIL revolution|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/starting-the-pil-revolution/571616/|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=The Indian Express|date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown some good examples of safeguarding the rights of the people of India and has strengthened the position of the [[Supreme Court of India]] as preeminent guardian of Fundamental Rights enumerated in the [[Indian Constitution]]. It was introduced in India around 1979-80 by the Supreme Court judges, Justice [[V. R. Krishna Iyer]] along with Justice [[P. N. Bhagwati]]. And since then there had been instances when the Courts are keen to decide the matters of public importance without delay, as the case in Shyam sundar where the court accepted the matter even when the application was made by a letter sent through post.

==United States==
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Brandeis|Brandeis]] (center) in his office 1916.]]

“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built on a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists"] (Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work—wishing to affect the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Summing up the movement's history in the United States, Stanford University Law Professor Deborah Rhode writes: "Public interest lawyers have saved lives, protected fundamental rights, established crucial principles, transformed institutions, and ensured essential benefits for those who need them most....In virtually every major American social reform movement of the last half century, public interest lawyers have played an important role."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L.Rhode, Public Interest Law: the Movement and Midlife, 60 Stan.L.Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Public interest law is institutionalized in the United States(USA). Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that work to promote and protect human rights using the U.S. legal system, fight to protect the environment, or advocate on behalf of consumers, call themselves public interest law organizations. A large community of lawyers practices public interest law in the form of providing [[legal aid]] free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay for it. However, the grim reality remains that lawyers are underpaid and grossly overworked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=How Americans Lost the Right to Counsel, 50 Years After 'Gideon' (March, 2013)|url=http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/how-americans-lost-right-counsel-50-years-after-gideon|publisher=The Brennan Center for Justice (NYU School of Law)|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering perfunctory representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Stephen B.|last2=Sanneh|first2=Sia M.|title=Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance After Gideon v.

Some law schools have public interest law centers, which advise law students interested in pursuing public interest law careers. [[Pro bono]] programs at bar associations and law firms provide opportunities for commercial lawyers to donate time to public interest law activities.&lt;ref name=Cummings/&gt;

==United Kingdom(UK)==
In law, public interest is a defence against certain lawsuits (for instance some [[libel]] suits in the United Kingdom) and an exemption from certain laws or regulations (for instance [[freedom of information]] laws in the UK). Also, judges in [[common law]] systems can make judgements on the grounds of [[public policy (law)|public policy]], a related term.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1872">'''Puppetista''' is a word coined in 2000 by a group of [[puppeteer]]s who make and use [[puppet]]s in [[street theater]] and [[Demonstration (people)|political demonstrations]]. Formed by combining the words "puppet" and [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]], the term originated in the [[Northeastern United States]] and quickly picked up use in the [[Southern United States|South]], [[Midwest]] and on the [[West Coast of the United States]], as well as in [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]] and [[Brazil]], to describe a social movement of [[revolutionary]] artists and their work.

==Early life and education==
Rami Hamdallah was born in [[Anabta]] in the northern [[West Bank|Palestine]] on 10 August 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm H - Personalities. [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]].] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CJF0qBzA?url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_h.htm |date=20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Jordan]] in 1980 and received his MA from the [[University of Manchester]] in 1982. Hamdallah completed a PhD in linguistics at [[Lancaster University]] in 1988.

==Career==
Hamdallah, widely known as Abu Walid ('Father of Walid', after one of his deceased children) is a professor at [[An-Najah National University]], where he was hired in 1982 as English instructor. He was appointed president of the university in 1998. During his 15 years' term, he tripled the student enrollment, which now numbers 20,000 students on 4 campuses. He also opened a 400-bed teaching hospital. He served as the secretary general of Palestinian Central Elections Commission from 2002 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bobb|first=Scott|title=Palestinians Give Mixed Reaction to New Prime Minister|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/abbas-names-new-palestinian-prime-minister/1673841.html|accessdate=21 June 2013|work=Voice of America|date=3 June 2013|location=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the commission's deputy chairman in 2011.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palestinian Authority picks Rami Hamdallah as prime minister|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-fg-palestinian-premier-20130603,0,549411.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|first1=Maher|last1=Abukhater|first2=Edmund|last2=Sanders|date=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sworn in as prime minister on 6 June 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kershner|first=Isabel|title=New Palestinian prime minister submits resignation after two weeks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2013/06/20/new-palestinian-prime-minister-submits-resignation-after-two-weeks/ZMuEdsUbkywlXjZTI9ymtJ/story.html|accessdate=21 June 2013|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=20 June 2013|location=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced [[Salam Fayyad]] in the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Browning|first=Noah|title=New Palestinian prime minister offers resignation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/20/us-palestinians-resignation-idUSBRE95J0MI20130620|accessdate=21 June 2013|work=Reuters|date=20 June 2013|location=Ramallah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two weeks into the job, however, Hamdallah tendered his resignation, reportedly as result of interference with Hamdallah's authority by Abbas' aides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khoury|first=Jack|title=Abbas accepts resignation of newly appointed Palestinian PM Hamdallah|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/abbas-accepts-resignation-of-newly-appointed-palestinian-pm-hamdallah-1.531450/|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 2013, Abbas accepted Hamdallah's resignation, but appointed him as the head of the interim government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Basil|first=Yousuf|title=Abbas accepts resignation of Palestinian prime minister|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/23/world/meast/mideast-palestinian-pm|accessdate=3 July 2013|work=CNN|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamdallah's resignation was praised by [[Mohammed Dajani]], the founder of the Wastia Movement of Moderate Islam in the West Bank, who stated that "I respect him for taking this decision. They thought he would be window dressing and he would not accept that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palestinian PM Rami Hamdallah tenders resignation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/10132634/Palestinian-PM-Rami-Hamdallah-tenders-resignation.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 June 2013|location=London|first=Phoebe|last=Greenwood|date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks after Hamdallah's resignation, Abbas asked him to form a new government, which he did on 19 September 2013.&lt;ref name="NewPM"/&gt;

On March 13, 2018, he escaped assassination during his visit to the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-43391901/palestinian-pm-hamdallah-survives-gaza-explosion|title=Palestinian PM Hamdallah survives Gaza explosion|last=BBC|first=BBC|date=13 March 2018|website=BBC|access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reed Technology and Information Services Inc.''' is a company that provides electronic [[content management]] services, engaging in data capture and conversion, preservation, analysis, e-submission and publication for corporate, legal and government clients.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reed-tech-internet-archive-announce-125500082.html Reed Technology and Information Services Inc. November 11, 2013 7:55&amp;nbsp;AM,]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company was founded in 1961 and is based in [[Horsham, Pennsylvania]], with an additional office in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

==History==
The company was incorporated in 1966 as International Computaprint Corporation (ICC). In 1969, the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) contracted ICC to develop and operate a computer system for use in the patent publishing process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bayhdolecentral.com/3_DIV_SCAN/2469_001_C_OCR_DBL_ZIP_0.pdf University of New Hampshire School of Law Bayh-Dole Act Research &amp; History Central, March 18, 2014 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. CT. Retrieved from bayhdolecentral.com]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the company's core business in managing and converting data, the company launched the ReedFax service in 1992, making copies of U.S. and foreign patent and trademark documents available to law firms, corporate legal departments and patent practitioners.

In 1995, the company changed its name to Reed Technology and Information Services Inc.

When the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) mandated that all prescription drug labeling information must be submitted in [[Structured Product Labeling]] [[eXtensible Markup Language]] (SPL XML) format in 2005, Reed Tech created an SPL XML submission solution for the [[pharmaceutical sciences]] and other [[life sciences]] industries, for which the company won a 2010 CIO100 Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/cio100/detail/2078|title=CIO 100 2010 Winner Profile: Reed Technology &amp; Information Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also achieved [[Federal Information Security Management Act]] (FISMA) certification for its data center operations in 2006.

In 2012, Reed Technology achieved SOC2 SSAE-16 accreditation from the [[AICPA]].

==Products &amp; Services==
As a [[LexisNexis]] company, Reed Tech specializes in the field of content management and [[intellectual property]] services in the areas of [[life sciences]], [[patent prosecution]], research and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203721704577157211501855648|title=For Future Reference, a Pioneer in Online Reading|first=Stephen|last=Miller|date=13 January 2012|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual Property ===
The Reed Tech Intellectual Property products span a range of capabilities, including data capture and conversion, preservation, analysis, e-submission and publication for corporate, legal and government clients.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130620-908055.html The Wall Street Journal, June 20, 2013, 11:55&amp;nbsp;a.m. ET]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Reed Tech, in collaboration with PatentCore, announced the launch of the PatentAdvisor service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww.patentadvisor.com/blog1.php?pid=4&amp;p=3&amp;search=#blt|title=Holt, C. (2013, May 29). USPTO RCE Rates by Technology Center (TC). Retrieved from|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to deliver searchable and actionable data for patent attorneys and IP-driven companies focused on the prosecution and management of patents by providing searchable, filterable access to historical behavior data for nearly every U.S. patent examiner and art unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/Reed-technology-wont-slow-down-110319-1.html|title=Reed: Technology Won’t Slow Down. Recalibration Needed.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, document retrieval, translations, and research and analysis of U.S. and international patent documents are offered through the company's IP Services (formerly ReedFax).

=== Life Sciences ===
The company's Life Sciences products focus on electronic data conversion and submissions to regulatory agencies, including the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as a solution for the FDA’s [[Structured Product Labeling]] (SPL) format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=ENL.N|title=Company Search Results|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the XEVMPD format for the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA). Since the inception of SPL in 2005, Reed Tech has worked closely with the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA, and is a member of the Health Level 7 (HL7) working group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diahome.org/en-US/News-and-Publications/CSO-Directory/Find-CSO/CSO%20Details.aspx?orderno=9004596886&amp;orderlineno=1|title=Error 404: Page not found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing the SPL XML format, Reed Tech also offers label printing and publishing solutions, allowing pharmaceutical companies to reuse FDA-approved drug labels for printed marketing and manufacturing materials.

Reed Tech helps companies find detailed human and animal health drug product label information online with its PDR3D digital drug database and LabelDataPlus.com.

In September 2013, the FDA issued a final rule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/09/24/2013-23059/unique-device-identification-system|title=Unique Device Identification System|date=24 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring medical device manufacturers to provide a [[Unique Device Identification]] (UDI) to a centralized Global UDI (GUDID) database, much like the FDA's SPL database. Reed Tech has developed a UDI / GUDID solution to meet the growing demand from device firms for help in complying with the time- and resource-intensive submission process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Gray-Sheet/40/1/Multiple-Options-To-Weigh-For-Moving-A-UDI-Into-FDAs-Database?result=23&amp;total=231&amp;searchquery=%253fq%253dudi%2526start%253d21|title=Multiple Options To Weigh For Moving A UDI Into FDA’s Database|date=6 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{otheruses|Assimilation (disambiguation)}}

'''Religious assimilation''' refers to the adoption of a majority or dominant [[culture]]'s [[Religion|religious]] practices and [[Belief|beliefs]] by a minority or subordinate culture. It is an important form of [[cultural assimilation]].

Religious assimilation includes the [[religious conversion]] of individuals from a minority [[faith]] to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious [[indoctrination]] of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among [[Immigration|immigrant]] groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems.{{r|Connor-2010|p=134}}

In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion.{{r|Connor-2010|p=3}} Some researchers, such as [[Will Herberg]], have advanced a thesis of perpetual [[religious pluralism]], to the effect that [[Immigration|immigrants]] would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture.{{r|Yang-and-Ebaugh-2010|p=368}} Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of [[religious persecution]].{{r|LeMay-2010}} These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.{{r|LeMay-2010}}

{{Italic title|reason=.}}

In two-dimensional works of art, such as [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[photography]] or [[bas-relief]], '''repoussoir''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəpuswaʁ|lang}}, ''pushing back'') is an object along the right or left foreground that directs the viewer's eye into the composition by bracketing ([[Framing (visual arts)|framing]]) the edge. It became popular with [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] artists, and is found frequently in Dutch seventeenth-century landscape paintings. [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], for example, often included a tree along one side to enclose the scene (see illustration). Figures are also commonly employed as ''repoussoir'' devices by artists such as [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Impressionist]]s such as [[Gustave Caillebotte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The revolution of history painting|first=Edgar|last=Wind|p=117|journal=Journal of the Warburg Institute|jstor=750085|volume=2|issue=2|date=October 1938|doi=10.2307/750085|quote=He fulfils the function of a 'repoussoir',and by leading the imagination into a distant land,effectively offsets the shock of seeing the hero die in a modern uniform.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Peter Paul Rubens 118.jpg|''The Four Philosophers'' (''c''. 1615. Oil on panel; 167 x 143&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Pitti Palace]], [[Florence]]). In his friendship portrait of himself, his brother Philip Rubens, [[Justus Lipsius]] and [[Jan van den Wouwer]] (left to right), the painter Rubens's [[self-portrait]] on the left is an example of a figural ''repoussoir'' that is further accentuated by the flowing red curtain.
File:Gustave Caillebotte - Paris Street; Rainy Day - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Gustave Caillebotte]]. ''[[Paris Street; Rainy Day]]'' (1877, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]). The rear-facing man on the right with the tilted umbrella is an example of ''repoussoir'' figure leading the viewer's gaze into the composition.

The {{convert|100|kg|adj=on}} [[satellite]] carried a Lyman-alpha Imaging Solar Telescope (LIST) as well as [[Satellite laser ranging]] (SLR) payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|title=STSAT 2|work=Gunter's Space Page|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/stsat-2.htm|accessdate = 2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC) developed STSAT-2A as a sun observation, satellite laser ranging and engineering and technology demonstration sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology. It was expected to be operational for about two years, and was scheduled to be launched between 2005 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Jun HO| authorlink = S.

The Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) instrument was intended to measure the orbit of STSAT-2A, in order to investigate variations in its orbit.&lt;ref name="security"/&gt;

It was a followup to [[STSAT-1]], which was launched using a [[Kosmos-3M]] rocket on September 27, 2003. Originally a  Dual-channel Radiometers for Earth and Atmosphere Monitoring (DREAM) [[Microwave radiometer]] was intended as the principal payload of STSAT-2A for an expected launch in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Sung-Hyun |author2=De-Hai Zhang |author3=Ho-Jin Lee |author4=Hyuk Park |author5=Seok-Hun Yun |author6=Chun-Sik Chae |author7=Eun-Sup Sim |author8=Jing-Shan Jiang |author9=Yong-Hoon Kim|title=Korean spaceborne microwave radiometer on STSAT-2: Dual-channel Radiometers for Earth and Atmosphere Monitoring (DREAM)|journal=Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

STSAT-2A has three missions, the indigenous research and development to place a satellite into low orbit, development of indigenous spacecraft, and the ability to develop scientific payloads.&lt;ref name="security"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/rok/stsat.htm|title=STSAT (Science and Technology Satellite)|date=February 4, 2009|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STSAT-2A was launched on the maiden flight of the [[Naro-1]] rocket, which lifted off the [[Naro Space Centre]], on the southern coast of South Korea at 08:00 GMT on 25 August 2009. The launch failed to place STSAT-2 into orbit after half of the payload fairing failed to separate.&lt;ref name="yonhap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2009/08/26/15/0601000000AEN20090826005500320F.HTML|title=S. Korean satellite lost shortly after launch: gov't  |publisher=Yonhap News|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the second stage being too heavy to reach orbit, and it fell back to Earth along with the satellite. Further investigation is ongoing. A second satellite, [[STSAT-2B]], was launched on June 10, 2010, but the launch vehicle failed again.

'''Sandy River Valley Sign Language''' was a [[village sign language]] of the 19th-century [[Sandy River (Kennebec River)|Sandy River Valley]] in [[Maine]]. Together with the more famous [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] and [[Henniker Sign Language]], it was one of three local languages which formed the basis of [[American Sign Language]].

The [[deaf communities]] in the valley developed in some of the 30 villages founded by settlers from Martha's Vineyard. However, it is not clear whether MVSL itself was transmitted, or if the chain was broken and a new sign language was created once a substantial deaf population was established.

'''Tatul''' ({{lang-bg|Татул}}, the local name for ''[[Datura stramonium]]'') is a village in [[Momchilgrad]] municipality, [[Kardzhali Province]] located in the [[Eastern Rhodopes]] in southern [[Bulgaria]]. It is lies at 319 m above sea level at {{Coord|41.5536|N|25.5412|E|type:city_region:BG|display=inline,title|format=dms}}, 15&amp;nbsp;km east of Momchilgrad, and {{As of|2005|alt=as of September 2005}} has a population of 189 people. Most of the houses were built of well-cut stone blocks.

In the 2000s Bulgarian archaeologists discovered an ancient [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[surface tom]]b and sanctuary in the immediate proximity of the village, and it was soon recognized as an exclusive religious center in the region of importance to the whole region according to head [[archaeologist]] [[Nikolay Ovcharov]]. Latest archaeological finds date the earliest settlement to 4000 [[Before Christ|BC]]. According to Ovcharov, the site is the sanctuary and tomb of an influential Thracian leader who was [[deified]] after his death. He also links it with the cult of [[Orpheus]].&lt;ref&gt;Овчаров, Николай. Новооткритото светилище при с. Татул, Момчилградско, и въпросът за локализацията там на единствения известен в Тракия храм на Орфей, в: Проблеми и изследвания на тракийската култура, Казанлък 2006, с. 26-37&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient sources describe the ritual of burying leaders overground, on the top of a hill (as opposed to in a mound), as extremely rare, mentioning only [[Orpheus]] and [[Rhesus of Thrace|Rhesus]] as two of the leaders who were buried this way{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and as Orpheus was buried&lt;ref&gt;Orpheus and Greek Religion (Mythos Books) by William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, {{ISBN|0-691-02499-5}}, 1993, page 34: "...the tomb was near the town of Leibethra on Olympos. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Classical Mythology by Pierre Grimal and A. R. Maxwell-Hyslop, {{ISBN|0-631-20102-5}}, 1996, page 333, "... tomb. It was said that this had once been at Leibethra and that an oracle of the Thracian Dionysus had predicted ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orpheus: Ancient Greek History by Gregory Zorzos, {{ISBN|1-4414-6777-7}}, 2009, page 10: "... Muses collected them, and buried them at the place called Leibethra : ..."&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leibethra]] close to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], Greece it only leaves Rhesus as a candidate though both of the characters are [[mythological]] and may have never existed.

Around 30 clay [[altars]] and other items from the 19th-18th century BC have been excavated, as well as an idol, a nude male figure from the [[Iron Age]], proving the sanctuary was used without interruption in the period. A stone wall was erected surrounding the hill between the 4th and the 1st century BC, and the temple was constructed shortly thereafter, with the religious complex gradually expanding and the religious activity worshipping the man buried in Tatul shifting to the mausoleum that was built. Several new buildings were constructed in the 2nd-3rd century AD and the [[Christianization]] of the Rhodopes in the late 4th-early 5th century resulted in the conversion of the complex into a local ruler's domain featuring a defensive tower. The complex also suffered from two earthquakes, once in the 12th century BC and once in the 14th century AD.

As the conservation of the site began shortly after the excavations started, it is developing as a tourist destination, with the infrastructure being renewed and created and the Tatul Thracian complex already welcoming tourists.

==Honour==
[[Tatul Island]] off [[Robert Island]], in the [[South Shetland Islands]] is named after Tatul.

'''''Inu makura''''' or {{nihongo|'''''The Dog Pillow'''''|犬枕}} is an early-[[Edo period]] [[Japanese literature|Japanese]] literary [[parody]] of ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' of [[Sei Shōnagon]]. The title has also been translated as '''''The Mongrel Pillow'''''.&lt;ref name="Keene"/&gt;

==''The Pillow Book''==
[[Sei Shōnagon]]'s observations of the [[Heian period|Heian]] court at the end of the tenth-century in {{nihongo|''[[The Pillow Book]]''|枕草子|''Makura no sōshi''}} include passages that resemble a [[poetic diary]], others in an [[Zuihitsu|essay-like style]], as well as a number of poetic catalogues or {{nihongo|"detailing of things"|ものはつくし}}.&lt;ref name="Inu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sei Shōnagon's Poetic Catalogues |author=Morris, Mark |journal=[[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]] |publisher=[[Harvard–Yenching Institute]] |year=1980 |volume=40 | issue = 1 |pages=5–54 |doi=10.2307/2718916}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, under the heading Elegant Things: 'a white coat worn over a violet [[Japanese clothing|waistcoat]], duck eggs, shaved ice mixed with [[liana]] syrup placed in a new silver bowl, rock-crystal [[Buddhist prayer beads|prayer beads]], [[wisteria]] blossoms, [[Prunus mume|plum blossoms]] covered with snow, a beautiful child eating strawberries'.&lt;ref name="Shirane"&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology (1600-1900) |author=Shirane, Haruo |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=2002 |ISBN=0-231-10991-1 |pages=21–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inu makura'' similarly comprises a number of such listings under a series of headings, although without the [[narrative]] accompaniment. Combined with the work's brevity, the effect is sustained through 'the possibilities of terseness, juxtaposition, and surprise', by repeating the same situation under a different heading, or by the subtle alteration of a situation.&lt;ref name="Inu"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inu Makura: The Dog Pillow |author=Putzar, Edward |journal=[[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]] |publisher=[[Harvard–Yenching Institute]] |year=1968 |pages=98–101 |volume=28 |doi=10.2307/2718596}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are in total ninety sections, seventeen of them in the form of kyōka or 'comic [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'.&lt;ref name="Keene"&gt;{{cite book |title=World Within Walls: Japanese Literature of the Pre-Modern Era, 1600-1867 |author=[[Donald Keene|Keene, Donald]] |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-231-11467-2 |pages=153f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work, without [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] or title page, and dated variously between 1596 and 1607, is attributed to Hata Sōha (1550-1607), annotator of [[Tsurezuregusa|Essays in Idleness]], physician to [[Toyotomi Hidetsugu]], [[Taikomochi#History|storyteller (otogishu)]] to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and later in the employ of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].&lt;ref name="Keene"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Constructing the Classic: Tsurezuregusa in Tokugawa Readings |author=Chance, Linda H. |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |publisher=[[American Oriental Society]] |year=1997 |volume=117 | issue = 1 |pages=39–56 |doi=10.2307/605621}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early exemplar of [[kanazōshi]] or 'booklets in the vernacular', it was printed with [[Movable type#Wooden movable type|wooden movable type]].&lt;ref name="Inu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shirane"/&gt;

Illustrative of the work are such sections as Things One Wishes to See: 'the moon, well-performed [[Noh]], the furnishings of a [[Chashitsu|tea house]], the real thoughts of one's lover'; Interesting Things: '[[Tsurezuregusa]], arranging coals for the [[tea ceremony]], a [[Hanami|flower-viewing]] walk with a boy favourite'; and Things that Stand One's Hair on End: 'putting on [[Japanese armour|armour]] in winter without underclothes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inu Makura: The Dog Pillow |author=Putzar, Edward |journal=[[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]] |publisher=[[Harvard–Yenching Institute]] |year=1968 |pages=102–4 |volume=28 |doi=10.2307/2718596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==
Such [[parodies]] were amongst the earliest [[genres]] of [[kanazōshi]], updating and transforming [[Heian period|Heian]] and later court works into "comic versions of contemporary popular culture".&lt;ref name="Shirane"/&gt; In the 1530s, {{nihongo|Dog Tsukubashū|犬筑波集}}, attributed to [[Yamazaki Sōkan]] and a response to the first collections of [[Renga|linked verse]], had been infused with the [[haikai]] spirit, "outlandish [[metaphor]]", and "irreverent or ribald humour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Traditional Japanese Poetry: An Anthology |author=Carter, Steven |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1993 |ISBN=0-8047-2212-9 |pages=332, 338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following on from ''Inu makura'', other parodies emerged: the {{nihongo|Fake [[Tales of Ise]]|偽物語|[[Nise Monogatari]]}} of 1640; {{nihongo|Dog [[Tsurezuregusa]]|犬徒然草}} of  1653; and {{nihongo|Dog [[Hyakunin Isshū]]|犬百人一首}} of 1669.&lt;ref name="Shirane"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Japanese Burlesque: Nise Monogatari |author=Rucinski, Jack |journal=[[Monumenta Nipponica]] |publisher=[[Sophia University]] |year=1975 |volume=30 | issue = 1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.2307/2383693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Visual genesis of Japanese national identity: Hokusai's Hyakunin isshu |author=Machotka, Ewa |year=2009 |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]] |ISBN=978-90-5201-482-1 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Excursion to Tilsit''''' is a 1917 collection of short stories or novellas by the German writer [[Hermann Sudermann]]. Its German title is '''''Litauische Geschichten''''', which means "Lithuanian stories". The book consists of four stories set in rural Lithuania in the mid 19th century. It was published in English in 1930, translated by Lewis Galantière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/excursion-to-tilsit/oclc/1474999|title=The excursion to Tilsit|work=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several stories from the book have been adapted for film. Most famously, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s 1927 film ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' is loosely based on the titular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=Lucy|year=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V96tee1l2q8C&amp;pg=PA75|chapter=Sunrise: A Tale of Two Humans|editor1-last=White|editor1-first=Rob|editor2-last=Buscombe|editor2-first=Edward|title=British Film Institute Film Classics, Volume 1|location=London; New York|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]; [[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|Fitzroy Dearborn]]|page=75|isbn=1-57958-328-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories and plots==
'''The Excursion to Tilsit''' (Die Reise nach Tilsit)&lt;br /&gt;
A married man is in love with his mistress and plans to drown his wife on the way back from a trip to [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]]. During the trip he reconciles with his wife, changes his mind and tells her about his now abandoned plan. In a fatal accident the man drowns and the wife is saved through the means the man had prepared for his own escape.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Miks Bumbullis'''&lt;br /&gt;
A murderer needs to visit the grave of his daughter to please the goddess of death, despite knowing that the police will be there waiting for him.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Jons and Erdma''' (Jons und Erdme)&lt;br /&gt;
A couple become wealthy by the means of tricks and foul play. Eventually they are in turn tricked by their daughters and have to start again from zero.&lt;br /&gt;
'''The Hired Girl''' (Die Magd)

==Reception==
Margaret Wallace of ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like [[Selma Lagerlöf]], and many other novelists whose material is national and even provincial, Sudermann by his very unconcern with cosmopolitan values gives a deeper truth and meaning to the lives of his characters. Of these four stories of Lithuanian peasants, only one, "Miks Bumbullis", depends for its effect upon purely national traits and circumstances. They are, for the most part, founded solidly upon the fundamental and inescapable human facts of birth and love and death. They are moving and tragic and, above all, intensely and vividly alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wallace|first=Margaret|year=April 1930|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Bookman-1930apr-00214a03|title=''The Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann|work=[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]|page=214-215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'' reviewed the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann is a collection of powerful short stories dealing with the life of Lithuanian peasants. The author has observed them sympathetically and at first hand. Nominal Catholics, they still live in fear of pagan gods, giving even their lives to propitiate them. ... Among the stories, that of Jons and Erdma who, having built a home by tricks and cunning are tricked out of it at last by their daughters, compares favorably with [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgeniev's]] ''Lear of the Steppes'' as a story of faith and treachery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=1930-04-02|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Outlook-1930apr02-00544a02|title=The Leisure Arts: The Week's Reading|work=[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{History of Virginia}}
{{Confederate states in the American Civil War}}
The '''[[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]]''' became a prominent part of the [[Confederate States of America]] when it joined the Confederacy during the [[American Civil War]]. As a Southern slave-holding state, Virginia held a [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861|state convention]] to deal with the secession crisis, and voted against secession on April 4, 1861. Opinion shifted after April 15, when U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] called for troops from all states still in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] to put down the rebellion, following the capture of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], and the Virginia convention voted to declare secession from the Union. A Unionist government was established in Wheeling and the new state of [[West Virginia]] was created by an act of Congress from 50 counties of western Virginia.

In May, it was decided to move the Confederate capital from [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]], to [[Richmond, Virginia]], in part because the defense of Virginia's capital was deemed vital to the Confederacy's survival. On May 24, 1861, the [[Union Army|U.S. Army]] moved into [[northern Virginia]] and captured [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] without a fight. Most of the battles in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]] took place in Virginia because the Confederacy had to defend its national capital at Richmond, and public opinion in the North demanded that the Union move "On to Richmond!"  The successes of [[Robert E. Lee]] in defending Richmond are a central theme of the military history of the war. The [[White House of the Confederacy]], located a few blocks north of the [[Virginia State Capitol|State Capitol]], became home to the family of Confederate leader, former [[Mississippi]] Senator [[Jefferson Davis]].

==Origins==
On October 16, 1859, the radical [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] led a group of 22 men in a raid on the Federal Arsenal in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], [[Virginia]]. U.S. troops, led by [[Robert E. Lee]], responded and quelled the raid. Subsequently, Brown was tried and executed by hanging in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]] on December 2, 1859.

In 1860 the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] split into northern and southern factions over the issue of slavery in the territories and [[Stephen Douglas]]' support for [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]]: after failing in both [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Baltimore]] to nominate a single candidate acceptable to the South, Southern Democrats held their [[United States presidential election, 1860|convention]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], on June 26, 1860, and nominated [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their party candidate for [[President of the United States|U.S. president]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected as president, Virginians were concerned about the implications for their state. While a majority of the state would look for compromises to the sectional differences, most people also opposed any restrictions on slaveholders' rights.&lt;ref&gt;Link p. 217. Link wrote, "Although a majority probably favored compromise, most opposed any weakening of slaveholders' protections. Even so-called moderates -- mostly Whigs and Douglas Democrats – opposed the sacrifice of these rights and they rejected ant acquiescence or 'submission' to federal coercion. ... To a growing body of Virginians, Lincoln's election meant the onset of an active war against southern institutions. These men shared a common fear of northern Republicans and a common suspicion of a northern conspiracy against the South."&lt;/ref&gt; As the state watched to see what [[South Carolina]] would do, many Unionists felt that the greatest danger to the state came not from the North but from "rash secession" by the lower South.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Call for secession convention===
On November 15, 1860 Virginia [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[John Letcher]] called for a special session of the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] to consider, among other issues, the creation of a [[secession in the United States|secession]] convention. The legislature convened on January 7 and approved the convention on January 14. On January 19 the General Assembly called for a national [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]], led by Virginia native and former U.S. President [[John Tyler]], to be held in [[Washington, DC]] on February 4, the same date that elections were scheduled for delegates to the secession convention.&lt;ref&gt;Link p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of convention delegates drew 145,700 voters who elected, by county, 152 representatives. Thirty of these delegates were secessionists, thirty were unionists, and ninety-two were moderates who were not clearly identified with either of the first two groups. Nevertheless, advocates of immediate secession were clearly outnumbered.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 3-4. Robertson, clarifying the position of the moderates, wrote, "However, the term 'unionist' had an altogether different meaning in Virginia at the time. Richmond delegates Marmaduke Johnson and William McFarland were both outspoken conservatives. Yet in their respective campaigns, each declared that he was in favor of separation from the Union if the federal government did not guarantee protection of slavery everywhere. Moreover, the threat of the federal government's using coercion became an overriding factor in the debates that followed."&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous to the February 4 election delegates from the first six states to secede (South Carolina, Mississpii, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana) met in Montgomery and four days later founded the [[Confederate States of America]].

According to one Virginian teacher, William M. Thompson, who would later become a Confederate cavalryman, the declaring of secession by the slave states was necessary to preserve slavery as well as prevent marriages between freedmen and the white "daughters of the South", saying that civil war would be preferable:

===Secession convention===
The [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861]] met on February 13 at the Richmond Mechanics Institute located at Ninth and Main Street in Richmond. One of the convention's first actions was to create a 21-member Federal Relations Committee charged with reaching a compromise to the sectional differences as they affected Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Link p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was made up of 4 secessionists, 10 moderates and 7 unionists.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  At first there was no urgency to the convention's deliberations as all sides felt that time only aided their cause. In addition, there were hopes that the [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]] on January 19 led by Virginia's former President [[John Tyler]], might resolve the crisis by guaranteeing the safety of slavery and the right to expand slavery into the southwest territories.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers pp. 120-123&lt;/ref&gt; With the failure of the Peace Conference at the end of February,&lt;ref&gt;Potter, pp. 545-546. Nevins, pp. 411-412. The conferences recommendations, which differed little from the [[Crittenden Compromise]], were defeated in the Senate by a 28 to 7 vote and were never voted on by the House.&lt;/ref&gt; moderates in the convention began to waver in their support for unionism.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 8. Robert E. Scott of Fauquier County noted that this failure and the North's apparent indifference to southern concerns "extinguished all hope of a settlement by the direct action of those States, and I at once accepted the dissolution of the existing Union ... as a necessity."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Richmond convention in February 1861, [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgian]] [[Henry L. Benning|Henry Lewis Benning]], who would later go on to join the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] as an officer, delivered a speech in which he gave his reasoning for the urging of secession from the Union, appealing to ethnic prejudices and pro-slavery sentiments to present his case, saying that were the slave states to remain in the Union, their slaves would ultimately end up being freed by the anti-slavery Republican Party. He stated that he would rather be stricken with illness and starvation than to see [[African-American]]s liberated from slavery and be given equality as citizens:

{{quote|What was the reason that induced Georgia to take the step of secession? This reason may be summed up in one single proposition. It was a conviction, a deep conviction on the part of Georgia, that a separation from the North-was the only thing that could prevent the abolition of her slavery. ... If things are allowed to go on as they are, it is certain that slavery is to be abolished. By the time the north shall have attained the power, the black race will be in a large majority, and then we will have black governors, black legislatures, black juries, black everything. Is it to be supposed that the white race will stand for that? It is not a supposable case ... war will break out everywhere like hidden fire from the earth, and it is probable that the white race, being superior in every respect, may push the other back. ... we will be overpowered and our men will be compelled to wander like vagabonds all over the earth; and as for our women, the horrors of their state we cannot contemplate in imagination. That is the fate which abolition will bring upon the white race. ... We will be completely exterminated, and the land will be left in the possession of the blacks, and then it will go back to a wilderness and become another Africa... Suppose they elevated [[Charles Sumner]] to the presidency? Suppose they elevated [[Frederick Douglass|Fred Douglass]], your escaped slave, to the presidency? What would be your position in such an event? I say give me pestilence and famine sooner than that.|[[Henry L. Benning|Henry Lewis Benning]]|speech to the Virginia Convention|February 18, 1861.&lt;ref name=GordonRhea&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/why-non-slaveholding.html |last=Rhea |first=Gordon |title= Why Non-Slaveholding Southerners Fought |work=Civil War Trust |publisher= Civil War Trust |date= January 25, 2011 |accessdate= March 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110321183207/http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/why-non-slaveholding.html |archivedate= March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feb1861Speech&gt;{{cite web |url= http://civilwarcauses.org/benningva.htm|last=Benning|first=Henry L.|title=Speech of Henry Benning to the Virginia Convention |date= February 18, 1861 |work= Proceedings of the Virginia State Convention of 1861 |volume=1 |pages=62–75 |accessdate= March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unionist support was further eroded for many Virginians by [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|Lincoln's first inaugural address]], which they felt was "argumentative, if not defiant."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 8. Robertson quotes an observer of the speech saying, "Mr. Lincoln raised his voice and distinctly emphasized the declaration that he must take, hold, possess, and occupy the property (e.g. slaves) and places [in the South] belonging to the United States. This was unmistakable, and he paused for a moment after closing the sentence as if to allow it to be fully taken in and comprehended by his audience."&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the state there was evidence that support for secession was growing.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 9. Robertson writes, "Although some leaders such as Governor Letcher still believed that 'patience and prudence' would 'work out the results,' a growing, uncontrollable attitude for war was sweeping through the state. Militia units were organizing from the mountains to the Tidewater. Newspapers in Richmond and elsewhere maintained a steady heat, noisy partisans filled the convention galleries, and at night large crowds surged through the capital streets 'with bands of music and called out their favorite orators at the different hotels.'"&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Relations Committee made its report to the convention on March 9. The fourteen proposals defended both slavery and [[states' rights]] while calling for a meeting of the eight slave states still in the Union to present a united front for compromise. From March 15 through April 14 the convention debated these proposals one by one.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 13. The committee report represented the moderate/unionist position; the vote in committee was 12 in favor, 2 against, with 7 abstaining.&lt;/ref&gt; During the debates, the sixth resolution calling for a peaceful solution and maintenance of the Union came up for discussion on April 4. Lewis Edwin Harvie of [[Amelia County, Virginia|Amelia County]] offered a substitute resolution calling for immediate secession. This was voted down by 88 to 45 and the next day the convention continued its debate.&lt;ref&gt;Riggs p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Approval of the last proposal came on April 12.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the unionist faction after this approval was to adjourn the convention until October, allowing time for both the convention of the slave states and Virginia's congressional elections in May which, they hoped, would produce a stronger mandate for compromise.&lt;ref&gt;Link p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

One delegate reiterated the state's cause of secession and the purpose of the convention:

[[Mississippi]]an Fulton Anderson told the convention that the Republicans were hostile to the slave states, accusing the Republican Party of having an "unrelenting and eternal hostility to the institution of slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GDZEV23I0FGS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=081392104X|title=Apostles of Disunion|first=Charles B.|last=Dew|page=62|accessdate=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the convention declared that slavery should continue, and that it should be extended into U.S. territories:

{{quote|'''Proposals Adopted by the Virginia Convention of 1861'''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The first resolution asserted states' rights ''per se''; the second was for retention of slavery; the third opposed sectional parties; the fourth called for equal recognition of slavery in both territories and non-slave states; the fifth demanded the removal of federal forts and troops from seceded states; the sixth hoped for a peaceable adjustment of grievances and maintaining the Union; the seventh called for Constitutional amendments to remedy federal and state disputes; the eighth recognized the right of secession; the ninth said the federal government had no authority over seceded states since it refused to recognize their withdrawal; the tenth said the federal government was empowered to recognize the Confederate States; the eleventh was an appeal to Virginia's sister states; the twelfth asserted Virginia's willingness to wait a reasonable period of time for an answer to its propositions, providing no one resorted to force against the seceded states; the thirteenth asked United States and Confederate States governments to remain peaceful; and the fourteenth asked the border slave states to meet in conference to consider Virginia's resolutions and to join in Virginia's appeal to the North.&lt;ref&gt;Riggs p. 264. Riggs made his summary based on Proceedings of the Virginia State Convention of 1861, Volume 1, pp. 701-716&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same time, unionists were concerned about the continued presence of U.S. forces at [[Fort Sumter]], despite assurances communicated informally to them by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] that it would be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Potter p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln and Seward were also concerned that the Virginia convention was still in session as of the first of April while secession sentiment was growing. At Lincoln's invitation, unionist John B. Baldwin of [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]] met with the president on April 4. Baldwin explained that the unionists needed the evacuation of Fort Sumter, a national convention to debate the sectional differences, and a commitment by Lincoln to support constitutional protections for southern rights.&lt;ref&gt;Klein p. 381-382. Ayers (p. 125) notes that Baldwin had said that "there is but one single subject of complaint which Virginia has to make against the government under which we live; a complaint made by the whole South, and that is the subject of African slavery.&lt;/ref&gt; Over Lincoln's skepticism, Baldwin argued that Virginia would be out of the Union within forty-eight hours if either side fired a shot in the vicinity of the fort. By some accounts, Lincoln offered to evacuate Fort Sumter if the Virginia convention would adjourn.&lt;ref&gt;Klein p. 381-382. Baldwin denied receiving the offer to evacuate Fort Sumter, but the next day Lincoln told another Virginia unionist, John Minor Botts, that the offer had been made. In any event, the offer was never presented to the convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, amid rumors that the North was preparing for war, the convention voted by a narrow 63-57 to send a three-man delegation to Washington to determine from Lincoln what his intentions were. However, due to bad weather the delegation did not arrive in Washington until April 12. They learned of the attack on Fort Sumter from Lincoln, and the president informed them of his intent to hold the fort and respond to force with force. Reading from a prepared text to prevent any misinterpretations of his intent, Lincoln told them that he had made it clear in his inaugural address that the forts and arsenals in the South were government property and "if... an unprovoked assault has been made upon Fort Sumter, I shall hold myself at liberty to re-possess, if I can, like places which have been seized before the Government was devolved upon me."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 14-15. Furgurson p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-Union sentiment in Virginia was further weakened after the April 12 [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter]]. Richmond reacted with large public demonstrations in support of the Confederacy on April 13 when it first received the news of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson p.&amp;nbsp;278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furgurson p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt; A Richmond newspaper described the scene in Richmond on the 13th:

{{quote|Saturday night the offices of the Dispatch, Enquirer and Examiner, the banking house of Enders, Sutton &amp; Co., the Edgemont House, and sundry other public and private places, testified to the general joy by brilliant illuminations.

Hardly less than ten thousand persons were on Main street, between 8th and 14th, at one time. Speeches were delivered at the Spottswood House, at the Dispatch corner, in front of the Enquirer office, at the Exchange Hotel, and other places. Bonfires were lighted at nearly every corner of every principal street in the city, and the light of beacon fires could be seen burning on Union and Church Hills. The effect of the illumination was grand and imposing. The triumph of truth and justice over wrong and attempted insult was never more heartily appreciated by a spontaneous uprising of the people. Soon the Southern wind will sweep away with the resistless force of a tornado, all vestige of sympathy or desire of co-operation with a tyrant who, under false pretences, in the name of a once glorious, but now broken and destroyed Union, attempts to rivet on us the chains of a despicable and ignoble vassalage. Virginia is moving."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlxs.richmond.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ddr;cc=ddr;view=text;idno=ddr0141.0019.087;rgn=div3;node=ddr0141.0019.087%3A3.2.1 (Richmond Daily Dispatch April 15, 1861)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The convention reconvened on April 13 to reconsider Virginia's position, given the outbreak of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21361.htm |title=On This Day: Legislative Moments in Virginia History |publisher=Virginia Historical Society |access-date=December 4, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203111617/http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21361.htm |archive-date=February 3, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Virginia still in a delicate balance, with no firm determination yet to secede,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} sentiment turned more strongly toward secession on April 15, following [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call to all states that had not declared a secession, including Virginia, for sending troops to assist in halting the insurrection and recovering the captured forts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolntroops.htm |title=Lincoln Call for Troops}}(page includes TWO documents)&lt;/ref&gt;

Your Excellency will please communicate to me the time, at or about, which your quota will be expected at its rendezvous, as it will be met as soon as practicable by an officer to muster it into the service and pay of the United States.|Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.}}

The quota of Virginia's state militia called for, in the table attached to this letter, was three regiments which would have a total of 2,340 men to rendezvous at Staunton, Wheeling and Gordonsville. Governor Letcher and the recently reconvened Virginia Secession Convention considered this request from Lincoln "for troops to invade and coerce"&lt;ref name="Clement A. Evans, Confederate Military History- Volume III - Virginia, pt. 1, p.  38"&gt;Clement A. Evans, Confederate Military History- Volume III - Virginia, pt. 1, p.37 &amp;  38&lt;/ref&gt; lacking in constitutional authority, and out of scope of the Act of 1795. Governor Letcher's "reply to that call wrought an immediate change in the current of public opinion in Virginia".,&lt;ref name="Clement A. Evans, Confederate Military History- Volume III - Virginia, pt. 1, p. 38"/&gt; whereupon he issued the following reply:

{{quote|Executive Department, Richmond, Va., April 15, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War: Sir: I have received your telegram of the 15th, the genuineness of which I doubted. Since that time I have received your communications mailed the same day, in which I am requested to detach from the militia of the State of Virginia "the quota assigned in a table," which you append, "to serve as infantry or rifleman for the period of three months, unless sooner discharged." In reply to this communication, I have only to say that the militia of Virginia will not be furnished to the powers at Washington for any such use or purpose as they have in view. Your object is to subjugate the Southern States, and a requisition made upon me for such an object - an object, in my judgment, not within the purview of the Constitution or the act of 1795 - will not be complied with. You have chosen to inaugurate civil war, and, having done so, we will meet it in a spirit as determined as the administration has exhibited toward the South.|Respectfully, John Letcher}}

Thereafter, the secession convention voted on April 17, provisionally, to secede, on the condition of ratification by a statewide referendum. That same day, the convention adopted an [[s:Virginia Ordinance of Secession|ordinance of secession]], in which it stated the immediate cause of Virginia's declaring of secession, "the oppression of the Southern slave-holding States".&lt;ref name=SecessionOrdinance&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Virginia_Ordinance_of_Secession|title=Virginia Ordinance of Secession|author=Virginia Secession Convention|publisher=Virginia Secession Convention|location=Virginia|date=April 17, 1861|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E.L. Ayers, who felt that "even Fort Sumter might have passed, however, had Lincoln not called for the arming of volunteers",&lt;ref&gt;Ayers p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; wrote of the convention's final decision:

{{quote|The decision came from what seemed to many white Virginians the unavoidable logic of the situation: Virginia was a slave state; the Republicans had announced their intention of limiting slavery; slavery was protected by the sovereignty of the state; an attack on that sovereignty by military force was an assault on the freedom of property and political representation that sovereignty embodied. When the federal government protected the freedom and future of slavery by recognizing the sovereignty of the states, Virginia's Unionists could tolerate the insult the Republicans represented; when the federal government rejected that sovereignty, the threat could no longer be denied even by those who loved the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Governor of Virginia]] immediately began mobilizing the [[militia|Virginia State Militia]] to strategic points around the state. Former Governor Henry Wise had arranged with militia officers on April 16, before the final vote, to seize the United States arsenal at Harpers Ferry and the Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk. On April 17 in the debate over secession Wise announced to the convention that these events were already in motion. On April 18 the arsenal was captured and most of the machinery was moved to Richmond. At Gosport, the [[Union Navy]], believing that several thousand militia were headed their way, evacuated and abandoned [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and the navy yard, burning and torching as many of the ships and facilities as possible.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson p. 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel [[Robert E. Lee]] resigned his U.S. Army commission, turning down an offer of command of the Union army. He would ultimately join the Confederate army instead.

===Secession===
[[File:Virginia secession vote.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"How Virginia Was Voted Out Of The Union" -appeared in the northern journal ''Harpers Weekly'', June 15, 1861]]

Virginia's ordinance of secession was ratified in a referendum held on May 23, 1861, by a vote of 132,201 to 37,451.&lt;ref name=SecessionOrdinance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21361.htm |title=Virginia Historical Society |access-date=December 4, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203111617/http://www.vahistorical.org/onthisday/21361.htm |archive-date=February 3, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate Congress proclaimed Richmond to be new capital of the Confederacy and Confederate troops moved into northern Virginia before the referendum was held. The actual number of votes for or against secession are unknown since votes in many counties in northwestern and eastern Virginia (where most of Virginia's unionists lived) were "discarded or lost."  Governor Letcher "estimated" the vote for these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/statehood06.html West Virginia Division of Culture and History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/union_or_secession/unit/10/referendum_on_secession Library of Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopediavirginia.org/American_Civil_War_and_Virginia_The Encyclopedia Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to the referendum was swift on both sides. Confederate troops shut down the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], one of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington City]]'s two rail links to Ohio and points west. The next day, the [[Union Army|U.S. Army]] moved into northern Virginia. With both armies now in northern Virginia, the stage was set for war. In June, Virginian unionists met at the [[Wheeling Convention]] to set up the [[Restored Government of Virginia]]. [[Francis Pierpont]] was elected governor. The restored government raised troops to defend the Union and appointed two Senators to the United States Senate. It resided in Wheeling until August 1863 when it moved to Alexandria with West Virginia's [[admittance to the Union]]. During the summer of 1861, parts of the northern, western and eastern Virginia, including the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, were returned to Union control. Norfolk returned to union control in May 1862. These areas would be administered by the Restored Government of Virginia, with the northwestern counties later becoming the new state of West Virginia. In April 1865, Francis Pierpont and the Restored Government of Virginia moved to Richmond.

In 1894, Virginian and former Confederate soldier [[John S. Mosby]], reflecting back on his role in the war, stated in a letter to friend that "I've always understood that we went to war on account of the thing we quarreled with the North about. I've never heard of any other cause of quarrel than slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Confederate Battle Flag: America's Most Embattled Emblem|date=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zs0VJTbNwfAC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=26|first=John M.|last=Coski|isbn=0-674-01722-6|publisher=First Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/06/19/how-people-convince-themselves-that-the-confederate-flag-represents-freedom-not-slavery/|title=How people convince themselves that the Confederate flag represents freedom, not slavery: Historian John M.

==Strategic significance==
Virginia's strategic resources played a key role in dictating the objectives of the war there. Its agricultural and industrial capacity, and the means of transporting this production, were major strategic targets for attack by Union forces and defense by Confederate forces throughout the war.

===Richmond===
{{Main|Richmond in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Alexander Gardner - 1865 - Tredegar (Detail of iron works).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tredegar Iron Works, Richmond, Virginia, April 1865]]
The Confederate's need for war [[materiel]] played a very significant role in its decision to move its capital from Montgomery, Alabama to Richmond in May 1861, despite its dangerous northern location 100 miles south of the United States capital in Washington, DC. It was mainly for this industrial reason that the Confederates fought so hard to defend the city. The capital of the Confederacy could easily be moved again if necessary, but Richmond's industry and factories could not be moved.

Richmond was the only large-scale industrial city controlled by the Confederacy during most of the Civil War. The city's warehouses were the supply and logistical center for Confederate forces. The city's [[Tredegar Iron Works]], the 3rd largest foundry in the United States at the start of the war, produced most of the Confederate artillery, including a number of giant rail-mounted siege cannons. The company also manufactured railroad locomotives, boxcars and rails, as well as steam propulsion plants and iron plating for warships. Richmond's factories also produced guns, bullets, tents, uniforms, harnesses, leather goods, swords, bayonets, and other war materiel. A number of textile plants, flour mills, brick factories, newspapers and book publishers were located in Richmond. Richmond had shipyards too, although they were smaller than the shipyards controlled by the Union in Norfolk, Virginia.

The city's loss to the Union army in April 1865 made a Union victory in the Civil War inevitable. With Virginia firmly under Union control, including the industrial centers of Richmond, Petersburg and Norfolk, the mostly rural and agricultural deep south lacked the industry needed to supply the Confederate war effort.

===Other locations===
At the outbreak of the war [[Petersburg, Virginia]] was second only to Richmond among Virginia cities in terms of population and industrialization. The juncture of five railroads, it provided the only continuous rail link to the [[Deep South]]. Located {{convert|20|mi|km}} south of Richmond, its defense was a top priority; the day that Petersburg fell, Richmond fell with it.

In the western portion of the state (as defined today), the [[Shenandoah Valley]] was considered the "Breadbasket of the Confederacy". The valley was connected to Richmond via the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] and the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]].

The Blue Ridge mountains and similar sites had long been mined for iron, and (though as the war progressed, shortages in manpower limited their production). In southwest Virginia, the large salt works at [[Saltville, Virginia|Saltville]] provided a key source of [[salt]] to the Confederacy, essential in preserving food for use by the army. It was the target of two battles.

==Major campaigns==

The image depicts Confederate leaders packing up their belongings as they prepare to flee Richmond to avoid U.S. forces, with a slave watching on contemptuously.]]
The first and last significant battles of the war were held in Virginia, the first being the First Battle of Bull Run and the last being the [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse]]. From May 1861 to April 1865, Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy. The [[White House of the Confederacy]], located a few blocks north of the State Capital, was home to the family of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

===1861===
{{Main|Manassas Campaign}}
The first major battle of the Civil War occurred on July 21, 1861. Union forces attempted to take control of the railroad junction at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]] for use as a supply line, but the [[Confederate Army]] had moved its forces by train to meet the Union. The Confederates won the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (known as "First Battle of Manassas" in southern naming convention) and the year went on without a major fight.

===1862===
{{Main|Peninsula Campaign|Jackson's Valley Campaign|Northern Virginia Campaign|Battle of Fredericksburg}}
Union general [[George B. McClellan]] was forced to retreat from Richmond by [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army. Union general Pope was defeated at the Second Battle of Manassas. Following the one-sided Confederate victory [[Battle of Fredericksburg]].

===1863===
{{Main|Battle of Chancellorsville}}
When fighting resumed in the spring of 1863, Union general Hooker was defeated at Chancellorsville by Lee's army.

===1864===
{{Main|Overland Campaign|Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Valley Campaigns of 1864|Richmond-Petersburg Campaign|Appomattox Campaign}}
[[Ulysses Grant]]'s [[Overland Campaign]] was fought in Virginia. The campaign included battles of attrition at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania and Cold Harbor and ended with the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and Confederate defeat.

In September 1864, the ''Southern Punch'', a newspaper based in Richmond, reiterated the Confederacy's cause:

===1865===
In April 1865, the Confederate regime fled Richmond as U.S. forces approached the city. As the Confederates fled, they set fire to Richmond's public works to prevent them from being used by U.S. forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/incidentsanecdot00portiala|title=Incidents and Anecdotes of the Civil War|last=Porter|first=David Dixon|pages=300–302|date=1886|authorlink=David Dixon Porter|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire set in Richmond by the retreating Confederate army burned 25 percent of the city before being put out by the Union Army. It was the Union Army that saved the city from widespread conflagration and ruin.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=g7ABIgo_yDgC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=wJAnYXykKy&amp;dq=civil+war+history&amp;sig=7KIo6o_w7hTI5hY3HK1_d_FJ7YM#PPP9,M1 The Civil War: A History&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Richmond emerged from the Civil War as an economic powerhouse, with most of its buildings and factories undamaged.

==West Virginia enters the Union==
{{See also|Virginia Conventions#Wheeling Conventions of 1861|Restored government of Virginia|West Virginia in the American Civil War}}
On April 17, 1861, when the Richmond convention voted in favor of Virginia's secession from the United States, the 49 delegates that represented the 50 counties of the future state of West Virginia voted 32 to 13 against secession, with 4 delegates absent or abstaining. With the beginning of the war in western Virginia on May 26, however, most of the delegates returned to Richmond and signed the ordinance, 29 of the 49 delegates signed. A public vote to confirm the ordinance was held on May 23, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginiamemory.com/docs/votes_on_secession.pdf How Virginia Convention Delegates Voted on Secession]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Richard O. Curry estimated the vote for West Virginia was approximately 34,677 against it and 19,121 in favor.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Richard O., ''A House Divided, A Study of Statehood Politics and the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that 24 counties favored secession and 26 opposed it.

The successive defeats of Confederate forces under the commands of [[George A. Porterfield|Col. Porterfield]], [[Robert S. Garnett|Gen. Robert Garnett]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] enabled the establishment of a Unionist government in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], one of Virginia's largest cities. Known as the [[Restored Government of Virginia]], it was officially recognized by the Lincoln administration. [[Francis H. Pierpont]] was selected as governor of Virginia and a rump legislature was composed of former members of the Virginia Assembly who supported the Union. Many western members of the [[Virginia General Assembly|assembly]] however assumed their offices in Richmond, which reflected the deep divisions among the western counties. The Pierpont government found support among the counties along the Pennsylvania and Ohio borders and the counties along the B&amp;O railroad line.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, Charles Henry, ''A History of West Virginia'', Prentice-Hall, 1936, pg. 357&lt;/ref&gt; In most of West Virginia however Pierpont's government was weak.

[[File:October 24, 1861 county vote for West Virginia statehood.jpg|thumb|October 24, 1861 county vote for West Virginia statehood]]
Military organizations for both the Union and Confederate governments began in May and June 1861, with Gov. Letcher ordering the muster of county militias and Pierpont doing the same for the Union. Many counties that had voted heavily against the secession ordinance nevertheless gave large numbers of men to the Confederate army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Voting with Their Arms: Civil War Military Enlistments and the Formation of West Virginia, 1861–1865|authors= MacKenzie, Scott A.|url= https://muse.jhu.edu/article/666080/pdf|year=2017|journal=Ohio Valley History|volume=17|number=2|pages=25–45|subscription=yes|via=[[Project MUSE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the restricted enlistment for soldiers in Pennsylvania and Ohio many men not accepted in those states chose to join Pierpont's military organizations. The [[1st West Virginia Infantry|1st]] and [[2nd West Virginia Infantry]] and the [[1st West Virginia Cavalry|1st]] and [[2nd West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|2nd West Virginia Cavalry]] were primarily composed of men from those states. Confederate enlistments began for the [[8th Virginia Cavalry]], [[31st Virginia Infantry]], [[25th Virginia Infantry]], and several regiments in the [[Stonewall Brigade]]. West Virginia provided about 20,000 soldiers each to the Union and the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Mark A., ''West Virginia and the Civil War'', History Press, 2011, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

An ordinance for separate statehood from Virginia was passed by the Pierpont government for a public vote on October 24, 1861. Turnout was low, with 18,408 voters approving. The 1860 census recorded 79,515 men of voting age in the 50 counties, and turnout was low for all of the Wheeling initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V3kzAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=8th%20census%20united%20states&amp;pg=PA500#v=onepage&amp;q=8th%20census%20united%20states&amp;f=true]&lt;/ref&gt; The last necessary vote for statehood was held on March 4, 1863, with a turnout of 28,318, which included the soldier votes, approving the Willey amendment to the new state constitution.

The new state was formally admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863.

==Demographics==
{{See also|List of Virginia Civil War units}}
Virginia's Confederate government fielded about 150,000 troops in the American Civil War. They came from all economic and social levels, including some Unionists and former Unionists. However, at least 30,000 of these men were actually from other states. Most of these non-Virginians were from Maryland, whose government was controlled by Unionists during the war. Another 20,000 of these troops were from what would become the State of West Virginia in August 1863. Important Confederates from Virginia included General Robert E. Lee, commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Stonewall Jackson (born in what became West Virginia), General J.E.B. Stuart, General A.P. Hill, and General Jubal Early.

Roughly 50,000 Virginians served in the Union military, including West Virginians and roughly 6,000 Virginians of African ancestry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Some of these men served in Maryland units. Some African Americans, both freedmen and runaway slaves, enlisted in states as far away as Massachusetts. Areas of Virginia that supplied Union soldiers and sent few or no men to fight for the Confederacy had few slaves, a high percentage of poor families, and a history of opposition to secession. These areas were located near northern states and were often under Union control.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Sheehan-Dean, "Everyman's War: Confederate Enlistment in Civil  War Virginia," ''Civil War History'', March 2004, Vol. 50 Issue 1, pp 5-26&lt;/ref&gt; 40% of Virginia's officers in the United States military when the war started stayed and fought for the Union.&lt;ref name="pryor20110419"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/the-general-in-his-study/ | title=The General in His Study | publisher=The New York Times | work=Disunion | date=2011-04-19 | accessdate=April 19, 2011 | author=Pryor, Elizabeth Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These men included Winfield Scott, General-in-Chief of the Union Army, David G. Farragut, First Admiral of the Union Navy, and General George Henry Thomas.

At least one Virginian actually served in both the Confederate and Union armies. At the beginning of the war, a Confederate soldier from Fairfax County approached the Union soldiers guarding Chain Bridge in his Confederate uniform. Asked what he was doing trying to cross the bridge, he responded that he was travelling to Washington, D.C. to see his uncle. The perplexed Union soldiers asked who his uncle was and the soldier replied his name is Uncle Sam. He was quickly enlisted as a Union scout due to his knowledge of the local terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=0kK4RCGWvqwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=fairfax+county+during+the+civil+war&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_qV-U67eLJWkyAS4loLIDw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212132824/https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=0kK4RCGWvqwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=fairfax+county+during+the+civil+war&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_qV-U67eLJWkyAS4loLIDw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maps currently in the project ==

The project currently includes editions of thirteen ''mappamundi'':

* [[Early world maps#Anglo-Saxon Cotton world map (c. 1040)|Cotton World Map]] (BL Cotton Tiberius B.v, f. 56v)

== Medieval maps of the world ==

Traditionally, western European medieval ''mappaemundi'', or world maps, have been divided into two categories: [[t and o map|T-O maps]] and zonal maps. T-O maps are names as such because of their tripartite structure - a T rests inside an O, dividing the world into the three known continents. At the top is Asia, the bottom left quadrant contains areas of Europe, and the bottom right quadrant Africa. The orientation of T-O maps is usually shifted 90 degrees to the left, such that the cardinal direction of east, i.e. paradise, India and parts of Asia for a medieval mind are located at the very top of the map. Zonal maps, however, are usually oriented with north at the top, and the world is divided into four latitudinal zones that represent climate and indicate appropriateness for habitation.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, David. “Medieval Mappaemundi,” in ''The History of Cartography, Vol. 1: Cartography in Prehistoric, Ancient, and Medieval Europe and the Mediterranean'', edited by J. B. Harley and David Woodward (University of Chicago Press, 1987), 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of medieval maps are included in the Virtual Mappa project.

== Project history and support ==

The project came out of digital humanities research by project leader Martin Foys of medieval artifacts and media that resisted traditional modes of print-based scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ls.wisc.edu/news/digitizing-the-middle-ages | title=Digitizing the middle ages| date=2017-04-10| last1=Vaughn| first1=Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval ''mappamundi'' represented a problem of representation and analysis that digital tools and techniques could help address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wpt.org/University-Place/digital-mappa-project | title=The Digital Mappa Project | last1= Wisconsin Public Television| date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital humanities resource of digital annotation and linking tools that was developed to collect, annotate and network medieval maps was Digital Mappa, which is now its own freely-available online workspace and digital publishing platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medievalists.net/2018/04/digital-mappa-1-0-now-online-new-digital-resource-for-medievalists/ | title=Digital Mappa 1.0 now online – new digital resource for medievalists| date=2018-04-16| last1=Medievalist.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://progressivegeographies.com/2018/08/02/the-virtual-mappa-project-and-digital-mappa-online-editions-of-medieval-maps-from-the-british-library-and-elsewhere/ | title=The Virtual Mappa Project and Digital Mappa – Online editions of Medieval Maps from the British Library and elsewhere| date=2018-08-02 | last1=Progressive Geographies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Digital Mappa (DM) platform, Virtual Mappa has been funded by grants by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF) at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].

'''Western culture''', sometimes equated with '''Western civilization''', '''Occidental culture''', the '''[[Western world]]''', '''Western society''', and '''European civilization''', is a term used very broadly to refer to a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] of [[social norms]], [[ethical value]]s, [[tradition]]al customs, [[belief systems]], [[political system]]s and specific [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] and [[technology|technologies]] that have some origin or association with [[Europe]]. The term also applies beyond Europe to countries and cultures whose [[history|histories]] are strongly connected to Europe by immigration, colonization, or influence. For example, Western culture includes countries in the [[Americas]] and [[Australasia]], whose language and [[European emigration|demographic ethnicity]] majorities are European. The development of western culture has been strongly influenced by [[Role of Christianity in civilization|Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roman-Catholicism |title=Roman Catholicism, "Roman Catholicism, Christian church that has been the decisive spiritual force in the history of Western civilization".

The West as a geographical area is unclear and undefined. More often a country's ideology is what will be used to categorize it as a Western society. There is some disagreement about what nations should or should not be included in the category and at what times. Many parts of the Eastern Roman Empire are considered Western today but were Eastern in the past. Geographically, the "[[Western world|West]]" of today would include Europe (especially the [[European Union]] countries) together with extra-European territories belonging to the [[English-speaking world]], the [[Hispanidad]], the [[Lusosphere]]; and the [[Francophonie]] in the wider context. Since the context is highly biased and context-dependent, there is no agreed definition what the "West" is.

It is difficult to determine which individuals fit into which category and the East–West contrast is sometimes criticized as [[relativism|relativistic]] and arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Yin Cheong Cheng, ''New Paradigm for Re-engineering Education''. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Thomas Embree]], [[Carol Gluck]], ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''. p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kwang-Sae Lee, ''East and West: Fusion of Horizons''{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}} Globalism has spread Western ideas so widely that almost all modern cultures are, to some extent, influenced by aspects of Western culture. Stereotyped views of "the West" have been labeled [[Occidentalism]], paralleling [[Orientalism]]—the term for the 19th-century stereotyped views of "the East".

As Europe discovered the wider world, old concepts adapted. The area that had formerly been considered the [[Orient]] ("the East") became the [[Near East]] as the interests of the European powers interfered with [[Meiji Period|Meiji Japan]] and [[Qing China]] for the first time in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="davison"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East? |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=665–75 |year=1960 |doi=10.2307/20029452 |postscript=. |jstor=20029452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894–1895 occurred in the [[Far East]] while the troubles surrounding the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] simultaneously occurred in the Near East.{{efn|British archaeologist [[David George Hogarth|D.G.

{{further|History of Western civilization}}
{{histphil}}
The earliest [[civilization]]s which influenced the development of western culture were those of [[Mesopotamia]]; the area of the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system]], largely corresponding to modern-day [[Iraq]], northeastern [[Syria]], southeastern [[Turkey]] and southwestern [[Iran]]: the [[cradle of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacobus Bronowski]]; ''The Ascent of Man''; Angus &amp; Robertson, 1973 {{ISBN|0-563-17064-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greeks]] contrasted themselves to their [[History of Anatolia|Eastern neighbors]], such as the [[Troy|Trojans]] in ''[[Iliad]]'', setting an example for later contrasts between east and west. In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Near East]] provided a contrast to the West, though it had been [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] since the time of [[Alexander the Great]].

Concepts of what is ''the West'' arose out of legacies of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Later, ideas of the west were formed by the concepts of [[Greek East and Latin West|Latin Christendom]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. What we think of as Western thought today originates primarily from [[Greco-Roman]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influences, and includes the ideals of the [[Middle Ages]], [[the Renaissance]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], as well as [[Christian]] culture.

=== Classical West ===
[[File:Aleksander-d-store.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Alexander the Great]]]]
In [[Homer]]ic literature, and right up until the time of [[Alexander the Great]], for example in the accounts of the [[Persian Wars]] of [[Greeks]] against [[Persia]]ns by [[Herodotus]], we see the [[paradigm]] of a contrast between the West and East.

Nevertheless, the Greeks felt they were the most civilized and saw themselves (in the formulation of [[Aristotle]]) as something between the wild [[barbarians]] of most of Europe and the soft, slavish [[Middle-East]]erners. Ancient Greek [[scientific method|science]], [[philosophy]], [[democracy]], [[classical architecture|architecture]], [[classical literature|literature]], and [[art]] provided a foundation embraced and built upon by the [[Roman Empire]] as it swept up Europe, including the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic World]] in its conquests in the 1st century BCE. In the meantime, however, Greece, under Alexander, had become a capital of the East, and part of an [[empire]]. The Celts also created some significant literature in the ancient world whenever they were given the opportunity (an example being the poet [[Caecilius Statius]]). They also developed a large amount of scientific knowledge themselves, as seen in their [[Coligny Calendar]].

It is a mid-sized [[Augustus|Augustan]] provincial temple of the theocratic [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] of the Empire. The Imperial cult was inseparable from that of Rome's official deities, whose cult was essential to Rome's survival and whose neglect was therefore treasonous. Traditional cult was a focus of Imperial revivalist legislation under [[Decius]] and [[Diocletian]].]]
[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Roman Empire]] at its greatest extent.]]
For about five hundred years, the Roman Empire maintained the [[Greek East]] and consolidated a Latin West, but an East-West division remained, reflected in many cultural norms of the two areas, including language. Although Rome, like Greece, was no longer democratic, the idea of democracy remained a part of the education of citizens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Eventually, the empire became increasingly split into a Western and Eastern part, reviving old ideas of a contrast between an advanced East, and a rugged West. In the Roman world one could speak of three main directions: North (Celtic tribal states and Parthians), the East (''lux ex oriente''), and finally South, which implied danger, historically via the [[Punic Wars]] (''Quid novi ex Africa?'').

From the time of Alexander the Great (the [[Hellenistic period]]) Greek civilization came in contact with Jewish civilization. [[Christianity]] would eventually emerge from the [[syncretism]] of [[Hellenism (Greek culture)|Hellenic culture]], [[Roman culture]], and [[Second Temple Judaism]], gradually spreading across the [[Roman Empire]] and eclipsing its antecedents and influences.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Cyrus H., The Common Background of the Greek and Hebrew Civilasations, W. W. Norton and Company, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of Christianity reshaped much of the Graeco-Roman tradition and [[culture]]; the Christianised culture would be the basis for the development of Western civilization after the fall of Rome (which resulted from increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture). Roman culture also mixed with [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] cultures, which slowly became integrated into Western culture: starting mainly with their acceptance of Christianity.

=== Medieval West ===
[[File:Slovakia region Spis 33.jpg|thumb|Two main symbols of the medieval Western civilization on one picture: the gothic [[Spišská Kapitula and St. Martin's Cathedral|St. Martin's cathedral]] in [[Spišské Podhradie]] ([[Slovakia]]) and the [[Spiš Castle]] behind the cathedral.]]
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Justinian I]]]]

The Medieval West was at its broadest the same as [[Christendom]],&lt;ref name="Dawson 1961 108" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koch |first=Carl |title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission |year=1994 |publisher=St. Mary's Press |location=The Age of Enlightenment |isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; including both the "Latin" West, also called "Frankish" during [[Charlemagne]]'s reign and the Orthodox Eastern part, where Greek remained the language of empire.

After the [[fall of Rome]], much of Greco-Roman art, literature, science and even technology were all but lost in the western part of the old empire. However, this would become the centre of a new West. Europe fell into political anarchy, with many warring kingdoms and principalities. Under the Frankish kings, it eventually, and partially, reunified, and the anarchy evolved into [[feudalism]].

Much of the basis of the post-Roman cultural world had been set before the fall of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], mainly through the integration and reshaping of Roman ideas through Christian thought. The Greek and Roman [[Religion in ancient Rome|paganism]] had been completely replaced by [[Christianity]] around the 4th and 5th centuries, since it became the official State religion following the baptism of emperor [[Constantine I]]. [[Orthodox Christian]] Christianity and the [[Nicene Creed]] served as a unifying force in Christian parts of Europe, and in some respects replaced or competed with the secular authorities. The [[Jewish Christian]] tradition out of which it had emerged was all but extinguished, and [[antisemitism]] became increasingly entrenched or even integral to Christendom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34892303 |title=Christian antisemitism : a history of hate |last=William, |first=Nicholls, |isbn=978-1-56821-519-8 |edition=1st Jason Aronson softcover |location=Northvale, New Jersey |oclc=34892303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9112202 |title=The origins of anti-semitism : attitudes toward Judaism in pagan and Christian antiquity |last=G. |first=Gager, John |date=1983 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-503607-7 |location=New York |oclc=9112202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church, in an environment that, otherwise, would have probably seen their loss.

Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is "at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization."&lt;ref name="National Review Book Service" /&gt;

In a broader sense, the [[Middle Ages]], with its fertile encounter between Greek philosophical [[reasoning]] and [[Levant]]ine [[monotheism]] was not confined to the West but also stretched into the old East. The philosophy and science of Classical Greece was largely forgotten in Europe after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, other than in isolated monastic enclaves (notably in Ireland, which had become Christian but was never conquered by Rome).&lt;ref&gt;"How The Irish Saved Civilisation", by Thomas Cahill, 1995{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning of [[Classical Antiquity]] was better preserved in the [[Byzantine]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Justinian's [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] Roman civil law code was preserved in the East and Constantinople maintained trade and intermittent political control over outposts such as [[Venice]] in the West for centuries. Classical Greek learning was also subsumed, preserved and elaborated in the rising Eastern world, which gradually supplanted Roman-Byzantine control as a dominant cultural-political force. Thus, much of the learning of classical antiquity was slowly reintroduced to European civilization in the centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.

The rediscovery of the [[Roman law|Justinian Code]] in Western Europe early in the 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. In the [[Catholic]] or [[Franks|Frankish]] west, [[Roman law]] became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence is found in all Western legal systems, although in different manners and to different extents. The study of [[canon law]], the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship. During the Reformation and Enlightenment, the ideas of [[civil rights]], [[social equality|equality]] before the [[law]], [[procedural justice]], and [[democracy]] as the ideal form of [[society]] began to be institutionalized as principles forming the basis of modern Western culture, particularly in Protestant regions.

In the 14th century, starting from Italy and then spreading throughout Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; there was a massive artistic, architectural, scientific and philosophical revival, as a result of the Christian revival of Greek philosophy, and the long Christian medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities.&lt;ref name=Grant9&gt;Grant ''God and Reason'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; This period is commonly referred to as the [[Renaissance]]. In the following century, this process was further enhanced by an exodus of Greek Christian priests and [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|scholars]] to Italian cities such as [[Venice]] after the end of the [[Byzantine Empire]] with the [[fall of Constantinople]].

From [[Late Antiquity]], through the [[Middle Ages]], and onwards, while Eastern Europe was shaped by the [[Orthodox Church]], Southern and Central Europe were increasingly stabilized by the [[Catholic Church]] which, as Roman imperial governance faded from view, was the only consistent force in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Koch 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Koch |first=Carl |title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission |year=1994 |publisher=St. Mary's Press |location=Early Middle Ages |isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1054 came the so-called [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] that, following the [[Greek East and Latin West]] divide, separated Europe into religious and cultural regions present to this day.

From the late 15th century to the 17th century, Western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the [[Age of Discovery]], and by [[Imperialism|imperialists]] from the 17th century to the early 20th century. During the [[Great Divergence]], a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]{{sfn|Frank|2001}} the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]] of the time, eclipsing [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions.

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[United States Constitution]]]]

Coming into the [[modern era]], the historical understanding of the East-West contrast—as the opposition of [[Christendom]] to its geographical neighbors—began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The [[Age of Discovery]] faded into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in Western Europe emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the [[Catholic Church]]; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and [[skepticism]].

Philosophers of the Enlightenment included [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778), [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Sootin, Harry. "Isaac Newton." New York, Messner (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as [[enlightened absolutism]]. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–72) that was edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. The ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'' (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and ''[[Letters on the English]]'' (1733) written by [[Voltaire]] spread the ideals of the Enlightenment.

Coinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the [[scientific revolution]], spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of [[modern science]], during which developments in [[History of mathematics#Mathematics during the Scientific Revolution|mathematics]], [[History of physics#Scientific Revolution|physics]], [[History of astronomy#Renaissance Period|astronomy]], [[History of biology#Renaissance and early modern developments|biology]] (including [[History of anatomy|human anatomy]]) and [[History of chemistry#17th and 18th centuries: Early chemistry|chemistry]] transformed views of society and nature.&lt;ref name="Galileo"&gt;Galileo Galilei, ''Two New Sciences'', trans.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of [[water wheel|water power]], the increasing use of [[steam power]], and the development of [[machine tool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|1969|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; These transitions began in Great Britain, and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Landes|1969"&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the [[standard of living]] for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lectures on Economic Growth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Robert E., Jr. |authorlink= |title=Lectures on Economic Growth |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2002 |location=Cambridge |pages=109–10 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-674-01601-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feinstein |first=Charles |title=Pessimism Perpetuated: Real Wages and the Standard of Living in Britain during and after the Industrial Revolution |journal=Journal of Economic History |date=September 1998 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=625–58 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4123540 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700021100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SzreterMooney2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Szreter &amp; Mooney |title=Urbanization, Mortality, and the Standard of Living Debate: New Estimates of the Expectation of Life at Birth in Nineteenth-Century British Cities |journal=The Economic History Review |date=February 1998 |volume=51 |issue=1 |page=104 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0289.00084/abstract |accessdate=6 May 2014 |doi=10.1111/1468-0289.00084 |last2=Mooney}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.&lt;ref name="revolution"&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Ltd., p. 27 {{ISBN|0-349-10484-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;Joseph E Inikori.

Some cultural and artistic modalities are characteristically Western in origin and form. While dance, music, visual art, story-telling, and architecture are human universals, they are expressed in the West in certain characteristic ways.

In Western dance, music, plays and other arts, the performers are only very infrequently masked. There are essentially no taboos against depicting a god, or other religious figures, in a representational fashion.

=== Music ===
[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] composed many Masses and religious works, including his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] ''[[Ode to Joy]]''.]]
In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[sonata]], [[opera]], and [[oratorio]] have their origins in Italy. Many musical instruments developed in the West have come to see widespread use all over the world; among them are the [[violin]], [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[accordion]], and the [[theremin]]. The solo [[piano]], [[symphony orchestra]], and the [[string quartet]] are also significant musical innovations of the West.

=== Painting and photography ===

[[Jan van Eyck]], among other renaissance painters, made great advances in [[oil painting]], and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawings and paintings had their earliest practitioners in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In art, the [[Celtic knot]] is a very distinctive Western repeated motif. Depictions of the [[nude]] human male and female in photography, painting, and sculpture are frequently considered to have special artistic merit. Realistic [[portrait]]ure is especially valued.

Photography, and the [[motion picture]] as both a technology and basis for entirely new art forms were also developed in the West.

=== Dance and performing arts ===
[[File:Swanlake001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Classical music]], [[opera]] and [[ballet]]. ''[[Swan lake]]'' pictured (here, [[Zenaida Yanowsky]] as ''Odette'')]]
The [[ballet]] is a distinctively Western form of performance dance.&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ballroom dance]] is an important Western variety of dance for the elite. The [[polka]], the [[square dance]], and the Irish [[step dance]] are very well known Western forms of [[folk dance]].

[[Greek theater|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] are considered the antecedents of modern [[theatre]], and forms such as [[medieval theatre]], [[Passion Play|passion plays]], [[morality play]]s, and [[Commedia dell'arte]] are considered highly influential. [[Elizabethan theater]], with such luminaries as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], and [[Ben Jonson]], is considered one of the most formative and important eras for modern drama.

The [[soap opera]], a popular culture dramatic form, originated in the United States first on radio in the 1930s, then a couple of decades later on television. The [[music video]] was also developed in the West in the middle of the 20th century. [[Musical theatre]] was developed in the West in the 19th and 20th Centuries, from [[music hall]], [[comic opera]], and [[Vaudeville]]; with significant contributions from the [[Jewish diaspora]], [[African-American culture|African-Americans]], and other marginalized peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/668182929 |title=Jews on Broadway : an historical survey of performers, playwrights, composers, lyricists and producers |last=F. |first=Lane, Stewart |date=2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-5917-9 |location=Jefferson, N.C. |oclc=668182929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52520631 |title=Making Americans : Jews and the Broadway musical |last=Andrea. |first=Most, |date=2004 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-01165-6 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=52520631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654535012 |title=Our musicals, ourselves : a social history of the American musical theater |last=Bush. |first=Jones, John |date=2003 |publisher=Brandeis University Press, published by University Press of New England |isbn=1-61168-223-1 |location=Hanover |oclc=654535012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
[[File:Gustave Doré - Dante Alighieri - Inferno - Plate 9 (Canto III - Charon).jpg|thumb|The ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' is an [[epic poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work in [[Italian literature]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Encyclopedia Americana'', 2006, Vol. 30. p. 605: "the greatest single work of Italian literature;" John Julius Norwich, ''The Italians: History, Art, and the Genius of a People'', Abrams, 1983, p. 27: "his tremendous poem, still after six and a half centuries the supreme work of Italian literature, remains—after the legacy of ancient Rome—the grandest single element in the Italian heritage;" and Robert Reinhold Ergang, ''The Renaissance'', Van Nostrand, 1967, p. 103: "Many literary historians regard the Divine Comedy as the greatest work of Italian literature. In world literature it is ranked as an epic poem of the highest order."&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen as one of the greatest works of [[world literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold Bloom |title=The Western Canon |year=1994}} See also [[Western canon]] for other "canons" that include the ''Divine Comedy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's imaginative vision of the [[afterlife]] is representative of the [[medieval philosophy|medieval world-view]] as it had developed in the [[Catholic Church|Western Church]] by the 14th century. In this scene, [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] comes to ferry souls across the river [[Acheron]] to the Christian [[Hell]]. Engraving by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
While epic literary works in verse such as the [[Mahabharata]] and Homer's [[Iliad]] are ancient and occurred worldwide, the prose [[novel]] as a distinct form of storytelling, with developed, consistent human characters and, typically, some connected overall plot (although both of these characteristics have sometimes been modified and played with in later times), was popularized by the West&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; in the 17th and 18th centuries. Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] world and in [[Heian period|Heian]] Japan. Both [[Petronius]]' [[Satyricon]] (c. 60 CE) and the ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world's first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times.

[[Tragedy]], from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical [[opera]].

=== Architecture ===

Important western architectural motifs include the [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]], and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns, and the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Baroque]], and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles are still widely recognised, and used even today, in the West. Much of western architecture emphasizes repetition of simple motifs, straight lines and expansive, undecorated planes. A modern ubiquitous architectural form that emphasizes this characteristic is the [[skyscraper]], first developed in New York, London, and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=5 February 2018 |title=Early skyscrapers |url=[[Special:PermaLink/824190116]] | journal=Wikipedia |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, it is unusual to see women represented as teachers, in particular when the students appear to be monks.

A notable feature of Western culture is its strong emphasis and focus on innovation and invention through science and technology, and its ability to generate new processes, materials and material artifacts with its roots dating back to the Ancient Greeks. The [[scientific method]] as "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses" was almost entirely fashioned by the Italian [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=2016 |title=Oxford Dictionaries: British and World English |chapter=scientific method |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/scientific-method |accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Kline]] (1985) [https://books.google.com/?id=f-e0bro-0FUC&amp;pg=PA284 ''Mathematics for the nonmathematician'']. [[Courier Dover Publications]]. p. 284. {{ISBN|0-486-24823-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western world has been the leading force in the technological and scientific disciplines: whether measured in people or events, 97 percent of accomplishment in the scientific inventories occurred in Europe and North America. The [[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]] (DoSB) sponsored by the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], concluded that 81 percent of the most significant scientists and mathematicians come from Europe compared to 76 percent in the Human Accomplishment set, numbers that rise to 94 and 91 percent respectively when the United States and [[Canada]] are included.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Murray, Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950, Paperback – 9 November 2004, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] alone account for 72 percent of all the significant scientific figures in science from 1400 to 1950. Add in [[Russia]] and the [[Netherlands]], and 80 percent of all significant figures are accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Murray, Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950, Paperback – 9 November 2004, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the rest, 25% were American and 5% Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Murray, Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950, Paperback – 9 November 2004, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubiquitous materials including [[concrete]], [[aluminium]], clear [[glass]], [[synthetic rubber]], [[synthetic diamond]] and the plastics [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] and [[polystyrene]] were invented in the West. Iron and steel ships, bridges and [[skyscraper]]s first appeared in the West. [[Nitrogen fixation]] and [[petrochemicals]] were invented by Westerners. Most of the [[Chemical element|elements]] were discovered and named in the West, as well as the contemporary [[Bohr model|atomic theories]] to explain them.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2017}}

The [[transistor]], [[integrated circuit]], memory chip, and [[computer]] were all first seen in the West. The [[Longitude by chronometer|ship's chronometer]], the [[screw propeller]], the [[locomotive]], [[bicycle]], [[automobile]], and [[airplane]] were all invented in the West. [[Glasses|Eyeglasses]], the [[telescope]], the [[microscope]] and [[electron microscope]], all the varieties of [[chromatography]], [[Protein sequencing|protein]] and [[DNA sequencing]], [[computerized tomography|computerised tomography]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]], [[x-ray]]s, and light, ultraviolet and infrared [[spectroscopy]], were all first developed and applied in Western laboratories, hospitals and factories.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2017}}

In medicine, the pure [[antibiotics]] were created in the West. The method of preventing [[Rh disease]], the treatment of [[diabetes]], and the [[germ theory]] of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of [[smallpox]], was led by a Westerner, [[Donald Henderson]]. [[Radiography]], [[Computed tomography]], [[Positron emission tomography]] and [[Medical ultrasonography]] are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of [[clinical chemistry]] including the methods of [[spectrophotometry]], [[electrophoresis]] and [[immunoassay]] were first devised by Westerners. So were the [[stethoscope]], [[electrocardiograph]], and the [[endoscope]]. [[Vitamins]], [[hormonal contraception]], [[hormones]], [[insulin]], [[Beta blocker]]s and [[ACE inhibitors]], along with a host of other medically proven drugs were first utilized to treat disease in the West. The [[double-blind]] study and [[evidence-based medicine]] are critical scientific techniques widely used in the West for medical purposes.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2017}}

In mathematics, [[calculus]], [[statistics]], [[mathematical logic|logic]], [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]], [[tensor]]s and [[complex analysis]], [[group theory]] and [[topology]] were developed by Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;* Elwes, Richard, "[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups,]" ''Plus Magazine'', Issue 41, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swineshead]] (1498), ''Calculationes Suiseth Anglici'', Papie: Per Franciscum Gyrardengum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y.

== Media ==
{{Main|Western media}}The [[Western media]] refers to the [[news media]] of the [[Western world]]. The roots of the Western media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when [[printing press]]es began to operate throughout [[Western Europe]]. The emergence of [[news media]] in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the [[spread of the printing press]], from which the publishing [[Publishing|press]] derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weber |first=Johannes |title=Strassburg, 1605: The Origins of the Newspaper in Europe |journal=German History |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=387–412 (387) |year=2006 |doi=10.1191/0266355406gh380oa}}: {{quote|At the same time, then as the printing press in the physical technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was now born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, a decrease in the preeminence of [[New Latin|Latin]] in its literary use, along with the impact of economic change, the "discoveries" arising from trade and travel, navigation to the [[New World|"new" world]], science and arts and the development of increasingly rapid communications through print led to a rising corpus of vernacular media content in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMaNAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=western+media&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBtuSa26TTAhUJJMAKHaG6AnsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20media&amp;f=false |title=Western Media Systems |last=Hardy |first=Jonathan |date=25 February 2010 |publisher=Routledge |year= |isbn=978-1-135-25370-7 |location= |pages=25 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the launch of the satellite [[Sputnik 1]] by the Soviet Union in 1957, satellite transmission technology was dramatically realised, with the U.S. launching [[Telstar]] in 1962 linking live media broadcasts from the UK to the US. The first digital broadcast satellite (DBS) system began transmitting in America in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMaNAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=western+media&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBtuSa26TTAhUJJMAKHaG6AnsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20media&amp;f=false |title=Western Media Systems |last=Hardy |first=Jonathan |date=25 February 2010 |publisher=Routledge |year= |isbn=978-1-135-25370-7 |location= |page=59 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, the [[Internet]] has contributed to a tremendous increase in the accessibility of Western media content. Departing from media offered in bundled content packages ([[magazine]]s, [[Compact disc|CDs]], [[News broadcasting|television and radio slots]]), the Internet has primarily offered unbundled content items ([[Digital journalism|articles]], audio and video files).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzilLEyul5YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=media+internet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid6cmN5KTTAhWKJcAKHY7vDvkQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=media%20internet&amp;f=false |title=The Internet and the Mass Media |last=Küng |first=Lucy |last2=Picard |first2=Robert G. |last3=Towse |first3=Ruth |date=14 May 2008 |publisher=SAGE |year= |isbn=978-1-4462-4566-8 |location= |page=65 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
The native religions of Europe were [[polytheism|polytheistic]] but not homogenous—however they were similar insofar as they were predominantly [[Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] in origin. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] was similar to but not the same as [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenic religion]]—likewise the same for [[Germanic paganism|indigenous Germanic polytheism]], [[Celtic polytheism]] and [[Slavic paganism|Slavic polytheism]]. Western culture, for at least the last 1000 years, has been considered nearly synonymous with [[Christian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawson |first=Christopher |title=Crisis in Western Education |year=1961 |isbn=978-0-8132-1683-6 |edition=reprint |author2=Glenn Olsen |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards.

Western culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Western [[Christian culture]], and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians. The notion of "[[Europe]]" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref name="Dawson 1961 108" /&gt;

As in other areas, the [[Jewish diaspora]] and [[Judaism]] exist in the Western world. Non-European groups, and Jews in particular, have been subjected to intense [[racism]], [[Ethnic hatred|ethnic and]] [[religious hatred]], [[xenophobia]], [[discrimination]], and [[Jewish persecution|persecution]] in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ySMxcXkjIC&amp;dq=christian+antisemitism&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=History, Religion, and Antisemitism |last=Langmuir |first=Gavin I. |date=8 May 1990 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-91226-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFhEmMFZStkC&amp;dq=antisemitism+in+the+west&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Anti-Judaism: The Western Tradition |last=Nirenberg |first=David |date=4 February 2013 |publisher=W.

[[File:Bull-leaping.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bull-Leaping Fresco]] from the Great Palace at [[Knossos]], [[Crete]]. Sport has been an important part of Western cultural expression since [[Classical Antiquity]].]]
[[File:Baron Pierre de Coubertin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], and considered father of the modern [[Olympic Games]].]]

Since [[classical antiquity]], sport has been an important facet of Western cultural expression. A wide range of sports were already established by the time of [[Ancient Greece]] and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the [[Olympic Games]], which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympics were held at [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Athens in]].

The Romans built immense structures such as the [[Colisseum]] in Rome to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for [[blood sports]], such as the infamous [[Gladiator]]ial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of [[Classical Antiquity]]—such as [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], [[discus]] and [[javelin]].
The sport of [[bullfighting]] is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric [[bull worship]] and [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and is often linked to [[Roman Empire|Rome]], where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its Central and South American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.

[[Jousting]] and hunting were popular sports in the Western Europe of the [[Middle Ages]], and the aristocratic classes of Europe developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of the popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of [[golf]] originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is [[James II of Scotland|James II]]'s banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning [[archery]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of [[cricket]] was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the [[British Empire]]. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence—these include [[ping pong]], modern [[tennis]], [[association football]], [[netball]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]].

Football (also known as [[soccer]]) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the ''world game''. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing nations, while victory in the [[Rugby World Cup]] has been shared among the Western nations of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and England.

[[Australian Rules Football]], an Australian variation of football with similarities to [[Gaelic football]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] evolved in the British [[colony of Victoria]] in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of [[baseball]] to America during the colonial period. The history of [[American football]] can be traced to early versions of rugby football and [[association football]]. Many games known as "football" were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by [[Walter Camp]], the "Father of American Football". [[Basketball]] was invented in 1891 by [[James Naismith]], a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States.

== Themes and traditions ==
[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Madonna and Child]] painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas.]]
Western culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
* Greco-Roman classic letters, arts, architecture, philosophical and cultural tradition, which include the influence of preeminent authors and philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Homer]], [[Virgil]], and [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]], as well as a long [[Greek mythology|mythologic tradition]].
* [[Christianity|Christian]] ethical, philosophical, and [[Jewish mythology|mythological]] tradition, stemming largely from the [[Bible|Christian Bible]], particularly the [[New Testament]] Gospels.
* Monasteries, [[schools]], [[libraries]], [[books]], book making, [[universities]], teaching, [[education]], and lecture halls.
* A tradition of the importance of [[the rule of law]].
* [[Secular humanism]], [[rationalism]] and Enlightenment thought. This set the basis for a new critical attitude and open questioning of religion, favouring [[freethinking]] and questioning of the church as an authority, which resulted in open-minded and reformist ideals inside, such as [[liberation theology]], which partly adopted these currents, and secular and political tendencies such as [[laicism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[atheism]].
* Generalized usage of some form of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] or [[Greek alphabet]], and derived forms, such as [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used by those southern and eastern Slavic countries of [[Eastern Christianity|Christian Orthodox]] tradition, historically under the [[Byzantine Empire]] and later within the Russian [[czarist]] or [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] area of influence. Other variants of the Latin or Greek alphabets are found in the [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] and [[Coptic alphabet]]s, which historically superseded older scripts, such as [[Runic|runes]], and the Egyptian [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Hieroglyphic]] systems.
* [[Natural law]], [[human rights]], [[constitutionalism]], [[parliamentarism]] (or [[presidentialism]]) and formal [[liberal democracy]] in recent times—prior to the 19th century, most Western governments were still monarchies.
* A large influence, in [[modern history|modern times]], of many of the ideals and values developed and inherited from [[Romanticism]].
* An emphasis on, and use of, [[science]] as a means of understanding the natural world and humanity's place in it.
* More pronounced use and application of innovation and scientific developments, as well as a more rational approach to scientific progress (what has been known as the [[scientific method]]), as opposed to more empiric discoveries in the [[Eastern world]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74384">In August 1992, the American film director [[Woody Allen]] was accused by his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow, then seven years old, of having sexually assaulted her in the home of her adoptive mother, the actor [[Mia Farrow]], in [[Bridgewater, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; Allen has repeatedly denied the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woody-allen-defends-himself-on-60-minutes-in-92/|title=Woody Allen defends himself on '60 Minutes' in '92|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate= February 8, 2018|archivedate=November 22, 2014| archiveurl=https://archive.is/VNhj0|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllenFeb72014/&gt;

When the allegation was made, Farrow and Allen had been in a 12-year relationship and had three children together: two adopted children, Dylan and Moses, and one biological son, Satchel (now known as [[Ronan Farrow]]).&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; The assault is alleged to have taken place eight months after Farrow learned that Allen had been having an affair with another of her adoptive daughters, [[Soon-Yi Previn]], who married Allen in 1997; Previn was a first-year undergraduate when Farrow found out about the relationship.&lt;ref name=Wypijewski26Feb2014/&gt; Allen alleges that the affair prompted Mia Farrow to concoct the assault allegation as an act of vengeance.&lt;ref name=AllenFeb72014/&gt; The Connecticut [[State's Attorney]] investigated the allegation but did not press charges,&lt;ref name=Henneberger25Sept1993/&gt; and the New York Department of Social Services found "no credible evidence" to support it.&lt;ref name=PerezPena26Oct1993/&gt; In response to the allegation, Allen sued Farrow for sole custody of Dylan, Satchel and Moses.&lt;ref name=Weber14Aug1992/&gt; He lost the case in June 1993; the judge denied him visitation rights with Dylan, gave him limited, supervised visitation with Satchel, and allowed Moses, a teenager, to decide for himself.&lt;ref name=Marks8June1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shea7Feb2014/&gt; The decision was upheld on appeal in 1994&lt;ref name=appeal1994/&gt; and 1995.&lt;ref name=appeal1995/&gt;

Dylan Farrow has repeated the allegation several times as an adult. Her first public comment was in an interview with [[Maureen Orth]] for ''Vanity Fair'' in 2013,&lt;ref name=OrthOct2013/&gt; followed by an open letter in the&lt;!--CMOS 8.170--&gt; ''New York Times'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=Farrow1Feb2014/&gt; a ''Los Angeles Times'' [[op-ed]] in December 2017,&lt;ref name=Farrow7Dec2017/&gt;.
Woody Allen has also spoken publicly about the allegations, in an interview with [[Gayle King]] for ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' in  a ''New York Times'' op-ed&lt;ref name=AllenFeb72014/&gt; and in 2018 with a statement to CBS, denying the allegation in both.&lt;ref name=CBS2018re&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woody-allen-responds-dylan-farrow-sexual-abuse-allegations/|title=Woody  responds to Dylan Farrow sexual abuse allegations|date=January 18, 2018|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Allen and Farrow===
Woody Allen and Mia Farrow began a 12-year relationship in 1980, during which Farrow starred in 13 of Allen's films.&lt;ref name=OrthOct2013&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/11/mia-farrow-frank-sinatra-ronan-farrow| title=Momma Mia!| first=Maureen|last=Orth|author-link=Maureen Orth|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]| date= October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintained separate apartments in [[Manhattan]] throughout the relationship—Farrow on [[Central Park West]]&lt;ref name=Smith8May1994/&gt; and Allen on [[Fifth Avenue]]—and did not marry; they had both been married twice.&lt;ref name=Lax24Feb1991/&gt;

[[File:Mia Farrow 2012 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mia Farrow]], 2012]]
When the relationship began, Farrow had seven children: three biological sons from her marriage to composer [[André Previn]]; three adopted girls (two Vietnamese and one Korean, [[Soon-Yi Previn]]); and one adopted Korean boy, Moses.&lt;ref name=Lax24Feb1991&gt;{{cite news | title=Woody and Mia: A New York Story |first=Eric|last=Lax|work=The New York Times|date=February 24, 1991|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/24/magazine/woody-and-mia-a-new-york-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woody Allen, Mia Farrow family tree|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/03/showbiz/gallery/allen-farrow-family-tree/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1985 she adopted a baby girl, Dylan, from Texas. Allen was not involved in the adoption, but when Dylan arrived he assumed a parental role toward her and began spending more time in Farrow's home. He and Farrow went on holiday to Europe several times with the Farrow–Previn children between 1987 and 1989.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=Inside the Shocking Custody Case Court Documents that Shed Light on the Dylan Farrow-Woody Allen Saga|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shocking-custody-case-court-documents-that-shed-light-on-the-dylan-farrow-woody-allen-saga|work=The Daily Beast|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1987 Farrow gave birth to Allen's biological son, Satchel (later known as [[Ronan Farrow]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/22/arts/son-born-to-mia-farrow-and-woody-allen.html | title = Son Born to Mia Farrow And Woody Allen | agency = Associated Press |newspaper=The New York Times | date= December 22, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrow wanted to adopt another child in 1991; Allen said he would not take "a lousy attitude toward it" so long as she agreed to his adoption of Dylan and Moses,&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; and in October that year she adopted another Vietnamese child.{{efn|Farrow found that the child was too disabled and needed more care than she could provide; she helped to find him another family.&lt;ref name=Smith8May1994&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dinitia|first1=Smith|title=Picking Up The Legos And The Pieces|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-feature.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 8, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Allen's adoption of Dylan and Moses was finalized on December 17, 1991.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt;

According to her testimony during the custody trial, Farrow became concerned about Allen's behavior around Dylan in 1987–1988. She reportedly told Allen that he was paying too much attention to Dylan and failing to give her "breathing room". He had allegedly read to Dylan while in his underwear, allowed her to suck his thumb, and would sit on her bed in the morning waiting for her to wake up.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marks27March1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; Farrow would later testify that she found Allen's relationship with Dylan at this time "relentless and overpowering" and said it had "a wooing quality". &lt;ref name="wmr"&gt;[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/25/Mia-I-worried-about-Woody-being-a-homosexual/8544733035600/ "Mia: I worried about Woody being a homosexual"]. William M. Reilly, March 25, 1993. [[UPI.com]]. Retrieved 14 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Farrow also told her therapist that she feared Woody "would abuse Satchel", and that she also worried that Allen had a sexual relationship "with another man".&lt;ref name="wmr" /&gt; On one occasion, Dylan allegedly locked herself in the bathroom for four hours when he arrived; Allen had an employee pick the lock with a coat hanger.&lt;ref name=Marks27March1993/&gt; The family psychologist, Dr. Susan Coates, witnessed some of Allen's behavior and testified during the custody trial in 1993 that she did not see it as sexual, but as "inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else".&lt;ref name=Wypijewski26Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marks30March1993/&gt; Allen said later that he had paid extra attention to Dylan to compensate for the time Farrow was spending with the newborn, Satchel.&lt;ref name=appeal1994/&gt; He agreed in 1990 to discuss the issue in therapy sessions.&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt;

===Relationship with Previn===
In or around 1991 Allen began an affair with Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. According to Allen, it began in late December 1991.&lt;ref name=PerezPena23March1993/&gt; According to Farrow, it began while Previn was in her final year of high school, which ended in June 1991. She alleges that Dylan saw Allen and Previn on the bed together in the summer or autumn of 1991.&lt;ref name=Marks27March1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=Farrow Says Daughter Became Distraught Over Allen's Relentless Attention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/farrow-trial.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 27, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the bones of contention has been how old Previn was at the time. When Farrow and André Previn adopted her from [[Seoul]] in 1978, the Seoul family court gave her a "presumptive birth date" of October 8, 1970; she had been abandoned and was living in that city's St. Paul's Orphanage.{{efn|"Information concerning this case was obtained from Mr. and Mrs. André G. Previn&amp;nbsp;... The beneficiary, Soon Hee Oh, aka Soon Yi Oh, is a native and citizen of Korea with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970."&lt;ref&gt;United States Congressional Serial Set, Issue 13173, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1TYoAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Soon+Hee+Oh,+aka+Soon+Yi+Oh%22 170].&lt;/ref&gt; "Memorandum of information concerning H.R. 1352 for the relief of Oh Soon Hee submitted by the American Embassy at Seoul, Korea. The beneficiary is an abandoned child, who was found in Seoul, Korea on February 12, 1976. She was placed temporarily in the care of Maria's House, a local institution for abandoned children while an effort was made to identify and locate her parents and relatives. When this search failed, the beneficiary was transferred to the care of St. Paul's Orphanage&amp;nbsp;... in Seoul, where she currently lives. The Seoul Family Court established a Family Census Register (legal birth document) in her behalf on December 28, 1976, with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970. The beneficiary attends kindergarten classes held in the orphanage. Through the auspices of the Social Welfare Society, Inc.,&amp;nbsp;... and the Friends of Children adoption agency in the United States, the child has been selected for adoption by Mr. and Mrs. André George Previn, of Martha's Vineyard, Mass.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;United States Congressional Serial Set, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UPBIAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Soon-Yi%22+Previn+%22October+8%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22October+8%22 cxlii–cxliv].&lt;/ref&gt;}} A bone scan in the United States in 1978 indicated that she was between five and seven years old;&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; according to Farrow, the family regarded her date of birth as October 8, 1972.&lt;ref name=Wypijewski26Feb2014/&gt; The timing of the affair became an issue in part because Farrow attempted, unsuccessfully, to have Allen's adoption of Dylan and Moses declared void after the molestation allegation, on the grounds that his affair with Previn had begun before the adoptions were finalized on December 17, 1991.&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993/&gt;

[[File:Soon Yi Previn and Woody Allen at the Tribeca Film Festival.jpg|thumb|left|[[Soon-Yi Previn]] and [[Woody Allen]], 2009]]
During her final year of high school, Previn told Allen that she wanted to be a model; he advised her how to dress and arranged for professional photographs to be taken.&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; She reportedly asked if she could accompany him to a basketball game, and after attending several together, they became closer.&lt;ref name=Isaacson31Aug1992&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isaacson|first1=Walter|title=The Heart Wants What It Wants|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,160439,00.html|work=Time|date=June 24, 2001|at=First published August 31, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; Their affair came to light on January 13, 1992, when Farrow found nude [[Instant camera|Polaroid]] photographs of Previn on the [[Fireplace mantel|mantel]] in Allen's home.&lt;ref name=Wypijewski26Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perez20March1993/&gt; Previn was by then in her first year at [[Drew University]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992/&gt; Allen, then 56, told Farrow that he had taken the photographs the day before, and that he and Previn had first had sex in the last week of December 1991.&lt;ref name=PerezPena23March1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez-Pena|first1=Richard|title=Nude Photographs Are Focus Of Woody Allen's Testimony|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/23/nyregion/nude-photographs-are-focus-of-woody-allen-s-testimony.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 23, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993/&gt; Allen told the custody trial in 1993 that he regarded the images as erotic, but not pornographic; the appellate court said that it did not "share Mr. Allen's characterization" of the photographs.&lt;ref name=appeal1994/&gt;

Allen and Previn remained in contact; in July 1992 she lost her job as a summer-camp counselor in Maine after spending too much time on the telephone with a "Mr. Simon", who turned out to be Allen.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; In July 1992, after Allen visited Connecticut to celebrate Dylan's birthday, Farrow left a note near Allen's bedroom, in which she called him a "child molester." &lt;ref&gt;"Allen Said Farrow Made Good On Her Promise".

Present in the house, once Farrow had left, were Dylan and Satchel; Farrow's babysitter, Kristie Groteke; the children's French tutor, Sophie Berge; Farrow's friend's three children; and Farrow's friend's babysitter, Alison Stickland.{{sfnp|Farrow|1997|p=270}} The day after the visit, Stickland told her employer that she had seen Allen kneel on the floor in front of Dylan, then aged seven, with his face in her lap turned toward Dylan's body; she testified to that effect during the custody trial.&lt;ref name=MarksApril101993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=Sitter Questions Allen Actions With Daughter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/10/nyregion/sitter-questions-allen-actions-with-daughter.html|work=The New York Times|date=April 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Farrow asked Dylan about it, Dylan described what had happened and said she had not liked it; she also said that Allen had touched her "private part" while they were alone together in the attic crawl space.&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=OrthNov1992&gt;{{cite news |last=Orth|first=Maureen|author-link=Maureen Orth|title=Mia's Story|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=August 5, 2008|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1992/11/farrow199211|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221205817/http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1992/11/farrow199211|archive-date=November 1992|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, that Dylan’s statements were true and that Mr. Allen had sexually abused her; second, that Dylan’s statements were not true but were made up by an emotionally vulnerable child who was caught up in a disturbed family and who was responding to the stresses in the family; and third, that Dylan was coached or influenced by her mother, Ms. Farrow.

===Allen's appeals, other legal action===
In December 1992 Farrow began legal action, which was ultimately unsuccessful, to have Allen's adoption of Dylan and Moses declared void. Her position was based, in part, on her view that Allen's affair with Soon-Yi Previn had begun before the adoption was finalized on December 17, 1991.&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez-Pena|first1=Richard|title=Farrow Spurns Allen's Plea For a Truce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/nyregion/farrow-spurns-allen-s-plea-for-a-truce.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern10Feb2014/&gt; Allen stated that the sexual relationship had started in the last week of 1991.&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993/&gt; Allen offered not to appeal the custody ruling if Farrow would drop her attempt to have his adoption of Dylan and Moses declared void, but she refused.&lt;ref name=Perez19June1993/&gt;

Although the Yale–New Haven team's view that Dylan had a tendency to "withdraw into a fantasy", and that she had offered inconsistent accounts, had to be taken into account, the court stated that "the testimony given at trial by the individuals caring for the children that day, the videotape of Dylan made by Ms. Farrow the following day and the accounts of Dylan's behavior toward Mr. Allen both before and after the alleged instance of abuse, suggest that the abuse did occur." It added that "the evidence in support of the allegations remains inconclusive". The court was critical of Allen's parenting skills and relationship with Soon-Yi Previn. The appeal failed, although two of the five judges said the visitation rights regarding Satchel were too restrictive.&lt;ref name=appeal1994&gt;[https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994524197ad2d3271461 Allen v.

Dylan's brother Moses Farrow, who was 14 in 1992, has taken a different view; he has reconciled with Allen and is now estranged from the Farrow family. When Dylan published her open letter, he said in an interview that several people had been in the house on the disputed day and that "no one, not my father or sister, was off in any private spaces". He asserted that Mia Farrow had cultivated a climate in which he and his siblings had felt compelled to support her views, and that she had both physically and emotionally abused him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Rothman|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dylan-farrows-brother-moses-mia-farrow-woody-allen/story?id=22377303|title=Dylan Farrow's Brother Moses Says Mia Farrow, Not Woody Allen Was Abusive |publisher= ABC News |date= February 5, 2014}}{{pb}}

Moses Farrow wrote an extensive blog post accusing Mia Farrow of emotionally abusing her children and driving some to suicide: "Most media sources claim my sister Tam died of 'heart failure' at the age of 21. In fact, Tam struggled with depression for much of her life, a situation exacerbated by my mother refusing to get her help, insisting that Tam was just 'moody.'
