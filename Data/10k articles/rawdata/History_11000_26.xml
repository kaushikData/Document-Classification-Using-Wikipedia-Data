==Science fiction set in the 27th century==
* The 1937 novel ''[[Swastika Night]]'' by [[Katharine Burdekin]] takes place in the 27th century, seven hundred years after [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 2633.
* The prologue and epilogue of ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'' take place in 2670.
* [[Jerzy Żuławski]]'s classic trilogy of novels ''[[On the Silver Globe (novel)|The Lunar Trilogy]]'' are set in the 27th century in which a race of moon dwarves search for a route back to [[Earth]] through spiritual enlightenment.

* [[Roberto Bolaño]] in his novel ''Los Detectives Salvajes'', through one of the main characters, Cesarea Tinajero (original founder of the real visceralismo poetry society) envisions the 27th century as a time when some dark events will happen in the north of Mexico. In ''2666'', Bolaño's last novel, he describes hundreds of rapes and murders in the north of Mexico, most likely linked with the events written in ''Los Detectives Salvajes''.
* In the [[video game]] series ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'', the [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]], following five years of raids against their shipping by the [[Kilrathi]], officially declares war on July 5, 2634.

* The ''[[Contra (series)|Contra]]'' series of video games (with the exception of ''[[Contra Force]]'' and ''[[Neo Contra]]'') is set during this century. The original American localizations of the titles prior to ''[[Contra III: The Alien Wars]]'' changed the setting from the future to the present.
* The  video game ''[[Earthsiege 2]]'' begins in the year 2624, with the Earth having been in a major [[world war|global war]] against a self-controlled [[AI]] called "Prometheus".

* In ''[[The End of Eternity]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]] (1955), it is in the late 27th century that the researches of Jan Verdeer and the mathematician Antoine Lefebvre realize the exploitation of "temporal field" technology some three centuries after its mysterious empirical discovery by an eccentric inventor in the 24th.  Temporal engineers could now generate a field of "physiotime", or Eternity, a realm outside of normal time, large enough to enclose men and equipment, and use it to reach into the future.  This, coupled with the discovery that they could secretly alter the course of human events without affecting themselves, enables their control over the next 69,973 centuries of human history.
* The events of sci-fi films ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]'' are set in the 27th century.

He spent most of his time stealing famous world monuments and even added his face to [[Mt. Rushmore]]. Also, in the episode "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]", the Professor says that in 2620, astronomers renamed Uranus "Urectum" to end "the stupid Uranus joke once and for all". Also, in 2636, Mars University is founded on the planet Mars.
* In ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'''s fifth-season episode "[[The Boy Must Live]]", the character Windmark time travels to Manhattan in the year 2609, depicted as a bleak, [[dystopian]] world populated by an evolved race of highly intelligent but emotionless humans deemed "the Observers" by the show's protagonists.

The '''Admiral's Men''' (also called the '''Admiral's company''', more strictly, the '''Earl of Nottingham's Men'''; after 1603, '''Prince Henry's Men'''; after 1612, the '''Elector Palatine's Men''' or the '''Palsgrave's Men''') was a [[playing company]] or troupe of actors in the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] eras. It is generally considered the second most important acting troupe of [[English Renaissance theatre]] (after the company of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Lord Chamberlain's]] or [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]).&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
They were first known as the Lord Howard's Men, named after their patron [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]]. The company played once at Court on December 1576 (the play was called ''Tooley''), again on 17 February 1577 (''The Solitary Knight''), and a third time the following Christmas season, 5 January 1578 (all dates [[Old Style and New Style dates|new style]]). They toured widely, from Bath to Nottingham, in the years 1577&amp;ndash;79.

A powerful patron like Howard could make a great difference in a company's fortunes. Though there is little evidence that he was actively concerned with drama, Howard was almost alone among [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth's]] closest councillors in opposing the Lord Mayor of London's 1584 drive to close the public theatres. The theatres stayed open.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, pp. 31-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Howard became [[England]]'s [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]] in 1585, the group's name was changed to reflect his new title. They performed regularly in the provinces and at Court in the 1585&amp;ndash;87 period; but a fatal accident at one of their performances forced them into a temporary retirement. (During a performance in London on 16 November 1587, stage gunfire went wrong, killing a child and a pregnant woman.)&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; But they returned to activity with two performances at Court in the winter of 1588&amp;ndash;9, on 29 December and 11 February.

Despite the power of their patron, the Admiral's Men were not entirely free of official interference. Both they and the [[Lord Strange's Men]] were stopped from playing by the Lord Mayor of London in November 1589; it seems that [[Edmund Tilney]], the [[Master of the Revels]], had taken a dislike to their choice of plays. During this period of difficulty the Admiral's Men moved into James Burbage's [[The Theatre]] for a time (November 1590 to May 1591), and there they played ''Dead Man's Fortune'' with a young [[Richard Burbage]] in the cast &amp;mdash; the only time that the later competitors Burbage and [[Edward Alleyn]], the longtime star of the Admiral's, are known to have acted together.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

If the Admiral's Men were having difficulties in the City in this period, they were still welcome at Court (28 December 1589; 30 March 1590), and still popular in the towns and shires, where they toured more in 1589&amp;ndash;90. Indeed, this was perhaps the height of their achievement: in these years Alleyn was making a sensation acting the heroes of [[Christopher Marlowe]]. ''[[Tamburlaine]]'' was printed in 1590 with their name on its title page. Some of the plays of [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], and [[Thomas Lodge]]'s ''The Wounds of Civil War,'' were also in their repertory in the early 1590s.

==Henslowe years==
It was during the later 1580s that the company established its long-term relationship with [[Philip Henslowe]], theatre builder, producer, impresario. Henslowe's [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] was home to the Admiral's Men for a number of years, and Henslowe played a key role as a blend of manager and financier. After the major disruption of the 1592&amp;ndash;94 era, when the public theatres endured a long closure due to [[bubonic plague]], the Admiral's Men entered another lush period in 1594 and after.

The re-constituted company resumed performances on 14 May 1594, with ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' and two anonymous and lost plays, ''The Ranger's Comedy'' and ''Cutlack''.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Admiral's Men had Edward Alleyn as their leading man; other personnel included George Attewell, Thomas Downton, and James Tunstall, all veterans of the earlier pre-1592 version of the Admiral's, and Richard Jones, a former mate of Alleyn's and Tunstall's in [[Worcester's Men]] in the 1580s. (Jones and Downton would defect to [[Pembroke's Men]] in early 1597, only to be caught up in their disastrous performance of [[The Isle of Dogs (play)|''The Isle of Dogs'']], and return to the Admiral's by the end of that year.) Attewell was a "jigging" clown, known for his dancing; when [[Richard Tarlton]] had died in 1588, Attewell had taken over the job of dancing a jig at the end of each performance of the [[Queen Elizabeth's Men]]. John Singer, another clown with the Queen Elizabeth's company, also joined the Admiral's in 1594; other members included Edward Juby, Martin Slater, and Thomas Towne. The company's repertory came to feature plays by [[George Chapman]], [[William Haughton]], and [[Anthony Munday]], among many other poets.

The survival of Henslowe's so-called [[Philip Henslowe#Henslowe.27s diary|Diary]] (actually an account book kept by Henslowe and others in his organization) provides scholars with more detailed information about the Admiral's Men in this era than is available for any contemporaneous acting troupe. Among other points, the Diary illustrates the enormous demands the Elizabethan repertory system placed upon the actors. In the 1594&amp;ndash;95 season, the Admiral's Men generally performed six days a week, and staged a total of 38 plays; 21 of these were new plays, introduced at a rate of approximately one every two weeks &amp;mdash; but only eight were acted again in subsequent seasons. The next season, 1595&amp;ndash;96, demanded 37 plays, including 19 new ones; and the following year, 1596&amp;ndash;97, 34 plays, 14 new. The company consistently played the works of Marlowe throughout this era. ''Tamburlaine Part 1'' was acted 14 times in the 1594&amp;ndash;95 season, followed by ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (12 performances), ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (10), ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (9), and ''Tamburlaine Part 2'' (6).&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, pp. 103-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Taken altogether, the most popular play over this 1594&amp;ndash;97 period was the anonymous ''The Wise Man of Westchester,'' which has not survived yet was acted 32 times over the three years, debuting on 3 December 1594 and last played on 18 July 1597. Earlier scholars speculated that it might be an alternative title for Anthony Munday's ''[[John a Kent and John a Cumber]]'', though no firm evidence supports this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henslowe had interests in other theatres, including the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]] (built in 1600); the Admiral's Men moved into the new venue, and when the lease ran out on The Rose in 1605 it was abandoned. The company prospered, at least moderately, in its new location: in 1600 a share in the Admiral's Men (one out of a total of ten) was worth £50, while in 1613 a share (one of twelve) was valued at £70.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime in the winter of 1603&amp;ndash;4, after the [[House of Stuart]] succeeded to the throne of England, the Admiral's Men acquired a new patron, [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] (1594&amp;ndash;1612), later the Prince of Wales (1610&amp;ndash;12). Edward Alleyn retired from the stage in 1604, though he was involved with the company as their Fortune Theatre landlord. During this period their core cohort of players consisted of William Bird, Thomas Towne, [[Samuel Rowley]], Charles Massey, [[King's Men personnel|Humphrey and Anthony Jeffes]], Edward Juby, and Thomas Downton (who'd been part of the 1597 production of [[The Isle of Dogs (play)|''The Isle of Dogs'']]). Edward Juby was the company's payee for Court performances, which suggests that he had significant responsibility for the troupe's finances.

The company was known as Prince Henry's Men until the Henry's early death (6 November 1612), after which they came under the patronage of his new brother-in-law, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]. Their new patent of 11 January 1613 lists six of the actors of the previous decade, Juby, Bird, Rowley, Massey, Downton, and Humphrey Jeffes, plus six new sharers,&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 186-92.&lt;/ref&gt; who included [[John Shank]], later a long-time member of the King's Men, and [[Richard Gunnell]], who would become a theatre manager and impresario by building the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] with William Blagrave in 1629.

==Decline==
The company suffered a major set disaster when the Fortune Theatre burned down on 9 December 1621, destroying their stocks of playscripts and costumes. The owner, [[Edward Alleyn]], rebuilt it in 1623, in brick, at a cost of £1000. The actors moved back in, though recovery was difficult. They persisted for years, but endured a long-term decline in reputation. The company finally collapsed in 1631; after a re-organization, a troupe with some of the same personnel received royal patronage under the name of the infant Prince Charles, the future [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]], and became the second iteration of [[Prince Charles's Men]] at the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]]. In December 1631 the Fortune Theatre, vacated by the Admiral's/Palsgrave's company, received the [[King's Revels Men]] from the Salisbury Court for the next few years (1631&amp;ndash;33).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertory==
The Admiral's Men acted a huge repertory of plays during their long career; Henslowe's Diary lists dozens from the 1597&amp;ndash;1603 period alone. Unfortunately, most of these plays have not survived; they exist only as titles (sometimes provocative titles, like ''The Boss of Billingsgate,'' or ''Mahomet,'' or ''Judas''). The list that follows is a selection of noteworthy surviving plays.

'''Alexander Hislop''' (1807 - 13 March 1865) was a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] [[Minister of religion|minister]] known for his criticisms of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  He was the son of Stephen Hislop (died 1837), a mason by occupation and an elder of the [[Relief Church]].  Alexander's brother was also named Stephen Hislop (lived 1817–1863) and became well known in his time as a missionary to India and a naturalist.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Alexander was born and raised in [[Duns]], [[Berwickshire]]. He was for a time parish schoolmaster of [[Wick, Highland|Wick, Caithness]]. In 1831 he married Jane Pearson.  He was for a time editor of the ''Scottish Guardian'' newspaper.  As a [[Ministers and elders in the Church of Scotland|probationer]] he joined the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] at the [[Disruption of 1843]].  He was ordained in 1844 at the East Free Church, [[Arbroath]], where he became senior minister in 1864.  He died of a paralytic stroke in Arbroath the next year after being ill for about two years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

He wrote several books, his most famous being ''[[The Two Babylons|The Two Babylons: Papal Worship Proved to be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==''The Two Babylons''==
{{main|The Two Babylons}}

This book was initially published in 1853 as a [[pamphlet]], then greatly revised {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and expanded and released as a book in 1858.  

In this book, Hislop argued that the Catholic Church was a Babylonian [[mystery religion|mystery cult]], and pagan, whereas Protestants worshipped the true Jesus and the true God. He believed that Roman Catholic religious practices are pagan practices grafted onto true Christianity during the reign of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]. At this point, the merger between the Roman state religion and its adoration of the mother and child was transferred to Christianity, merging Christian characters with pagan mythology. The Goddess was renamed ''[[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]'', and Jesus was the renamed ''[[Jupiter-Puer]]'', or "Jupiter the Boy".

Hislop believed that the goddess, in Rome called [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] or [[Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna]], was the Roman name of the more ancient Babylonian cult of [[Ishtar]], whose origins began with a blonde-haired and blue-eyed woman named [[Semiramis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

According to Hislop, Semiramis was an exceedingly beautiful woman, who gave birth to a son named [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], was instrumental as the queen, and wife of [[Nimrod]] the founder of [[Babylon]], and its religion, complete with a pseudo-[[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]. Later, Nimrod was killed, and Semiramis, pregnant with his child, claimed the child was Nimrod reborn. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Hislop attempted to show that the cult and worship of Semiramis spread globally, her name changing with the culture. In Egypt she was [[Isis]], in Greece and Rome she was called Venus, [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], [[Athena]], and a host of other names, but was always prayed to and central to the faith which was based on Babylonian mystery religion. According to Hislop, Constantine, though claiming to convert to Christianity, remained pagan but renamed the gods and goddesses with Christian names to merge the two faiths for his political advantage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Constantine's endorsement of the tradition was a turning point for [[Early Christianity]].  In 313, Constantine issued the [[Edict of Milan]] legalizing Christian worship. The emperor became a great patron of the Church,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and set a precedent for the position of the Christian Emperor within the Church and the notion of [[orthodoxy]], [[Christendom]], and [[ecumenical councils]] that would be followed for centuries as the [[State church of the Roman Empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8260">"'''Ancient planter'''" was a term applied to early colonists who migrated to the [[Colony of Virginia]] in what is now the United States, when the colony was managed by the [[Virginia Company of London]]. They received land grants if they stayed in the colony for at least three years. Under the terms of the "Instructions to [[George Yeardley|Governor Yeardley]]" (issued by the [[London Company]] in 1618), these colonists received the first land grants in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;"Instructions to George Yeardley, November 18, 1618" http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mtj8&amp;fileName=mtj8pagevc03.db&amp;recNum=121.gif&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yeardley&gt;"Instructions to Governor Yeardley, 1618" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography for the Year Ending JUNE, 1895, Volume II, pp. 154-165 (The Virginia Historical Society, 1895)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
These land grants constituted a dividend paid out by the [[Virginia Company of London]], which was constituted as a [[joint stock company]].  Under the terms of the Second Charter, issued in 1609, the Company offered shares for twelve pounds ten shillings per share, to be invested and reinvested for seven years.  Those men who ventured to Virginia in person, investing their time and risking their lives, would each be counted as holding one share.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Wesley Frank, ''The Virginia Company of London, 1606-1624, pp.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/va02.asp#1, 2008. ''The Second Charter of Virginia; May 23, 1609''], Lillian Goldman Law Library, Yale University:&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1616, at the end of the administration of Sir [[Thomas Dale]], the first dividend became due and payable to all who had invested, whether by the purchase of shares or by "personal adventure".  However, since the colony had not prospered, there was no money to divide.  Instead, the Company offered grants of land.  Colonists who had paid their own passage to Virginia received a "first dividend" of {{convert|100|acre|km2}}, free of [[quit-rent]], for their "personal adventure", and an additional hundred acres for each share they owned in the London Company:

{{Quote|...the ancient adventurers and Planters which were transported thither with Intent to Inhabit at their own costs and charges before the coming away of Sir Thomas Dale, Knight, and have so continued during the space of three years, shall have upon a first Division to be afterwards by us augmented one hundred acres of Land for their personal adventure and as much for every single share of twelve pounds ten shillings paid for such share allotted and set out to be held by them their Heirs and assigns forever.&lt;ref name=Yeardley/&gt;}}

Those who had been brought at the Company's expense (as indentured servants) also received 100 acres for their "personal adventure", but in their case the land was subject to an annual rent of one shilling per 50 acres:

{{Quote|And that for all such planters as were brought thither at the Company's charge to Inhabit there before the coming away of the said Sir Thomas Dale after the time of their service to the Company on the common Land agreed shall be expired there be set out one hundred acres of Land for each of their Personal adventure to be held by them their Heirs and assigns for ever paying for every fifty acres the yearly free Rent of one shilling to the said Treasurer and company and their successors at one entire payment on the feast day of Saint Michaels the Archangel forever.&lt;ref name=Yeardley/&gt;}}

Colonists who arrived after the departure of Sir Thomas Dale were entitled to a lesser grant of 50 acres. The London Company reasoned that "... by the singular Industry and virtue of the said Sir Thomas Dale the former Difficulties and Dangers were in greatest part overcome to the great ease and security of such as have been since that time transported thither",.&lt;ref name=Yeardley/&gt;  In other words, those who had come earlier received twice as much land, supposedly in recognition of the greater risks and hardships they had endured.  Of course, reducing the size of the grant to 50 acres also saved the hard-pressed Company a great deal of money, and the later colonists can scarcely be said to have experienced the "great ease and security" mentioned by the Company; the death rate continued extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Edmund S., ''American Slavery, American Freedom''.  Morgan states: "One reason why the King dissolved the Virginia Company [in 1624] was that it seemed to have sent so many men to their deaths without taking adequate measures to feed and shelter them."&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Ancient Planter" was not an [[honorific]]; it was simply a descriptive term, as used in the "Instructions", for a planter of long standing.&lt;ref&gt;''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd Edition, p.64:"Ancient", (2) of early origin; going far back.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a letter from [[John Rolfe]] dated January 1619/20: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All the Ancient Planters being sett free have chosen places for their dividends according to the Comyssion. Which giveth all greate content, for now knowing their owne landes, they strive and are prepared to build houses &amp; to clear their groundes ready to plant, which giveth great encouragement and the greatest hope to make the Colony florrish that ever yet happened to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Records of the Virginia Company of London'', ed. Susan Myra Kingsbury, III, 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Identification==
Because the surviving historical records are incomplete, and sometimes demonstrably inaccurate,&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Early Passengers to Virginia: When Did They Really Arrive?", by Avery E. Kolb, ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'', Vol. 88, No. 4, pp 401-414&lt;/ref&gt; it is not possible to compile a definitive list of Ancient Planters.

The database of Colonial Land Office Patents at the [[Library of Virginia]] is the principal source of information as to the identities of those who received grants as Ancient Planters.  Though the record does not begin until 1623, when administration of the colony was taken over by the Crown, many of the subsequent patents identify "ancient planters", or provide information which shows that a tract of land must have been originally granted under the terms applying to Ancient Planters.

Additional information comes from the [http://www.virtualjamestown.org/Muster/introduction.html 1624/5 Muster], a census ordered as part of the handover of the colony from the Virginia Company to the Crown.  For some of the colonists, the census includes information on the year and ship of arrival. In many cases this valuable information is missing.

Also as part of the transition to Crown Colony status, a list of grants was compiled in 1625 and sent to London.&lt;ref&gt;"Extracts of all the Titles and Estates of Land, sent home by Sir Francis Wyatt, May, 1625", ''ibid.'', 551&lt;/ref&gt;  This list does not identify the Ancient Planters as such, but in some cases knowledge of the grant combined with information from other sources (e.g., knowledge of the date of arrival) is enough to show that the planter in question must have received the grant as an Ancient Planter.

'''Anton F. Fahne''' (February 28, 1805 – January 12, 1883) was a German author, jurist, genealogist and historian.

Fahne was born in [[Münster]] and studied medicine at the [[University of Bonn]] and law at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He produced several genealogical and local historical writings. Fahne helped to found the Historischen Verein für den Niederrhein (Historical Society of the Lower Rhine) in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz14121.html#adbcontent|last=Schell|first=Otto|website=[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fahne died in [[Düsseldorf]]. He was buried at the Gerresheimer Waldfriedhof in [[Düsseldorf-Gerresheim]]. His estate manages the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne]].

It is a common mistake that Anton Fahne and [[Friedrich von Uechtritz]] are the same person.

[[image:Blas-Valera-tres-firmas-wiki.jpg|thumb|Three signatures of Blas Valera (private collection, C. Miccinelli - Naples (Italy))]]

'''Blas Valera''' was born in Levanto, Chachapoyas, Peru, in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;The author of the ''[[Comentarios Reales de los Incas]]'' believed Valera was born in [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]], but it has been proven he was born in the city of Chachapoyas.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valera is considered to be the son of [[Luis Valera]], one of the men who accompanied [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] in the conquest of the [[Inca Empire]]. He established himself in this city since its foundation. The mother of this outstanding Chachapoyano writer was [[Francisca Pérez]], a native who had taken this name after being baptized.

The circumstance that he was born in 1545, less than 20 years after the fall of the Inca Empire, allowed him to meet many of its prominent men and also old ''[[amauta]]s'', that transmitted and entrusted him the events that he later narrated in his works.

He did his first studies in Trujillo and then continued them in Lima. Considering his knowledge of [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], he took part in the missions that [[Jesuit]]s had established in [[Huarochirí]], an important pre-Hispanic center of worship that at the beginning of the 17th century was the location of the most intense eradication campaign of idolatry, carried out by [[Francisco de Ávila]].

He took an active part in the [[III Concilio Limense]] of 1583. Father Valera died in [[Alcalá de Henares]], Spain on 2 April 1597.&lt;ref&gt;http://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/anthropologica/article/view/1560/1505&lt;/ref&gt;

==The priest==
His priestly vocation made him travel to [[Lima]] when he was still a teenager. When he was 17, he joined the [[Compañía de Jesús]] (Society of Jesus), where he gave excessive samples of his top intelligence since he began his priestly studies.

But at the same time he was preparing for the religious ministry, his love for the [[Peru]]vian history was also growing and, in his insistence of knowing about Peruvian past better, he devoted himself to the study of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|native languages]]. He  became the biggest authority of his time in this subject.

This skill made that people entrusted him missions in which his [[Linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge was necessary, which simultaneously allowed him to keep on increasing his data gathering, collecting information from the authentic sources of all the places he was visiting.

Valera was a special case in those times: a bilingual [[mestizo]] and well-educated. He was entrusted with the compilation of news from the pre-Hispanic civilization, but the suspicions that his sympathies towards the [[Inca Empire|Inca culture]] raised made that the Compañía closed the access of mestizos in the [[Monasticism|order]] and they supposed a negative opinion of him.

Because of his knowledge of native languages, he was a valuable collaborator of [[José de Acosta|father José de Acosta]], who prepared the first [[catechism]]s in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]]. These catechisms deserved the approval of [[Turibius of Mongrovejo|Toribio de Mogrovejo]].

On the other hand, there are evidences that Valera was accused of [[heresy]] because he include some favourable comments to the Inca Empire. He was shut in by the Jesuits for a brief period.

==Family==

Father
# Luis Valera was a Spanish [[conquistador]] born of Bartolome Garcia Roman and Catalina Hernandez in the small town of Aracena in western Andalucia.
# He left for the new world on April 28, 1534, leaving his wife Catalina Rodriguez de Aldana, a noblewoman, in Spain.  He would later ask her to join him in the New World 25 years later, and she did so in 1559.
# It is likely that he was a trusted companion of [[Francisco Pizarro]] during the conquest, and was loyal to him during the fight with [[Diego de Almagro]].
# He later served as a captain of crossbowmen under one of Pizarro's lieutenants, Alonso de Alvarado in 1538.
# After his service, Alvarado granted Valera the [[encomiendas]] of Chibalta and Tiapullu, where he mainly raised livestock for sale in Santiago.
# He was regional leader and served on the [[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]], or city council of the region.

Mother
# A native Peruvian who was most likely of [[Inca]] ancestry who is known by the Christian name [[Francisca Perez]].
# She may have been an Inca princess in the court of the late Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]], or possibly related to the former governor of Chachapoyas region named Cayo Tupac Rimachi..  Details of her are still relatively unknown, but she either died or left Luis when her son Blas was 15.

Brother
# Jeronimo Valera was born eleven years after his brother Blas Valera in the Nieva region of Chachapoyas in the late 1550s.  He traveled to Spain as a young child but returned in September 1559.
# He was raised by Catalina Rodriguez, the first wife of Luis Valera.
# He studied at the Jesuit College of San Martin in Lima, and became a Jesuit on February 25, 1580.
# He made a transition to the [[Franciscan]] order on August 21, 1588 mainly due to his brother's problems with the [[Spanish Inquisition]].
# He later taught [[theology]] and became an inquisition judge.

==The writer==

Luckily this man, who had the opportunity to know people who were able to provide very valuable information to him, was provided with a remarkable talent that distinguished him from his very early studies. Since he was a very young man, he could realize how important was, for the Peruvian history, to compile data information about the great [[Inca Empire|Inca culture]], which was already becoming extinct as fast as the western culture was imposing in this country.

All his works were written in [[Latin]] and, according to his critics, they were written in an elegant, neat and clean style. He narrated events of Peruvian past with a rigorous critical sense, accepting only the events that were supported by irrefutable evidence. This fact has given the authority to his writings that [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso]] recognized in them. Many other historians have coincided with Garcilaso's judgment later. Some of them also believed that in other chroniclers' works, there are plagiarisms of the work of this venerable Jesuit and even the clandestine use of unpublished documents that he could not release.

In 1595, being in Spain, Valera lost valuable writings in the plundering of [[Cadiz]] made by the Englishmen. Some of them were acquired later by [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso]], who relates that they were provided him by the Jesuit [[Pedro Maldonado de Saavedra|Pedro Maldonado]]. Maldonado saved the documents, and even though they were burnt and mistreated, Garcilaso thought that they were a valuable source of information with more authenticity and credibility than any other chronicler of the epoch.

==Occupational achievements==

During Blas Valera's lifetime he had many important jobs and roles throughout Peru and Spain.  He is most famously known as being a member of the [[Society of Jesus]], also known as a Jesuit.  He was a priest where he taught Christian teachings and performed many sacraments which included [[baptism]], marriage and extreme unction (last rites).  He was also concerned with explaining [[Andean]] religion in Christian terms and he led spiritual discussions and communal prayer every Wednesday and Friday.  Blas Valera was also a writer.  He wrote many great works including the Quechua vocabulary [[Vocabulario Quechua]] and [[the Naples Documents]].  In many of Valera's documents is he known for defending the Andean society.  Along with being a priest and a writer, Valera was also a teacher.  He taught free Quechua classes to the public and translated Christian religion into Quechua.  He also translated the [[Catholic Catechism]] into [[Quechua-Third Lima Council Bishops]].

==His works==

Among his works were:

* [[Vocabulario quechua]] (Quechua vocabulary)
The ''Vocabulario'' was one of Blas Valera's works which resembled an encyclopedia of Peru and the [[Incas]].  It references information on the history of the Incas.  Citations from the document can be found in other writers’ works.  For example, [[Giovanni Anello Oliva]] cited references from the ''Vocabulario'' of pre-Inca kings of Peru for his argument that there were [[Peruvian kings]] before the Incas.  Anello Oliva also Valera's argument that Titu Atauchi, a full brother of [[Atahuallpa]], led a force in the defeat over Spanish forces at the battle of Huamachuco. It also cites Atahuallpa which the ''Vocabulario'' gives high praise to and even argues he's a Christian saint in heaven, displaying Valera's stance of [[Andean Christianity]].  The sources which he used when writing the ''Vocabulario'' and other works, do not fully reveal the amount of knowledge he obtained about the native history.  Much of the information he used Valera acquired through memories, quipus, and written texts of native elites in Peru, which also have been mostly lost except for information contained in his works.  Much of the information contained in the ''Vocabulario'' has been lost, and the information which has not, has been used for citing other historians’ arguments about the history of the Incas and the Andean civilization.
* ''[[Historia de los Incas]]'' (History of the Incas)

==The Miccinelli Documents==
Blas Valera (1544–1597) was a distinguished member of the Jesuit missionaries in Peru. He was admired for his knowledge of the Andean language, and renowned for his collaboration in the translation of the official catechism of the [[Third Lima Council]] (1582–1583) into Quechua and Aymara. However, in 1583 this storyteller of the Incas, due to unknown reasons, faced rejection from his people, was imprisoned for three years, and later deported from Spain where he supposedly died in 1597.

However, Blas Valera remained an ambiguous character of history until the early 1990s in which a group of Italian researchers led by [[Laura Laurencich Minelli]] discovered a set of documents owned by a private collector in [[Naples]], which included Valera's writings; yet, with the discovery of these documents, questions to the accuracy of Valera's life arouse. Controversially, one of the writings found in the Naples documents was dated after Valera's supposed death in 1597. This erratum of dates led to the assumptions of different versions of the truth. The documents stated that Valera was secretly condemned by his order for his radical pro-Incan beliefs, and especially for his claim that Incan religion was equivalent to Christianity. There is a version in the documents that assures that after having faked his death, Valera returned to Peru where he wrote the famous ''Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno'' (New chronicle and good government), which has been attributed to the native writer [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]].

The revelation of the "Naples documents", has led to controversial disputes among scholars as to how these documents should be evaluated. Many Andeanists consider the manuscript as forgeries fabricated by the owner Clara Miccinelli and her friend Carlo Animato and argue that the content of these documents cannot be taken literal. Likewise, Francesa Cantú, from the Universitá di Roma, and Maurizio Gnerre, from the Instituto Universitario Orientale, also found documents in public archives in Italy that connect with aspects of the story found in the Naples documents. Likewise, these two scholars have also been accused of manufacturing false documentation. Moreover, many Peruvians argue that the Naples documents were forged by Jesuit followers of Valera after his death in order to express political opinions, which would otherwise be censured by Society. Those pertaining to this chain of thought, also argue that Valera did not write ''Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno.'' Lastly, there are those who believe that the Naples documents are authentic and true regarding his fake death and life.

In addition, the discovery of the [[Naples documents]] not only raises questions with regards to Valera's life, but also raises assumptions that the [[Incas]] had a secret, phonetic writing system and that the writings in ''Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno'' are evidence of indigenous resistance to Spanish domination. Valera's discrete crimes show an attachment to his people, his radical condemnation of the Spanish conquest, and his belief that the Incas understood the key Christian truths. The Naples Documents also talk about [[Quipu]] writing, which is supposed to be a phonetic form of language that supposedly was used by the Incas, if this is true, many of the secrets and ambiguities from the colonial Andes would be solved.

==Controversy about his life and works==

Lately a few supposed new information on Blas Valera's biography have started to circulate. The most controversial one talks about "[[Nueva Crónica y Buen Gobierno]]" (A new Chronic and a Good Government), of [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]]. According to specialist Laura Laurencich Minelli, there are three sheets of paper with drawings in the "[[Historia et Rudimenta Linguae Piruanorum]]" that have the signature of an "Italian Jesuit", Blas Valera. According to Minelli, these drawings were made before 1618, that is to say, some years after the official death of Valera.

Apparently, the objective of Valera in Europe was to tell the [[Pope]] the truth about the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquest of Peru]] made by [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]], who would have poisoned [[Atahualpa]]'s soldiers with a mixture of [[arsenic]] and wine. This fact was told to Valera by another conqueror, his own father, [[Luis Valera]]. The general of the [[Compañía de Jesús|Compañía]], [[Claudio Aquaviva]], didn't agree with Valera's intentions, for this reason he was declared a dead person and was exiled. He went to Spain, where he supposedly shared part of his works with the [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]].

Later, it is said that Valera returned to Peru secretly with the intention of publishing his version of the Peruvian conquest. he got in touch with other two Jesuits: [[Joan Antonio Cumis]] and [[Joan Anello Oliva]]. To carry out their intention, the three of them had to hide the identity of the real author, so they used the name of [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala|Huaman Poma de Ayala]]. When he carried out his assignment, Blas Valera would have returned to Spain in 1618, where he supposedly died a little time later.

==Exile==
One of the major controversies about Blas Valera was the dates in which he was in prison, and when he was in exile.  While many believe that Blas Valera was constantly in prison, there were times that it [[Sabine Hyland]] proved Valera was in exile by the [[Jesuits]], south of Peru.  After he was arrested by the Jesuits with the accuse of fornication, he was sent secretly to exile by the Spanish government.  While in exile is believed that Valera taught the [[Quechan]] language to the Jesuits, so the Jesuits were able to communicate with the Incas, and understand what they were saying with the [[Quipus]].

==Imprisonment==
Blas Valera entered his underground prison cell in April 1583 on charges of fornication brought on by [[General Aquaviva]].  Valera's sentence started with four years in prison, followed by a follow up hearing.  During this four-year stay in prison, Valera suffered forced fasting, prayer and weekly mortification.  After the four years had passed, the Jesuits offered Valera a chance to leave the society.  He of course rejected the offer and continued to claim innocence.  As a result, the Jesuits sentenced him to six years of house arrest.  Due to the horrible conditions in prison, Valera had grown very ill.  He requested to be sent back to Spain to recover and get away.  The Jesuits approved his request, and exiled him to Spain in 1594.  Blas Valera died in Spain in 1597.  The controversy of Valera's imprisonment comes from the actual crime he committed against the society.  According to the Jesuits, after Valera's appointment to professor of grammar in [[Potosí]], Aquavia sent a letter of concern to the society about Valera in February 1583.  The contents of this letter are secret, but historians suspect it dealt with Valera's teachings.  Following this letter, in April 1583 the society brought charges of [[fornication]] and found him guilty.  The fornication supposedly took place with one of Valera's female students.  [[The Naples Documents]] show another story untold by the Jesuits.  According to the documents, Valera's writings on [[Inca]] religion and potential heretical techniques had caused the society to take action against him.  No evidence has ever been uncovered to prove either of these indictments brought against Valera.

==Death==

After being exiled from Peru, Valera arrived in [[Cádiz]] in 1596. Valera continued a peaceful life until later on that year pirate [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux]] invaded Cadiz beating local priests. Valera at the age of 53 was mortally wounded and would die on April 2, 1597.
However, some argue Valera's death in Cadiz was faked and he came back to Peru to complete other works. [[Anello Oliva]] wrote about Valera's [[faked death]] in the ''Historia et Rudimenta''.  Apparently, Valera was given a choice to leave the Jesuits or fake his own death.  Not wanting to leave the Jesuit society, Valera faked his own death in Cadiz 1596, after Devereux roamed the city beating priests.  Valera left Cadiz and headed back to Peru in June 1598, where he resided with a group of natives in [[Cuzco]].  It is believed Valera wrote the ''Nueva coronica y buen gobierno'' at the age of sixty-six.  Valera's work was attributed to [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala|Guaman Poma]], since Valera was supposedly dead.  If Valera secretly wrote the Nueva about Andean life, this will change modern understanding of the Incas and early colonial life in Peru. Anello Oliva argues that Valera contributed to writings in [[the Naples Documents]], but some believe that Anello Oliva used Valera's name as a means to respect the dead Valera and publish anti-Spanish beliefs that were forbidden at the time.  But, there is no reliable evidence to Valera's death did not occur in 1597.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">In the [[Gregorian calendar]], a year ending in "00" that is [[divisible]] by 400 is a '''century [[leap year]]''', with the [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] of [[February 29]] yielding 366 days instead of 365.  Century years (divisible by 100) that are ''not'' divisible by 400 are not leap years but [[common year]]s of 365 days. For example, the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are century leap years since those numbers are divisible by 400, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are common years despite being divisible by 4. Leap years divisible by 400 always [[Leap year starting on Saturday|start on a Saturday]]; thus the leap day February 29 in those years always falls on a Tuesday ([[dominical letter]] BA).

The Gregorian calendar yields an average year that currently tracks the annual revolution period of the Earth more closely than the older [[Julian calendar]], in which every fourth year (including end-of-century years) is a leap year. The Julian formula adds too many leap days (3 every 400 years), causing the Julian calendar to drift gradually with respect to the astronomical seasons. Over time, natural events such as the spring equinox began to occur earlier and earlier in the Julian calendar.

The Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582, but was adopted by various countries over several centuries, with the result that some countries still used the older Julian calendar while others used the Gregorian calendar.  Dates prior to 1582 are generally calculated using the Julian calendar, and different countries have different conventions about dates between 1582 and their adoption of the Gregorian calendar. (See, for example, [[Old Style and New Style dates]].)

The '''date of birth of [[Jesus]] ''' is not stated in the [[gospels]] or in any secular text but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett.

Sausalito, CA: University Science Books. {{ISBN|0-935702-68-7}}. p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches—one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[Gospel of Luke|Gospels of Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M.

==Estimation via the Nativity accounts==
The [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[New Testament]] gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus, and [[Karl Rahner]] states that the gospels do not, in general, provide enough details of dates to satisfy the demands of modern historians.&lt;ref name=Rahner732 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} p. 731&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholars do not see the Luke and Matthew nativity stories as historically factual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Borg]], "The Meaning of the Birth Stories" in Marcus Borg, N T Wright, ''The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions'' (Harper One, 1999) page 179: "I (and most mainline scholars) do not see these stories as historically factual."&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, they do not consider them a reliable method for determining Jesus' date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus''. Penguin, 1993, pages 85–88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states that the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Luke and Matthew associate Jesus' birth with the time of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name="Rahner731"/&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] states that "Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king". He also implies that Jesus could have been as much as two years old at the time of the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], because Herod ordered the murder of all boys up to the age of two years, "in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi".

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of Jesus,&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 /&gt; but places the birth during the [[Census of Quirinius]], which only took place ten years later in AD 6 as described by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 /&gt; He, in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (c. AD 93), indicates that Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6, and Josephus mentions a census sometime between AD 6–7.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E5dCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=josephus+antiquities+of+the+jews&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 18, Chapters 1–2]. Josephus indicates that the census under Cyrenius (i.e., Quirinius) occurred in the 37th year after Octavian's (i.e., Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus') victory over Marc Antony at Actium, which secular historical records date to 2 September 31 BC. Therefore 31 BC + 37 years = AD 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as the month of Jesus' birth, it can be inferred to be summer or fall. Combining inferences from when shepherds would likely be in the fields and working backward from Zechariah's priestly service (John the Baptist's father) and its connections to Jesus' birth, one arrives at a likely date of mid-September to early October. This would suggest the conception of Jesus might have been in December, but not his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/when-was-jesus-born|title=When was Jesus born? {{!}} Bibleinfo.com|website=www.bibleinfo.com|language=en|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://christinprophecy.org/articles/when-was-jesus-born/|title=When Was Jesus Born?|work=Lamb and Lion Ministries|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working backwards from when Jesus began preaching==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Pharisees Question Jesus (Les pharisiens questionnent Jésus) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|Dispute of Jesus and the Pharisees, by [[James Tissot]], c. 1890]]
Another approach to estimating the year of birth works backwards from when Jesus began preaching, based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" at that time.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate would be in about AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoehner 1978 29–37"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working backwards from this, it would appear that Jesus was probably born no later than 1 BC. However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 27–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christmas celebration==
Despite the celebration of Christmas in December, neither Luke nor Matthew mentions a season for when Jesus was born. However, scholarly arguments regarding the realism of shepherds grazing their flock during the winter have taken place, both challenging a winter birth for Jesus as well as defending it by relying on the mildness of winters in ancient Israel and [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] rules regarding sheep near Bethlehem before February.&lt;ref&gt;"New Testament History" by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: an introduction and commentary'' by Leon Morris 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-0419-5}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of Jesus' Birth'' by Edwin D. Freed 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-08046-3}} pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Murray of ''History Today'' says that the celebration of [[Christmas]] as the birth day of Jesus is based on a date of a pagan feast rather than historical analysis.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas "Medieval Christmas"], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saturnalia]], the Roman feast for Saturn, was associated with the [[winter solstice]]. Saturnalia was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms. It is likely that such a Christian feast was chosen for Christ's marked contrast and triumph over paganism; indeed, new converts who attempted to introduce pagan elements into the Christian celebrations were sharply rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7399|title=Library : History &amp; Origin: Feast of the Nativity|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 25 may have been selected due to its proximity to the winter solstice, because of its theological significance. After the solstice, the days begin to lengthen with more sunlight, which Christians see as representing the [[Light of Christ]] entering the world. This mirrors the celebration of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on June 24, near the [[summer solstice]]; John said of Jesus "He must increase, I must decrease." {{bibleref2|John 3:30|NRSV}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-do-we-celebrate-jesus-birth-on-december-25|title=Why do we celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25? - Catholic Answers|website=www.catholic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] became a separate feast as [[Easter]] and in the same century [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] began to be celebrated in the Churches of the East on 6 January.&lt;ref&gt;''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-5856-3}} page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]] notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'' by Lukas Vischer 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}} pages 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest source stating 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is likely by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox]] which he placed on 25 March, and then added nine months – festivals on that date were then celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142&lt;/ref&gt; 25 March would also roughly be the date of his crucifixion, which ancient Christians would have seen as confirming the date of his birth, since there was a notion that the great prophets were conceived into the afterlife on the same date they were conceived into the world.  [[John Chrysostom]] also argued for a 25 December date in the late 4th century, basing his argument on the assumption that the offering of incense in Luke 1:8–11 was the offering of incense by a high priest on [[Yom Kippur]] (early October), and, as above, counting fifteen months forward. However, this was very likely a retrospective justification of a choice already made rather than a genuine attempt to derive the correct birth date.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Beckwith (2001). Calendar and chronology, Jewish and Christian: biblical, intertestamental and patristic studies, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, 25 December might be a reference to the date of the Feast of the Dedication, which occurs on the 25 Kislev of the Jewish calendar.  This would require that early Christians simply translated Kislev directly to December.

==In Islam==
In Islam, the Quran references a fruit branch which Mary shook as she gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=3YhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Quran+Jesus+19&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ4_H4_4_YAhWMNY8KHd1OAG8Q6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20Jesus%2019&amp;f=false|title=Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation|last=Stowasser|first=Barbara Freyer|date=22 August 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199761838|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fruit, the date, is known to ripen during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dateland.com/how-are-dates-grown/|title=How are Dates Grown?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19625">The '''Elephantine Papyri''' consist of 175 documents from the Egyptian border fortresses of [[Elephantine]] and [[Syene]] (Aswan), which yielded hundreds of [[Papyrus|papyri]] in [[Hieratic]] and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]], spanning a period of 2000 years. The documents include letters and legal contracts from family and other archives, and are thus an invaluable source of knowledge for scholars of varied disciplines such as [[epistolography]], law, society, religion, language and [[onomastics]]. They are a collection of ancient Jewish [[manuscripts]] dating from the 5th century BCE. They come from a Jewish community at [[Elephantine]], then called ''[[ꜣbw]]''. The dry soil of [[Upper Egypt]] preserved documents from the Egyptian border fortresses of Elephantine and Syene ([[Aswan]]).  Hundreds of these Elephantine papyri, written in Hieratic and Demotic Egyptian, Aramaic, Greek, Latin and Coptic, span a period of 1000 years. Legal documents and a cache of letters survived, turned up on the local '[[gray market]]' of antiquities starting in the late 19th century, and were scattered into several Western collections.

Though some fragments on [[papyrus]] are much older, the largest number of papyri are written in [[Aramaic]], the ''lingua franca'' of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], and document the Jewish community among soldiers stationed at Elephantine under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule, 495–399 BCE. The Elephantine documents include letters and legal contracts from family and other archives: divorce documents, the [[manumission]] of slaves, and other business, and are a valuable source of knowledge about law, society, religion, language and [[onomastics]], the sometimes surprisingly revealing study of names.

The 'Passover letter' of 419 BCE (discovered in 1907), which gives detailed instructions for properly keeping the [[passover]] is in the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]].

Further Elephantine papyri are at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. The discovery of the Brooklyn papyri is a remarkable story itself. The documents were first acquired in 1893 by [[New York City|New York]] journalist [[Charles Edwin Wilbour]]. After lying in a warehouse for more than 50 years, the papyri were shipped to the Egyptian Department of the Brooklyn Museum. It was at this time that scholars finally realized that "Wilbour had acquired the first Elephantine papyri".

== Jewish temple at Elephantine ==
[[Image:Elephantine Temple reconstruction request.gif|thumb|260px|A letter from the Elephantine Papyri, requesting the rebuilding of a Jewish temple at Elephantine.]]
The Jews had their own temple to [[Yahweh]]&lt;ref&gt;The written form of the [[Tetragrammaton]] in Elephantine is YHW.&lt;/ref&gt; evincing [[polytheistic]] beliefs, which functioned alongside that of [[Khnum]].&lt;ref&gt;The History of the Second Temple Period by Paolo Sacch P:151&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavation work done in 1967 revealed the remains of the Jewish colony centered on a small temple.&lt;ref name=JPost&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephen Gabriel Rosenberg |title=Was there a Jewish temple in ancient Egypt? |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=1 July 2013 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Was-there-a-Jewish-temple-in-ancient-Egypt-318363 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Petition to Bagoas" (Sayce-Cowley collection) is a letter written in 407 BCE to [[Bagoas]], the Persian governor of Judea, appealing for assistance in rebuilding the Jewish temple in Elephantine, which had recently been badly damaged by an antisemitic rampage on the part of a segment of the Elephantine community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kent.net/DisplacedDynasties/Petition_to_Bagoas.htm Comment on 'Petition to Bagoas' (Elephantine Papyri), by Jim Reilly in his book ''Nebuchadnezzar &amp; the Egyptian Exile''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723173238/http://www.kent.net/DisplacedDynasties/Petition_to_Bagoas.htm |date=2011-07-23 }} From website www.kent.net. Retrieved 18 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of this appeal, the Jewish inhabitants of Elephantine speak of the antiquity of the damaged temple:

:'Now our forefathers built this temple in the fortress of Elephantine back in the days of the kingdom of Egypt, and when [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]] came to Egypt he found it built. They (the Persians) knocked down all the temples of the gods of Egypt, but no one did any damage to this temple."

The community also appealed for aid to [[Sanballat I]], a [[Samaritan]] potentate, and his sons [[Delaia]]h and [[Shelemiah]], as well as [[Johanan (High Priest)|Johanan ben Eliashib]]. Both Sanballat and Johanan are mentioned in the [[Book of Nehemiah]], {{bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|2:19|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|12:23|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Unger, ''Unger's Bible Handbook'', p.260&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a response of both governors (Bagoas and Delaiah) which gave the permission by decree to rebuild the temple written in the form of a memorandum:
"&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Memorandum of what Bagohi and Delaiah said &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;to me, saying: Memorandum: You may say in Egypt ... &lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;to (re)build it on its site as it was formerly...".&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel Porten; Ada Yardeni, ''Textbook of Aramaic Documents from Ancient Egypt'' 1. Jerusalem 1986, Letters, 76 (=TADAE A4.9)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 4th century BCE, the temple at Elephantine had ceased to function. There is evidence from excavations that the rebuilding and enlargement of the Khnum temple under [[Nectanebo II]] (360–343) took the place of the former temple of YHWH.

In 2004, the Brooklyn Museum of Art created a display entitled "Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt: A Family Archive From the Nile Valley," which featured the interfaith couple of Ananiah, an official at the temple of Yahou (a.k.a. Yahweh), and his wife, Tamut, who was previously an Egyptian slave owned by a Jewish master, Meshullam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/new_tales_from_a_postexodus_egypt_20040409/ New Tales From a Post-Exodus Egypt] by Naomi Pfefferman, 2004-04-08, ''Jewish Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/11/entertainment/et-biederman11 So long ago, so very much like us: A multicultural couple marries, buys a house, raises kids.

==The family archive of Ananiah and Tamut==
The eight papyri contained at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] concern one particular Jewish family, providing specific information about the daily lives of a man called Ananiah, a Jewish temple official; his wife, Tamut, an Egyptian slave; and their children, over the course of forty-seven years. Egyptian farmers discovered the archive of Ananiah and Tamut on Elephatine Island in 1893, while digging for fertilizer in the remains of ancient mud-brick houses. They found at least eight papyrus rolls which were purchased by [[Charles Edwin Wilbour]]. He was the first person to find [[Aramaic]] papyri. The papyri have been grouped here by topic, such as marriage contract, real estate transaction, or loan agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt: A Family Archive from the Nile Valley|date=2002|publisher=Booklyn Museum of Art|location=Brooklyn, NY|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage document===
[[File:Aramaic. Marriage Document, July 3, 449 B.C.E..jpg|right|thumbnail|Marriage Document of Ananiah and Tamut, July 3, 449 BCE, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Ancient marriage documents generally formalized already existing relationships. In this case, Ananiah and Tamut already had a young son when the document was drawn up. Because Tamut was a slave when she married Ananiah, the contract has special conditions: usually, it was the groom and his father-in-law who made Jewish marriage agreements, but Ananiah made this contract with Tamut's master, Meshullam, who legally was her father. In addition, special provision was made to free the couple's son, also a slave to Meshullam; perhaps Ananiah consented to the small dowry of either 7 or 15 [[shekels]] (the text is ambiguous) in order to obtain his son's freedom. Future children, however, would still be born slaves. In contrast to Jewish documents like this one, contemporaneous Egyptian marriage documents were negotiated between a husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt: A Family Archive from the Nile Valley|date=2002|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=26|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deed of Emancipation===
Nearly twenty-two years after her marriage to Ananiah, Tamut's master released her and her daughter, Yehoishema, from slavery. It was rare for a slave to be freed. And though a slave could marry a free person, their children usually belonged to the master. As an institution, slavery in Egypt at that time differed in notable ways from the practice in some other cultures: Egyptian slaves retained control over personal property, had professions, and were entitled to compensation. During the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Persian Period]] in Egypt, it was not uncommon to sell children, or even oneself, into slavery to pay debts.

===Real estate documents===

====Bagazust and Ubil sell a house to Ananiah====
[[File:Property Sale Document, 437 B.C.E,47.218.95a-b.jpg|thumbnail|Property Sale Document: Bagazust and Ubil Sell a House to Ananiah, September 14, 437 BCE [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
This document to the right describes a property purchased by Ananiah, twelve years after his marriage, from a Persian soldier named Bagazust and his wife, Ubil. The property, in a town on [[Elephantine]] Island, named for the god [[Khnum]], was located across the street from the Temple of Yahou and adjacent to the Persian family of Ubil's Father. As such proximity might suggest, the Egyptians, Jews, and Persians in Elephantine all lived among one another. The renovation of the house and its gradual transfers to family members are the central concerns of the next several documents in Ananiah's family archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt: A Family Archive from the Nile Valley|date=2002|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=30|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ananiah gives Tamut part of the house====
Three years after purchasing the house from Bagazust and Ubil, Ananiah transferred ownership of an apartment within the now renovated house to his wife, Tamut. Although Tamut thereafter owned the apartment, Ananiah required that at her death it pass to their children, Palti and Yehoishema. As with all property transfers within a family, this gift was described as made "in love".

====Ananiah gives Yehoishema part of the house====
Drawn up thirty years after the preceding papyrus, this document is one of several that gradually transferred ownership of Ananiah and Tamut's house to their daughter, Yehoishema, as payment on her dowry. The legal descriptions of the house preserve the names of Ananiah's neighbors. They included an Egyptian who held the post of gardener of the Egyptian god [[Khnum]] and, on the other side, two Persian boatmen. Image of document in gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt: A Family Archive from the Nile Valley|date=2002|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=34|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ananiah gives Yehoishema another part of the house====
For his daughter Yehoishema's dowry, Ananiah had transferred to her partial ownership of the house he shared with Tamut. After making more repairs to the building, Ananiah transferred a further section of the house, described in this document, to the dowry.

====Ananiah and Tamut sell the house to their son-in-law====
This papyrus records the sale of the remaining portion of Ananiah and Tamut's house to Yehoishema's husband. Possibly because the clients were dissatisfied with something the scribe had written, at one point the text of the document breaks off and then starts over again, repeating what has gone on before with some additions. The boundary description included here refers to the Temple of Yahou in Elephantine, now rebuilt eight years after its destruction in 410 BCE during a civil war conflict that arose out of a land dispute. Image of document in gallery below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Jewish Life in Ancient Egypt: A Family Archive from the Nile Valley|date=2002|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=Brooklyn, NY|page=39|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan agreement===
Sometime in December 402 BCE, Ananiah son of Haggai borrowed two monthly rations of grain from Pakhnum son of Besa, an Aramaean with an Egyptian name. This receipt would have been held by Pakhnum and returned to Ananiah son of Haggai when he repaid the loan. No interest is charged but there is a penalty for failing to repay the loan by the agreed date. The receipt demonstrates that friendly business relations continued between Egyptians and Jews in Elephantine after the expulsion of the Persians by pharaoh [[Amyrtaios]] of the [[28th Dynasty]]. Image of document is in gallery below.

==Birth and family==

Born Elizabeth Olive Wood near Nuku'alofa, Tonga, she was often known as Bess or '''Pesi Wood'''.  She was a daughter of Reverend Dr [[A. Harold Wood]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1896–1989), a renowned [[Methodist]] then [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] and educator, and medical Dr Olive K. Wood (née O'Reilly), who were Australian missionaries in Tonga 1924-37.&lt;ref name="Age obit"/&gt; She had five brothers and sisters, including Janet Secomb, herself a missionary to Tonga, actor [[Monica Maughan]] and Uniting Church minister and hymnologist Rev. Dr [[H. D'Arcy Wood]].

==Education==

Moving to Australia in 1937, Elizabeth was educated [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] in Melbourne where, in her final year, she topped the state in Greek and Roman History.

At [[Melbourne University]], she majored in English and History, gaining a BA in 1953, and would later undertake her PhD there.

==Career==
Wood-Ellem earned her living as a book editor and indexer, initially at Angus &amp; Robertson in Sydney, then London (1960-1972) with Macmillan and Paul Hamlyn, and later worked freelance. She was also appointed an archivist at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[Cambridge University]], to sort and catalogue the papers of British novelist [[E. M. Forster]] after his death in 1970.&lt;ref name="Age obit"/&gt;  [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], then engaged her as Assistant Librarian for Archives to catalogue Sir [[James Grigg]]'s papers and [[A.V. Alexander]]'s correspondence.

She completed a PhD in Tongan history in 1982 at the [[University of Melbourne]] and remained a Senior Fellow there at the time of her death. She published her biography of Queen Sālote of Tonga in 1999.  [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]]’s Pacific correspondent Mike Field has said of it:

‘If I were nominate a single, superb book on the Pacific, ''Queen Sālote of Tonga: The Story of an Era 1900-1965'' is one of the finest pieces of historical research and insight, anthropology and understanding of Tonga that you’ll ever find.  You don’t even have to be vaguely interested in Queen Sālote, but in how Tonga works.’

Notable books she edited include ''The Songs and Poems of Queen Sālote'' (2004) and ''Tonga and the Tongans: Heritage and Identity'' (2007).

In 2008, [[King George Tupou V]] recognised her singular contribution to Tonga by bestowing on her the title of Commander of the [[Order of the Crown of Tonga]].&lt;ref name="Age obit"/&gt;

'''Erebuni Museum''' ({{lang-hy|Էրեբունի թանգարան}}, {{lang|hy-Latn|Ērebunu t'angaran}}) was established in 1968. The opening of the museum was timed to coincide with the 2750th anniversary of [[Yerevan]]. The Museum stands at the foot of the Arin Berd hill, on top of which the Urartian [[Erebouni Fortress|Fortress Erebouni]] has stood since 782 BCE. The City-Fortress was excavated, some parts of the structure were reinforced and restored, and the fortress was turned into an outdoor Museum. 

A [[cuneiform]] inscription testifies that the city was built by [[Argishti I]] the King of Urartu in 782 BCE. The majority of the fortress was built from raw bricks. The citadel was encircled by strong walls in some places built in three rows. The temple of God Khaldi occupied an important place in the fortress. The walls of the temple were decorated with numerous [[frescos]]. Archeologists have found giant karasses (pitches for storage of wine) buried in the ground. Ceramics, potter’s wheels and other articles used in everyday life were also unearthed during excavations. There is huge collection of artifacts, sups, jars, bronze bracelets, glass, agate beads and many other things that tell us about the life of the citadel, the tastes and habits of its inhabitants. The building of the Museum that houses 12,235 exhibits was constructed by architects Baghdasar Arzoumanian and Shmavon Azatian and sculptor A. Harutiunian. It has two branches in Shengavit and Karmir Blur with 5,288 and 1,620 exhibits respectively in stock.

Gagik Gyurjyan has been the director of the museum since 2009.

[[File:Francesco Saverio Quadrio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|Francesco Saverio Quadrio]]

'''Francesco Saverio Quadrio''' (1 December 1695 – 21 November 1756)&lt;ref name=Waller&gt;Waller &amp; Eadie 1863, [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t46q2760b?urlappend=%3Bseq=679 vol. 3, p. 619].&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italians|Italian]] scholar, historian, and writer. His most famous work is ''Della storia e della ragione di ogni poesia'', a voluminous history of poetry, theatre, and music.

==Biography==
Quadrio was born in [[Ponte in Valtellina]]. He joined the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and trained as a scholar, but finding himself uncomfortable with religious life, became suspicious and despondent, and suffered poor health from mental stress. In 1744, having received permission for a country sojourn, he reached a decision on the high road near [[Como]] to leave the order and proceeded to [[Switzerland]], where he lived for some time, refusing offers from [[Protestant]] scholarly associations and becoming involved in several controversies. He next moved to Paris, where he met [[Voltaire]]. Finally, [[Pope Benedict XIV]], having always treated him with decided forbearance, provided him assistance, and he retired to a [[convent]] of [[Barnabites]]. He died in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt;

==Works==
His most important work is the seven-volume '''''Della storia e della ragione di ogni poesia''''' (Bologna/Milan, 1739–1752), "an elaborate history of poetry, which," according to the 1863 ''Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography'', "bears the stamp of conscientiousness and unsparing industry, but has been judged inaccurate, and as regards [[English literature]] is singularly jejune and inadequate."&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt; The 1819 ''Cyclopaedia; or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature'' writes: "The author seems a mere compiler, without selection, taste, or accuracy. It is a heavy work, hardly interesting enough to stimulate a regular perusal; and from the disorder of arrangement, very difficult to consult."&lt;ref&gt;Rees 1819, [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015057241088?urlappend=%3Bseq=165 vol. 29, "QUADRIO, Francesco Saverio"].&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Reynolds, writing in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'' (1992), points out that it includes much valuable information on the [[history of music]] and [[early instruments]], including illustrations. Volumes 2 and 3 contain articles on ''[[melodramma]]'', [[oratorio]], and [[cantata]]. Volume 3, part 2 (pp. 425–563), which has lists of singers, actors, writers, [[stage designers]], [[costume designers]], and inventors of [[stage machinery]], and comments on [[Theatre|production]], is "invaluable for historians of opera."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quadrio also published, among other works, the ''Dissertazioni critico-storiche intorno alla Rezia di qua dalle Alpi, oggi detta Valtellina'' (1755), which testifies to his learning and has a preface explaining his motives in changing his calling.&lt;ref name=Waller/&gt;

'''George Hourmouziadis''' ({{lang-el|Γιώργος Χουρμουζιάδης}}; 26 November 1932 – 16 October 2013) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[archaeologist]] and Professor Emeritus of prehistoric archaeology at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]].  He led excavations in many prehistoric settlements in Thessaly and Macedonia (such as Dimini, Arkadikos Dramas etc.) and in 1992 he started the excavation of the neolithic lakeside  settlement of [[Dispilio]] in Kastoria, Northwestern Greece.  A myriad of items were discovered, which included ceramics, structural elements, seeds, bones, figurines, personal ornaments, three flutes (considered the oldest in Europe) and the [[Dispilio Tablet]]. He died on 16 October 2013 in Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/10/16/george-hourmouziadis-archaeologist-and-kke-deputy-passes-away/ Archaeologist and KKE Deputy George Hourmouziadis Passes Away], Greek Reporter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22768&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=63904034 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the wooden tablet was announced at a symposium in February 1994 at the University of Thessaloniki. The site's paleoenvironment, botany, fishing techniques, tools and ceramics were published informally in the June 2000 issue of Επτάκυκλος, a Greek archaeology magazine and in Hourmouziadis (2002).

'''Gero Merhart von Bernegg''' (17 October 1886 – 4 March 1959) was a German archaeologist. Although he worked at the same time when German nationalism and [[Nazi archaeology]] was dominant in Germany, he was not a "Nazi archaeologist".  He came into conflict with [[Hans Reinerth]].

'''Giuseppe Lugli''' (born in Rome, Italy, in 1890; died in [[Rome, Italy]], on December 5, 1967) was Professor of [[Topography of ancient Rome|ancient Roman topography]] at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] from 1933 to 1961.&lt;ref name="treccani.it"&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giuseppe-lugli/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugli's academic career began with the completion of his undergraduate "Laurea" degree at [[Università di Roma La Sapienza]] in 1913, where he wrote a thesis on the villa of the emperor [[Domitian]] at [[Castel Gandolfo]].&lt;ref name="inasa-roma.it"&gt;http://www.inasa-roma.it/pdf/Colini%20Ricordo%20di%20Giuseppe%20Lugli.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugli's career was prolific, although among his many significant contributions, several are paramount.  He is credited with more than 230 scholarly publications.&lt;ref name="inasa-roma.it"/&gt; In his topographical career, Lugli compiled the landmark ''Fontes ad topographiam veteris urbis Romae pertinentes'' (8 vols. 1952-69).&lt;ref name="Lugliantica1950"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giuseppe Lugli|author2=Università degli studi di Roma "La Sapienza".

Bardi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aim of this corpus was to collect all of the textual mentions in the ancient sources that pertain to the topography and monuments of Rome.  The work is organized according to the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Augustan regions]] of the city.

Lugli was also a student of architecture, and in particular of building techniques.  His study ''La tecnica edilizia romana: con particolare riguardo a Roma e Lazio, Roma'' (Bardi, 1957) remains a seminal study of the technology of construction in [[Italy]] during the 1st millennium B.C.&lt;ref name="Lugli1957"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giuseppe Lugli|title=La Tecnica Edilizia Romana Con Particolare Riguardo a Roma E Lazio: Testo. 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftGxnQEACAAJ|year=1957|publisher=Johnson Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugli also founded the ''[[Forma Italiae]]'', a series of archaeological maps and concordance for Italy.  This work continues today as a serial publication, and associated research project, directed by Prof. Paolo Sommella in the Department of Ancient History, Archaeology and Anthropology at the Università degli Studi di Roma "La Sapienza". The aim of ''Forma Italiae'' is to map the full archaeological landscape of Italy at a sufficient scale to facilitate a variety of research and teaching needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://antichita.let.uniroma1.it/ricerca/v_forita.htm.Forma{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Italiae&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">'''Gustave Charles Fagniez''' (6 October 1842 – 18 June 1927), [[France|French]] historian and archivist, was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]] on 6 October 1842. Trained at the [[École des Chartes]] and the [[École pratique des hautes études]], he made his first appearance in the world of scholarship as the author of an excellent book called ''Études sur l'industrie et la classe industrielle à Paris au XIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; et au XIV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' (1877). This work, composed almost entirely from documents, many unpublished, opened a new field for historical study.

Twenty years later he supplemented this book by an interesting collection of ''Documents relatifs à l'histoire de l'industrie et du commerce en France'' (2 vols., 1898-1900), and in 1897 he published ''L'économie sociale de la France sous Henri IV'', a volume containing the results of very minute research. He did not, however, confine himself to economic history. His ''Le Père Joseph et Richelieu'' (1894),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Quarterly Review|title=Review of ''Le Père Joseph et Richelieu'' par Gustave Fagniez|volume=183|date=April 1896|pages=339–373|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092526664;view=1up;seq=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; though somewhat frigid and severe, is based on a mass of unpublished information, and shows remarkable psychologic grasp. In 1878 his ''Journal parisien de Jean de Maupoint, prieur de Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Couture'' was published in vol. iv. of the ''Mémoires de la Société de l'Histoire de Paris et de l'Île de France''. He wrote numerous articles in the ''[[Revue historique]]'' (of which he was co-director with [[Gabriel Monod]] for some years) and in other learned reviews, such as the ''Revue des questions historiques'' and the ''[[Journal des savants]]''. In 1901 he was elected member of the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]].

'''Hans Coppi Jr.''' (born November 27, 1942 in [[Berlin]]) is a German historian. His parents, [[Hilde Coppi|Hilde]] and [[Hans Coppi]], were active in the [[German Resistance]] and were both executed by the [[Nazi]]s.

== Biography ==

=== Nazi victim at birth ===
Coppi was born at Barnimstraße Women's Prison in Berlin.&lt;ref name="gdw"&gt;[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/bio/ausgabe_mit-e.php?id=218 Brief biography of Hilde Coppi]. German Resistance Memorial Center, Berlin. Official website. Retrieved April 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were arrested on September 12, 1942 in Schrimm (now [[Śrem]], [[Poland]]). His paternal grandparents, maternal grandmother and one uncle were also arrested around this time. At the time of his parents' arrest, his mother was ''hochschwanger'', literally "highly pregnant".&lt;ref name="hildedet"&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/CoppiHilde/index.html Biographical details of Hilde Coppi's life] German Historical Museum official website. (Many pages in English, bio is in German.) Retrieved April 12, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was convicted and executed shortly after his birth. Coppi's father was allowed to see him in his mother's arms one last time before being executed.&lt;ref name="belgien"&gt;Thomas Brandenburg, [http://www.belgieninfo.net/artikel/view/datum/2006/12/15/widerstand-in-anderlecht.html "Widerstand in Anderlecht — Vor 65 Jahren: Sturm auf die "Rote Kapelle"] ("Resistance in Anderlecht — 65 Years Ago: Storming of the 'Rote Kapelle'") Retrieved April 12, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother attempted to get clemency, but it was denied by [[Adolf Hitler]] in July 1943. She was allowed to nurse her son until shortly before her execution on August 5, 1943 at [[Plötzensee Prison]], when Coppi was just eight months old.&lt;ref name="gdw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hildedet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="belgien" /&gt; Coppi grew up with his grandparents.&lt;ref name="belgien" /&gt;

=== Education and career ===
After studying economics in college, Coppi worked at an [[East Germany|East German]] foreign trade company for machine tools as a party secretary of the ruling SED party. From 1984 to 1987, he was employed by the Berlin district leadership of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED). After a year of study abroad in [[Moscow]], he went to the [[Arvid Harnack|Harnack]]/[[Harro Schulze-Boysen|Schulze-Boysen]] Research Center at the Academy of Sciences in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). Writing his dissertation on [[Harro Schulze-Boysen]], he got his doctorate at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology]] in 1992. He has spent considerable time devoted to the study of the Red Orchestra and the German Resistance.&lt;ref name="belgien" /&gt;

Although his parents are often identified as having been members of the [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]], Coppi himself says the term is a "catch-all" term the Nazis used to derogatorily refer to all ''[[Widerstand]]'' groups and it was used even after 1945 to defame them as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spies.&lt;ref name="belgien" /&gt;

From 1990 to 1994, he was a researcher at the [[German Resistance Memorial Center]] in Berlin. From 1997 to 2002, he was the project director for the development of electronic archival resources at the Sachsenhausen Memorial. Coppi has been a freelance contributor at the German Resistance Memorial Center since 2003 and since 2004, the state chairman of the [[Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime]] in Berlin.

Coppi was an honored guest at a Brussels program commemorating the 65th anniversary of the December 13, 1941, 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. arrests in Brussels of members of the Red Orchestra.&lt;ref name="belgien" /&gt; At that event, Coppi said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;After 1945, the members of the [[Abwehr]], Gestapo and [[Reichskriegsgericht]] were never held accountable for their crimes against humanity. On the contrary, they were in demand as interlocutors for western intelligence agencies and made sure that those they had sentenced to death and killed in detention were once again defamed as spies and traitors. —Hans Coppi in Brussels, December 13, 2006&lt;ref name="belgien" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coppi is married to the gallery owner, Helle Coppi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/Galleries/About.asp?G=&amp;gid=424270926&amp;which=&amp;rta=http://www.artnet.com Description of Galerie Leo.Coppi]. Retrieved April 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He has three daughters and lives in Berlin.

'''Konrad Eubel''' or '''Conradus Eubel''' (19 January 1842 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1923) was a German [[Franciscan]] historian. He is known for his reference work, the ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', on medieval popes, cardinals and bishops. It appeared in three volumes, beginning in 1898.  It covers the period 1198 to 1592, and is a more detailed version of the ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae'' by [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]].

Under the title of the ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recentioris Aevi'' the work has continued and now stands at nine volumes covering the period from 1198 to 1922.

Other works include a Franciscan ''[[bullarium]]''.

The '''Lau'agae Ridge Quarry''' is a prehistoric stone quarry on the eastern side of the island of [[Tutuila]] in the United States territory of [[American Samoa]].  It is located on a ridge above another archaeological site, the prehistoric village of [[Tulauta Village Site|Tulauta]].  The site includes a carpet of stone flakes, evidence of rough stonework (creating forms probably finished in Tulauta), signs of habitation, and two ''tia'ave'', oval stone platforms found in abundance on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Prehistoric Settlement System in Eastern Tutuila, America Samoa|last=Clark|first=Jeffrey|last2=Herdrich|first2=David|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|issue=Volume 102, No. 2|date=June 1993|pages=147–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These archaeological materials adhere to the current definition, and have been designated national treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into effect on June 9, 1951.

[[Buddhism]] arrived in Japan in the mid–6th century [[Asuka period]], and was officially adopted in the wake of the [[Battle of Shigisan]] in 587, after which [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] began to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sansom|Sansom|1958|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new religion and customs fundamentally transformed Japanese society and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farris|1998|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funerary traditions such as cremation and the practice of placing [[epitaph]]s in graves were imported from China and Korea. Following the treatment of Buddhist relics, the cremated remains in a glass container were wrapped in a cloth and placed in an outer container.&lt;ref name="fuminonemaro"/&gt; Epitaphs, which recorded the lives of the deceased on silver or bronze rectangular strips, were particularly popular from the latter half of the 7th to the end of the 8th century (late Asuka and [[Nara period]]).

Believers buried scriptures and images to gain merit and to prepare for the coming Buddha.&lt;ref name="nishikawa-p58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nishikawa|Sano|1983|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p88"/&gt; This practice, which continued into the [[Kamakura period]], required the transcription of [[sutra]]s according to strict ritual protocols, their placement in protective reliquary containers and burial in the earth of sacred mountains, [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] or temples to await the future Buddha.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heianjapan-p245"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adolphson|Kamens|Matsumoto|2007|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known [[sutra mound]] is that of [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] from 1007 on Mount Kinpu, who buried one [[lotus sutra]] and five other sutras that he had written in 998.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p88"/&gt; Its sutra container has been designated as National Treasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33928">'''[[Disaster]]s''' can be particularly notable for the high costs associated with responding to and recovering from them. This page lists the estimated economic costs of relatively recent disasters.

The costs of disasters vary considerably depending on a range of factors, such as the geographical location where they occur. When a large disaster occurs in a wealthy country, the financial damage may be large, but when a comparable disaster occurs in a poorer country, the actual financial damage may appear to be relatively small.  This is in part due to the difficulty of measuring the financial damage in areas that lack [[insurance]]. For example, the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], with a death toll of over 230,000 people, cost a 'mere' $15 billion,&lt;ref name="sschonhardt.com"/&gt; whereas in the ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill, in which 11 people died, the damages were six-fold.

''Note: All damage figures are listed in billions of [[United States dollars]].''

'''Madeleine Riffaud''' (born 23 August 1924 in [[Arvillers]], France), is a French poet, journalist, war correspondent and previously a member of the [[French Resistance]].

== World War II ==
Madeleine grew up in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] region, surrounded by memories of the First World War. She was 15 years old when war with Germany was declared. In May 1940, the [[Luftwaffe]] strafed a column of refugees from the Somme in which she was fleeing for the unoccupied South-West. Following this, she decided to move to Paris and fight against the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=(ed.)|first=Nicole Thatcher &amp; Ethel Tolansky|title=Six authors in captivity literary responses to the occupation of France during World War II|year=2006|publisher=Lang|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039105205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began operating for the [[French Forces of the Interior]] at the age of 18 under the codename "Rainer", participating in several operations against occupying Nazi forces and contributing to the capture of 80 [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers from an armoured German supply train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jon Henley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/21/secondworldwar.france |title='You can't know how wonderful it was to finally battle in the daylight' &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-08-21|accessdate=2013-04-29 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 1944, at age 20, she became infamous for the killing of a German officer, whom she shot dead in broad daylight on a bridge overlooking the river [[Seine]].

Shortly afterwards, she was captured by the [[Gestapo]] and taken to their HQ at [[Rue des Saussaies]] before being transferred to [[Fresnes Prison]]. Following her torture and a date being set for her execution, she was finally released in a prisoner exchange. She immediately returned to fight in the Resistance with the aim of freeing Paris from Nazi occupation. After the [[liberation of Paris]], she and her comrades continued the fight against the Nazis until the end of the War.

== Journalism ==

After the war ended in 1945, she became a journalist for [[:fr:Ce soir|Ce Soir]], a French newspaper run by [[Louis Aragon]], and then reported on the [[Algerian War]] for the French newspaper [[L'Humanité]]. In 1946, she met with [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Paris and vowed to devote her life to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookatvietnam.com/2008/11/vietnamese-diplomat-visits-french-celebrity.html |title=Vietnamese diplomat visits French celebrity |publisher=Look At Vietnam |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to South Vietnam, and lived with the [[Viet Cong]] resistance for 7 years, covering their fight during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://talkvietnam.com/2011/09/french-heroine-fight-vietnam-breath/ |title=French heroine: I will fight for Vietnam till the last breath — TalkVietnam |publisher=Talkvietnam.com |date=2011-09-02 |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, she published ''Au Nord Vietnam, écrit Sous Les Bombes'' and made a documentary film entitled ''Dans Le Maquis du Sud-Vietnam'', documenting their methods of [[guerrilla warfare]].

Upon her return to France, she worked as a nursing assistant in a Paris hospital, where she wrote the best-seller ''Les Linges De La Nuit'', and published an anthology of poetry, ''Cheval Rouge : Anthologie Poétique, 1939-1972''.

Madeleine Riffaud was awarded the [[National Order of Merit (France)]] in Paris on February 26, 2013 for her contributions to France and the world. She received the Friendship Medal from Vietnam in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamembassy-bulgaria.org/vnemb.vn/tinkhac/ns090227091513?b_start:int=50 |title=Vietnam Embassy - Veteran French journalist honoured |publisher=Vietnamembassy-bulgaria.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing and poetry ==

Riffaud wrote poetry throughout the war and during her career as a journalist. [[Pablo Picasso]] drew her portrait for the frontispiece of ''Le Poing Fermé'' (The Closed Fist), her collection of poems published in 1945.

Her autobiographical account of her time in the Resistance was published in 1994 entitled ''On L'appelait Rainer'', referencing the [[nom de guerre]] that she adopted during that time. She has also starred in a number of documentaries about her life.

'''Michael George MacDonald Kidson''' (24 August 1929 &amp;ndash; 20 June 2015) was a British schoolmaster who taught history at [[Eton College]]. Among Kidson's pupils was former Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. His life is portrayed in the bestselling book ''[http://www.quillerpublishing.com/the-enigma-of-kidson.html The Enigma of Kidson]'', by Jamie Blackett published by [http://www.quillerpublishing.com/ Quiller], {{ISBN|9781846892509}}.

Kidson was born in [[Belgravia]], [[London]].  His parents separated when he was an infant and his father died a few years later.  He was brought up in [[Shropshire]] by his grandfather until the age of seven.  Following his grandfather's death he was placed into the care of the [[Royal Wolverhampton School]], which at that time was a charitable institution for children who had lost one or both parents.
&lt;ref name=tele&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11716504/Michael-Kidson-schoolmaster-obituary.html Michael Kidson, schoolmaster - obituary], ''Daily Telegraph'', Obiits. 3 July 2015. (Retrieved 15 July 2015). &lt;/ref&gt;

Kidson served in the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] as a [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|national service officer]], then went up to [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he read economics and history. In 1956 he joined [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] as a graduate trainee but soon moved into teaching, initially at [[Papplewick School|Papplewick]], a private school, and then at Eton. He  retired in 1994.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Great Teachers in my Life" website  http://myndset.com/2008/02/great-teachers-in-my-life/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;发表于 2015-1-28 09:24:51 | 只看该作者 (Retrieved 17 July 2015). {{cite web |url=http://bbs.zhengqingchunhr.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=74144&amp;extra=page%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717203936/http://bbs.zhengqingchunhr.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=74144&amp;extra=page%3D1 |archivedate=17 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was notable for his competence and for his exceptional ability to engage the minds of his students.&lt;ref&gt;2011年考研关于跨专业报考问题, 评论列表（网友评论仅供网友表达个人看法，并不表明本站同意其观点或证实其描述）, {{cite web |url=http://class.enboedu.net/plus/feedback.php?aid=6&amp;action=show&amp;totalresult=3116&amp;pageno=156 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720213630/http://class.enboedu.net/plus/feedback.php?aid=6&amp;action=show&amp;totalresult=3116&amp;pageno=156 |archivedate=20 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;اختصارات لوحة المفاتيح, 27 April 2015 https://twitter.com/britt_w/.../592689100488110080?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Газеты на английском языке. http://hogwarts-blagoveshensk.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=752&amp;Itemid=842&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milan Rešetar''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Милан Решетар}};  February 1, 1860 – January 14, 1942) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] (a self-identified [[Serb Catholic movement in Dubrovnik|Serb Catholic]] from [[Dalmatia]], today by some Croat researchers considered [[Croatia]]n),&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=52561 |contribution=Rešetar, Milan, |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=January 19, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[linguistics|linguist]], [[historian]] and [[literary critic]].

==Biography==
Rešetar was born in [[Dubrovnik]]. After the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Dubrovnik, he studied classical [[philology]] and Slavic languages in [[Vienna]] and [[Graz]]. He worked as a high-school professor in [[Koper]], [[Zadar]] and [[Split (city)|Split]], and later a professor of Slavic studies on the universities of [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] and [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]]). He also edited the Croatian edition of "''List drevnih zakona''" magazine. Rešetar was a student of [[Vatroslav Jagić]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zigh.at/hrv/institut/simpoziji/slavistika_bec_profesori.html Vienna's Slavistics Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a notable member of the [[Serb Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]. After retirement, he moved to [[Florence]] where he died 1942.

The main areas of his works included [[dialectology]] and [[accentology]] of [[South Slavic languages]], as well as philologically impeccable editions of 15th to 18th century writers for the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] edition "''Stari pisci hrvatski"/Old Croatian Writers''".

He was one of founders of South Slavic dialectology, investigating features of [[Štokavian]] dialects (''Der Štokawische Dialect'', Vienna, 1907) and [[Čakavian]] dialects, and also wrote a monography about [[Molise Croatian dialect]]. Milan Rešetar was the most conscientious and diligent commentator on [[The Mountain Wreath]]. He was also engaged in the field of [[numismatics]] (''Dubrovačka numizmatika'', 1924-1925), inheriting the interest and coin collection from his father Pavle, the last commander in [[Kotor]] during [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš]]'s lifetime. The collection is kept at The National Museum in Prague.

==Works==

He wrote in Serbian, Croatian, German, and Italian.

His most important works in Serbian include:
*"''Čakavština i njene nekadašnje i sadašnje granice''" (''Čakavian Dialect, its Past and Present Boundaries'')
* "''Štokavski dijalekat''" (''Štokavian Dialect'')
* "''Nikša Zvijezdić''" of [[Serbian Chancellery in Dubrovnik]] fame (1431-1455)
* "''Najstariji dubrovački govor''" (''The Oldest Dialect of Dubrovnik'')
* "''Najstarija dubrovačka proza''" (''The Oldest Literature of Dubrovnik'').

His works in this area are, with a few exceptions, superseded by later areal linguistics and historical dialectology research. On the other hand, Rešetar's editions of the Renaissance and Baroque poets and playwrights are still the standard printed issues; only  modern computerized textology analyses, done in the Institute for Croatian language and linguistics, have begun to question some aspects of his transliteration choices on the graphemics level. The big part of his work in this area remains highly regarded and confirmed by contemporary textology.

His scientific attitudes towards the Ijekavian Štokavian dialect of Dubrovnik were driven by his own ethnic affiliation{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}—like many other prominent members of the intelligentsia in Dubrovnik of his time, Rešetar identified himself as a ''[[Serb Catholic]]''.

Convinced that the [[Croats]] and the [[Serbs]] are one nation in two names, Rešetar held that Croatian and Serbian are one and the same language, and in that conviction he published two versions of its grammar - one with examples in Latin script and examples in Cyrillic script: ''Elementar-Grammatik der kroatischen (serbischen) Sprache'' and ''Elementar-Grammatik der serbischen (kroatischen) Sprache'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=52561 |contribution=Rešetar, Milan, |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=January 19, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote in German a lengthy book entitled ''Die serbokroatischen Kolonien süditaliens'' which was published in Vienna in 1911. 
{{quote|This volume concerns itself with the highly-interesting Croatian enclave in [[Molise]] of the province of [[Naples]], the three communities of [[Montemitro]], [[San Felice del Molise]], and Aquaviva-Collecroce. Remote from the lines from which the greater events of history moved in the Middle Ages, the three communities have remained singularly conservative of ancestral type in habit and speech. Even at the present they lie remote from the travel routes and scarcely touched by the modern life of Italy save in so far as the Government reaches out to them hands collecting taxes and drawing their youth into military service. The moot point of the period at which this Molise colony was founded and the circumstances under which it came to fixity is carefully discussed with a full apparatus of historical record. Upon the same point the author, with great skill in the interpretation of speech record, masses the weight of his philological acumen in the linguistic section of the work. He succeeds in orienting the Molise dialect upon the great body of Slavic speech and shows where the migration was derived; and, by a critical examination of speech forms, is able to identify the period quite independently of the formal record of documents. It affords a most interesting example of the contribution of philology to the art of a historian.| From a review in ''Bulletin of the American Geographic Society'' (Vol. 45, No. 4 (1913) pp.&amp;nbsp;303–304) by William Churchill.}}

'''Nicholas Trivet''' (or '''Trevet''', as he himself wrote) (c. 1258 – c. 1328) was an English [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[chronicler]].

==Life==
Trivet was born in [[Somerset]] and was the son of Sir Thomas Trevet (died 1283), a judge who came of a [[Norfolk]] or [[Somerset]] family. Nicholas became a [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[friar]] in [[London]], and studied first at [[Oxford]] and later in [[Paris]], where he first took an interest in English and French chronicles.{{sfn|Burton|1913}}

Little is known of the greater part of his life except that at one time he was [[prior]] of his order in London, and at another he was teaching at Oxford, also that he was at [[Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence.

==Works==
Trivet was the author of a large number of theological and historical works and commentaries on the classics, more especially the works of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. A large number of these exist in MS. in various libraries, but only two appear to have been printed, one being the work by which he is chiefly remembered, the chronicle of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin]] kings of England; the other was the last twelve books of his commentary on [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s treatise ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate dei]]''. The full title of the former work is ''Annales sex regum Angliae qui a comitibus Andegavensibus originem traxerunt'', an important historical source for the period between 1135 and 1307, containing a specially valuable account of the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], who was his contemporary. Trivet also wrote a chronicle in French, parts of which were printed by [[Henry Spelman]].  This contains the tale of Constance, from which the popular tale-type derived its name, and from which [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] is believed to have obtained his [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mediaeval romance in England; a study of the sources and analogues of the non-cyclic metrical romances|last=Hibbard Loomis|first=Laura A.|publisher=B. Franklin|year=1963|location=New York|pages=24|oclc=906442375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annales'' were published in Paris in 1668, in Oxford in 1719, and were edited by [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg|Thomas Hogg]] for the [[English Historical Society]] in 1845. Manuscripts are at Oxford and in the [[British Museum]]. Trevet's other historical works are ''Catalogus regum anglo-saxonum durante heptarchia'', and ''Les Cronicles qe frere N. Trevet escript a dame Marie'' (Marie was Edward I's daughter [[Mary of Woodstock]]). Trivet also wrote a number of works of a theological and philological character.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Trivet also wrote many biblical commentaries, treatises and translations. While over a hundred manuscripts exist, in Latin, French and Italian, of his commentary on [[Boethius]], which in turn influenced [[Jean de Meun]] and Chaucer.

A member of Nicholas' family was Sir [[Thomas Trivit]] (died October 1383), a soldier of repute, who saw a good deal of service in France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

St. '''Nikephoros I''' or '''Nicephorus I''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Νικηφόρος Α΄, ''Nikēphoros I'') (c. 758 &amp;ndash; April 5, 828) was a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] writer and [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] from April 12, 806, to March 13, 815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11050a.htm St. Nicephorus]. „''Patriarch of Constantinople, 806-815, b. about 758; d. 2 June, 829''.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Alexander, ''The Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople''. Oxford University Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Background==
He was born in [[Constantinople]] as the son of Theodore and Eudokia, of a strictly orthodox family, which had suffered from the earlier [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]]. His father Theodore, one of the secretaries of Emperor [[Constantine V]], had been scourged and banished to [[Nicaea]] for his zealous support of [[Iconodule]]s, and the son inherited the religious convictions of the father. Nevertheless, he entered the service of the Empire, became cabinet secretary (''[[asekretis]]''), and under [[Irene of Athens|Irene]] took part in the [[Second Council of Nicaea|synod of 787]] as imperial commissioner. He then withdrew to one of the [[cloister]]s that he had founded on the eastern shore of the [[Bosporus]], until he was appointed director of the largest home for the destitute in Constantinople c. 802.

After the death of the Patriarch [[Tarasios of Constantinople]], although still a [[laity|layman]], he was chosen patriarch by the wish of the emperor ([[Easter]], April 12, 806). The uncanonical choice met with opposition from the strictly clerical party of the [[Stoudios|Stoudites]], and this opposition intensified into an open break when Nikephoros, in other respects a very rigid moralist, showed himself compliant to the will of the emperor by reinstating the excommunicated priest Joseph.

After vain theological disputes, in December 814, there followed personal insults. Nikephoros at first replied to his removal from his office by excommunication, but was at last obliged to yield to force, and was taken to one of the cloisters he had founded, ''Tou Agathou'', and later to that called ''Tou Hagiou Theodorou''. From there he carried on a literary [[polemic]] for the cause of the [[iconodule]]s against the [[Council of Constantinople (815)|synod of 815]]. On the occasion of the change of emperors, in 820, he was put forward as a candidate for the patriarchate and at least obtained the promise of toleration.

He died at the monastery of Saint Theodore (''Hagiou Theodorou''), revered as a [[confessor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dce.oca.org/assets/templates/bulletin.cfm?mode=html&amp;id=85 "Martyrs and Confessors", Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were solemnly brought back to Constantinople by [[Methodios I of Constantinople]] on March 13, 847, and interred in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], where they were annually the object of imperial devotion. His feast is celebrated on this day both in the Greek and Roman Churches; the Greeks also observe 2 June as the day of his death.

Compared with [[Theodore the Studite|Theodore of Stoudios]], Nikephoros appears as a friend of conciliation, learned in [[patristics]], more inclined to take the defensive than the offensive, and possessed of a comparatively chaste, simple style. He was mild in his ecclesiastical and monastical rules and non-partisan in his historical treatment of the period from 602 to 769 (''Historia syntomos, breviarium''). He used the chronicle of [[Trajan the Patrician]].

His tables of universal history (''Chronographikon syntomon''), in passages extended and continued, were in great favor with the Byzantines, and were also circulated outside the Empire in the Latin version of [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]], and also in Slavonic translation. The ''Chronography'' offered a universal history from the time of [[Adam and Eve]] to his own time. To it he appended a canon catalog (which does not include the ''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]'' of [[John of Patmos|John]]). The catalog of the accepted books of the Old and New Testaments is followed by the ''[[antilegomena]]'' (including ''Revelation'') and the [[apocrypha]]. Next to each book is the count of its lines, his [[Stichometry of Nicephorus|stichometry]], to which we can compare our accepted texts and judge how much has been added or omitted. This is especially useful for apocrypha for which only fragmentary texts have survived.

The principal works of Nikephorus are three writings referring to [[iconoclasm]]:

* ''Apologeticus minor'', probably composed before 814, an explanatory work for laymen concerning the tradition and the first phase of the iconoclastic movement;
* ''Apologeticus major'' with the three ''Antirrhetici'' against [[Mamonas]]-Constantine Kopronymos, a complete [[dogmatics]] of the belief in images, with an exhaustive discussion and refutation of all objections made in opposing writings, as well as those drawn from the works of the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]];
* The third of these larger works is a refutation of the iconoclastic synod of 815 (ed. Serruys, Paris, 1904).

Nikephoros follows in the path of [[John of Damascus]]. His merit is the thoroughness with which he traced the literary and traditional proofs, and his detailed refutations are serviceable for the knowledge they afford of important texts adduced by his opponents and in part drawn from the older church literature.

In [[Numismatics]] '''overstrike''' refers to the image on a coin which has been [[Coining (machining)|coined]] more than once. Overstriking is done deliberately when the first strike is unsatisfactory, or accidentally if the blank slips out of place or if the [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] judder, resulting in a slight doubling of the design. 

Sometimes old and worn coins were overstruck with new designs by later rulers. This occurred in the [[Roman Empire]], see [[sestertius]], and also in more modern times. Due to a shortage of silver the mint of [[George III]] of [[Great Britain]] used [[Spanish dollar|Spanish silver dollars]] in the early 19th century, and overstruck the king's image and legends on them.

==Ancient world==
In the ancient world, use of overstrikes was not uncommon, since the manufacture of [[Planchet|flans]] was resource consumptive; thus a foreign or outdated coin could be overstruck with less investment than new [[mint (coin)|mintage]].&lt;ref&gt;O.Mørkholm, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence of overstriking appears as early as about 500 [[Before Christ|BC]] when coins of [[Aegina]] were overstruck by the ancient city of [[Kydonia]] on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In this case and many others, the overstrike can be a valuable aid to dating an ancient coin, an era when dates were not commonly affixed to the design.&lt;ref&gt;M.Crawford, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8198">The '''Pecos Classification''' is a chronological division of all known [[Ancestral Puebloans]] into periods based on changes in [[architecture]], [[art]], [[pottery]], and [[Artifact (archaeology)|cultural remains]].  The original classification dates back to consensus reached at a 1927 [[Pecos conference|archæological conference]] held in [[Pecos, New Mexico]], which was organized by the United States archaeologist [[Alfred V. Kidder]].

==Original classification==

The original Pecos Classification contained eight stages of Southwestern prehistory, but it did not specify dates.

# [[Early Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker I]], or Early Basketmaker II
# [[Late Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker II]], or Late Basketmaker II
# [[Basketmaker III Era|Basketmaker III]], or Post-Basketmaker
# [[Pueblo I Period]], or Proto-Pueblo
# [[Pueblo II Period]]
# [[Pueblo III Period]], or Great Pueblo
# [[Pueblo IV Period]], or Proto-Historic
# [[Pueblo V Period]], or Historic

==Current classification==

Although the original classification has been significantly debated and sometimes modified over the years, the split into [[Basket]]maker and Pueblo period still serves as a basis for discussing the culture of the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Ancient Puebloans]] of the [[Four Corners]] area. The following classification in based in part of the Revised Pecos Classification for the Mesa Verde Region.

===Archaic–Early Basketmaker (8000 – 1500 BCE)=== 
{{main|Archaic–Early Basketmaker Era}}

The pre-Anasazi culture that moved into the modern-day [[Southwestern United States]] after the big game hunters departed are called ''Archaic''. Little evidence for extensive habitation before 8000 BC exists.  From evidence near [[Navajo Mountain]], they were [[nomad|nomadic people]], [[hunter-gatherer]]s traveling in small bands.  They gathered wild foods when in [[season]], and hunted with stone-tipped spears, ''[[atlatl]]s'', and [[Dart (missile)|dart]]s. Game included [[rabbit]]s, [[deer]], [[antelope]], and [[bighorn sheep]].

The original classification postulated a '''Basketmaker I Period''' which was subsequently discredited due to lack of physical evidence.  It was combined with the '''Archaic Period'''.

This period was called [[Oshara Tradition]]. There was a trend toward a sedentary lifestyle, with small-scale cultivation of plants beginning 1000 BC.

===Early Basketmaker II (1500 BCE – 50 CE)=== 
{{main|Early Basketmaker II Era}}

The early Anasazi camped in the open or lived in caves seasonally. During this period, they began to cultivate gardens of [[maize]] ([[flint corn]] in particular) and [[squash (vegetable)|squash]], but no [[beans]]. They used ''manos'' and ''[[metate]]s'' to grind corn, and the women made baskets for numerous uses.  They had no [[pottery]].

===Late Basketmaker II (50 – 500)=== 
{{main|Late Basketmaker II Era}}

The people constructed primitive storage bins, [[cist]]s, and shallow [[pit-house]]s. At this stage, evidence suggests that the beginning of a religious and decision-making structure had already developed. [[Shaman]]istic cults existed, and [[petroglyph]]s and other rock art indicate a ceremonial structure as well. Groups appear to be increasingly linked into larger-scale decision-making bodies.

===Basketmaker III (500 – 750)=== 
{{main|Basketmaker III Era}}

Deep pithouses were developed, along with some above-ground rooms.  The bow and arrow replace the atlatl and spear. Plain [[bisque (pottery)|bisque]] and some painted [[black-on-white]] pottery is made. Cultivation begins of beans, available due to trade from Central America, and edible due to slow cooking in pottery vessels.  Wild [[amaranth]] and [[pinyon pine]] were also staples. People of this period may have domesticated [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]].

The prototype ''[[kiva]]s'' were large, round, and subterranean.

===Pueblo I Period (750 – 900)=== 
{{main|Pueblo I Period}}

The [[Pueblo I Era|Pueblo I Period]] saw increasing populations, growing village size, social integration, and more complicated and complex agricultural systems typified this Period.  The construction and year-round occupation of pueblos begins; the people constructed reservoirs and canals to deal with scarce and irregular water resources.  Large villages and great kivas appear, though pithouses still remain in use. Above-ground construction is of [[jacal]] or crude [[masonry]]. Plain gray [[Bisque (pottery)|bisque]] predominates in pottery, though some red bisque and pottery decorated in black and white appears.

===Pueblo II Period (900 – 1150)=== 
{{main|Pueblo II Period}}

By AD 1050, [[Chaco Canyon]] (in present-day [[New Mexico]]) was a major regional center, with a population of 1,500–5,000 people. It is surrounded by standardized planned towns, or ''great houses'', built from the wood of more than 200,000 trees. Thirty-foot-wide ({{convert|30|ft|m|disp=output only}}) [[road]]s, flanked by [[berm]]s, radiate from Chaco in various directions. Small blocks of above-ground masonry rooms and a kiva make up a typical [[pueblo]]. Great kivas were up to {{convert|50|-|70|ft}} in diameter.  Pottery consists of corrugated gray bisque and decorated black-on-white in addition to some decorated red and orange vessels. The people imported shells and [[turquoise]] from other cultures through trading.

During the 12th century, populations began to grow after a decline at the end of the [[Pueblo II Era|Pueblo II Period]].  More intense [[agriculture]] was characteristic, with [[terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] and [[irrigation]] common.

===Pueblo III Period (1150 – 1350)=== 
{{main|Pueblo III Period}}

[[town|Settlements]] consist of large pueblos, cliff dwellings, towers and turkey pens. Most villages in the Four Corners area are abandoned by AD 1300.  The distinction between the ''[[Hohokam]]'' and Ancient Pueblo people becomes blurred.

===Pueblo IV Period (1350 – 1600)===
{{main|Pueblo IV Period}}

Typically, large pueblos are centered around a [[plaza]]. Socially, this was a period of more conflict than cooperation, which is thought to have led to abandonment of settlements at Mesa Verde. The people began making [[kachina]]s for religious and ritual purposes. Plain pottery supplants corrugated. Red, orange and yellow pottery is on the rise as the black-on-white declines.  [[Cotton]] is introduced and grown as a commodity.

The Puebloans are joined by other cultures.  As early as the 15th century, the Navajo were in the process of migrating into the region from the north.  In the next century, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] colonists first came in the 1540s from the south.

===Pueblo V Period (1600 – present)=== 
{{main|Pueblo V Period}}

The Spanish dominate and take over sites such as the [[Acoma Pueblo]]. Their arrival sends Pueblo subcultures underground.

{{Numismatics}}
'''Piloncitos''' (also known as '''Bulawan''') are tiny engraved gold coins found in the [[Philippines]] from the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Archaic period]] (pre-Hispanic era).

Trade among the early Filipinos and with traders from neighboring islands was conducted through [[Barter]]. The inconvenience of barter later led to the use of some objects as a medium of exchange. [[Gold]], which was plentiful in many parts of the islands, invariably found its way into these objects that included the Piloncitos, small bead-like gold bits considered by the local numismatists as the earliest coin of ancient Filipinos, and gold barter rings.

Piloncitos is presumably an offshoot of the [[silver]] and may have evolved into the bullet or [[History of Thai money|pod-duang]] coinage of Sukhothai in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of-philippine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical usage==
[[File:Piloncitos head and tails.jpg|left|thumb|An example of Piloncitos with a [[Baybayin]] ''Ma'' ([[File:Baybayin Ma.svg|20px]]) character.]]
Since ancient times, gold has been one of the main products of the islands. Both ancient and modern goldsmiths exude exquisiteness in their craftsmanship for trade, personal vanity and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.ph/permanenttraveling.php?page=classicalgoldwork&lt;/ref&gt;

Piloncitos are the earliest form of precious metal based currency of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]], [[Namayan]] and [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] in present-day Philippines. It is likely made of pure gold with a weight ranging between 0.5 grams to more or less than 3 grams. Piloncitos are tiny engraved bead-like [[gold]] bits unearthed in the Philippines. They are the first recognized coinage in the Philippines circulated between the 9th and 12th centuries. They emerged when increasing trade made barter inconvenient.

===Descriptions===
Piloncitos are so small—some are of the size of a corn kernel—and weigh from 0.09 to 2.65 grams of fine gold. Large Piloncitos weighing 2.65 grams approximate the weight of one mass. Piloncitos have been excavated from [[Mandaluyong]], [[Bataan]], the banks of the [[Pasig River]], [[Batangas]], [[Marinduque]], [[Samar]], [[Leyte]] and some areas in [[Mindanao]]. They have been found in large numbers in [[Indonesia]]n archeological sites leading to questions of origin. That gold was mined and worked in the Philippines is evidenced by many [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] accounts, like one in 1586 that stated: 
{{Main|History of Philippine money}}
{{Quote|“The people of this island ([[Luzon]]) are very skillful in their handling of gold. They weigh it with the greatest skill and delicacy that have ever been seen. The first thing they teach their children is the knowledge of gold and the weights with which they weigh it, for there is no other money among them.”&lt;ref&gt;http://opinion.inquirer.net/10991/%E2%80%98piloncitos%E2%80%99-and-the-%E2%80%98philippine-golden-age%E2%80%99&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other currencies or coinages used by early Filipinos===
[[File:Piloncitos ang gold rings.jpg|thumb|The Barter rings along with Piloncitos.]]
The early Filipinos traded Piloncitos also along with Gold rings, which is gold ring-like [[ingot]]s. These barter rings are bigger than doughnuts in size and are made of nearly pure gold.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.ph/permanenttraveling.php?page=classicalgoldwork&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also very similar to the first coins invented in the [[Kingdom of Lydia]] in present-day [[Turkey]]. Barter rings were circulated in the Philippines up to the 16th century.

===Similarities in neighboring countries===
Piloncitos is not exclusively found in the Philippines as most collectors and local historians state. Similar type of gold can be found in some regions of Indonesia which they call ''massa''.&lt;ref&gt;http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of-philippine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In an era before coined money was widely used, Indo-Pacific beads were made first at a site called Arikamedu in South [[India]] ca. 200 BC. The manufacture then moved in sequence to [[Ceylon]], South [[Thailand]], [[Java]] and finally Malaya. By about 1200–1300 AD the larger [[Majapahit]] beads, excavated today in the interior of Java, had supplanted it. Since these factory sites have been dated, archaeologists now use the beads to date sites, though whether beads rose to the level of metals, salt, cloth, and cowries as "standard" trade goods is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of-philippine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The first indigenous metallic coinage in the region, ca. 750–850 AD, comes from the Javanese kingdom of Sailendra (Chinese: ''Ho-ling''). These roughly dome-shaped silver of irregular weight bore stamps of a flowing vase, and the sandalwood flower (quatefoil). By 850 AD weights had been standardized at 20 rattis to a Massa of about 2.4 grams. Silver and gold coins of Massa and fractional denominations were issued until about 1300 AD, with changes in shape and quality of inscription marking periods of issue. The gold Piloncitos of the Philippines are a late offshoot of the gold coinage, while the bean-like silver "namo" series, of the Malay isthmus was presumably an offshoot of the silver and may have evolved into the bullet (Pod-Duang) coinage of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of-philippine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postchristianity'''&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Oosthuizen. ''Postchristianity in Africa''. C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd (December 31, 1968). {{ISBN|0-903983-05-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the loss of the primacy of the Christian worldview in political affairs, especially in the [[Western world]] where [[Christianity]] had previously flourished, in favor of alternative worldviews such as [[secularism]] or [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, from "The Christian Revolution," in The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes personal [[world views]], [[ideologies]], [[religious movements]] or [[societies]] that are no longer rooted in the language and assumptions of Christianity, at least explicitly, although they had previously been in an environment of ubiquitous Christianity (i.e. [[Christendom]]).

Some scholars{{who|date=September 2018}} have disputed the global decline of Christianity, and instead hypothesized of an evolution of Christianity which allows it to not only survive, but actively expand its influence in contemporary societies.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Decline of Christianity==
Historically, the majority of Christians have lived in [[Western world|Western]], [[White people|White]] nations, often conceptualized as "[[Role of the Christian Church in civilization|European Christian" civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, from "The Christian Revolution," in The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

A postchristian world is one in which Christianity is no longer the dominant [[civil religion]] but has gradually assumed [[values]], [[culture]], and [[world view|worldview]]s that are not necessarily [[Christian]] (and also may not necessarily reflect any world religion's standpoint or may represent a combination of either several religions or none). Post-Christian tends to refer to the loss of Christianity's [[monopoly]], if not its followers, in historically Christian societies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalreview.com/article/366263/our-post-christian-society-john-osullivan&lt;/ref&gt; Postchristian societies can be found across the Global North - for example, though the 2005 [[Eurobarometer]] survey indicated that the majority of [[Europe]]ans hold some form of belief in a [[higher power]], fewer point explicitly to the [[Christian God]]. 

Despite the declining, Christianity remains the [[Religion in Europe|dominant religion in Europe]], according to a 2010 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], 76.2% of the [[Demographics of Europe|European]] population identified themselves as [[Christians]],&lt;ref name="Christianity in Europe"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-europe.aspx Christianity in Europe], including the Asian part of Russia, excluding the European part of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt; and according to a 2012 [[Eurobarometer]] survey, [[Christianity]] was the largest religion in the [[European Union]] (account 72% of EU population).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012 |work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=European Union |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2010 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], about 70.6% of the [[Americas]] population identified themselves as [[Christians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS  |url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/ |title=Religion in America: U.S. Religious Data, Demographics and Statistics |publisher=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (90% in [[Latin America]] and 77% in [[North America]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS  |url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-christians.aspx |title=Global religious landscape: Christians |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1961 ''The Death of God'', the [[France|French]] theologian [[Gabriel Vahanian]] argued that modern secular culture in most of [[Western civilization]] had lost all sense of the [[sacred]], lacked any [[Sacrament|sacramental]] meaning, and disdained any [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] purpose or sense of [[Divine providence|providence]], bringing him to the conclusion that for the modern mind, "[[God is dead]]". [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] and William Hamilton of [[Emory University]] drew upon a variety of sources, including the [[aphorism]]s of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]'s ''Letters and Papers from Prison'', and brought this line of thought to public attention in a short-lived intellectual movement of the mid-to-late-1960s among [[Protestant]] theologians and ministerial students. Conservative reaction on the right and social-advocacy efforts on the left blunted its impact, however, and it was quickly overlooked in favor of more ethically-oriented movements such as the [[Social Gospel]] and [[feminist theology|feminist theologies]], within [[mainline Protestant]]ism.

==Alternative perspectives==
Other scholars have disputed the global decline of Christianity, and instead hypothesized of an evolution of Christianity which allows it to not only survive, but actively expand its influence in contemporary societies.

[[Philip Jenkins]] hypothesized a "Christian Revolution" in the Southern nations, such as Africa, Asia and Latin America, where instead of facing decline, Christianity is actively expanding. The relevance of Christian teachings in the global South will allow the Christian population in these areas to continually increase, and together with the shrinking of the Western Christian population, will form a "new Christendom" in which the majority of the world's Christian population can be found in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jenkins, from "The Christian Revolution," in The Next Christendom: The Coming of Global Christianity, Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], meanwhile, disputes the "God is Dead" thesis by arguing that the practices and understandings of faith changed long before the late 20th century, along with secularism itself. In ''[[A Secular Age]]'' Taylor argues that being "free from Christendom" has allowed Christianity to endure and express itself in various ways, particularly in Western society; he notes that otherwise secular ideas were, and continue to be, formed in light of some manner of faith. He stresses that "loss of faith" reflects simplistic notions on the nature of [[secularization]], namely the idea of "subtraction." Thus "post-Christian" is, after a fashion, a product of Christianity itself.

==Other uses==
Some American Christians (primarily Protestants) also use this term in reference to the [[evangelism]] of [[unchurched]] individuals who may have grown up in a non-Christian culture where traditional [[Biblical]] references may be unfamiliar concepts. This perspective argues that, among previous generations in the United States, such concepts and other artifacts of [[Glossary of Christianity|Christianese]] would have been common cultural knowledge and that it would not have been necessary to teach this language to adult [[religious conversion|converts]] to Christianity. In this sense, post-Christian is not used pejoratively, but is intended to describe the special remediative care that would be needed to introduce [[new Christian]]s to the nuances of Christian life and practice.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Some groups use the term "post-Christian" as a self-description. [[Dana McLean Greeley]], the first president of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], described [[Unitarian Universalism]] as postchristian, insofar as Christians no longer considered it Christian, while persons of other religions would likely describe it as Christian, at least historically.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Harper. [http://www.danielharper.org/blog/?page_id=463 "What is a 'post-Christian'?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard D. Hansen''' is a distinguished [[United States of America|American]] [[archaeologist]] and currently Adjunct Professor of Anthropology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.  He previously has been an  Affiliate Research Professor and Senior Scientist at the Institute for Mesoamerican Research in the Department of Anthropology at Idaho State University and an Associate Scientist (Level IV) at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCLA.  Hansen is a specialist on the ancient [[Maya civilization]] and also a director of the [[Mirador Basin]] Project, which investigates the mainly unexplored territory in the northern Peten, [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/archeology/peten.html Archeological Research in the Petén, Guatemala - NASA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miradorbasin.com/about/rhansen.php Mirador Basin National Monument: The Cradle of Maya Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

He has worked in the [[Mesoamerican region]] and early Maya civilization. In 1989, discoveries by Hansen and his colleagues established the idea that ancient Maya societies had centralized governments far earlier than once supposed, building several massive centers as early as 1000-600 B.C. Hansen also identified data for an extensive collapse of the Preclassic Maya about 150 A.D. The Classic Maya cultural history lasted for another 600 years, ending around 850 A.D., with the collapse of the use of ceremonial centers in what are now parts of [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[Mexico]]. In March 2017, Hansen received the prestigious Order of the Quetzal&lt;Prensa Libre, 10 Marzo 2017, p. 12,35&gt; from Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales and Minister of Culture Jose Luis Chea in a national ceremony in the National Palace of Guatemala.  He had previously received (2005) the National Order of Cultural Heritage from Guatemalan President Oscar Berger at the National Palace.  He has received numerous additional national and international awards for his work in northern Guatemala &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalheritagefund.org/apocalypto.html Global Heritage Fund&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102063514/http://www.globalheritagefund.org/apocalypto.html |date=2007-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">'''Richard Milazzo''' is a critic, curator, publisher, [[independent scholar]] and poet. In the 1970s, he was the editor and co-publisher of Out of London Press. He is the co-founding publisher and editor of [[Edgewise Press]]. In the 1980s, under the rubric of [[Tricia Collins|Collins]] &amp; Milazzo, he co-curated art exhibitions and co-wrote works on art and art theory.&lt;ref name="av"&gt;{{cite book|last=Amy Virshup|first=|title="Get Me Rewrite" - New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=27 December 2014|date=1988-01-25|publisher=New York Media|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Since 1982, he has worked internationally as a critic and curator in the art world.  In the early 1980s, he co-published and co-edited [[Effects : Magazine for New Art Theory]] in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]],&lt;ref name=Pearlman&gt;Alison Pearlman, ''Unpackaging Art of the 1980s'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1986 to 1988 he was the American co-editor of ''Kunstforum'' (Cologne).  Among the many publications of those years were ''Radical Consumption and the New Poverty'' (New York: New Observations, 1987); ''Art at the End of the Social'' (Malmö, Sweden: The Rooseum, 1988); and ''Hyperframes: A Post-Appropriation Discourse in Art'', the lectures they delivered as Senior Critics at [[Yale University]] in 1988 and 1989.   They were recently reissued in an Italian edition by Campanotto Editore in Udine, in 2005.

==Collins &amp; Milazzo==
Collins &amp; Milazzo brought to prominence a new generation of artists in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Pearlman"/&gt; It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of [[Post-conceptual art]] that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allanmccollum.net/allanmcnyc/Collins_Milazzo.html] Allan McCollum interview with Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with [[Neo-Conceptualism]] (or what the critics reductively called ''Simulationism'' and ''Neo Geo'') was first brought together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specificobject.com/objects/index.cfm?search_type=basic&amp;search=Tricia%20Collins%20%2F%20Richard%20Milazzo] Collins &amp; Milazzo at specific object&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map achaemenid empire en.png|350px|right|thumb|The map of Achaemenid Empire and the section of the Royal Road noted by [[Herodotus]]]]
The '''Royal Road''' was an ancient [[highway]] reorganized and rebuilt by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] king [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) of the first ([[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]) Persian Empire in the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Persian Royal Road System'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Darius built the [[road]] to facilitate rapid communication throughout his very large empire from [[Susa]] to [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', 1973:96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mounted couriers of the [[Angarium]] were supposed to travel 1677 miles (2699&amp;nbsp;km) from Susa to Sardis in nine days; the journey took ninety days on foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kia|first1=Mehrdad|title=The Persian Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=1610693914|page=127|url=https://books.google.ch/books?isbn=1610693914}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] wrote, "There is nothing in the world that travels faster than these Persian couriers." Herodotus's praise for these messengers&amp;mdash;"Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds"&amp;mdash; was inscribed on the [[James Farley Post Office]] in New York and is sometimes thought of as the [[United States Postal Service creed]].

==Course of the Royal Road==
The course of the road has been reconstructed from the writings of [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' v.52-54, viii.98; Herodotus seems to have been in possession of an [[Guide book|itinerary]]. W. M. Calder, "The Royal Road in Herodotus" ''The Classical Review'' '''39'''.1/2 (February - March 1925:7-11) suggested that Herodotus was partly in error in his tracing the route through [[Anatolia]] by making it cross the Halys and showed that though his overall his distances in [[parasang]]s are approximately correct, his distances over the sections he describes bear no relation to geographical facts.&lt;/ref&gt; [[archeology|archeological]] research, and other historical records. It began in [[Asia Minor]] (on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast of [[Lydia]], about 60 miles east of [[İzmir]] in present-day [[Turkey]]), traveled east through what is now the middle northern section of Turkey (crossing the [[Halys River|Halys]] according to Herodotus), and passed through the [[Cilician Gates]]  to the old [[Assyria]]n  capital [[Nineveh]] (present-day [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]]), then turned south to [[Babylon]] (near present-day [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]). From near Babylon, it is believed to have split into two routes, one traveling northeast then east through [[Ecbatana]] (in present-day [[Iran]]) and on along the [[Silk Road]], the other continuing east through the future Persian capital [[Susa]] (in present-day [[Iran]]) and then southeast to [[Persepolis]]. Of course, such long routes for travellers and tradesmen would often take months on end, and during the reign of [[Darius the Great]] numerous royal outposts ([[Caravanserai]]) were built.

==History of the Royal Road==
Because the road did not follow the shortest nor the easiest route between the important cities of the Persian Empire, archeologists believe the westernmost sections of the road may have originally been built by the [[Assyria]]n kings, as the road plunges through the heart of their old empire. More eastern segments of the road, identifiable in present-day northern Iran, were not noted by Herodotus, whose view of Persia was that of an Ionian Greek in the West;&lt;ref&gt;"Herodotus, a Greek from the Aegean coast of Asia Minor, appears to have reported only that part of the network which led directly to the parts of the Greek world that concerned him," notes Rodney S. Young, "Gordion on the Royal Road" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''107'''.4 (August 15, 1963:348-364).&lt;/ref&gt; stretches of the Royal Road across the central plateau of Iran are coincident with the major trade route known as the [[Silk Road]]. This route was used by couriers to deliver messages to the Persian capital.

However, Darius I improved the existing road network into the Royal Road as it is recognized today.  A later improvement by the Romans of a road bed with a hard-packed gravelled surface of 6.25&amp;nbsp;m width held within a stone curbing was found in a stretch near Gordium&lt;ref&gt;Near Gordium the track was identified as post-[[Phrygia]]n, as it wound round Phrygian [[tumulus|tumuli]]: Rodney S. Young, "The Campaign of 1955 at Gordion: Preliminary Report" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''60'''.3 (July 1956):249-266) p.266 "The Royal Road"; and '''61''' (1957:319 and illus.).&lt;/ref&gt; and connecting the parts together in a unified whole stretching some 1677 miles, primarily as a [[post road]], with a hundred and eleven posting stations maintained with a supply of fresh horses, a quick mode of communication using relays of swift mounted messengers, the kingdom's ''pirradazis''.

The construction of the road as improved by Darius was of such quality that the road continued to be used until [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. A bridge at [[Diyarbakır]], [[Turkey]], still stands from this period of the road's use. The road also helped Persia increase long-distance trade, which reached its peak during the time of [[Alexander the Great]] (Alexander III of Macedon).

In 1961, under a grant from the [[American Philosophical Society]], S. F. Starr traced the stretch of road from Gordium to Sardis, identifying river crossings by ancient bridge abutments.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, S. F. "The Persian Royal Road in Turkey" ''Yearbook of the American Philosophical Society'' 1962 (Philadelphia 1963) 629-632.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was maintained by personal guards. The road also was made secure by the Persians. Guard posts were stationed along the road, patrols were also made to secure the route. The Royal Road would be a monument of the Persian Empire.

== A metaphorical "Royal Road" in famous quotations ==
[[Euclid#Life|Euclid]] is said to have replied to [[Ptolemy I|King Ptolemy's]] request for an easier way of learning mathematics that "there is no Royal Road to geometry", according to [[Proclus]].&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZEHj2fEmqAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], in his ''[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]'' (1878), says, "There is no royal road to logic, and really valuable ideas can only be had at the price of close attention." This essay was claimed by [[William James]] as instrumental in the foundation of the philosophical school of [[pragmatism]].

[[Sigmund Freud]] famously described dreams as the "royal road to the unconscious (not conscious)" (''"Via regia zur Kenntnis des Unbewußten"'').

[[Karl Marx]] wrote in the [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p2.htm 1872 Preface to the French Edition] of [[Das Kapital]] (Volume 1), "There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits."

''The Royal Road to Romance'' (1925) is the first book by [[Richard Halliburton]], covering his world travels as a young man from [[Andorra]] to [[Angkor]].

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Russian postmodernism''' refers to the [[culture|cultural]], [[art|artistic]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] condition in [[Russia]] since the downfall of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[dialectical materialism]].  With respect to statements about post-Soviet philosophy or [[sociology]], the term is primarily used by non-Russians to describe the state of [[economic]] and [[political]] uncertainty they observe since the fall of [[communism]] and the way this uncertainty affects Russian identity.  'Postmodernism' is, however, a term often used by Russian [[literary criticism|critics]] to describe contemporary Russian art and [[Russian literature|literature]].

==Artistic origins==
In art, [[postmodernism]] entered the Soviet Union in the 1960s after the end of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] move toward liberalization with the advent of the [[Russian Conceptualism|Russian conceptualist]] movement.  Beginning as an underground political-artistic move against the use of [[Socialist realism]] as a method of social control and becoming a full-fledged movement with the [[Moscow Conceptualists]], Russian conceptualism used the [[symbol]]ism of Socialist realism against the Soviet government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3497">[[The Rev.]] '''Samuel Johnson''' (24 June 1846 &amp;ndash; 29 April 1901) was an [[Anglican]] priest and historian of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]].

==Biography==
Born a [[Sierra Leone Liberated Africans|recaptive]] '[[Sierra Leone Creole people|Creole]]' in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], Johnson was an [[Oba (ruler)#Oloye|Omoba]] of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] clan as a descendant of the [[Alaafin]] [[Abiodun (Oyo ruler)|Abiodun of Oyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=3WqKbRSk7S8C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=|title=The Human Tradition in Modern Africa (Volume 49 of Human tradition around the world)|author=Dennis D. Cordell|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2012|isbn=978-0-742-5373-23|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his education at the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS) Training Institute and subsequently taught during what became known as the Yoruba civil war.

Johnson and [[Charles Phillips (bishop)|Charles Phillips]], also of the CMS, arranged a ceasefire in 1886 and then a treaty that guaranteed the independence of the [[Ekiti State|Ekiti]] towns. [[Ilorin]] refused to cease fighting however, and the war dragged on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref={{harvid|Dupuy}}

 |title=The Yoruba War 1877-1893
 |work=Armed Conflict Events Database
 |author=The Dupuy Institute
 |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1880, he became a [[deacon]] and in 1888 a [[priest]]. He was based in Oyo from 1881 onward and completed a work on Yoruba history in 1897. This event is said to have been caused by him fearing that his people were losing their history, and that they were beginning to know [[History of Europe|European history]] better. Ironically, this work was ''misplaced'' by his British publishers.

After his death, his brother Dr. [[Obadiah Johnson]] re-compiled and rewrote the book, using the reverend's copious notes as a guide. In 1921, he released it as ''A History of the Yorubas from the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the British Protectorate''. The book has since been likened to ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]].

{{nihongo|'''Shakushain's revolt'''|シャクシャインの戦い|Shakushain no tatakai}} was an [[Ainu people|Ainu]] rebellion against Japanese authority on [[Hokkaidō]] between 1669 and 1672. It was led by Ainu chieftain Shakushain against the [[Matsumae clan]], who represented Japanese trading and governmental interests in the area of Hokkaidō then controlled by the Japanese (''[[Yamato people]]'').

The war began as a fight for resources between Shakushain's people and a rival Ainu clan in the Shibuchari River ([[Shizunai River]]) basin of what is now [[Shinhidaka, Hokkaidō]]. The war developed into a last try by the Ainu to keep their political independence and regain control over the terms of their trade relations with the Yamato people.

According to scholar Brett Walker:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Shakushain's War stands out as a watershed event in the history of the conquest of [[Ezo]]. Shakushain exploded onto the scene as a charismatic leader who proved able to bridge regional differences among Ainu communities, threatening to unite them against the Japanese intrusion from the south. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] reacted by solidifying its own united front of military allies in the northeast, replacing local Matsumae generals with men of its own choosing, thus illustrating its self-appointed role as defender of the realm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of 1669, Shakushain's forces surrendered to the Matsumae. The two sides exchanged gifts and negotiated a peace settlement; however, while Ainu generals celebrated with "liberal helpings of saké",{{attribution needed|date=May 2017}}{{cn|date=May 2017}} they were assassinated by Matsumae warriors. Shakushain was among those killed that day.

The only other comparable large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the [[Menashi-Kunashir Battle]] of 1789. An earlier rebellion along the same lines was [[Koshamain's Revolt]] in 1456.

'''Terribilità''', the spelling in modern Italian, or '''terribiltà''', as [[Michelangelo]]'s 16th century contemporaries tended to spell it, is a quality of provoking  terror (the literal meaning), awe, or a sense of the sublime, in the viewer, that is ascribed to his art.  It is perhaps especially applied to his [[sculpture]]s, such as his figures of [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] or in [[Moses (Michelangelo)|''Moses'']].

[[Pope Julius II]] was apparently the first to describe Michelangelo as a ''uomo terribile'' ("terror-inducing man"), apparently describing his difficult character as much as his art. This ''terribilità'', also references the [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonics]] of humanists such as [[Marsilio Ficino]], who had known Michelangelo in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Lleó Cañal, Vicente, Revista de Libros:Tintoretto 2, 2 Abril 2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's friend and collaborator [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] reported in a letter to him of 15 October 1520 on a private audience with [[Pope Leo X]].  After praising Michelangelo's work, the pope continued "But he is ''terribile'', as you see; one cannot deal with him".  Sebastiano responded "that your ''terribile'' character did not harm anyone, and that you appear ''terribile'' for love of the great works you carry out."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition handlist for "Michelangelo &amp; Sebastiano", 2017, National Gallery. Catalogue # 33, from [[Casa Buonarroti]], Florence.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[ancient history|ancient world]], '''Thynia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ɪ|n|i|ə}}, {{lang-el|Θυνία}}) was a region of Europe along the northern coast of the [[Propontis]], opposite [[Bithynia]] on the [[Asia Minor|Asian]] side.&lt;ref&gt;W.H.Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', Loeb Classical Library (2008), introductory maps&lt;/ref&gt; It was occupied by the [[Thyni]], a [[Thracians|Thracian]] people who came from [[Thrace]].  Note that in the Middle Ages, [[Mesothynia]] ("middle Thynia") was the peninsula of modern [[Kocaeli Peninsula|Kocaeli]].

According to Greek mythology, its name came from Thyneas (Θυνέας) son of Phineas (Φινέας).

In the [[Argonautica]] (Book 2), [[Jason]] and the Argonauts are turned aside from the Clashing Rocks at Bithynia, and go to the opposite coast to consult King Phineus.

Housing prices peaked in early 2005, began declining in 2006 (see also [[United States housing market correction]]).

==1930s==
*'''1933-1939''' The [[New Deal]] is a group of new laws created to fix problems in the [[Great Depression]] economy, including methods to increase home ownership for white Americans .
*'''1934''' The [[National Housing Act of 1934]], part of the New Deal, makes more affordable housing and home mortgages. It creates the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) (later [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], HUD) and the [[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation]].
*'''1938''' [[Fannie Mae]] is founded by the government under the New Deal. It is a stockholder-owned corporation that purchases and securitizes mortgages in order to ensure that funds are consistently available to the institutions that lend money to home buyers.

==1968–1991==
*'''1968''': As part of the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968]], the Government mortgage-related agency, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) is converted from a federal government entity to a stand-alone [[government sponsored enterprise]] (GSE) which purchases and securitizes mortgages to facilitate liquidity in the primary mortgage market. The move takes the debt of Fannie Mae off of the books of the government.
*'''1970''' Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ([[Freddie Mac]]) is chartered by an act of Congress, as a GSE, to buy mortgages on the secondary market, pool them, and sell them as mortgage-backed securities to investors on the open market. The average cost of a new home in 1970 is $26,600 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1970sflashback.com/1970/Economy.asp |title=1970s Flashback-Economy / Prices |publisher=1970sflashback.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ($167,817 in 2017 dollars). From 1960 to 1970, inflation rose from 1.4% to 6.5% (a 5.1% increase), while the [[consumer price index]] (CPI) rose from about 85 points in 1960 to about 120 points in 1970, but the median price of a house nearly doubled from $16,500 in 1960 to $26,600 in 1970. In 1970, the median price of a home was $22,100 to $25,700. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/const/uspricemon.pdf |title= Median and Average Sales Prices of New Homes Sold in United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1974''': [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] imposes heavy sanctions for financial institutions found guilty of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age.
*'''1975''': In January 1975, the Median Home Price was $37,200, while the Average Home Price was $39,500. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/const/uspricemon.pdf |title= Median and Average Sales Prices of New Homes Sold in United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ulrich Beck''' (15 May 1944 – 1 January 2015) was a well known [[Germany|German]] [[sociologist]], and one of the most cited social scientists in the world during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;PDF at www.manuelcastells.info&lt;/ref&gt;  His work focused on questions of uncontrollability, [[Sociology of scientific ignorance|ignorance]] and [[uncertainty]] in the [[modernity|modern age]], and he coined the terms "[[risk society]]" and "[[second modernity]]" or "[[reflexive modernization]]". He also tried to overturn national perspectives that predominated in sociological investigations with a [[cosmopolitanism]] that acknowledges the interconnectedness of the [[modern history|modern world]]. He was a professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] and also held appointments at the ''Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme'' (FMSH) in Paris, and at the [[London School of Economics]].

==Life==
[[File:UlrichBeck.jpg|thumb|Ulrich Beck in his flat in Munich, 1999]]
Beck was born in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomeranian]] town of [[Stolp]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] (now Słupsk in [[Poland]]), in 1944, and grew up in [[Hanover]]. He began university studies with a focus on law at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and from 1966 onwards studied [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[political science]] at the University of Munich. Starting in 1972, after earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]], he was employed at Munich as a sociologist. In 1979 he qualified as a university lecturer with a [[habilitation]] thesis. He received appointments as professor at the universities of [[University of Münster|Münster]] (1979–1981) and [[Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg|Bamberg]] (1981–1992). From 1992 until his death, Beck was professor of sociology and director of the Institute for Sociology at the University of Munich. He received numerous international awards and honors, including election to the Council and Executive Board of the German Society for Sociology.

From 1995 to 1997 he was a member of the ''Kommission für Zukunftsfragen der Freistaaten Bayern und Sachsen'' ([[Bavaria]]n and [[Saxony|Saxon]] State Commission for Questions Concerning the Future). Beginning in 1999, he was the speaker of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] research programme on [[Reflexive modernization|reflexive modernity]].

From 1999 to 2009 Beck was a spokesman of the Collaborative Reflexive Modernization Research Centre 536, an interdisciplinary consortium of four universities in the Munich area funded and overseen by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation (DFG)]].&lt;ref&gt;Collaborative Reflexive Modetnization Research Centre 536&lt;/ref&gt; Beck's theory of interdisciplinary reflexive modernization on a basis of a wide range of topics in appropriate research was empirically tested. The theory of reflexive modernization works from the basic idea that the rise of the modern industrial age produces side-effects across the globe that provide the institutional basis and coordinates that modern nation-states question, modify, and open for political action.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck and Wolfgang Bonß (ed.): ''The modernization of modernity''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main 2001; Ulrich Beck and Christoph Lau (ed.): ''Delimitation and Decision''. Frankfurt 2004 special issue of the journal Social World: theory and empirical reflexive modernization, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active as sociologist and public intellectual in Germany and throughout the world, regularly intervening in debates on the European Union, climate change and nuclear energy. At the time of his death, he and his international research group were only 1.5 years into the 5-year research project "Methodological Cosmopolitanism – in the Laboratory of Climate Change" (the Cosmo-Climate Research Project), of which Beck was the [[Principal investigator]]. For this research project he received the prestigious ERC Advanced Grant, scheduled to terminate in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://erc.europa.eu/methodological-cosmopolitanism-laboratory-climate-change&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Beck, sociologists David Tyfield and [[Anders Blok]] lead work packages within the overall project.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://www.soc.ku.dk/english/about/news/project_greening/&lt;/ref&gt; The project also fostered international research collaboration with various research 'hubs' in East Asia through the [[Europe-Asia Research Network (EARN)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cosmostudies.com/east-asian-research-network/&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with EARN, Beck and sociologist Sang-Jin Han had been set to lead a 2-year project for the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] beginning in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://isa-global-dialogue.net/in-memory-of-professor-ulrich-beck-january-8-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck was a member of the Board of Trustees at the [[Ohel Jakob synagogue (Munich)|Jewish Center in Munich]] and a member of the German branch of [[PEN International]].

He was married to the German [[social scientist]] [[Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim]]. He died of a cardiac infarction on 1 January 2015, at the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/06/ulrich-beck Ulrich Beck obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research contributions==
For 25 years, Beck delivered new diagnoses to the following question: How can social and political thought and action in the face of radical global change (environmental destruction, financial crisis, global warming, the crisis of democracy and the nation-state institutions) be intertwined in a new modernity?&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck: ''World Risk Society''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A radicalized modernity, for Beck, attacks its own foundations. Institutions such as the nation-state and the family are globalized 'from the inside'.

Beck studied [[modernization]], ecological problems, [[individual]]ization and [[globalization]]. Later in his career, he embarked on exploring the changing conditions of work in a world of increasing global [[capitalism]], declining influence of unions and flexibilisation of the labour process, a then new theory rooted in the concept of [[cosmopolitanism]]. Beck also contributed a number of new words to German and anglophone sociology, including "[[risk society]]", "[[second modernity]]", [[reflexive modernization]] and [[Brazilianization]] ([[Brasilianisierung]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} According to Beck, all contemporary political thinking emanates from the methodological nationalism of political thought and sociology (and other social sciences).&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck and Edgar Grande: Beyond methodological nationalism: Non-European and European variations of the second modernity, in: Social World 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Risk society}} Risk society was coined by Ulrich Beck and [[Anthony Giddens]] during the 1980s. According to Beck and Giddens, the traditional industrial class structure of modern society is breaking apart. Globalization creates risks that concern people from all different classes; for example, radioactivity, pollution, and even unemployment. Affluent households act to insulate themselves from these risks, but cannot do so for some; for example global environmental change. The poor suffer them. He points out that risks are also socially constructed and some risks are perceived as more dangerous because they are discussed in mass media more frequently, such as terrorism. Risk society leads to analysis of risks, causing prejudgment.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Joachim Möller, Achim Schmillen: ''Hohe Konzentration auf wenige – steigendes Risiko für alle'' (IAB-Kurzbericht 24/2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck was the editor of the sociological journal, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Soziale Welt|de|vertical-align=sup}}'' (in German, since 1980), author of some 150 articles, and author or editor of many books.

==The Spinelli Group==

On 15 September 2010 Beck supported the [[European Parliament]]'s [[Spinelli Group]] initiative to reinvigorate [[federalism]] in the [[European Union]]. The [[Union of European Federalists]] and its youth organisation [[Young European Federalists]] have been promoting the idea of European federalism for over 60 years, with a "belief that only a European Federation, based on the idea of unity in diversity, could overcome the division of the European continent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federalists.eu/uef/history/|title=Union of European Federalists (UEF): History|website=www.federalists.eu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent supporters of the initiative include [[Jacques Delors]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]], [[Andrew Duff]] and [[Elmar Brok]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''Virtual war''' signifies the increased use of and dependence on [[technology]] in the course of [[war]]fare. It includes the time/space separation between an attacker and the intended target which results in the "sanitization" of war. The concept has gained notoriety amongst policy makers and academics who study the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]]. [[James Der Derian]], in his book ''Virtuous War: Mapping the Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment Network'' elaborates extensively on the concept of Virtual War and the consequences of increased technological integration within modern militaries.

[[File:2005-09 Kętrzyn pomnik Kętrzynskiego.jpg|thumb|Kętrzyński-Monument in [[Kętrzyn]].]]

'''Wojciech Kętrzyński''' (born '''Adalbert von Winkler'''; 11 July 1838 &amp;ndash; 15 January 1918),  was a [[historian]] and the director of the [[Ossolineum]] Library in [[Lviv|Lemberg]] (Lwów), the capitol of Galicia, [[Austrian Empire]]. He focused on [[Poland|Polish]] history at a time [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|when Poland was partitioned between foreign powers]]. He was the father of [[Stanisław Kętrzyński]].

==Biography==

The Kętrzyński-family is of [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] origin and settled in [[Pomerania]] since the sixteenth century. In 1821 his father had changed his surname to "von Winkler", a direct translation of "Kętrzyński", while he served in the [[Prussian Army]]. After he left the military his father became a Prussian policeman (gendarm) at Lötzen where he married a local German wife and died in 1846.&lt;ref name=Cultures&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=067zQP-4dlUC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=albert+winkler&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3
|title=The Polish conversion of Albert Winkler |accessdate=2009-07-29 |work=National cultures at the grass-root level |publisher= Antonina Kłoskowska |year=2001 |date= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kętrzyński was born in [[Giżycko|Lötzen]] (Lec, modern Giżycko) as ''Adalbert von Winkler'', [[Province of Prussia]], within the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and grew up under the care of a German family after his father's death. He was sent to a military school for soldier orphans at [[Potsdam]] in 1849 but returned to [[Masuria]] and passed his [[Abitur]] at [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]] (Rastembork, modern Kętrzyn). In 1856 his sister had discovered the family's ancestry and informed him about it, which caused his decision to identify himself as a Pole, even though he did not read or write Polish and knew only a few words and expressions.&lt;ref name=Cultures /&gt; As Kętrzyński later wrote, at the time of his national conversion he "was a German and felt himself to be German" and this "decision had been sudden and had raised no doubts".&lt;ref name=Cultures /&gt; In 1859 he enrolled at the [[University of Königsberg]], still as "von Winkler", but used the name "von Kętrzyński" for his matriculation in 1861. Here he also spoke for the first time Polish to students.&lt;ref name=Cultures /&gt;

In 1863 he was imprisoned for his support of the Polish [[January Uprising]] in the [[Russian partition]] and spent his jail time in [[Olsztyn]] (Allenstein), [[Berlin]], and [[Kłodzko]] (Glatz). Throughout his imprisonment he translated his dissertation from German into Latin and [[Wincenty Pol]]'s "Song of our Land" into German.&lt;ref name=Cultures /&gt;

After being released from prison, Kętrzyński completed his doctorate at the University of [[Königsberg]] (Krolewiec) and moved to the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] within [[Austria-Hungary]] to pursue his interests. He became the head (1873) and the director (1876) of the [[Ossolineum]] Library in [[Lviv]], then capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Kingdom of Galicia]]. Kętrzyński died there during [[World War I]].

==Legacy==

In recognition of his deeds after [[World War II]], the town Rastenburg ({{lang-pl|Rastembork}}) in Masuria was renamed ''[[Kętrzyn]]'' after Kętrzyński in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miastoketrzyn.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=179:15-stycznia-2014-roku-96-rocznica-smierci-wojciech-ketrzynskiego&amp;catid=101:urzad-miasta&amp;Itemid=468 www.miastoketrzyn.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; In Olsztyn a scientific institute was established named after him in 1963, called [[Ośrodka Badań Naukowych im. Wojciecha Kętrzyńskiego]]. Its primary mission is to document and research the history of [[Polish people]] (i.e. Slavic Masurians) and their culture in [[Warmia]] and Masuria, concentrating on their efforts to oppose [[Germanization]]. Another important subject of its research is the structure and administration of [[Royal Prussia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1483">'''Xenagoras''' ({{lang-grc|Ξεναγόρας}}) was a [[Greek historiography|Greek historian]] quoted by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], i. 72&lt;/ref&gt; from whom we learn that Xenagoras wrote that [[Odysseus]] and Circe had three sons, [[Rhomos]], [[Anteias]], and [[Ardeas]], who founded the three cities which were called by their names. He wrote a work titled ''Chronicle'' (Χρόνοι),&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] iv. 262, 264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harpocration]] ''s.v.'' Κραυαλλίδαι&lt;/ref&gt; and another on islands (Περὶ νήσων).&lt;ref&gt;Etymol. ''s.v.''

This Xenagoras was possibly the same Xenagoras as father of the historian [[Nymphis]].
